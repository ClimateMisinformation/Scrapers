"It’s easy to switch off during the weekly grocery shop. Everything we need is conveniently at our fingertips, so why bother thinking about where it comes from? If we pick up a banana in the supermarket and see a brown spot, we can exchange it for another. If avocados are $5 this week, there’s always a cheaper alternative in the next aisle. We avoid misshapen carrots and hunt around for the crunchiest, shiniest and cheapest red apples available. Time to stop the trolleys. The rapidly changing climate is shaking up what makes it to the supermarket shelves and Australian farmers are getting hurt in the process. Droughts, floods, heatwaves, changing rainfall patterns and declining yields are hammering them from all sides, and in a myriad of ways.  Extreme weather events make Australia’s food security increasingly vulnerable and extreme, unpredictable weather is climate change’s specialty. Last summer, for instance, more than 205 records were broken around the country as heatwaves and record hot days scorched many regions – particular in Queensland and New South Wales. As temperatures rise, this alters growing seasons and makes stock management more difficult. It’s not just hotter conditions farmers are worried about, either. Severe flooding is also expected to increase in frequency and, while up in the north there may be fewer cyclones, climate scientists say they will be more ferocious. Food bowl areas all across Australia, including the Murray Darling basin, are at risk from declining rainfall and heat stress. If farmers cop it, then so do consumers. If we lose agricultural production from these areas, then we will all be giving up an ability to put fresh Australian fruit and vegetables on the table, with ease, every day.  Australia as a whole will suffer because agriculture is a vital cog in our economy and is the most exposed of our industries to climate change. According to the National Farmers’ Federation, the agricultural sector at farm-gate contributes 2.4% to our total gross domestic product (GDP) – or $58.5bn. The majority of the 150,000 farm businesses in Australia are small, family owned businesses, with 96% having a turnover of $2m or less. So when extreme weather events, including the slow-moving ones like drought, do arrive they hurt farmers hard and fast. Next in line? Shoppers. Consider the sky-high price of bananas following Cyclone Yasi in Queensland as a recent example. Continual, major losses from within this sector are not something that consumers, the economy or government can take lightly.  For those that enjoy a glass of Australian wine with dinner, consider this: according to a recent report by the Climate Council, 70% of Australia’s best grape growing regions are predicted to be in jeopardy by 2050 because grapes will ripen too early. The Shiraz of tomorrow will suffer from our lack of action today.  By failing to swiftly and meaningfully act on climate change, we are dumping a lifetime of extreme weather events and food insecurity onto future generations. The good news is that all shoppers can play a significant role in mitigating the worst impacts of climate change on the food and drink everyone enjoys. First, demand immediate and meaningful action on climate change from the federal government. The electricity system is by far the biggest polluter. Australia urgently needs smart policies to fix the energy sector and significantly cut carbon pollution. A rapid transition to renewable energy is a must.  Second, now is the time to rediscover paddock-to-plate connections and recognise that food doesn’t start its life on the supermarket shelves. Learning more about the origins of your favourite groceries and buying local can not only reduce food miles and emissions but also support farm businesses all over Australia.  When a dollar is spent on locally produced food, that dollar keeps circulating in the community; paying for Landcare membership, shopping at the local stock feeds or supporting essential services, like kindergartens. By contrast, a dollar spent on cheap imports flies straight out of the country. Finally consumers can throw their support behind farmers fighting against climate change and come up with a solution. Farmers are custodians of about half of Australia’s landmass. Right across the country, farmers are exploring ways to use renewable energy, regenerate soils and sequester carbon.  The old slogan said “every family needs a farmer”. With climate change upon us, farmers need all families to stand up for Australian agriculture. Doing so will give future generations of farmers as well as consumers the quintessential Aussie fair go. "
"The first 100 days of President Donald Trump: how has my life changed? First of all, there was the mourning period. Not for me, but for my fellow citizens. I was just mad. And I wasn’t even maddest at the Trump voters. I understood that the critical battle lines now are not left versus right, but the 1% neoliberal globalisers making off with all of the loot and disembowelling the middle class. So when I saw the campaign, I knew that in the US, just as in the UK, a candidate who said anything at all about people forgotten in the neoliberal race would have a solid chance.  No – I was mad at my own leftwing tribe. All of January, people on the left would confront me with dazed, grief-stricken expressions, as if they had just emerged from a multi-car pileup on a foggy highway. “How could this have happened? What will we do?” I couldn’t even bear to participate in those conversations. Finally I started explaining my rage to my closest friends. I had been screaming about the possibility of this very moment for eight years, since I published a piece in the Guardian titled “Fascist America in 10 Easy Steps” and wrote a book based on it, called The End of America (2007). Under George Bush Jr, the left had been very receptive to the book’s message about how democracies are undermined by the classic tactics of would-be authoritarians. But once Obama was elected – “one of ours” – I had to spend the next eight years yelling like a haunted Cassandra, to a room the left had abandoned. I had yelled myself hoarse for eight years under Obama about what it would mean for us to sit still while Obama sent drones in to take out US citizens in extrajudicial killings; what it would mean for us to sit still while he passed the 2012 National Defence Authorisation Act that let any president hold citizens for ever without charge or trial; what it would mean for us to sit still while he allowed NSA surveillance, allowed Guantánamo to stay open, and allowed hyped terrorism stories to hijack the constitution and turn the US into what finally even Robert F Kennedy Jr was calling a national security surveillance state. For eight years, under Obama, my audiences were libertarian cowboys and red-state truckers; members of the military and police forces, who were appalled by what they were witnessing; and even conservatives, worried about our legacy of freedom. My usual audience, the shoppers at Whole Foods and drivers of hybrid cars, the educated left, my people, sat smugly at home while the very pillars of American democracy were being systematically chipped away. They were watching Downton Abbey and tending their heirloom tomato patches on weekends in the Hudson Valley, because everything was OK; yeah, he may OK drone strikes, but they can’t be that bad, since he was one of “ours” – a handsome, eloquent African American, a former community organiser – in the Oval Office. Seduced by the image of a charming black man on Air Force One who talked about “change” – a white woman in a pantsuit (though highly paid by Goldman Sachs) talking about “that highest, hardest glass ceiling” – the left slumbered while US democracy was undone brick by brick by brick. So my feeling, the first inaugural month of 2017, as the left sat shiva, was: now you are worried? Now you want action? Now that the separation of powers is a joke and the constitution has collapsed around your ears, you point a finger at Trump and say, “Sudden Catastrophe?” He didn’t do this. You did this. Your own inaction and willingness to be seduced by two-bit identity politics labels, without actually doing the hard work of being patriots and defending the actual constitution – brought us exactly, exactly here. I had sought for eight years to explain to my own people, to no avail, this: it is not that important who sits in the White House if the structures of democracy are strong. If the structures of democracy are strong – you can have a madman or madwoman for four years or even eight, and then he or she is gone, and the nation’s freedoms live. But if you take an eight-year nap snoozing through a systematic dismantling of the structures of democracy – freedoms of speech; independence of the press; separation of powers; fourth amendment rights to privacy; and allow the suspension of due process under the guise of “fighting the war on terror” – hell yeah, some day you will wake up and there will be a crazy man or a strongman in the White House and then nothing you do or say will make a difference any more. So yeah, Month One: I had nightly glasses of red wine to dull my rage at my own feeble delusional kind, and avoided the collective liberal “mourning conversation”. Month Two: February was the month of OMG! Or else, WTF! I was part of it too, as Pres Trump’s new-to-us-all methods of exploding Twitter bombs, engaging in scary political theatre, committing daily acts of apparent, um, economic treason, and doing it all at a bewilderingly fast pace, demanded a learning curve from us all. It was a sense of chaos, destabilisation. OMG! He issued a travel ban. OMG! People are held en masse at Newark – New York City taxi drivers are boycotting the airport because of the ban! OMG, Uber is profiting on picking up those rides! OMG, now we have to boycott Uber! WTF! He is rounding up immigrants! OMG – he is separating families at the border! WTF – did Kellyanne Conway just promote Ivanka Trump’s clothing line? Isn’t that illegal? WTF! Are Chinese influence-mongers really lining up at Mar-a-Lago to ingratiate themselves with the president’s son-in-law? WTF – stripping the EPA of any budget to keep the air and water clean? OMG – did he just say he doesn’t believe in global warming? There was a stream of statelier edits from Congress, as the nation’s “WTF?” reaction evolved into: can he really do that? Ben Cardin, the Democratic senator for Maryland, proposed a Senate resolution that Pres Trump obey the emoluments clause of the constitution, which forbids bribery (Trump had refused to put his holdings in a blind trust). States began to pass laws, such as those protection sanctuary cities, to fight back against measures that Trump was taking federally. My day-to-day life was spent at our tech company, DailyClout, training a group of young people to write about legislation, Congress and statehouses, and putting out news stories, blogs and opinion pieces following these developments. DailyClout is incubated in a cool space in Manhattan called Civic Hall, which is funded by Microsoft, Google and Omidyar Networks, where we are surrounded by others – mostly idealistic millennials – who are also building exciting new tools for new kinds of civic engagement. Month Three: in March, we all began to see a massive grassroots “resistance”. I personally don’t like that term, because you use that term to fight a completed fascist takeover; it gives democracy’s opponents too much power; right now we have a battered democracy on life support that needs defending from those who wish to pull the plug. March was the month that dozens of new entities devoted to mobilising citizen action emerged from the collective shock. There were so many forms of new organising and funding: online candidate training seminars to Knight Foundation grants for new tools to get public and municipal records to people. Existing “civic tech” sites such as PopVox and Countable were joined in March by a slew of new tools and sites put together by this powerful wave of activism. Our collective missions got boosted with jet fuel by the huge burst in ordinary citizens wanting and needing to take action. New platforms ranged from 5 Calls – which came out of the experience of volunteers in the Clinton campaign and which sends you political action steps to take in five phone calls – to DailyAction, a similar service, which emerged out of Creative Majority, a Pac that supports Democratic candidates, and USAFacts, set up by Steve Ballmer, formerly of Microsoft, which compiles and crunches federal, state and local data from government sources. My own life mission didn’t reorient, since I had cofounded DailyClout’s platform in 2010. But use of our civic engagement tools skyrocketed. Our first product, called BillCam, lets you search a database of live state and federal bills, then pop a live bill into your blog or news articles; it lets you interact with the bills in real time and share them socially. We also created RSS feeds to stream live state and federal legislation right into the websites of local, regional and national news sites, and the websites of elected officials. In March we boosted our blog stream and videos covering new state and federal legislation, and started to report on what people could do locally to push forward their issues. Our sites on social media grew by triple and quadruple digits. I presented these tools in March to news outlets and candidates and campaigns around the country – from Maine to Ohio to Oregon. I felt as if I was rediscovering my own nation, as the people in it were rediscovering belatedly how precious and fragile democracy was, and how much it depends on an informed citizenship. We were invited to demo it in a senate office; we visited Congress too, for our first exclusive interview, with Representative French Hill of Arkansas; I had never before been inside the Senate office building, or the Congress’s Longworth House Office Building. It was uplifting and moving to me. I also saw that elected officials worried about democracy, and wanting to empower real citizens, existed on both sides of the aisle. We got our widget embedding live bills into news outlets totalling 160 million readers. In Q1 of 2017, 113,000 people searched BillCam to look at bills that would affect them – that they could now affect in turn. There are still shocking days – missiles to Syria, gunboats to North Korea – but we stay focused. An amazing thing happened in March. The distinguished technologist George Polisner –who quit his senior-level role at Oracle in a public letter, covered widely in the US press, in which he demurred from Oracle’s CEO’s intention of “working with President Trump” – had started “ Civ.Works, a social platform, privacy protected so citizens can organise without fear of a corporate-buyout Big Brother. Polisner and DailyClout joined forces in March. We’re working to combine Civ.Works’ power of organising with the power of DailyClout’s streaming digital updates via RSS feeds, blogs and video, about local and federal legislation. No wonder I feel excited about the future. Am I happy about the present? I feel incredibly energised, hopeful and certain that if enough citizens, in our democracy and worldwide, wake up (as they are) and are able to get hold of real tools to use democracy – and those best-case tools are now digital and link to social and digital media – we can indeed be in the midst of what another president called “a new birth of freedom”. Where I live, every day, on the frontlines of this digital revolution, there is every reason to feel in spired. That doesn’t mean I am “happy” about where the nation is – I am extremely scared, just as I am scared about the future of Europe in a parallel assault on its democracies. But the biggest threat in the US or the UK isn’t one political party or candidate. It is people’s ignorance about their own democracies and their till-now lack of real-life tools to protect them. DailyClout UK and DailyClout EU are next on our list of planned launches: the UK legislative database is totally unsearchable, and the UK Parliament’s own website ends in dead links when you try to find actual legislation. The EU website tells you with difficulty what bills have passed but doesn’t show you what is coming up, when you might possibly take action – it offers a feed of pointless press releases instead. This lack of legislative transparency and usability had a lot to do, I believe, with the Brexit vote. Months Four, Five and Six will see more and more of these tools – from dozens of T-shirt-clad bespectacled tech revolutionaries, coming online. Geeks are the new patriots, and code is the new “shot heard round the world”. Naomi Wolf recently finished a PhD at the University of Oxford and is CEO of DailyClout.io As soon as we sang the first chorus of the hymn, the tears started. “Here I go again,” I thought, “crying in church.” This was three weeks ago. And the week before, and the week before that, all the way back to last November’s election. Sudden emotional outbursts are how I’m able to understand what Donald Trump’s presidency means to me. I wasn’t disconnected to these emotions before, but it’s the unexpected and potent nature that has changed. I’m in no immediate danger from the Trump presidency. I’m not fearing deportation, the loss of my healthcare, a racially motivated arrest. I haven’t been personally attacked online or in the real world. So when I get scared and start crying, I wonder what it would feel like to be in that more vulnerable position, and I’m more distressed by the damage being done. My lens on Trump stems from work in the climate movement. My vantage point is as executive director of 350.org, a global effort to build a social movement that can confront the power of the fossil-fuel industry and accelerate our transition to 100% renewable energy. Trump stands in direct opposition to those goals. As president, he has wholeheartedly taken the side of the oil, coal, and gas industry and is already seeing to it that their agenda is enacted. Previous US presidents and candidates also did business with this industry, but at the same time they decried the threat of climate destabilisation, worked actively to secure international diplomatic alliances leading to an agreement, and achieved some progress from the executive branch. Before Trump’s election, the climate movement had made some serious progress. Thanks to the good work of movements around the world, the social licence of this industry is on the decline. Investors are pulling their dollars, banks are cancelling loans, and public support for fossil-fuel companies is low. Ditto for the politicians who back them up. Take congressman Lamar Smith of Texas: 45% of his constituents, not unacquainted with his ties to the oil industry, were less inclined to vote for Smith when as chair of the house science committee he failed to investigate ExxonMobil’s alleged climate cover-up. (350.org is under subpoena from Smith’s office for our efforts to get the truth out about Exxon.) From the political arena to our energy markets, it felt like the tide was finally beginning to turn in our direction. But then along came Donald Trump to declare climate change a hoax (the only head of state in the world to do so), promising to revive the coal industry (declining in the US, thanks to terrific organising), and appointing known climate-change deniers to head the very offices responsible for regulating the problem. When Trump won, a new kind of despair settled over climate activists. We’re pretty accustomed to despair already – climate grief circles have started up in Australia, home to devastating heatwaves, fires, drought, and a basically decimated Great Barrier Reef – but this felt like something new. One week after the election, I was at a gathering with movement leaders across the faith, labour, LGBTQ and reproductive justice movements. We were each asked to write down one hard truth about the election that we hadn’t yet said out loud. One person wrote: “The small window of time we had to dramatically reduce emissions may have just closed.” At the very time when we need to be taking great leaps forward, Trump and his allies are dragging us backwards with an ideology that puts corporate power above all else – and you’d be hard pressed to find a set of corporations more desperate to hold on to power than the likes of Exxon, Chevron and numerous coal and gas companies with less brand recognition. At least now there’s no mystery about what we’re up against: the full political might of the fossil-fuel industry. Two examples register highly on that score. The first is the appointment of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. The second is the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. The Tillerson appointment stands out because even the most cynical and pessimistic among us didn’t predict that a person at the pinnacle of “big oil” would be in charge of diplomacy in the Trump regime. As my colleague Bill McKibben has said, you might as well ask Ronald McDonald to head up the Department of Agriculture. And Exxon isn’t just any oil company: it has hidden what it knew about climate change, as early as the late 1970s, in order to continue making money on a product it knew was wrecking the planet. It funded climate-denying thinktanks and retained the same firms that helped tobacco companies claim that nicotine isn’t addictive. It should be bad enough to have the entire cabinet made up of the 1%, but the state post provides Tillerson and Exxon with far too much temptation to officially use the US foreign policy apparatus to keep extracting more oil. The night I saw that Trump suggested Tillerson for the post, I burst into tears and crawled into bed. It was a feeling close to panic, in recognition of what might happen and how powerless I felt. Thank goodness I’m part of a big team, some of whom love battle and were quick to start writing and producing statements denouncing his appointment. Reports came out last week that of all the cabinet members, Tillerson is doing the best job keeping a close relationship to the president. Because this man is used to operating in secrecy, we’ll have to stay vigilant to understand the moves he’ll be making. Then there is the remarkable story about the Dakota Access pipeline and the historic resistance at Standing Rock. At no other time has there been this much widespread opposition to a pipeline, for the many reasons pipelines merit our opposition. This represented an alliance of tribes whose rights, livelihoods and lives have been systematically desecrated by the US government and corporations. The camp at Standing Rock itself was a symbol of everything Trumpism cannot be: spiritually grounded, connected to history and land, fundamentally respectful of the rights of nature and peoples, infused with art and music and heart. It moved people to act in solidarity all over the world. Many moved money out of the banks invested in the project. And the resistance worked. The forces at Standing Rock peacefully made sure that the Obama administration put a stop to the construction and allowed further review of the pipeline’s viability. So it was with cruelty – the same cruelty seen in the enactment of the Muslim travel ban and the gamble with the healthcare of 24 million people – that Trump signed an executive order to begin construction immediately. At the end of March, oil began to flow through the pipeline. This is why I’m still crying in church. The minute I start to feel numb, I believe I’ll lose some hope and resolve. And there is another animating goal. Progressives share so much, but so often our human nature and lopsided structures get in the way. Can we use this moment to be honest with each other in a new and different way, and clear up longstanding disagreements and inequalities that enable us to be aligned behind a common vision? Because I believe we will take power back. And when that happens, we need to enact a very bold agenda that catapults political possibilities far, far away from where Trump has dragged them. This work is already under way: it’s the work of conversations between unions and environmentalists; large, well-funded organisations and smaller grassroots ones; centrist and more radical activists; and those who believe change comes from disrupting unjust laws and those whose work is to pass just ones. It’s the work of the People’s Climate March, which will take place on Saturday, 29 April in Washington DC and throughout the rest of the country. Its message aspires to the future we’re trying to build, and it’s being organised by a diverse cross-section of the entire movement. That tearful day in church ended on a high note. Afterwards, some friends and I went to New York’s MoMA PS1 museum to see the Rev Osagyefo Uhuru Sekou perform. Rev Sekou is a Pentecostal minister, an author and a gospel and blues musician, who has been active in the Movement for Black Lives. Yes, I went to church twice that day, and no, that isn’t the norm for me! And when he sang “What a time to be alive, the revolution has come”, I didn’t feel like crying – I felt like getting back to work. 20 January 2017 marked a turning point for the entire world. Since the election results were announced on 8 November 2016 I’d been feeling mostly numb, unable to process what the impact would be for me, my family and the people I care about. I felt the need to be quiet, to be somewhere quiet. To have space to think. Every step I took felt like walking on eggshells. The first few weeks after the election everyone around me seemed to be unsure, fearful and riddled with anxiety. I was too. Quick to lash out, slow to listen. I had nothing to start from except what I’d heard during the campaign. And yet, at the same time, I did know what was coming. Perhaps somewhere my cells were reorganising to protect my heart from what was inevitable. More suffering, more uncertainty. More people dying for trying to live. During the campaign, the surrogates for our current president unabashedly attacked Black Lives Matter activists as “terrorists” and “cop killers”. In the aftermath of the election, there were many different responses. Some decided to continue their work as before and felt that not much had changed. Others decided to demonstrate their resistance by doing a direct action at the inauguration. Others shared information about the key players in the incoming administration, attempting to support others in the network to understand more clearly the new political agenda. All of us remain committed to the work of black liberation. During the holidays, my family and I talked over dinner about personal security. I described to them a new set of protocols we would need to begin using in order to ensure our safety, insofar as that was even possible. My parents described their fear of what was to come. A lawsuit filed by a rabid conservative former district attorney hung over our heads as someone charged us and other activists with “starting a race war”. Indeed, the election of Donald Trump was like a nuclear plume slowly rising over the United States. What I’ve learned in the first 100 days of this administration is that you can never stop dreaming about freedom. I’ve spent the past few months being relatively quiet. Listening. Brushing up on my reading about the right wing in the United States and the movement it has been diligently building for the past 30 years. I’ve taken to a practice of listening more and also listening less. Listening more to what’s not being said, watching as the various factions on the right joust for power and influence. I’ve taken stock of the damage, as the right wing now controls the presidency, the supreme court, Congress and the majority of state legislatures. Listening less to voices that refuse to deal with our political reality as it actually is, as opposed to how they want it to be. The low points over the past few months have been many. Executive order after executive order that sought to punish the communities that make America great – Muslims, undocumented immigrants, black people, women, queer communities, transgender people. A “law and order” agenda that seeks to criminalise anyone who disagrees with the administration’s aims. An attorney general who refuses to protect each person equally. A secretary of education who seeks to privatise public education. A secretary of housing and urban development who seeks to slash an already paper-thin budget for housing set aside for those living in poverty. A chief strategist with white supremacist leanings who is responsible not just for advising the president, but who, to all intents and purposes, is the one pushing the many decisions that this so-called president espouses on television. And of course, the recent bombings of Syria and Afghanistan. Certainly, we are in for a long fight and not all of us will make it. I comfort my parents who are concerned about the state of their healthcare. They’re both in their 60s and have recently retired. And so, while the Affordable Care Act isn’t perfect, it is what they have and it is what they depend on. And it is what they deserve, what every human being on this Earth deserves – to be cared for. And yet I am hopeful. The disorganisation of our political landscape offers abundant opportunities for new strategies and a transformation in the way we care for one another. I welcome the opportunity to be closer to my neighbours, to fight for myself, my family and my loved ones with every fibre of my being. Inside of the quiet, the cynicism dissipates. We have no choice other than to fight back, to take back what was always flawed but still holds the promise of what could be. I remember that the resistance is real and it lives. The day before the president is inaugurated, I join more than a million women in the streets of Washington, DC; for many, this was their first time on a demonstration. When the president followed orders from his chief strategist to institute a travel ban on Muslims, airports were shut down by those fighting for democracy and those caught in the crosshairs of such a ridiculous endeavour were given legal support and reunited with their families. I work with the National Domestic Workers Alliance, a prominent voice and political vehicle for the millions of domestic workers in the United States who are still excluded from most federal labour protections – and so when the president initially nominated a man for secretary of labour who was known for his opposition to workers’ rights, we participated in the resistance to stop him from being confirmed. Representatives returned to their home districts and were forced to face their constituents in ways that they haven’t had to in decades. And so, while there are many challenges to overcome, it is good to know that we are not alone in attempting to find the solutions necessary to save our lives and the lives of millions who are vulnerable not just in the United States, but around the world. Wherever there is oppression, there is resistance. I’m happy to know which side I’m on. I live in the heart of Trump country, in Meigs County, Ohio, a rural county struggling with poverty and addiction. My neighbours are precisely the people the right wing have been preying on and propagandising while the left abandoned them for decades. I wasn’t terribly surprised to see Clinton had lost. I’d just published a column in the Guardian about why so many people would be voting for Trump. But I wept on election night and then got well and truly drunk, because I didn’t want to think about what was coming next. My household is bracing for disaster. I wrote a book, Hand to Mouth, about what a precarious life feels like, but this is the first time I’ve felt precarity coming in my bones and also had enough income to assuage my fears of: not enough food, not enough warmth, not enough anything on hand to deal with an emergency. I have a garden, as anyone in the country does, but we got serious about it after the election. This is the first year I’ve thought that food prices will spike enough to make it worth focusing on the garden as a food source, not just a hobby. Increased immigration raids will likely leave food rotting in the fields and shipping costs will probably go up as they do during periods of uncertainty; imported food will be more expensive. And the more the country talked about Russia, the more sense it made to expand the plans we had for a few tomatoes and beans to include asparagus and maybe some root vegetables because they’ll keep just fine. The logic: oil and power costs tend to spike when Russia’s doing a thing and we’re bombing the Middle East. Then we thought: maybe berry bushes. A few fruit trees. And a herb patch. And maybe we should borrow a tiller at this point or buy one? Just now, I’m mapping out two weeks of my schedule around harvest time so I can be home to do the food preservation. We’re not about freeze-dried food storage yet; right now people are still only joking about nukes. Besides, this part of the country’s turning into a rainforest. A decade ago this part of Ohio didn’t reach such high temperatures. Now summers are lush and humid, while winters are becoming harsher. So it’s not such a bad idea, if you happen to have the land and the time to get the work done, to be working on sustainability. Partially that’s environmentalism, but it’s an economic consideration too. It’s a thing we talk about over dinner at home or with friends. We also talk about power. Electricity is expensive, so is heating oil, and gas ain’t free either. Power will only get more expensive as regulations are rolled back and the market is left to its own devices. Water is already a scarce commodity. Might as well put in some solar panels if you can afford it. I spent the weeks between the election and the inauguration mostly glued to Twitter. I tried to help people reason through what had just happened. I impatiently explained the philosophical and historical definition of fascism versus the hyperbolic version. I demanded we all grow up and focus on the important stuff: not what had happened, but what was coming. My audience grew and split into groups – people who liked my satirical round-ups of the incoming administration’s peccadilloes, people who liked that I discussed the reasons we were vulnerable to a demagogue, people who just wanted someone to explain what the hell had happened. I started taking more note of political conversation I heard around me, too, here in rural Ohio, where they went for Trump hard. Consensus seemed to be building that voting Trump hadn’t worked but as it was a last-ditch attempt anyway, it was worth waiting to see. Nobody quite agreed on what he was supposed to have done or, rather, there were a lot of things. Mostly, he was supposed to have disrupted everything – but not exactly like this. He needed to get off that stupid Twitter, anyway, everyone agreed on that. I keep wondering what these people didn’t learn from the Tea Party. Once the inauguration was over, I largely quit trying to explain anything to anyone online; emotion was riding too high and we were back to breaking news instead of analysis and I was planning a garden, so I started joking that no matter what happened, at least I had fertile land and a defensible perimeter. When the kids weren’t listening, we talked about what guns to buy. Between the realisation that we were moving into a time of instability and trying to keep up with the daily domestic outrages, I couldn’t muster the energy to care about who had what ties with Russia. As far as I could tell, nobody knew anything concrete and it was all an expenditure of nervous tension, something tangible to turn like a Rubik’s Cube. I watched friends I respect come to personal attacks over whether Bernie or Hillary would have been better, instead of concentrating on the task at hand, which was: we damn well did have Trump. If we could find someone to blame, we could avoid blaming ourselves: I watched it all spin around me and decided it wasn’t for me. I was going to concentrate on writing a book instead, paying closer attention to the world around me. I hoped that maybe by writing it I could answer my own questions: how did we get to this point where we seem incapable of governing? Where is this division and can we heal it? Most important, how is everyone experiencing all this unrest? I have always had a difficult time drawing a line between journalism and activism. I just go places and watch things and I write about them. I am a curious sort and my readers tend to be interested in the same things I am. Which I suppose is why, when faced with a country I hardly recognise, my instinct is to set off around the nation asking people impertinent questions and share what they tell me with everyone else. Three months in, my neighbours who discuss politics in public and voted for Trump seem to be split between unreasonable partisan shills and people who voted for disruption because it was that or more of the same. It seems many people really were hoping that someone with no experience might – just maybe – do it differently. Only he’s turning out to be worse than anyone we’ve ever had so far and now discussion is turning to whether we even have a functioning government any more. It’s a fight between what I know my country should be and what I see it turning into, which is the plaintive cry of all American millennials. I am 34 years old and I have watched my country poisoned by fear and hate, watched generations before me sell out my future and that of my children, watched us destroy the whole world’s economy and within months get back to business as usual and record highs in the markets. I do not have youthful hope for America, not now, and certainly not in Trump’s twisted version of freedom and progress where we hate and fear anyone who isn’t exactly like us and we have no charity for a fellow citizen. I was no fan of Hillary Clinton either, but at least she was only likely to enrich herself and her friends within reasonable limits. I can understand wanting power for power’s sake even if I wish leadership looked less like plutocracy. But I cannot, will not fathom the intentional hollowing of everything I have been taught to cherish. I got a tattoo recently, for the first time since mid-2015. I get tattooed when I am wrestling with something very difficult, because I prefer to keep reminders than to learn lessons twice. In this case, I realised that I was worried I’d forgotten how to survive."
"Although Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt has been among the biggest proponents of withdrawing America from the Paris climate agreement (using bogus ‘blame China’ arguments to make his case), climate deniers have been unhappy with him. That’s because Pruitt doesn’t want to challenge EPA’s carbon pollution endangerment finding – he thinks it would be a lost cause. A group of contrarian scientists released a white paper trying to pressure him to attack the finding anyway.  Briefly, the endangerment finding stemmed from a 2007 Supreme Court decision in which 12 states sued the EPA, calling on the agency to regulate carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of those states, ordering EPA to determine if greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare. After considering the scientific evidence, including the latest IPCC report, national climate science assessments, etc., the EPA issued its endangerment finding correctly concluding that carbon pollution clearly endangers public health and welfare via its climate change impacts. As a result, the EPA is legally required to regulate carbon pollution. The Obama EPA followed that legal requirement by crafting the Clean Power Plan. Early in his presidency, Trump signed an anti-climate executive order calling on EPA to review and revise the Clean Power Plan. In effect, it’s currently on hold. However, that review process takes years, and in 2020 the next president’s EPA could make the carbon pollution regulations even more aggressive. As long as the endangerment finding is in place, there is a legal requirement for the EPA to regulate carbon pollution.  Fossil fuel-loving deniers thus hate the endangerment finding. The problem is that it’s based on overwhelming scientific evidence. As attorney general of Oklahoma, Pruitt frequently sued the EPA and lost nearly every time, so he knows a losing case when he sees one. Baseball fan Pruitt lost 6 of 7 lawsuits against the EPA. That would be a mediocre .142 batting average. The judicial system evaluates all available scientific evidence and listens to scientific experts. That’s why climate deniers keep losing in court, and Pruitt doesn’t want to waste his time on another sure loser. But the endangerment finding is so important, many deniers think trying to take it down is worth a shot. Enter a white paper published by a number of contrarian scientists, including a few of the less than 3% of climate scientists who reject or minimize human-caused global warming. The white paper tries to make the case that the EPA endangerment finding is wrong. Not surprisingly, aside from being poorly written, the arguments in the white paper are astonishingly bad. The white paper focuses on what its authors call the “tropical hot spot” (THS), which refers to the fact that as a result of global warming, scientists expect to see a particularly hot area in the lower atmosphere above the Earth’s tropics. As the white paper describes it: Stated simply, first, the THS is claimed to be a fingerprint or signature of atmospheric and Global Average Surface Temperatures warming caused by increasing GHG/CO2 concentrations. Nearly a decade ago, current NASA Goddard director Gavin Schmidt provided this figure showing a climate model simulation with that hot spot signature: But there’s one big problem. In that simulation, the hot spot resulted from a 2% increase in solar activity. As Schmidt said in 2007: the pattern really has nothing to do with greenhouse gas changes, but is a more fundamental response to warming (however caused). Indeed, there is a clear physical reason why this is the case – the increase in water vapour as surface air temperature rises causes a change in the moist-adiabatic lapse rate (the decrease of temperature with height) such that the surface to mid-tropospheric gradient decreases with increasing temperature (i.e. it warms faster aloft). This is something seen in many observations and over many timescales, and is not something unique to climate models. So the fundamental claim in the white paper that the hot spot is a fingerprint of human-caused global warming is entirely false, as climate scientists (and my colleagues and I) have been pointing out for a decade. That basic error by itself is enough to toss the denier paper into the recycle bin, but it gets even worse, claiming: The assumption of the existence of a “Tropical Hot Spot (THS)” is critical to all Three Lines of Evidence in EPA’s GHG/CO2 Endangerment Finding. I encourage everyone to read the EPA endangerment finding technical support document. The document does discuss some of the many actual fingerprints of human-caused global warming that scientists have observed, but its only mention of the tropical hot spot is to note that it may or may not represent one inconsistency between models and observations: Fingerprint studies have identified GHG and sulfate aerosol signals in observed surface temperature records, a stratospheric ozone depletion signal in stratospheric temperatures, and the combined effects of these forcing agents in the vertical structure of atmospheric temperature changes (Karl et al., 2006). Karl et al. (2009) state that more recent studies have also found human fingerprints in the patterns of change in Arctic and Antarctic temperatures. However, an important inconsistency may have been identified in the tropics. In the tropics, most observational data sets show more warming at the surface than in the troposphere, while almost all model simulations have larger warming aloft than at the surface (Karl et al., 2006). Karl et al. (2009) state that when uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets are in agreement with climate model results. As noted at the end of that quote, the latest research finds evidence that the hot spot is there, but measuring temperature profiles in the atmosphere is a challenge.  To summarize: White paper claim #1: The endangerment finding depends on the existence of the hot spot.  Verdict: False. The document only briefly mentions the hot spot. White paper claim#2: The hot spot is a key fingerprint of human-caused global warming.  Verdict: False. According to atmospheric physics, the hot spot should result from global warming, regardless of its cause. White paper claim #3: The hot spot doesn’t exist.  Verdict: False. It probably does exist, although it’s difficult to measure. In short, the best case this group of contrarian scientists could make against the endangerment finding is a physically-incorrect strawman that ignores the latest research, as well as 99.9% of the scientific evidence summarized in the endangerment finding.  It’s no wonder Scott Pruitt doesn’t want to waste his time tilting at this windmill."

"After 200,000 years of modern humans on a 4.5 billion-year-old Earth, we have arrived at new point in history: the Anthropocene. The change has come upon us with disorienting speed. It is the kind of shift that typically takes two or three or four generations to sink in. Our best scientists tell us insistently that a calamity is unfolding, that the life-support systems of the Earth are being damaged in ways that threaten our survival. Yet in the face of these facts we carry on as usual.   Most citizens ignore or downplay the warnings; many of our intellectuals indulge in wishful thinking; and some influential voices declare that nothing at all is happening, that the scientists are deceiving us. Yet the evidence tells us that so powerful have humans become that we have entered this new and dangerous geological epoch, which is defined by the fact that the human imprint on the global environment has now become so large and active that it rivals some of the great forces of nature in its impact on the functioning of the Earth system. This bizarre situation, in which we have become potent enough to change the course of the Earth yet seem unable to regulate ourselves, contradicts every modern belief about the kind of creature the human being is. So for some it is absurd to suggest that humankind could break out of the boundaries of history and inscribe itself as a geological force in deep time. Humans are too puny to change the climate, they insist, so it is outlandish to suggest we could change the geological time scale. Others assign the Earth and its evolution to the divine realm, so that it is not merely impertinence to suggest that humans can overrule the almighty, but blasphemy. Many intellectuals in the social sciences and humanities do not concede that Earth scientists have anything to say that could impinge on their understanding of the world, because the “world” consists only of humans engaging with humans, with nature no more than a passive backdrop to draw on as we please.  The “humans-only” orientation of the social sciences and humanities is reinforced by our total absorption in representations of reality derived from media, encouraging us to view the ecological crisis as a spectacle that takes place outside the bubble of our existence. It is true that grasping the scale of what is happening requires not only breaking the bubble but also making the cognitive leap to “Earth system thinking” – that is, conceiving of the Earth as a single, complex, dynamic system. It is one thing to accept that human influence has spread across the landscape, the oceans and the atmosphere, but quite another to make the jump to understanding that human activities are disrupting the functioning of the Earth as a complex, dynamic, ever-evolving totality comprised of myriad interlocking processes.  But consider this astounding fact: with knowledge of the cycles that govern Earth’s rotation, including its tilt and wobble, paleo-climatologists are able to predict with reasonable certainty that the next ice age is due in 50,000 years’ time. Yet because carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere for millennia, global warming from human activity in the 20th and 21st centuries is expected to suppress that ice age and quite possibly the following one, expected in 130,000 years.  If human activity occurring over a century or two can irreversibly transform the global climate for tens of thousands of years, we are prompted to rethink history and social analysis as a purely intra-human affair. How should we understand the disquieting fact that a mass of scientific evidence about the Anthropocene, an unfolding event of colossal proportions, has been insufficient to induce a reasoned and fitting response?  For many, the accumulation of facts about ecological disruption seems to have a narcotising effect, all too apparent in popular attitudes to the crisis of the Earth system, and especially among opinion-makers and political leaders. A few have opened themselves to the full meaning of the Anthropocene, crossing a threshold by way of a gradual but ever-more disturbing process of evidence assimilation or, in some cases, after a realisation that breaks over them suddenly and with great force in response to an event or piece of information in itself quite small. Beyond the science, the few alert to the plight of the Earth sense that something unfathomably great is taking place, conscious that we face a struggle between ruin and the possibility of some kind of salvation. So today the greatest tragedy is the absence of a sense of the tragedy. The indifference of most to the Earth system’s disturbance may be attributed to a failure of reason or psychological weaknesses; but these seem inadequate to explain why we find ourselves on the edge of the abyss.  How can we understand the miserable failure of contemporary thinking to come to grips with what now confronts us? A few years after the second atomic bomb was dropped, Kazuo Ishiguro wrote a novel about the people of Nagasaki, a novel in which the bomb is never mentioned yet whose shadow falls over everyone. The Anthropocene’s shadow too falls over all of us.  Yet the bookshops are regularly replenished with tomes about world futures from our leading intellectuals of left and right in which the ecological crisis is barely mentioned. They write about the rise of China, clashing civilizations and machines that take over the world, composed and put forward as if climate scientists do not exist. They prognosticate about a future from which the dominant facts have been expunged, futurologists trapped in an obsolete past. It is the great silence.  I heard of a dinner party during which one of Europe’s most eminent psychoanalysts held forth ardently on every topic but fell mute when climate change was raised. He had nothing to say. For most of the intelligentsia, it is as if the projections of Earth scientists are so preposterous they can safely be ignored.  Perhaps the intellectual surrender is so complete because the forces we hoped would make the world a more civilised place – personal freedoms, democracy, material advance, technological power – are in truth paving the way to its destruction. The powers we most trusted have betrayed us; that which we believed would save us now threatens to devour us.  For some, the tension is resolved by rejecting the evidence, which is to say, by discarding the Enlightenment. For others, the response is to denigrate calls to heed the danger as a loss of faith in humanity, as if anguish for the Earth were a romantic illusion or superstitious regression.  Yet the Earth scientists continue to haunt us, following us around like wailing apparitions while we hurry on with our lives, turning around occasionally with irritation to hold up the crucifix of Progress."
"There was tremendous outcry when the New York Times hired opinion columnist Bret Stephens, who has a long history of making misinformed comments about climate change. Stephens didn’t assuage those fears when he devoted his first column to punching hippies, absurdly suggesting that our lack of progress on climate policy is a result of greens being too mean to climate deniers. Stephens lamentably stayed on the subject of climate change in his second and third Times columns as well. In those pieces, he used corn-based ethanol subsidies as an example of where climate policy has gone wrong:  So let’s talk about ethanol and other biofuels, a subject some climate-change activists might prefer to forget. In 2007, George W. Bush used his State of the Union speech to call for huge increases in the production of renewable and alternative fuels such as ethanol. Democrats were firmly on board, and President Barack Obama pursued a largely similar course in his first years in office. This is a clear case of cherry picking. There are hundreds of examples of climate policies with varying degrees of effectiveness; why focus on just one? Many environmental groups and “climate-change activists” have long opposed corn-based ethanol subsidies, as Stephens himself noted. Politicians of both political parties supported those subsidies because they were popular in corn-growing Midwestern states. It had little if anything to do with climate efficacy. So why blame “climate-change activists” for these politically-motivated subsidies? For his next misleading argument, Stephens shifted to German electricity costs: The country is producing record levels of energy from wind and solar power, but emissions are almost exactly what they were in 2009. Meanwhile, German households pay nearly the highest electricity bills in Europe, all for what amounts to an illusion of ecological virtue. Stephens’ comparison to 2009 is another example of blatant cherry picking. German carbon emissions that year were particularly low, due in part to the global recession. The long-term trend is unmistakable: Just asking @nytimes: why would @BretStephensNYT compare latest German greenhouse gas emissions with 2009, of all years? Delicious cherries! pic.twitter.com/r0J6slelpc It’s also odd that Stephens criticized Germany for its electricity bills, given that the report he referenced shows they’re a bit lower than what Americans pay. The difference is that while German electricity rates are 3.3 times higher than Americans’, their electricity consumption is 3.4 times lower. In other words, German policies have been successful in cutting the nation’s carbon pollution while still keeping their electricity bills a bit lower than Americans’.  The country is far from perfect – they still rely on coal for a significant amount of that electricity generation – but from a climate policy perspective, Germany is mostly a success story. America’s per-person carbon pollution is nearly twice as high as Germany’s. Although his columns are riddled with these sorts of misleading cherry picks, worse yet is that Stephens’ arguments are red herrings, distracting from the elephant in the room.  Stephens’ columns worry that America will jump on the bandwagon of any feel-good climate policy. If only we lived in a world where that were a legitimate concern. In reality, the Trump administration is taking every possible step to undo all American climate policies. They’re considering withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement because they believe it won’t allow America to increase its carbon pollution.  The administration has effectively declared war on the Earth’s climate and our future well-being. Noam Chomsky has called the Republican Party the most dangerous organization in human history because of its climate denial and policy obstruction. The Republican Party is the most dangerous organisation in human history due to its lack of action on climate change, Noam Chomsky tells us pic.twitter.com/zkFppzso3C Stephens’ focus on corn-based ethanol is like a cancer patient worrying about a hangnail. Certainly, all parties should debate the best and most effective policies to address climate change. We’ve been pleading with Republicans for years to engage in that debate. Democrats have proposed all sorts of different policy solutions - government regulations, free market cap and trade systems (a Republican invention), small government revenue-neutral carbon taxes - you name it. They’re not the problem.  Fortunately, some prominent Republicans have stepped up to engage in the climate policy debate. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham authored past climate legislation. 19 House Republicans have joined the Climate Solutions Caucus, 12 of whom just introduced The Climate Solutions Commission Act that would establish a commission to recommend economically viable climate policies. And a group of Republican elder statesmen on the Climate Leadership Council met with the White House to recommend support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax. However, while deserving of great praise and encouragement for their efforts, these climate realist Republican Party leaders are in the minority. The question is whether they can wrest control of the party away from the climate deniers and policy obstructionists before too much damage is done to the Earth’s climate and the future prospects of the GOP. The Republican Party used to be conservative on environmental issues, as Tea Party co-founder Debbie Dooley has noted: On this issue, the conservative approach requires major efforts to cut carbon pollution. Merely investing in research and clean technologies, as Stephens supports, is grossly insufficient.  It’s worthwhile to challenge New York Times readers’ notions and worldviews, but not if it’s done in an intellectually dishonest way on the greatest existential problem we face today. Stephens could use his platform and influence to try and reverse his party’s policy obstruction; instead he’s chosen to concern troll Times readers. They expect and deserve much better."
"The debate facing our world today is not whether we need to address climate change. That debate is far, far behind us. The issue is how to address climate change – as quickly and effectively as possible. Virtually the entire scientific community – more than 99% of peer-reviewed studies – has concluded that climate change is real. It is caused by human activity. And the impacts are devastating.  According to a study published Monday by the National Academy of Science, climate change is already causing severe weather events including prolonged droughts, record-high temperatures, and rising sea levels because of melting Arctic sea ice. And while everyone will be affected by climate change, the people who had least to do with causing the problem will be affected the most, including low-income families and communities of color across America. That is why we must aggressively transition our energy system away from fossil fuels and toward clean, renewable energy solutions such as energy efficiency, solar, wind and geothermal energy, and electric vehicles.  Here’s the good news: the global community is moving in the right direction. Solar panels cost 80% less today than they did in 2008. The solar industry has grown every year for the past decade. In fact, nearly one-fifth of the world’s electricity today comes from clean, renewable resources like the sun and wind. No matter what agenda President Trump and his administration of climate deniers push, it is clear that jobs in clean energy like wind and solar are growing much more rapidly than jobs in the coal, oil and gas sectors. The number of workers maintaining wind turbines in the US is set to more than double between 2014 and 2024, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Around the world, more than 9.4 million people already work in the renewable energy sector. These are the jobs of the future.  Not only does renewable energy help fight climate change and create jobs, but it’s also good for public health. Cutting carbon pollution emissions by just 32% by 2030 would prevent up to 3,600 premature deaths, 90,000 asthma attacks in children, and 1,700 heart attacks each year. We’re beginning to transition to a clean energy economy – but scientists say we need to do it faster to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. University researchers and the not-for-profit Solutions Project have mapped out how we can achieve a 100% clean, renewable energy future for all 50 states and 139 countries by 2050. With their research, governments in the US and around the world can learn exactly how to break dependence on fossil fuel, why we don’t need fracking and how we can move aggressively in terms of sustainable energy and energy efficiency. Now is the time for taking swift, aggressive action. This week, Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon and I, Bernie Sanders, together with Senators Ed Markey and Cory Booker, introduced a bill that is a major step forward in addressing the climate crisis. The bill, which is strongly supported by the Solutions Project and other major environmental organizations, would transition the US toward a completely clean energy system for electricity, heating, and transportation.  Not only is this possible and affordable, but it would also create millions of decent-paying, long-term and full-time jobs that our economy desperately needs. It would clean up our air and water. And it would decrease our dependence on foreign oil and improve national security. Most Americans know that Congress is way out of touch with where the American people are. The Koch brothers and the fossil fuels industry are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on campaign contributions to keep it that way. Too many members of Congress now worry more about the interests of the oil, gas, and coal companies than the interests of their constituents and the wellbeing of the planet. The only way we will defeat organized money is to organize through people power. We must stand up and demand that Congress put people over the profits of the fossil fuel industry. That’s why the People’s Climate March in Washington DC and all over the world on Saturday is so enormously important.  When millions of people in every country in the world demand that their government work to transition our energy systems away from fossil fuels and toward sustainable energy, we will win. That’s what today is about, and that’s what tomorrow must be about. We must keep up the fight for our children and future generations to come."

"During inauguration day on 20 January, as Donald Trump was adding “American carnage” to the presidential lexicon, the new administration also took a hammer to official recognition that climate change exists and poses a threat to the US. One of the starkest alterations to the White House’s website following Trump’s assumption of office was the scrapping of an entire section on climate change, stuffed with graphs on renewable energy growth and pictures of Barack Obama gazing at shriveling glaciers, to be replaced by a perfunctory page entitled “An America first energy plan”. In the more than 100 days since, the administration has largely opted for a chisel and scalpel approach to refashioning its online content, but the end result is much the same – mentions of climate change have been excised, buried or stripped of any importance. Federal government websites are being combed through to apply new verbiage. The state department’s office of global change, for example, has removed links to the Obama administration’s 2013 climate action report and mention of the latest UN meeting on climate change. Text relating to climate change and greenhouse gases has also been purged. Trump’s desire to champion the coal industry is reflected in the Department of Energy’s online pages aimed at educating children. Sentences that point out the harmful health consequences of burning coal and other impacts of fossil fuels have gone. Alterations to the Department of the Interior’s climate section weren’t quite as subtle. A nine-paragraph description of melting glaciers, wildfires and invasive species driven by climate change has been pared down to a single, noncommittal line. And then there’s the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the target of severe cuts to its climate programs by the administration and led by an administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has defied basic scientific understanding of climate change. On 28 April, the EPA announced in as quiet a way possible – it was a Friday at 7pm – that its website was “undergoing changes that reflect the agency’s new direction” under Trump and Pruitt. This would involve “updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership”. Immediately, the EPA’s climate change section disappeared, to be replaced by a static holding page. This page linked to a “snapshot” from 19 January that includes copious information on the basics of climate change, the amount of greenhouse gases emitted in the US, temperature data and how the EPA is helping tamp down emissions.  These changes have caused deep alarm among environmental groups and some scientists, who fear that tweaked online language may soon morph into reams of climate data being deleted. While the record-keeping rules of the EPA and other agencies demand that data is retained, there is little to stop the administration hiding it from public view, only to be obtained via freedom of information laws. Groups such as DataRefuge and the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI) have swung into action to monitor and archive climate and other data, just in case. EDGI uses a team of volunteer analysts to track changes to around 25,000 pages across multiple government agencies.  Maya Anjur-Dietrich, member of EDGI’s website tracking committee, said the initiative has “observed several emerging patterns, which notably concern climate change and renewable energy”.  “Across multiple agency websites, we have seen a reduction in usage of terms like ‘climate change’ and ‘greenhouse gases’, and an overall reduction in access to information pertaining to climate change,” she said.  “In a few cases, we have also observed shifts in economy- and business-oriented language, where the descriptions of the office focuses have increased their mentions of helping to grow infrastructure, create jobs, and stimulate the economy.   “On certain DOE (Department of Energy) pages, in particular, we have seen a shift in emphasis away from renewable energy and, in some cases, towards usage of fossil fuels.”  Anjur-Dietrich pointed out that federal government websites have always been regularly updated, either during an administration or its transition. But unless care is taken, broad, important themes such as climate change can become obscured.   “It is when web pages are changed without transparency, explanation, or careful documentation that the public’s access to information – and thus the ability to understand the implications of that information – is imperiled,” she said.  Activists have sought to resurrect removed information through the so-called Beetlejuice provision, which is where three separate freedom of information requests for the same thing requires the content to be publicly displayed.  The Beetlejuice tactic has been used on a range of agencies – including Nasa and the EPA – for climate data, renewable energy information and other content. Researchers fret that changes to online generalities aimed at the public may ultimately grow to become threat to their work.  “It’s a serious concern that we will lose this information because long-term, large-scale environmental data is very hard to come by,” said Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at Duke University who submitted one of the freedom of information requests.  “At this stage it’s a fear – I haven’t had colleagues saying they tried to get data and it’s no longer there. But this has to be viewed in the context of an administration that’s very hostile to science. I mean, we have a president who has said climate change is a Chinese plot.” Amy Atwood, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, added: “Scrubbing information about climate change will not make it any less dangerous. “We’re going to fight the Trump administration’s efforts to bury the science showing the dangerous impacts of climate change at every turn.”"
"Yesterday, New York Times subscribers were treated to an email alert announcing the first opinion column from Bret Stephens, who they hired away from the Wall Street Journal. Like all Journal opinion columnists who write about climate change, Stephens has said a lot of things on the subject that could charitably be described as ignorant and wrong. Thus many Times subscribers voiced bewilderment and concern about his hiring, to which the paper’s public editor issued a rather offensive response.  Justifying the critics, here’s how the paper announced Stephens’ first opinion column in an email alert (usually reserved for important breaking news): TOP STORIES In his debut as a Times Op-Ed columnist, Bret Stephens says reasonable people can be skeptical about the dangers of climate change In his column, Stephens pooh-poohed climate change as a “modest (0.85 degrees Celsius) warming of the Northern Hemisphere since 1880,” citing the 2014 IPCC report. However, Stephens packed three big mistakes into that single sentence. Here’s what the IPCC said (emphasis added): The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C over the period 1880 to 2012 The northern hemisphere warms faster than the global average because it has more land and less ocean than the southern hemisphere (water warms slowly), so this is an important mistake that underestimates the global temperature rise. On top of that, since 2012 we’ve seen the three hottest years on record (2014, 2015, and 2016), so even the 0.85°C warming figure is outdated (it’s now right around 1°C).  Most importantly, the global warming we’ve experience is in no way “modest.” We’re already causing a rate of warming faster than when the Earth transitions out of an ice age, and within a few decades we could be causing the fastest climate change Earth has seen in 50 million years. The last ice age transition saw about 4°C global warming over 10,000 years; humans are on pace to cause that much warming between 1900 and 2100 – a period of just 200 years, with most of that warming happening since 1975. Of course, how much global warming we see in the coming decades depends on how much carbon pollution we dump into the atmosphere. If we take serious immediate action to cut those emissions, as the international community pledged to do under the Paris agreement, we can limit global warming to perhaps 2°C, and the climate consequences that come along with it. But this is where Stephens’ opinions are particularly unhelpful: Demanding abrupt and expensive changes in public policy raises fair questions about ideological intentions. Censoriously asserting one’s moral superiority and treating skeptics as imbeciles and deplorables wins few converts … Perhaps if there were less certitude about our climate future, more Americans would be interested in having a reasoned conversation about it. In other words, the people obstructing climate policies are justified because climate “advocates” are too mean to them, and claim too much certainty about the future. This is of course nonsense. There is uncertainty about how much global warming and climate change we’ll see in the coming decades (climate scientists are crystal clear about this), but the biggest factor contributing to that uncertainty is human behavior – how much carbon pollution we end up dumping into the atmosphere. This is apparent from looking at the IPCC global temperature projections: In the red ‘burn lots of fossil fuels’ (RCP8.5) scenario, we’ll see a further 3.0–5.5°C warming between now and 2100. In the blue ‘take immediate serious climate action’ (RCP2.6) scenario, we’ll see a further 0.5–1.5°C global warming by 2100. Those ranges represent uncertainties in the climate modeling, but the difference between them – which is based on how much carbon pollution we release – is bigger than the uncertainty in each scenario. Smoking provides an apt analogy. Each time we smoke, we increase the odds of developing cancer a little bit more. The future outcome is uncertain – we don’t know exactly if or when the disaster of cancer will hit – but we know we’re making it more likely every time we smoke, and the smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on the cigarettes as quickly as possible. With climate change, each time we add more carbon pollution to the atmosphere, we increase the odds of a climate catastrophe a little bit more. The smart move is to mitigate that risk by cutting down on our burning of fossil fuels as quickly as possible.  Stephens’ piece is akin to criticizing doctors and anti-smoking groups for being too mean to the tobacco industry, and for not focusing on the uncertainty about exactly when the chain-smoking patient will develop cancer. So far, climate change may be humanity’s greatest-ever risk management failure. The Paris climate agreement was a major step to remedy that failure, but now the Trump administration is debating whether to withdraw from it, or simply refuse to honor America’s pledges.  There have been bipartisan bills in Congress to implement market-based solutions to the problem, but each has been blocked by the Republican Party at the behest of its fossil fuel donors. Democrats have even proposed small government, revenue-neutral solutions that would benefit the economy, but while some Republican elder statesmen support the policy, Republicans in Congress have refused to even vote on it. In short, on climate science and policy it’s clear where the problem lies, and it’s not with the advocates. Not only does Stephens get basic facts wrong and gloss over the tremendous risks posed by climate change, but he blames partisan policy obstruction on the people who are desperately trying every possible avenue to solve the problem. The New York Times is publishing and promoting textbook hippie punching, and its readers are rightly appalled.  The Truth Is More Important Now Than Ever, Except If You're Reading Our Op-Ed Page pic.twitter.com/1bWM9IPM1k A number of climate realists and scientists have canceled their subscriptions to the paper in response. It’s a difficult choice because New York Times journalists do a lot of good reporting, including on climate change. Justin Gillis is practically a national treasure. In fact many of those Times journalists themselves seem unhappy about the hire and Stephens’ first opinion piece.  ""The New York Times newsroom and the New York Times opinion section are totally separate things!"" he shouted into the void At the same time, it’s difficult to stomach paying for a paper that uses that money to hire and promote views as uninformed and harmful as Bret Stephens’, on a subject as critically important as climate change.  Personally, I had hoped that Stephens would simply avoid the subject, but his first piece dashed those hopes much in the way that our hopes for sensible American climate policy have been dashed time and time again by those who he defends."
"I’m 24 years old, and I believe that water and climate change are the defining issues of my generation. The way I see it, listening is a form of activism.  This Saturday I will be in Washington DC for the People’s Climate March, and I will have my audio recorder with me as part of my mission to collect 1,001 audio interviews about how climate change and water have impacted their lives.  My journeys as a poet-activist-touring cyclist began three years ago at the People’s Climate March in New York. I wore a cardboard sign around my neck that said “tell me a story about water” on one side and “tell me a story about climate change” on the other, joining a rising tide of 400,000 activists. That day people told stories about all sorts of things: of the health impacts of paper mill pollution on a community in northern China; climate change’s threats to Vermont’s maple syrup industry; and the experience of being stuck in an office building for 62 hours during Hurricane Sandy. Since the 2014 People’s Climate March I have been traveling through 11 countries, mostly by bicycle (and sometimes by boat). To date I have recorded interviews with more than 600 storytellers in the US, Fiji, Tuvalu, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Qatar, Morocco and the UK.  You can follow my progress on my 1,001 stories website. Here is a sample of some of the stories I have recorded on my journeys so far. I met Rebecca and her daughter Athena at the September 2014 People’s Climate March in NYC. At the time, Athena was five months old; she slept on her mother’s chest as we walked.  Rebecca told me that she and her husband moved to Ojai, California because they wanted to “start a family and get out of the big city of Los Angeles.”  “We moved to a five acre avocado ranch in Ojai and we have 300-plus avocado trees,” Rebecca said. “Our whole goal is to build and create this farm so that we could raise our daughter Athena that she could live on for her whole life and have her children.”  Their goal was to have a farm that could be passed down through generations. A prolonged drought made that goal more complex than Rebecca anticipated. “We’re now at the end of a five year drought and our water is running out, and so our trees are extremely thirsty,” she said at the time. “The cost of water is soaring. We’re not sure if we’re going to be able to keep our trees or not because of how water consumptive it is.”  All of the water in Ojai comes from Lake Casitas. After five years of drought, the reservoir was then on its last reserves. “The climate, just since we’ve moved to Ojai, has completely changed,” Rebecca said, “and so our big dream and our vision of moving to this beautiful place where we could grow our own food and we could live sustainably on the earth is starting to die, quite literally. It’s drying up.”  The highest point on this low-lying coral atoll nation in the Pacific is only four meters (12.5ft) above sea level. With a population just shy of 11,000, Tuvalu is one of the smallest and most remote countries on the planet. I lived in Tuvalu for a month, from December 2014 to January 2015, and during that time I made friends with Losite, a Tuvaluan my age, who invited me to the outer island of Nukufetau to spend Christmas with her family. Losite’s mother, Nisikata, works as a primary school teacher in Nukufetau. We sat overlooking the sea. She told me the story of a drought that lasted from April to December 2013: “Our local taro crops [and] the fish died because of the drought,” she said. “We usually get water from rain. And when we [went to] fetch water from our tank … it’s all empty. “The underground well water [was] also salty,” Nisikata said. “There used to be a freshwater lens under Tuvalu. In the last 15 years, due to sea level change, that freshwater lens has become salty and impossible to drink.” “With the drought, so many things that affected our life, like our livestocks. We depend on pigs, [and were] also facing problem by finding food. Coconuts are not bearing fruit … green nuts are all falling down. [It was] very hard to find anything to drink,” she said. “Donors from overseas gave bottles of water and those waters [were] distributed to each island and also into schools by the government of Tuvalu. And from there we can survive.”  Rations of food were also provided to each island. “Bit by bit we used those and when we run out of the ration, the government still providing us with more until we were back again to our normal weather: sunny, warm and then sometimes rain.” I met Dr Mike Joy, a senior lecturer at Massey University, during my bike trip down the length of Aotearoa. Joy told me this story from his home in the Horowhenua, on the lower north island, in February 2015.  “Water and climate change are totally interrelated here, as I guess they are everywhere,” Joy said. “As a country we are going along a very clear path towards maximizing agricultural production. Our government has decided that it wants to double agricultural production in the next decade or two. “We already have extreme effects of intensification of farming,” he said. “62% of the length of all our rivers in the country are unswimmable through pathogens, mostly from farming but also from urban impacts. “Pretty much anywhere in lowland New Zealand you’ll find polluted waterways, and in the conservation estate, which is mostly the alpine areas, we have amazingly clean lakes and rivers,” Joy said.  With the intensification of dairy agriculture, “we now have 6.5m dairy cows in this country,” Joy said. “If you want to think about the impact of 6.5m dairy cows, a very conservative comparison is that one dairy cow produces as much waste as 14 humans. So you multiply that out … a country the size of the United Kingdom and has 90 million human equivalents.”  The current human population of New Zealand is 4.8 million: “The waste from these animals doesn’t get some form of treatment like human waste would in a developed country. It mostly just goes into waterways. “The other big downside to that is more than 50% of our greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, and so we effectively, while our CO2 emissions are relatively OK because we’re quite a low human population, our greenhouse gas emissions in total are massively increasing,” Joy said. “We trade on this clean green image, but in reality we’ve trashed an amazingly unique and diverse country, and we’ve trashed it in the name of producing a very low-value commodity – that’s milk powder. Of the milk that’s traded in the world, more than 35% of it comes from New Zealand. We’re a major player in global markets, but only at the cheapest possible end of the scale.” And at what cost? “The other reality that’s well hidden here is that New Zealand has the highest proportion globally of threatened species overall. We have the highest incidence of waterborne diseases of any developed country as well.” Partway through my six months of cycling up Australia’s east coast, I pedalled through Wooyung, in New South Wales. Enticed by hand-painted signs for peaches, nectarines, lychees and mangoes, I pulled into Wooyung Rd Fruit and Vegetable Stall. I propped my bicycle next to an array of coconuts.  I bought a banana and a nectarine and listened as Terry, a lifelong farmer in Wooyung, told me the story of how floods are more unpredictable than ever before. He said: “Here we used to get floods in January, February. March was your wet monsoon. Now they can come any time from winter. The biggest flood we had, 2005, was the end of June – 34 inches in about three days.” This unpredictability impacts which crops Terry is able to plant. “There’s risk planting any crops on the flats now,” Terry said. “You used to be able to plant watermelons, rockmelons, and things on the flats and you seldom got flooded out before maybe January, February. Now, anytime, there’s such a risk,” he said. “Too much money involved to put many crops down on the flats,” Terry said."
"In response to Benjamin Barber’s article on putting cities in charge of climate change (Opinion, 8 May), while I agree that current government attempts are ineffective, and Oslo, the example city, has worked effectively to combat climate change and reduce carbon emissions, I think putting less affluent cities in charge would have a different outcome.Kate McWilliamsNewcastle upon Tyne  • One solution to the question of retesting older drivers (Letters, 3 May) would be to require them to resit the theory test.

"Australia’s electricity and gas transmission industry has intensified a call for a market mechanism to drive orderly transformation in the energy sector, warning a lack of clear regulation will result in higher prices for consumers and a less secure grid. Energy Networks Australia (ENA) says clear policy settings could ultimately save Australian energy customers $100bn, and allow a smooth transition, where large-scale variable renewable energy can be integrated securely, creating the prospect of Australia’s electricity sector achieving zero net carbon emissions by 2050. A new roadmap from the ENA to be released on Friday says the energy market is in the middle of a profound transformation that will only intensify over the next two decades. Modelling produced for the report suggests that by 2050, up to 45% of Australia’s electricity supply could be provided by millions of distributed, privately owned generators, in homes and businesses. The report notes the trend towards decentralisation of power generation creates “profound adaptation challenges for the system’s architecture, stability and efficiency given it was originally designed for almost 100% of generation at the transmission end of the system”. The report’s estimated $100bn in cost savings is a function of governments rolling out nationally consistent policies that would encourage the two parts of the system to work harmoniously together – the current poles and wires of the national market, and the virtual grids in homes and businesses. Allowing efficient co-optimisation would prevent overinvestment in poles and wires. The ENA’s chief executive, John Bradley, said with stable policy settings, networks could buy grid support from customers instead of building their own infrastructure. The rise of distributed energy between now and 2050 will coincide with decarbonisation in the national grid. The report suggests by 2030, around 40% of generation could come from renewable technologies in Victoria and Western Australia, with an increasing share in New South Wales and Queensland as coal generators are retired. The report points out that Queensland alone will boast solar generation capacity almost as large as its current coal-fired generation capacity by 2030. The chief energy economist at the CSIRO, Paul Graham, who collaborated on the report, said the east coast grid would probably require the equivalent of 25 new large-scale solar or windfarms being built in just five years. But the report points out that the massive technological transformation is rolling out in a policy vacuum. “There is currently no enduring, clear long-term climate policy. There is also a lack of integration between electricity sector planning processes and climate policy,” the ENA report says. It notes barriers to efficient decarbonisation “will be exacerbated if distributed energy resources are not utilised to support system balancing, facilitated by network optimisation systems”. The release of the roadmap follows the publication of a draft version last December just before the Coalition decided to rule out an emissions-intensity scheme for the electricity sector after a brief internal revolt. The ENA’s new report continues to argue that an emission-intensity baseline and credit scheme for the electricity sector, and “technology-neutral” carbon policy, would allow the transition to low-emissions power sources at least cost to households. It says an intensity scheme or an “alternative policy of similar merit” should be rolled out by 2020, and the government should pursue “review opportunities to introduce an economy-wide carbon pricing mechanism” by 2026. Bradley says the intense transformation required in the electricity sector will only be possible if the industry agrees on a clear roadmap, and with “stable and enduring carbon policy to support investment”. A range of influential organisations have told the current Finkel review of the national electricity market the Turnbull government needs to put a price on carbon or adopt a market mechanism to drive emissions reduction. A string of peak bodies have used the review to call for the adoption of a market mechanism, including the National Farmers’ Federation, the Investor Group on Climate Change and the Business Council of Australia, which explicitly called for an emissions intensity scheme. The current industry consensus around carbon pricing is a major turnaround in a very short period of time. Three years ago some of the same groups urged the parliament to get out of the way so that Tony Abbott could repeal the Gillard government’s “carbon tax”."
"Readers of this column know that I tend to focus on breaking science in the climate and energy areas. Sometimes, I stray into politics and other times, I venture further afield. Today, on Earth Day, I was reflecting on best ways to move real action forward and it is clear to me, and almost everyone in this industry, that building bridges between like-minded groups is key.  Frankly, it isn’t just scientists that are concerned about climate change. Our concerns are shared by business leaders, the insurance industry, defense industries, people who enjoy the outdoors, farmers, and many more. Recently, there has been a movement amongst persons of faith as well. In fact, for some people of faith, taking care of the Earth is a mandate from a higher authority. In this light, and to celebrate a very different voice form my own, the following is a guest post by a well-known meteorologist in the USA, Paul Douglas. It turns out he is also a man of faith as well as a business leader. Thanks Paul.  -John Abraham Christians just celebrated the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I’m a Christian, husband, father, businessman and scientist; a Penn State meteorologist by training. It’s true that all knowledge is relative; science is never “settled” and one never quite reaches solid bedrock. There’s always a new observation, a new discovery, a radical theory, more testing to do. We look at the universe through a pinhole as God gradually reveals himself to us. Regardless of how you pray or how you vote, we can all agree that fewer toxic chemicals in our air and water is a good thing. But today, more Americans die prematurely from air pollution than traffic accidents. More than 5 million premature deaths result from dirty air every year, worldwide. Air pollution disproportionately impacts minority and low-income communities across the USA. And statistically, America’s poor are much more likely to live near toxic waste sites.  These numbers betray the ugly truth that the poor pay the steepest price for America’s toxic reliance on fossil fuels. This is not the world Jesus teaches us to create. “He will reply, truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me,” Jesus told his disciples in Matthew 24:45.  The Trump administration’s misguided efforts to roll back protections for public health and the environment puts every one of us at risk, especially those with the fewest resources. Increasingly, America the Beautiful is under siege, as the interests of polluting industries take priority over the safety and welfare of our children.  Science is not a substitute for faith; the two are not mutually exclusive. Science has no answer for the miracle of consciousness, the power of love and the promise of eternal life to come. We are here to worship our Creator and enjoy the fruits of his Creation. We are caretakers of a precious gift. We don’t own anything—everything around us is on loan. “My home is in Heaven. I’m just traveling through this world,” Billy Graham preached. Science doesn’t have all the answers, but we would be well advised to listen to the 97% of climate scientists who tell us Earth is warming, and the rapid burning of fossil fuels is responsible. Because the symptoms of a warming planet are becoming harder to deny and dismiss. I just co-authored Caring for Creation: The Evangelical’s Guide to Climate Change and a Healthy Environment with Mitch Hescox, a former coal industry employee and a Methodist Minister. He is now leading the Evangelical Environmental Network, made up of conservatives focused on conserving the very thing that sustains us: a healthy, vibrant planet.  I’m proud of the many Christians who will march on April 29th in the People’s Climate March. Around the world people of faith will speak with one voice about the dangers of climate change, and the opportunities for good, renewable, clean-energy energy jobs. Environmental justice and economic justice go hand in hand. Clean energy is rapidly outpacing fossil fuels in creating jobs—the solar industry already employs twice as many people as coal.  We are called to be stewards, tending what’s left of Eden. “Man has been appointed as a steward for the management of God’s property, and ultimately, he will give account for his stewardship” says Luke 16:2.  How are we doing?  More than 150 million people around the world live within three feet of sea level, so warming, rising seas are quickly becoming more than an inconvenience. Climate change is already making storms, droughts and heat waves more intense, impacting where crops grow and who has access to water. Climate change is emerging as the global human rights struggle of the 21st century. A rapidly-changing climate affects the health and welfare of our kids, and their kids. Respect for life must extend to future generations of unborn. Climate change is a global pro-life issue.  There’s no time for gloom and doom. We already have solutions that will power sustainable abundance. Dirty fossil fuels will fade as we dial up clean, renewable energy sources. The revolution is here: solar costs have fallen more than 80 percent since 2008, onshore wind is down 40 percent, and grid-scale batteries cost 70 percent less. We can have everything we want and need, with less stress on Earth’s Operating System - less lasting damage to God’s Creation.  What would Jesus do? We can’t know the mind of God, but based on Christ’s own words, actions and ministry he might have two simple questions. “Did you protect my Father’s home? Did you defend his children?”  What will we tell him?

"Donald Trump’s scorched-earth approach to environmental protections has shocked current and former government officials overseas who are waiting nervously to see whether the US will destabilize the Paris climate agreement by pulling out of the deal. The Guardian has spoken to a number of officials from key countries before Trump makes a decision on the Paris agreement this month. Trump’s announcement might come as early as this week.  “Trump’s actions on the climate are worrying,” said Izabella Teixeira, the former Brazilian environment minister. “Although it is still too early to be sure what his strategy is for the US, the signs so far of backsliding are a concern to anyone who was involved in the long process that lead up to the Paris agreement,” said the veteran negotiator, who was credited with a key role in securing the international deal in 2015. “We certainly could not have imagined this political picture when we signed the agreement in Paris,” said Teixeira. “It is a concern because we saw a similar situation when George W Bush came to power and backed away from the Kyoto protocol”. The US president has started peeling away many of the pollution rules imposed by Barack Obama’s administration, such as the signature Clean Power Plan, new vehicle emissions standards, clean water regulations, and curbs on toxic discharge from power plants. Keystone XL and Dakota Access, two major and controversial oil pipelines, have been approved. Last week, the president ordered reviews of protected areas on land and water with the goal of opening them up to further oil and gas drilling. Trump said he was “unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high-paying American energy jobs.” The administration is now mulling whether the US should stay in the Paris climate agreement, a landmark deal struck by nearly 200 nations to lower greenhouse gas emissions that was ratified last year. Trump has previously promised to “cancel” the deal, but his advisers are reportedly split over whether quitting the compact would be worth the resulting diplomatic fallout. Last week a senior UN official warned the US would suffer economically if it chooses to pull out of Paris, citing the clean energy jobs that will be created as countries decarbonize their electricity sources. “There is no doubt where the future is and that is what all the private sector companies have understood,” Erik Solheim, UN environment chief, told Reuters. “The future is green. Obviously if you are not a party to the Paris agreement, you will lose out. And the main losers of course will be the people of the United States itself because all the interesting, fascinating new green jobs would go to China and to the other parts of the world that are investing heavily in this.”  Pacific island nations particularly vulnerable to the rising seas, heatwaves and droughts wrought by increasing global temperatures are particularly alarmed at the sharp reversal in climate policy by the US, the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases.  Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji, has written to Trump to urge him to stay within the Paris agreement. Bainimarama will officially head the UN climate change talks taking place in Bonn, Germany in November. “Climate change is not a hoax. it is frighteningly real,” Bainimarama told a conference in Melbourne. “Billions of people are losing the ability to feed themselves. Don’t let the whole side down by leaving, just when we have a game plan.” Hilda Heine, the president of the Marshall Islands, a scattered group of low-lying coral islands, said she was “extremely disappointed to see the United States seeking to roll back its efforts to reduce emissions”. She added: “My country’s survival depends on every country delivering on the promises they made in Paris. Our own commitment to it will never waiver.” Given America’s huge emissions and diplomatic clout, its domestic climate policies are being closely watched by other governments. They have noted Trump’s intention to cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by nearly a third – even though Congress had other ideas – and the climate change denial of many in the administration, including the president himself. “I’m very worried by what is happening in the US regarding climate change. It was an extraordinarily strong shock to hear that Trump has signed a decree to revise the clean power plan,” said Ramón Méndez, former head of Uruguay’s climate policy who was among those who hammered out the Paris agreement in 2015. “Of all of Trump’s policies, this is the one with the worst consequences for the world.” Without the US – which is responsible for almost a fifth of all emissions on the planet – Méndez told the Guardian it would be extremely difficult to reach the goal of keeping temperature rises below 1.5C. It would also set a bad example. “If an important country like the US, which has the second biggest emissions after China, doesn’t abide by the Paris agreement, then the Paris agreement is broken. It will make it harder for other countries to maintain their ambitions,” he said. Mendez said it was “terrifying” that Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the EPA, has denied that carbon dioxide was a primary driver of global warming. Pruitt’s denial contradicts the EPA’s own scientists, although the future visibility of such evidence is in question as the agency is currently “updating language” on climate change and regulations on its website. Should the US completely vacate the international effort to combat global warming, many observers consider it an opportunity for China to use the climate forum to assert itself more forcefully. But Zhang Haibin, a Peking University expert in climate negotiations, said Beijing was taking a “wait-and-see attitude” towards Trump’s climate policies. The academic said that Xie Zhenhua, China’s chief climate change negotiator, had indicated to him that the Chinese government believed Washington had “not yet formed a clear global policy on climate change”. Zhang said he saw only a 40% chance that Trump would follow through on threats to abandon the Paris agreement. “I think the greater likelihood is that Trump will end up not pulling out of the pact but instead adopting a passive approach towards it [and] meeting none of its commitments. I call it a ‘semi-withdrawal,” he said. However, Zhang warned that even that kind of reversal would deal a heavy blow to international efforts to tackle climate change. He predicted that Trump’s lack of interest in the issue would create “a vacuum of a global leadership” that would make it harder to reduce global emissions and finance mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund. Many activists have called on China, the world’s largest emitter, to step up as the global climate champion. Chinese president Xi Jinping appeared to seize that mantle just days before Trump’s inauguration, using a speech in Geneva to urge the US not to derail the Paris agreement and warn: “There is only one earth in the universe and we mankind have only one homeland.” However, Zhang rejected the idea that his country was pushing to become the world’s climate leader. “I think there are two key words to describe China’s leadership role in combating climate change: one is ‘stabilizer’ and the other is ‘coordinator’,” he said. “China should be a climate stabilizer because Trump is someone who is quite uncertain. China should stabilize the existing international order and its norms. And China has the ability to connect and integrate all involved parties in order to build a united global front to combat climate change.” Environmentalists hope to slow Trump’s ambitions by using legal action to entangle attempts to scrap the Clean Power Plan and rewrite other pollution standards. But those who helped negotiate the previous US position on climate change fear momentum will be lost at a crucial juncture in the effort to avoid dangerous warming. “The Trump people can slow-walk things, and a delay of three of five years is significant because with climate change we can’t sit and twiddle our thumbs for too much longer,” said Nathan Hultman, who worked on climate policy at the White House during Obama’s presidency. “Paris is a robust agreement but other countries looking at us and saying ‘why should we do anything then?’ is a risk. We are seeing some shift in leadership but many countries are hoping this a short withdrawal. This problem isn’t going away.” Hultman, who has attended international climate talks for more than 20 years as a negotiator or observer, said Trump’s administration is “far more unpredictable” than that of Bush, which withdrew the US from the Kyoto climate agreement. “Unlike the George W Bush administration, there’s now no clear core ideology or advising strategy as to how decisions are made,” he said. “There was some pragmatism under Bush. So far Trump has been a bull in a china shop.”"
"The El Niño climate event that helped supercharge global warming to record levels in 2015 and 2016 is set for an early return, according to a forecast from the World Meteorological Organization.  El Niño events are prompted by natural fluctuation in ocean temperatures in the Pacific but have a global impact, leading to flooding, droughts and heatwaves. They also exacerbate the increased extreme weather events occurring due to the continued heating of the world as a result of human-caused climate change. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Friday that a new El Niño was 50-60% likely before the end of 2017. “Memories are still fresh of the powerful 2015-2016 El Niño which was associated with droughts, flooding and coral bleaching in different parts of the world and which, combined with long-term climate change, led to the increase of global temperatures to new record highs in both 2015 and 2016,” said Maxx Dilley, director of WMO’s climate prediction and adaptation division. It is unusual for El Niño conditions to return so swiftly, said Tim Stockdale, principal scientist at the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), one of the leading prediction centres around the world and which contributed to the WMO forecast. “Normally we would expect a longer interval before another warming. But, having said that, El Niño variability is really rather irregular.” Friday’s forecast is a early one, based on observations, climate models and historical trends. At present the likelihood is that any El Niño event will be a moderate one. “It will become clearer in the next couple of months,” said Stockdale. However, regional warming associated with El Niño has already caused very heavy rains and floods in Peru and Ecuador, after the sea surface temperatures in the far eastern tropical Pacific ocean rose to 2C or more above average during February and March. This phenomenon has in the past sometimes been followed by a global El Niño. Another concern is that the variation in El Niño over decades may be switching to a new, hotter phase. “For the last decade, the tropical Pacific has tended to be on the cold side, and that has helped keep global temperatures down. With this warming coming back so soon, it makes you wonder if the decadal trend is a bit more on to the positive side,” said Stockdale. “Obviously if that were sustained over the next five to 10 years, it would make the global warming signal stand out more strongly than it has done over the past decade.” The impacts of El Niño events vary but often lead to hot, dry conditions in south and eastern Australia, as well as in Indonesia, the Philippines and south-eastern Africa. The Indian monsoon rainfall, upon which millions depend, also tends to be lower than normal. Wetter than usual conditions are typically seen along the Gulf coast of the US, and the west coast of tropical South America. It remains unclear whether climate change is affecting the frequency or severity of El Niño events, partly because with complex phenomena many years of data are needed to distinguish the human-caused and natural influences.  The ability to forecast El Niño events has improved in recent years, enabling authorities to make preparations. “Accurate predictions of the most recent El Niño saved untold lives. These [are] essential for the agricultural and food security sectors, for management of water resources and public health, as well as for disaster risk reduction,” said Dilley."
"The UK is set to reap the whirlwind of climate change with the huge damage caused by wind storms expected to increase sharply, according to new analysis. Even the minimum global warming now expected – just 1.5C – is projected to raise the cost of windstorm destruction by more than a third in parts of the country. If climate change heats the world even further, broken roofs and damaged buildings are likely to increase by over 50% across a swathe of the nation. The research shows all of the UK is on track to see rises in high winds except the south and south-west, with the greatest impact across the Midlands, Yorkshire and Northern Ireland. This is because the main storms that barrel in off the Atlantic are expected to move their track northwards as the planet warms, a phenomenon linked to the rapid melting being seen in the Arctic. Flooding is the most high-profile impact of climate change on the UK. But the overall cost of wind storms is actually higher, as a result of a much larger number of smaller incidents, and currently runs at an average of about £1bn a year. Extreme wind storms can occur, though, and in 1990 the Burns’ Day storm resulted in 47 deaths, as well as more than £2bn of insured damage and many millions more in damage to roads, power lines and uninsured properties. The new work was commissioned by the Association of British Insurers (ABI), which is concerned by the rising impacts of climate change on its customers, and was carried out by the consultancy Air Worldwide and the UK Met Office. “It is absolutely a concern that we are going to be living in a world where overall there are higher wind storm losses,” said Matt Cullen, the ABI’s head of strategy. “That inevitably transfers through to insurers having to raise premiums and hold more capital. We want to make sure we live in a world where risk is controlled and understandable and we can offer insurance in a reliable and sensible way.” Homes and buildings have lifespans of many decades and so work done now should make them better able to withstand the buffeting of severe winds, Cullen said. He said there was a concern that, while the risks of climate change are now being included in policies, there was little to ensure the protections needed are actually implemented.  The research used sophisticated Met Office climate models to examine how wind storms are likely to change in frequency and intensity with different levels of global warming. “We will probably see an overall reduction in the number of storms, but an increase in the frequency of the most intense storms, and of course those are the ones that cause the [most] damage,” said Peter Sousounis, director of meteorology at Air Worldwide. This data was then used to calculate the changes expected in the cost of damage resulting from the stronger storms and the researchers found significant increases in most parts of the UK. This was not entirely unexpected, said Sousounis. “We have seen enough results from catastrophe models to really not be surprised. Small changes in wind speed can have a huge impact on losses,” he said. “Losses go up almost exponentially with increasing wind speed.” Cullen said: “The likelihood of claims resulting from severe storms increasing in the future is something the insurance industry, and society, need to start preparing for now. Planners and builders should be aware of the need for more wind-resistant construction in specific areas of the country if claims are to be kept to a minimum and residents spared the distress and expense of higher levels of wind damage.” The government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, warned in 2016 that UK is poorly prepared for the inevitable impacts of global warming in coming decades, including floods, deadly annual heatwaves and water shortages. It also warned: “Any increases in maximum wind speeds with climate change experienced during storms would have significant implications for many infrastructure networks,” such as roads and railways and power and communication lines."
"We are running out of space. Fly over Africa at night and you will see mile after mile of fires burning red in the dark as scrub is removed to make way for human beings. Satellite images of nocturnal Europe or America show vast areas lit up like an enormous fairground. From Shanghai to Sydney, from Moscow to Mexico City, the skylines of our major cities are no longer fixed and familiar. Where we cannot build into the sky, we construct vast chequerboards of smogbound, low-rise dwellings that stretch from one horizon to the other. Our cities expand in every direction as we fight to house a population that is growing at the rate of 200,000 each day. That adds up to a headcount the size of Germany every year. To feed this growing number requires ever more land to farm: each year, more than 150,000 square kilometres of natural forest are lost to agricultural or urban development.   Forests cover a third of our planet’s land surface. They produce life-giving oxygen and, by absorbing carbon dioxide, also mitigate the otherwise catastrophic effects of climate change. Not only do they provide a habitat for many of the world’s most endangered animals, around 1.6 billion people rely on them for food, fresh water, clothing, traditional medicine and shelter. Yet they are under threat from rampant deforestation in its many forms: fires, clearing for agriculture, unsustainable logging, ranching and development. We speak reverentially of the savage beauty and teeming biodiversity of the world’s great wildernesses, from the tropical rainforests of Amazonia and central Africa, to our wetlands and deserts, and on to Patagonia and the frozen wastes of Antarctica. We are increasingly aware of the threats to such spaces and have encouraged sustainable conservation and ecotourism. But still the threats remain. The greatest unexplored space on our planet lies beneath the oceans. Yet rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere are causing acidification, which disrupts food chains and marine habitats. Huge floating masses of plastic dumped in the oceans turn into hazardous waste that endangers not only marine life but also, indirectly, human populations – and the planet itself. Overfishing, illegal and damaging trawling practices and past whaling have emptied the oceans before we have even properly understood what riches they contain. And the great spaces of the oceans are the lungs of the planet.  The very air we breathe is filling up with toxins. For years, gases have burned through the ozone layer, exposing us to ultraviolet rays and affecting climate change. Airborne diseases – such as Zika, swine flu and bird flu – have multiplied and threatened to become global pandemics.  Great clouds of smog hover above our cities and airborne diseases multiply. Inhalation of toxic gases is said to reduce average lifespans by one to two years. Various estimates suggest that air pollution accounts for between half and two-thirds of all premature deaths in Asia, while anywhere between 10 and 20% of all worldwide deaths are attributable to the same cause.  Typhoons, hurricanes and cyclones are harbingers of disaster, yet the winds are also, for some, an important source of energy. The debate about the effectiveness of wind farms rages on. Protesters claim they are ineffective and even dangerous eyesores, while pro-campaigners trumpet the positive impact of these wind farms.  Space itself – famously the final frontier – has not been colonised but has, instead, become a dumping ground to such an extent that scientists are now calling on nations to reduce the quantity of orbital junk they produce or risk inhibiting future space activity. And yet, as overpopulation and decreasing landmass become a conundrum for future generations, will outer space provide an inhabitable environment? Space exploration and research are continuing, with Nasa proposing to station a team of astronauts on the moon for a prolonged stay. There is even talk of space stations on Mars.  Twelve photographers were shortlisted for this year’s Prix Pictet award, on the theme of space. Each has made outstanding images that address the theme of space with originality and narrative power. Some, like Mandy Barker, create brilliant artificial worlds in which the plastic particles that are choking our oceans are presented as if they were plankton suspended in water drops. Scientific research has found that plankton ingest tiny plastic particles, mistaking them for food. Since they are at the base of the food chain, they are themselves a crucial source of nourishment for larger creatures. The potential impact on marine life and ultimately humankind is of deep concern. The shortlisted artists follow radically different paths but often arrive at parallel conclusions. Richard Mosse and Sergey Ponomarev focus on the refugee and migration crisis now facing Europe. Mosse’s searing monochrome images of refugee camps and staging sites reduce individual refugees to an inhuman mass, while Ponomarev’s photographs show despairing human beings with nothing left to lose. They have somehow found the strength to undertake a perilous sea journey, in the promise of a better life, in the hope that a safe space awaits them. They exist in limbo, excluded from modern societies.  Michael Wolf and Benny Lam explore those who have, at some personal cost, woven themselves into the social fabric of our cities. Lam focuses on the cramped living conditions of Hong Kong’s poorest citizens, for whom a single 40-square-foot room (the size of a toilet or balcony) is home.  Wolf ’s Japanese commuters are among the 3.64 million people who use Tokyo’s Shinjuku Station every day. Wolf pictures their faces rammed against the glass panes of a subway train. Clearly, this is no way to live. Yet these lives abide. And perhaps in this ability to carry on in adversity lies hope for us all. Hope that, despite the catastrophic damage that we have visited upon the natural world and upon the lives of our most vulnerable fellow citizens, it is not too late for us to reverse the damage.  The artists shortlisted have shone a light on the issues. We ignore them at our peril.  • The Prix Pictet: Space exhibition is at the V&A, London, 6-28 May. Kofi Annan will announce the winner tonight at a ceremony at the museum."
"When Michael Faraday ran the Royal Institution, one of the oldest scientific organisations in the world, the 19th-century chemist took time to pile into public discourse. He ranted about dangerous pollution in the Thames. He debunked the fad of table-turning and blamed the educational system for allowing such nonsense to thrive. Nearly 200 years later, scientists are still tackling bad thinking and big problems. For Sarah Harper, an Oxford gerontologist who takes the helm proper at the RI on Tuesday, the rise of denialism, fake news and alternative facts, combined with rapid advances in research that raise deep questions for society, mean that a grasp of science, and all its uncertainties, has never seemed more vital.  Harper is only the second woman to be appointed director of the RI in its 218-year history. The first was her Oxford colleague, the neuroscientist Baroness Greenfield, who was made redundant in 2010 after a redevelopment of the Mayfair premises plunged the institution into financial crisis. It was a damaging episode that Harper does not want to dwell on. “Plenty has been written about that,” she said. “I think it’s time for the RI to move on.” The details of how it will move on are not entirely clear. Harper has begun talks with the institution’s trustees and management team, but wants time to get to know the organisation too. More collaborations with other bodies are on the cards. “I’d hope that by the end of the year, we’ll have a final strategy in place,” she said. But if the details are uncertain, the direction is not. “Science impacts on people’s lives on a daily basis now. People increasingly need bodies that can provide trusted and open information, and when an issue isn’t black and white, to explain why there’s a debate and guide them through the evidence,” Harper said. “There is a real role for the RI to be a gold standard for scientific evidence.” That means more than simply stating scientific results. Harper’s vision, in part at least, is for the RI to beef up its provision of information, and have more non-scientists join its debates on the fruits of scientific research. Crucially, she wants to lay bare the scientific process: the complexities of data analysis, and the often ambiguous, even opaque nature of scientific findings. That will be valuable at all stages of life, she believes. In reproductive medicine, scientific advances have opened a “therapeutic gap”, where doctors can screen babies for disorders in the womb but have no effective treatments to offer. Where does that leave a couple in the first weeks of pregnancy? How should they respond to the uncertainty? “You can’t have a baby nowadays without having to face up to the fact that science can put decisions on to you that you never had to make even 20 or 30 years ago,” she said.  In Harper’s own field of longevity research, advances in science could raise further dilemmas. Emma Morano, the last person to be born in the 1800s, died this month at the age of 117. Today there are around 14,500 centenarians in the UK alone, but by 2100, than figure is projected to hit one million. “How many will there be if radical scientific interventions to prolong life become the norm?” Harper said. If increases in lifespan outpace those in healthspan, leading more of us to spend our later years sick and disabled, it will raise serious questions about the ethics of the anti-ageing research. It is not just science that Harper wants the RI to weigh in on. Major issues such as climate change and pollution are more about policy and technology than basic science. Another concern, and one that is likely to grow, is the rise of robots and artificial intelligence in the workplace. Robots are already taking on tasks now done by carers, but are the machines and the care they provide the best option? “We do need a forum where people can discuss, for example, whether we are happy for the market to drive the replacement of human carers by robots. Or whether we as a society feel that there are some jobs that should be retained, at least for the present, by people. There are no right or wrong answers, they are simply questions that should be openly addressed and debated,” she said. Harper is the first social scientist to become the RI’s director. She studied at Cambridge and Oxford, and worked as a BBC reporter and a producer on Newsnight before returning to academia. Since 2014 she has served on the prime minister’s Council for Science and Technology. Her appointment to the RI from outside the ranks of the chemists and physicists who have often held the post reflects a desire from the institution’s trustees for a different approach. Harper wants the RI to be more inclusive, for science to work with the humanities and arts, the private sector and policy makers, so that the information it provides, and the debates it holds, are delivered in the most rounded context. “Science is addressing such big global challenges that impact on people’s lives. You’ve got to consider the whole social, ethical, moral and political framing of debates,” she said. “It’s important that the scientist is no longer someone who just sits in a lab. All young scientists should think about public engagement. How will their research impact on the public? Questions that are important to the public should influence the questions they themselves are asking.”"
"Nations around the world have adopted more than 1,200 laws to curb climate change, up from about 60 two decades ago, a sign of widening efforts to limit rising temperatures, according to a new study. “Most countries have a legal basis on which future action can be built,” said Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s climate change chief, at an international meeting on climate change in Bonn, Germany.  She said the findings were cause for optimism, adding that laws were one yardstick for tracking action on global warming, alongside investment in renewable energy or backing the 2015 climate agreement, ratified by 144 nations. The study, by the London School of Economics (LSE), reviewed laws and executive policies in 164 nations, ranging from national cuts in greenhouse gases to curbs in emissions in sectors such as transport, power generation and industry. Up to 47 laws had been added since world leaders adopted the Paris agreement to combat climate change in late 2015, a slowdown from a previous peak of about 100 a year between 2009-13 when many developed nations passed laws. Donald Trump doubts that climate change has a human cause and is considering pulling out of the Paris climate agreement but legislation is often complicated to undo. “If you have that big body of 1,200 laws it is hard to reverse,” said Samuel Fankhauser, the co-director of the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. The study said that developing nations were legislating more but there were still many gaps. Nations including Comoros, Sudan and Somalia have no climate laws. “We don’t want weaklings in the chain,” said Martin Chungong, the secretary general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He urged all countries to adopt laws that help limit downpours, heatwaves and rising sea levels."
"People would always give me a quizzical look. “And what is that, exactly?” they would ask, if brave enough to reveal their naiveté about what was to become the next decades of my life. “Well, it’s the study of how to help poor countries become richer,” I would explain of my choice to study international development.  “Oh that’s very good,” my friends and family would invariably reply, my obvious altruism shining through. (Cough.) And that’s where it would end. The next part of the conversation about macroeconomics and international trade policy is rarely the stuff of great chit chat or dinner conversation outside of our specific professional bubble.  So what does international development really mean? And why is my organisation now dropping it from our name, changing it to Thousand Currents? Making people richer by promoting economic growth has been the assumption at the centre of international aid and philanthropy since it began. Early modernist theory taught us that if “traditional” societies could be helped to develop in the same manner as more “developed” countries, there would be prosperity for everyone.  But this ignored the colonial roots of the sector and the inequities that existed in so-called rich countries. Today, more and more people are recognising that neoliberal models of development belie the ecological realities of the earth’s capacity, as well as basic human rights. In 1985, when the founders of my organisation came together with like-minded people – those who wanted to build on local wisdom and create an alternative to top-down development – the name International Development Exchange (Idex) seemed right. The organisation strove to ignite cultural exchange and also change how US citizens related to the global south. They were not united around raising GDP, but around improving people’s economic opportunities, working conditions, health, education, and overall wellbeing. Since I finished graduate school and since Idex began its work over 30 years ago, the international development field has changed. It is now a loaded term, carrying the weight of parachuted-in “expertise” and resources perhaps best described by Ross Coggin’s 1976 poem, The Development Set: We bring in consultants whose circumlocution  Raises difficulties for every solution –  Thus guaranteeing continued good eating  By showing the need for another meeting. I was focused on HIV as my career began. The premise was that more information would result in changed behaviour. I was trained to be a technical expert, flying across oceans to share my knowledge with villagers about how to develop a project budget and obtain funding. Wouldn’t well-planned projects deliver just that? I quickly realised that my fancy education did not teach me about crucial contextual knowledge that creates space for dialogue, critical thinking, collective decision-making, mobilising networks, and holding powerful external actors accountable.  The limitations of thinking of development purely from a western-defined, economic growth-fuelled perspective are hard to ignore. Neoliberal development policies and approaches have resulted in economic, social, and environmental failures. Our global food system is broken, dominated by corporate-driven agricultural policies that push out small-scale farmers. The world’s richest 1% now have more wealth than the rest of the world combined. Unchecked natural resource consumption has led to a climate crisis that threatens our planet and our collective futures. And that is why last year, after 30 years, Idex decided to change its name. We wanted a powerful concept from the natural world to express the positive, transformational changes emanating from women, young people, and indigenous leadership in the global south. Though we suffer setbacks – such as the jailing of Stella Nyanzi in Uganda, the death of Sheila Abdus-Salaam in New York City, or the murder of natural resources defenders in Honduras – grassroots organisations and movements on all continents are bucking the “old school” paradigm of development. What hasn’t changed in 30 years is that the people living and working closest to these problems are the source of the solutions. Currents, like visionary grassroots leaders and locally-led solutions, have force and direction and are part of a moving, interdependent global picture. Today, Thousand Currents is focused on addressing our shared global challenges, not just the issues faced by a marginalised community or a poor country. That requires new approaches from donors in acknowledgement of this complexity – unrestricted financial support, multi-year timeframes, and new skills and personnel that reflect the world we want to see. We dropped “international development” from our name, because when small, yet formidable pockets of people power come together, that’s when Thousand Currents sees results. Old notions of development no longer serve us, and neither do rote bureaucratic responses to our urgent problems. We must move faster, think more creatively, build stronger relationships, and engender more effective collective action. Currents affect every single person on the planet every single day. And all of us – donors, grassroots activists, UN employees – are currents of change. Jennifer Lentfer  is the director of communications of Thousand Currents.

"‘An exuberant rite of spring” is how the New York Times described 22 April, 1970. In Manhattan, and across America, “huge, light-hearted throngs ambled down autoless streets.” Earth Day had been born, an outburst of protest – and revelry – that involved everyone from save-the-whales activists to opponents of new freeways. Denis Hayes, now 72, was the man tasked with organising it. “What we did was pull together an event that told all of those people, ‘You know you’ve really got something in common and this should be one big movement where we’re supportive of one another’.” It sparked, he tells me, the most profound change in American society since the New Deal. “We now have different kinds of buildings, different kinds of automobiles, different planes, different lighting, different land use. People are choosing to have diets for environmental reasons, choosing to have one child for environmental reasons.” And all that, he says, “didn’t come from political leadership at the top, it came from a bunch of demands down at the grassroots”.  In 1990, Earth Day went international, reaching 200 million people in 141 countries. Now, according to its website, more than a billion participate in celebrations, teach-ins and protests around the world. This year, the Earth Day Network has teamed up with scientists for a rally on the National Mall in Washington DC. Volunteers around the world are convening their own versions of this “March for Science”, to champion “evidence-based policies in the public interest”. Vanessa Furey, one of the organisers of the London march, says she was motivated by the “rise in fake news and ‘alternative facts’” during the past year, “and that quote from Michael Gove [during the referendum campaign] that ‘people have had enough of experts’”. The experts are fighting back. “Scientists aren’t the natural group to go out marching – and I know there are some that still have reservations about doing it. But it felt like a proactive, positive move for [them] to come out and say, let’s get the public involved.” But is there any point in these big days out when the world seems to be hurtling ever faster towards disaster? Last year was the warmest on record, yet progress on environmental issues seems to be going into reverse. Donald Trump is still mulling over whether to abandon the US’s commitment to the Paris agreement on limiting global warming. Scott Pruitt, the man he appointed to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the creation of which was the original Earth Day’s greatest achievement, doesn’t believe the scientific consensus on climate change. The UK government, once a global leader in the campaign to reduce carbon emissions, will be absorbed by Brexit for years. This week it privatised the Green Investment Bank, with no guarantee its mission will be maintained over the long term. “It’s pretty tough to look at what’s going on today with clear eyes and not get fairly depressed,” says Hayes. The challenges facing activists have certainly changed in the 47 years since he became involved, when “you couldn’t see 100 yards in front of your nose” in cities such as Pittsburgh, Los Angeles or Gary, Indiana. “The easy stuff environmentally is when something poses an immediate threat to you, to your children, to your neighbourhood. When that’s happening, it is not that hard to organise people and to get them sufficiently incensed to demand change.” Hayes says that it’s tougher with the big global issues such as climate change, threats to the world’s oceans and migratory species – issues that cross national boundaries and can’t be solved by any one country acting alone. “Those sort of things are all in much worse shape in 2017 than they were back in 1970,” he says. But despair, appropriate as it might seem, isn’t just bad for the soul. A growing movement of “Earth Optimists” believes that it could actually make things worse. In an editorial for Science magazine’s Earth Day issue, professors Andrew Balmford and Nancy Knowlton argue that “presenting people with huge problems without solutions leads to disengagement”. They continue: “Without examples of conservation succeeding, hopelessness could itself emerge as a driver of extinction.” And there are successes: in Brazil, for example, the rate of Amazon deforestation is down to one-third of its 2004 peak. Chinese investment in renewable energy is set to exceed $300bn by 2020. It’s those kinds of triumphs, and myriad smaller ones, that have inspired the Earth Optimism summit, also taking place in Washington DC this weekend. In the UK, Earth Optimism Cambridge will carry the torch. Speakers including Jane Goodall, David Attenborough and Steven Pinker will relay “stories of hope”, and there’s a “solutions fair” with stalls telling people how to consume less and get involved in campaigns. Dr Rosie Trevelyan, director of the Tropical Biology Association, is one of the brains behind the event. She argues that if people dwell on the negative, they won’t learn what actually works, and what they can do to help. Examples come from near and far. “We’ve got someone from the Wildlife Trust, which has restored fenland around here,” she says. “It’s an incredibly important habitat and it had practically disappeared. I went to a fenland on Sunday and saw a bittern. Bitterns had almost gone extinct in this country, and they’re now breeding out there.” One of Trevelyan’s students from Ghana will talk about how he and his colleagues managed to save the Togo slippery frog from extinction. When they were selecting positive stories, she says, “we had to cut loads of them, we had so many. It’s about making people aware of the fact that we don’t need to just stand by and watch these things disappear, we can actually do something.” Earth Day has its detractors, particularly in the US, where environmentalism is seen through the distorting lens of the culture wars. “Earth Day is a yearly reminder that humanity must be controlled, manipulated and even destroyed for the good of the planet,” wrote rightwing pundit Glenn Beck last year. He claimed that the EPA’s ban on the insecticide DDT in 1972 led to millions of avoidable deaths from malaria as other countries followed suit – despite the fact that the US wasn’t the first to outlaw the chemical and continued to allow its use for public health reasons. For Ron Bailey, Reason magazine’s science correspondent, the mixing of politics and ecology has turned off many who might otherwise find common cause with the protesters. “When it was started back in 1970,” he says, “there were obvious problems with pollution and so forth that needed to be dealt with. But it wasn’t an all-out assault on capitalism and market economies, which it has more or less turned into. It’s very alienating for those who are actually anxious to address specific problems that are occurring in the environment both locally and globally. If the only solution is destroying the economy, you’re not going to get a lot of people on board.” No fan of Trump, Bailey nevertheless thinks the scientists marching in Washington today are making a mistake. “Certainly we should celebrate science and its objectivity, and what this has brought to modernity. But by tying it to Earth Day, they are undermining their message. It automatically tinges them with politics.” That, he reckons, could jeopardise funding for scientific research, which in the US has tended to be bipartisan. If not a day, though, then what? “If you’re interested in these kind of things, then go to your local city council, go to your local legislature, write letters to your congressman, testify at hearings, that kind of thing, about the issues that particularly concern you,” says Bailey. It is not a colourful solution. For Trevelyan, it’s not a question of either/or. And while she doesn’t strike me as particularly political, she believes the reaction to Trump and the new spirit of protest are something to be welcomed. “I think it’s mobilised more people to worry about things,” she says. “I think we should watch this space. The March for Science has been catalysed by seeing [him] as president. People are no longer being complacent.” Hayes addresses what he sees as the self-harming democratic choices we have made more directly. “If you happen to be an American or a Briton or a French person or a Turk, it’s difficult not to be a little bit ashamed of your country. That’s just a reason not to get despondent, but to get energised and angry and committed.” “In 1970,” he says, “we called it Earth Day, but it was really a focus on individual cities in the US and schools and neighbourhoods. As we move forward, I think it genuinely is becoming ‘Earth’ Day.” The stakes are higher than they’ve ever been. “You know, this is not one of those casual things that if you win or lose, you don’t mind; or you say, ‘Jeez, sorry, we lost that one.’ We’re talking now about impoverishing the human prospect for the next 100 generations. We can’t lose on this.”"
"As party leaders prepare to sign off on their election manifestos, we would like to draw their attention to a policy that has the overwhelming support of the British public. While 52% of British people voted to leave the EU, 84% want the ban on hunting foxes to stay, according to the latest Ipsos Mori data. In addition, 88% support the ban on deer-hunting, and 91% back the ban on hunting hares. Support for the ban among people in the countryside is at similar levels.  Ipsos Mori projections indicate that there is a clear majority in favour of the ban in every constituency in England and Wales, including that of all party leaders, and that voters view more favourably those candidates who support the ban by a margin of more than seven to one over those who want it repealed. We call on all party leaders not only to rule out any repeal, weakening or substitution of the Hunting Act but also to support its strengthening and enforcement. The Hunting Act is one of the most popular pieces of legislation on the statute book today. We’re asking party leaders to send a clear, unambiguous message at this election that they fully intend to preserve Britain’s great natural heritage, and ensure that cruelty to animals in the name of “sport” remains firmly in the past.Eduardo Goncalves Chief executive, League Against Cruel Sports, Jeremy Cooper Chief executive, RSPCA, Anne Brummer CEO, Save Me Trust, Philip Mansbridge Director, IFAW-UK, Bill Oddie President, League Against Cruel Sports, Dr Brian May Founder, Save Me Trust, Chris Packham, Sir Ranulph Fiennes, Peter Egan • If there is one issue that should be at the heart of this election, it is climate change. When we next choose a government (in 2022), it’s likely that global temperature will have risen 1.5C. That’s the level that nations (including the UK) pledged at Paris in 2015 should not be breached to avoid dangerous climate change. At current rates of burning coal, gas and oil, we are on track to put enough carbon in the atmosphere in the next five years to push us past that temperature increase. But it’s not inevitable. Rapidly increasing our efforts to reduce emissions – from homes, businesses and transport – and installing more renewable energy give us a fighting chance. To build support, politicians must spell out the consequences of not taking the decisive action urgently required on climate change and introduce policies that will drive that action. Greens have long campaigned for warmer and more efficient homes, renewable energy, public transport, and better provision for cycling – measures that reduce emissions and are cheaper for society in the long term. I urge voters to find out where the other parties’ candidates stand on climate change and press them to commit to increased action. Because, whatever government we have and however hard or soft Brexit is, the challenge of climate change will still be with us.Robert PalgraveHereford Green party • There are three reasons the government is reluctant to publish its clean air plan (Report, 28 April). First, it will demonstrate that Defra has prioritised the interests of car manufacturers over the public good for the past five years. Second, the proposals are likely to be deficient and will be heavily criticised pre-election. Third, it will highlight the dangers of Brexit: for without the EU air quality directive, there are no legally binding standards to protect the public from the harmful effects of air pollution.Dr Robin Russell-Jones(Former chair, Campaign for Lead-Free Air), Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire • Deborah Orr has made the connection between NO2 emissions and hay fever: “The presence of NO2 also triggers allergic reactions to pollen” (Children can’t play if they can’t breathe, 29 April). Increased instances of hay fever, asthma and respiratory problems (especially in urban areas) are an unintended consequence of tree planting programmes, which are done for all the right reasons. But local authority planners and urban designers are not considering allergy and asthma when selecting tree species. For example: the male catkins of birch may be a delight to see, but they emit copious, almost invisible, airborne pollen, which is a particularly potent trigger of hay fever, asthma and several common food allergies (pollen-food syndrome). The beautiful bark, relatively low purchase and maintenance cost and foliage that is pretty efficient at capturing carbon are positive features, but there are plenty of non-allergenic alternatives that could do the same job of mopping up carbon and releasing oxygen for the benefit of all. The cost of ignoring allergens is poor respiratory health, days absent from school or work, and individuals suffering due to persistent over-exposure to noxious fumes and particulates and increasingly high pollen counts. When there are alternatives, the idea of “simply not letting the kids play outside when air pollution is particularly bad” doesn’t really work. Children, when they go to and from school, collect pollen in their airways, hair and clothing, which they then bring home. Neither school nor home is a pollen-free sanctuary. The necessary policies include selecting the right trees and plants for highways and public spaces, alongside actions to cut the NO2 and particulate pollution that is primarily driven by diesel.Jackie HeraldLondon • Bart Elmore is right that “Coca-Cola should have known better” (Report, 2 May).

"Barry Jones, a Hawke government minister who held the science portfolio when the high court decided the Tasmanian dam case in 1983, despairs of an Australian government making the same decision in 2017. Instead of taking a principled opposition on the grounds of science, he said, the Labor party would probably do a photo opportunity pouring the concrete. “In 1983, Labor was pushed to take a bit of a stand because it thought the issue was important,” he said. “Now I think Labor would do it the other way. Jobs are the thing.” Jones, who is now an honorary professor at Melbourne University and a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian College of Educators, Australian Academy of Humanities, Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia, and the Australian Society of Technological Sciences and Engineering, will speak at the global March for Science in Melbourne on Saturday. He told Guardian Australia he was marching in support of the scientific method and in support of rational thought and evidence as things that still mattered in society. Jones said politics had shifted to the point where science and facts were considered to be of equal or lesser value than opinions and intuition, and of considerably less value than potential votes.  “I always thought that higher levels of education and access to technology would have such a dramatic impact that people would then look at the world in a different way,” he said. “They would be more thoughtful, more engaged. In fact, it hasn’t been like that. “The big question for a lot of people now is: how do you feel about something? It’s not ‘what are the objective facts’, it’s ‘how do you feel about climate change?’ And people say, ‘Oh, well, I don’t think I like it because if I have to pay more for fuel that will be a bad thing.’ “When you have a conflict between politics and science, politics is always going to win.” Twelve Australian cities are participating in the global march, beginning with Launceston at 10.30am then Brisbane, Townsville and Canberra at 11am.  The march in Sydney will begin at 12pm at Martin Place while marchers in Melbourne will gather at the State Library of Victoria at 1pm. The speakers in Sydney will include the former Liberal party leader and Q&A favourite Dr John Hewson, along with public health professor Simon Chapman and prominent feminist academic Eva Cox. Peter Ellerton, a lecturer in critical thinking for the University of Queensland, told Guardian Australia he would be marching in Brisbane because “the credibility of science as a way of interpreting the world is under threat”. “You have always had an anti-intelligentsia undercurrent, or some sense in which people imagine that their own thinking is sufficient to determine these truths for themselves, and they don’t need this body of work to tell them otherwise,” Ellerton said. In recent years, he said, that had become more overt. “There’s a move away from evidence-based policy in general, politically. “What we have is a whole bunch of people who promote reasons why we don’t have to accept science. There’s a whole industry … it’s like some people think it seems sexy to say that you are a sceptic.” The problem, Ellerton said, was that there were two steps to being a sceptic.  “The first is to doubt and question, and the second is to listen to the answer,” he said. “Sometimes that requires some intellectual hard yards and I think some people who call themselves sceptics don’t want to do those hard yards. Calling themselves sceptics is a badge of honour they haven’t earned.” The global March for Science began as a thread on Reddit and is modelled on January’s massive Women’s March.  Thousands of scientists are expected to march on the national mall in Washington DC on 22 April, which is also Earth Day and, coincidentally, the first day of World Penguin Weekend.  Marches are expected to be held in at least 54 countries."

"In the Brazilian city of São Paulo, more than 80 experts, including dozens of climate scientists, gathered back in March for a giant planning meeting. As part of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the group from 39 different countries were starting their work on a major report that will tell governments and policymakers what kind of impacts they can expect when global warming reaches 1.5C.  That report is scheduled to be ready in late September 2018 and will assess in detail what’s known about the impacts 1.5C of global warming could have on societies, ecosystems and efforts to reduce poverty. But new research published in a leading scientific journal suggests that just eight years after that report is published, the world might have already reached that 1.5C target – or at least one definition of it (some senior scientists disagree with some of the assumptions in the paper – read on for those important caveats). Published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the research looks closely at the influence of a mechanism in the climate known as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). “The IPO is like the long-term version of El Niño – it’s like El Niño’s uncle,” says Ben Henley of the University of Melbourne and the research’s lead author. When heat gets trapped in deeper layers of the Pacific Ocean, this is known as a negative phase of the IPO.  Since about the year 2000, the IPO hit this negative phase, which tends to slow down the rise in global temperatures that’s being caused by humans burning too many fossil fuels and cutting down forests.  But around 2014, scientists say that this IPO started to shift, possibly towards a positive phase that would act like an accelerator on global warming. Henley and his colleague Andrew King, also at the University of Melbourne, wanted to know how quick global temperatures might reach 1.5C, relative to where they were between 1850 and 1900.  According to the paper, the “rate that global temperatures approach the 1.5C level is likely to be significantly quicker, or slower, depending on the IPO”. After using the latest computer models of the climate and allowing for the added greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, Henley and King looked to see what the coming decades have in store depending on the phase of the IPO.  If the IPO turns positive, then the average across the models shows that global temperatures hit 1.5C in around 2026. If the IPO was to turn negative, then this delays the 1.5C threshold by five years or so. Henley told me: “Policymakers have to be aware of just how quickly we are approaching this level. But that doesn’t mean that the target is not a sensible thing to have. “While we might overshoot 1.5C, stabilising global temperatures at that level still remains a worthwhile goal.” The paper also gives other projections for breaching 1.5C based on different assumptions and different models.  For example, if you wait until global temperatures go above 1.5C over a five-year average period, then some models suggest that if the IPO stays negative for longer, the 1.5C breach doesn’t happen until around the year 2040 (but this is an outlier in the paper).  Associate Professor Julie Arblaster, a climate scientist at Monash University who was not involved in the research, told me the research “highlights the role of natural or internal variability in the climate system in hitting climate targets”, Arblaster pointed to one study published last year in the journal Nature Communications that suggested the switch to a positive phase of the IPO might have already happened. She added: “Other things may also impact the timing of course, such as a large volcanic eruption, but this study helps by providing an estimate of the contribution of the climate system’s internal variability in hitting that target.” Henley told me a key motivation for doing the sums on the 1.5C target was to help policymakers understand what kind of timeframe they have to work with.  When countries were negotiating for a new global deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and slow the impacts of climate change, many smaller and less developed countries were worried that a 2C global warming target was setting the bar way too high. Some scientists also shared this concern. So there was a push to have a 1.5C target included in the text of the deal. Article 2 of the Paris agreement states that countries agree to keep global warming “well below 2C above pre-industrial levels” but to also pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C … recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change”. Bill Hare is an Australian climate scientist and founder of scientific consultancy group Climate Analytics. Hare is a veteran of the United Nations climate talks. In an email, Hare said the paper showed “that very ambitious near-term mitigation is required to limit warming to 1.5°C and this analysis underscores this”. But Hare and his colleagues also had some reservations about the paper’s conclusions.  Hare said the IPCC’s interpretation of when you can say that 1.5C target is breached was based on much longer time periods than the Henley and King paper. He also said the assumption in the paper that greenhouse gas emissions would continue to rise under a “business as usual” scenario didn’t reflect how countries were taking action under the Paris agreement. Using more optimistic scenarios could bring temperatures down by as much as 0.2C by 2030. Joeri Rogelj of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, also pointed out that the convention in UN climate negotiations was to refer to targets in terms of longer time frames of 20 or 30 years. He thought the paper’s assumptions that emissions would remain high were “not compatible” with the agreements countries had made in Paris, but he did agree that the paper demonstrated how urgent the issue was. Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland, is a senior lead author on a chapter of the special report that will look at the impacts of 1.5C global warming on humans and natural environments. Hoegh-Guldberg, who was not speaking from an IPCC perspective, told me the research would “wake some people up to the fact that exceeding 1.5C will happen within the next decade, give or take a couple of years”. “One unknown that’s associated with the study is the effect that anthropogenic climate change might be having on these long-term climate patterns themselves. Some research groups have provided compelling evidence that patterns associated with El Niño, for example, may actually be amplified by warming.” He added: “Many scientists have increasingly pointed to the unmanageable ecological and human impacts as average global surface temperatures exceed 1.5°C, and great economic and environmental costs that are likely to be associated.  “Unfortunately, past inaction means that we will exceed 1.5C no matter what we do. The key issue, however, is what we do next.  “People speak of overshoots as being one of the scenarios that we are likely to face. This is not an escape clause as the overshoot is likely to be catastrophic.”"

"Friday was Britain’s first ever working day without coal power since the Industrial Revolution, according to the National Grid. The control room tweeted the milestone on Friday. It is the first continuous 24-hour coal-free period for Britain since use of the fossil fuel began. West Burton 1 power station, the only coal-fired plant that had been up and running, went offline on Thursday.  National Grid can confirm that for the past 24 hours, it has supplied GB's electricity demand without the need for #coal generation. pic.twitter.com/vgyWEUYqZ4 The UK has had shorter coal-free periods in 2016, as gas and renewables such as wind and solar play an increasing role in the power mix. The longest continuous period until now had been 19 hours – first achieved on a weekend last May, and matched on Thursday. A National Grid spokesman said the record low was a sign of things to come, with coal-free days becoming increasingly common as the polluting fuel is phased out.  Coal has seen significant declines in recent years, accounting for just 9% of electricity generation in 2016, down from around 23% the year before, as coal plants closed or switched to burning biomass such as wood pellets.  Britain’s last coal power station will be forced to close in 2025, as part of a government plan to phase out the fossil fuel to meet its climate change commitments.  Hannah Martin, head of energy at Greenpeace UK, said: “The first day without coal in Britain since the Industrial Revolution marks a watershed in the energy transition. A decade ago, a day without coal would have been unimaginable, and in 10 years’ time our energy system will have radically transformed again. “The direction of travel is that both in the UK and globally we are already moving towards a low carbon economy. It is a clear message to any new government that they should prioritise making the UK a world leader in clean, green, technology.” Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate and energy at WWF, called the first coal-free working day “a significant milestone in our march towards the green economic revolution”. “Getting rid of coal from our energy mix is exciting and hugely important. But it’s not enough to achieve our international commitments to tackle climate change – we haven’t made anything like the same progress on decarbonising buildings and transport. Whoever forms the next government after the general election, they must prioritise a plan for reducing emissions from all sectors.” Redmond-King said. Britain became the first country to use coal for electricity when Thomas Edison opened the Holborn Viaduct power station in London in 1882. It was reported in the Observer at the time that “a hundred weight of coal properly used will yield 50 horse power for an hour.” And that each horse power “will supply at least a light equivalent to 150 candles”."
"  Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, famous for its abbey, the Wars of the Roses battle in 1471 and the floods that ravaged the town in 2007, might seem an unlikely place to look for evidence of impending drought. But stroll along the riverbank at Abbey Mill Gate and the signs are there: the mud is cracked and dry, the reeds brown and withering, and the water is starting to form pools.  “The water levels are low. I notice it when I put my bucket in the water,” says Christine Greenwood, who has spent the past year living on a barge at Abbey Mill, where a spur of the Avon meets a tributary of the Severn. “It affects us because we can’t turn the boat.” In the last week Abbey Mill Gate has featured consistently near the top of the list of rivers in the county with levels well below their normal minimum. Although rain is expected to give Tewkesbury’s rivers a little relief this weekend, it Tewkesbury is one of many places that could be hit by an expected summer drought following one of the driest winters in more than 20 years. Greenwood points to a small wooden jetty on the far side of the river. “The water would normally be up to the edge,” she says. “Now the water laps almost a metre below at the poles supporting the jetty.” Such small signs of change are familiar to environmentalists and scientists: they suggest that the river system is suffering the effects of a concerted period of low rainfall, an event whose most likely outcome is drought. And while falling levels can be inconvenient for the people living on the rivers, they can be catastrophic for the wildlife that is a crucial part of the river ecosystem. “At the moment, river flows are low and affecting migratory fish – salmon, sea trout, eels, shad, lamprey,” says Arlin Ricard, chief executive of the Rivers Trust. “All of these species’ migration upstream will be affected by low flow. It’s already having an effect. Salmon will be the first casualty, then trout, then coarse fish. Those migrating are struggling most because they need a good flow of highly oxygenated cold water to move upstream. Then you will start to see algal blooms caused by warm, nutrient-rich water. They will smother or kill off fish and invertebrates and deplete oxygen from water. During previous droughts, we’ve seen blue-green algal blooms on reservoirs, which can render water unfit for consumption.” Kathy Hughes, a freshwater specialist at the WWF, says other river species could be threatened by drought. “The situation is challenging because wildlife is in a slow, steady decline. Thousands of fish die every year because of a lack of water in the rivers. Kingfishers need healthy amounts of water, water voles are on a knife-edge. When there is no water, they have no refuge to hide from predators and during drought their population can be wiped out.” The early signs of drought are following a pattern familiar from 2012: a reasonably dry summer last year, a dry winter and a couple of dry months in the spring. April saw just 41% of average rainfall nationally; the six months from October were the driest since 1995-96. The Environment Agency said that, while some rivers, reservoirs and groundwater sources were lower than normal, there were currently no water supply issues as a result of the dry weather. However on Friday Affinity Water, which supplies 3.6 million customers in the south-east, urged people to save water because of a lack of rainfall. The company said that the region had received just over half its average rainfall since July resulting in low river levels. For Hughes, the impact of drought on the life of the river is critical because of the water abstraction regime, where water is taken from a ground source for irrigation or is treated for consumption. “In a normal, healthy environment wildlife can cope with drought and floods,” she says. “In 2015, 3,000 fish were killed due to over-abstraction. Of all the abstraction licences, only about 25% allow for an environmental flow. All the others are historical. There’s a huge legacy of over-abstraction, so in times of drought the abstraction is going to continue until there’s nothing left for the rivers. We’re advocating for a sustainable abstraction regime. It’s more of a policing issue: there must be a sufficient level of water in the river for the environment that is safeguarded.” Environmentalists had hoped that a new water bill would include a reform of the abstraction licences, but the bill has been postponed due to Brexit. For Ricard, population density and climate change have exacerbated the effect of low rainfall. “We’re a really drought-prone country, that’s why we struggle. Because of our population density – in the south and east it’s 1,000 people per square mile – we have less rainfall per head than anywhere in Europe, apart from Cyprus and, bizarrely, Belgium. Most scientists and environmentalists would see what is happening now as symptomatic of climate change or a period of change. As environmentalists, we are always saying that we’re seeing these consistent problems of climate change manifest themselves as drought or flood. All those formulas of a once in a 100-year event don’t work any more.” He says that while water companies have learned from previous droughts – by increasing the ability to transfer water by pipe between areas – other measures, such as improving soil quality and an expanded system of farm reservoirs, can offer a longer-term solution. “Paradoxically, to protect yourself from drought takes very similar measures as it does to protect yourself from flood,” he says. “You need to look to the uplands and wetlands and retain as much water as possible. What’s the one thing we can do? Improve soils and increase the potential of soil to retain and receive water and let it flow through to the aquifers. We’re not doing it.”"
"It seems the Earth has a sense of irony. “Record-breaking heat” is possible at the People’s Climate March in DC on Saturday, where thousands of people are planning to protest against the president’s climate change policies on his 100th day in office. Trump’s initiatives include, but are not limited to, a 31% cut in the Environmental Protection Agency and potentially leaving the Paris climate agreement. Among those suffering in the heat will be former vice-president Al Gore and, apparently, Leonardo DiCaprio. It is likely to take a titanic effort to change the other Wolf of Wall Street’s mind, however, as Trump has repeatedly said that the inception of climate change had nothing to do with mankind. Only 1,361 more days of this to go! A group of senators, including Resistance regular Bernie Sanders, this week unveiled legislation that aims to transition to 100% clean and renewable energy by 2050. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants and their allies will be striking and marching around the country on 1 May. The May Day protests are traditionally led by unions and labor groups, but this year – galvanized by the Trump administration – immigration, racial justice, gender equality and LGBT groups will be playing a big part. Demonstrations will take place in a number of states. Activist groups are launching a “Corporate Backers of Hate Campaign” on the same day, which will see demonstrations at the offices of companies seen to be supporting or benefiting from the Trump presidency. Targets include JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. Trump will be met by thousands of Luke Skywalkers, Hans Solos, and, depending on individuals’ tastes, Jar Jar Binkses when he returns to New York City next week.  It’s the president’s first trip to his home city since inauguration day but he will be met by protests. Given Trump’s visit comes on 4 May (May the fourth be with you, etc), organizers have called for activists to come clad in Star Wars gear. The president, a noted fan of heavy machinery, will be visiting the USS Intrepid aircraft carrier-cum-museum with the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. The NYPD says it costs $308,000 a day to protect Trump during his New York jaunts. There has been a 1,035% spike in Islamophobic incidents at US borders during Trump’s first 100 days, according to the Council on American-Islamic relations (Cair). In a press conference on Thursday Cair’s executive director, Nihad Awad, said the group, which he founded in 1994, had “never seen a spike” under any previous administration. A coalition of Muslim organizations is holding a two-day meeting in Washington on 1-2 May when they will lobby elected representatives to take action. • “Trump is the worst thing that could have happened to the planet,” writes climate activist Bill McKibben, but his catastrophic attitude towards the environment has at least forced politicians, and some private enterprises, to step up. • In related news, the Trump administration is considering allowing oil and gas companies to drill off the Atlantic seaboard. The president has ordered his interior department to “review offshore areas potentially rich in fossil fuels that were put out of reach of drilling by Barack Obama’s administration”, according to Oliver Milman. On Wednesday the government launched a new hotline for people to report crimes committed by “illegal aliens”.  It appears to be another anti-immigrant step by the Trump administration – but the plan was reportedly thwarted when people called the hotline to report UFO sightings. Or sightings of Superman. Or Big Foot. You get the idea. If any of you need to report space aliens to our government, please call their hotline: 1-855-48-VOICE. Here are some of their Most Wanted: pic.twitter.com/nWnVYdDdpG"

"Small but inevitable rises in sea level will double the frequency of severe coastal flooding in most of the world with dire consequences for major cities that sit on coastlines, according to scientists. The research takes in to account the large waves and storm surges that can tip gradually rising sea levels over the edge of coastal defences. Lower latitudes will be first affected, in a great swath through the tropics from Africa to South America and throughout south-east Asia, with Europe’s Atlantic coast and the west coast of the US not far behind.  The most vulnerable places, including large cities in Brazil and Ivory Coast, and small Pacific islands, are expected to experience the doubling within a decade.  “It is pretty much inevitable that we are going to see increased frequency of extreme water levels – there is no way around this,” said Sean Vitousek, at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who led the research. Climate change is causing sea levels to rise at about 4mm per year, as ice caps melt and the oceans warm and expand. This will continue for many years due to the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.  The steady rise in sea level is unlikely to cause flooding directly as coastline developments are designed to withstand the larger ebb and flow of the tides. But the rising level gives a higher starting point for the storm surges and big waves that can overwhelm coastal defences. The research, published in the Scientific Reports journal, is the first to analyse these factors, particularly waves, on a global scale. It found that the most at-risk areas were in the low latitudes, where tidal ranges are smaller meaning sea level rise is proportionally more significant.  In those locations, just 2.5cm of sea level rise leads to extreme water levels being seen twice as often, while a 5-10cm increase means coastal floods are twice as likely across all the tropics. A rise of 20cm leaves almost every coast with twice the risk. Projections of sea level rise vary, with the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimating in 2013 an increase between 30cm and 100cm by 2100. But more recent research has suggested the great ice caps are more vulnerable than expected in a warming world and that oceans levels could rise more rapidly to reach 200-300cm by the end of the century.  The rise of 5-10cm, likely to occur within a couple of decades, would mean major cities including San Francisco in the US, Mumbai in India, Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam and Abidjan in Ivory Coast facing a doubled risk of coastal floods. “The maps of increased flooding potential suggest a dire future,” write the scientists. “This study shows how even small changes in mean sea level can significantly increase the frequencies with which critical thresholds are exceeded,” said Thomas Wahl, professor of coastal risks at the University of Central Florida, who was not part of the research team.  “For coastal communities that means they need to adapt in order to prevent flood events from happening much more often,” Wahl said. “In the end, however, it still needs more localised studies in order for coastal managers to make important decisions on the ground.”  Previous research estimated the damages from coastal flooding could soar to $1tn a year by 2050. Vitousek said: “We are going to have to [cut carbon dioxide emissions] and engineer the coastlines to stop a lot of these events from happening. We want Greenland and Antarctica to remain as ice for as long as possible. “One metre of sea level rise is going to be a game-changer for the coastal zone. The next time you are at the beach or down by the water, think about what that area would be like in some of these sea level rise scenarios, half a metre or metre. You’ll see it’s a pretty scary proposition.”"
"Scientists from around the world took to the streets and organised online in events advocating evidence-based policy on 22 April. The global March for Science started as a small community based in Washington DC after online discussion sparked shortly after Donald Trump’s inaugration in January, but grew to encompass hundreds of satellite groups in cities from New Zealand to South Korea to Switzerland. Readers in those countries and many more got in touch to tell us why they were taking part – below are some of their stories. I took part because at a time when we so badly need to maintain hard-won momentum on tackling climate change, politics around the world is taking us in the other direction – ignoring clear scientific imperative. In the Arctic regions where I’ve worked, climate change is already having huge impacts. I’m afraid and frustrated that the window of time we have to reduce emissions and minimise the suffering climate change will cause to people is now closing I hope the march has made scientists more visible, and shown that as a community we do have a real passion for reason and truth. It can be hard to know what to believe or who to listen to at the moment. We need to show that science is credible, its based on reason and evidence and that we’re not prepared to let scientific facts be misrepresented to the public.  I wanted to show support for the March for Science in Washington DC. It is very important to me that science be robustly funded, and that children all over the world get quality STEM education. I’m also concerned about transparency in science – peer-reviewed science should not be censored so am uniting behind the #sciencenotsilence hashtag. I probably feel most strongly about representing veganism at the march. If you care about deforestation, water preservation, energy use, greenhouse gasses – you have to be vegan. If you care about animal cruelty, animal welfare, animal exploitation – you have to be vegan. If you care about antibiotic-resistant infection – you have to be vegan. If you care about obesity, heart disease, diabetes and various cancers – you have to be vegan. And for me it’s the science that tells us this. Science cannot be silenced, there needs to be a free flow of information in all fields of science, and funding for education, research, conferences, etc, with no strings attached. The current atmosphere is one of “gag orders” and meddling in how science is taught, disseminated, and used to support verifiable facts that do not always support the agenda of certain factions in a number of countries. In the US this has become especially problematic, with large cuts in national and state funding that will impact health, research, and natural resources.  Its time to make ourselves heard, and I do not believe that “science should not be politicised”, as some say. Science has been politicised since before Galileo. I hope the march sends a message of global cooperation and shared values within the scientific community, and to the public in general that science is not locked up in ivory towers or museums or laboratories. We are part of everyday activities, we are the people on the street. This man's Trump takedown is complicated. Ask a physicist for the derivative of acceleration. Sent via Guardian Witness  By jackstilgoe   23 April 2017, 3:11  I wanted to To underline the importance of the scientific method. It is the best tool that we, human beings, currently have to interrogate the world that surrounds us. It poses a question, finds the conditions to test it appropriately, repeats this test rigorously to asses whether the results can be reproduced, and leads to an answer supported by evidence. It is evidence-based, not opinion-besed, and open to feedback. Evidence, fact-checking – and responsible Googling – do matter. Let’s build our society and educational system on these principles.  Geneva is home to many international organisations and has more than its fair share of scientists. The speakers at the rally before the Geneva March for Science included: James Beacham, a particle physicist at CERN; Hilal Lashuel, a Molecular Biologist studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s; and Mike Sparrow, Senior Scientific Officer of the World Climate Research Programme. I took part in the march today partly for political reasons: politicians need to recognise the benefits of science to society and ensure that policy is guided by evidence, not by lobbyists for vested interests. But also for personal reasons: I have close family members who will dismiss facts in order to maintain their beliefs. I want to affirm that as new information comes to light, we should integrate it into our beliefs: facts are immutable, but beliefs can change. Sent via Guardian Witness  By Slartibardfarst   22 April 2017, 17:06  I find that the recent political developments and shift in society’s view on research, its practitioners and its findings, threatens the good relationship between society as a whole a the small portion of it that lives primarily for and from research (not only science).  I hope that by showing others who researchers are, and explaining what we do on the occasion of March for Science, we may be able to initiate a new dialogue that will foster mutual learning and trust. March for Science is an opportunity for all researchers to come together and show others in society that although we all have a different voice and question, we do all believe that the scientific method we apply and the questions we consider are of prime importance to us all.

"Thousands of people across the US have marched in rain, snow and sweltering heat to demand action on climate change mass protests that coincided with president Donald Trump’s 100th day in office and took aim at his agenda for rolling back environmental protections. A sea of protesters taking part in the People’s Climate March swarmed in front of the White House to demand Trump rethink plans to reverse the climate change policies. Organisers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco.  A wet spring snow fell in Denver, where several hundred activists posed in the shape of a giant thermometer for a photograph and a dozen people rode stationary bikes to power the loudspeakers. In Chicago, a rain-soaked crowd of thousands headed from the city’s federal plaza to Trump Tower. In Washington, as temperatures rose above 90F, tens of thousands of people marched from the grounds of the US Capitol and passed the White House en route to the Washington Monument for a rally. Participants on Saturday said they object to Trump’s rollback of restrictions on mining, oil drilling and greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants, among other things.   Many of the protesters carried signs with slogans such as “The seas are rising and so are we” and “Don’t be a fossil fool.” As the procession passed the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, marchers booed and chanted “shame.“  While a good-natured mood prevailed and there were no signs of violence, many demonstrators said they were angered by the prospect of Trump carrying through on his vow to roll back protections put in place by his predecessor Barack Obama.  “We’re going to rise up and let them know that we’re sick and tired of seeing our children die of asthma,” said Reverend Leo Woodberry of Florence, South Carolina, who spoke during a press conference before the march. “We’re sick and tired of seeing people with cancer because of coal ash ponds. We’re sick and tired of seeing sea-level rise.” Elsewhere, more than 2,000 people gathered at the Maine State House in Augusta. Speakers included a lobsterman, a solar company owner and members of the Penobscot Nation tribe. “I’ve seen firsthand the impacts of climate change to not only the Gulf of Maine, but also to our evolving fisheries, and to the coastal communities that depend upon them,” said lobsterman Richard Nelson of Friendship, Maine. People in the crowd spoke about the importance of addressing climate change to industries such as renewable energy, forestry, farming and seafood.   Trump’s administration is considering withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, which more than 190 countries including the United States signed in hopes of curbing global warming. Trump has also proposed deep cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency and the elimination of many environmental regulations.  In his campaign, Trump called climate change a hoax. Last month he kept a promise to the coal industry by undoing climate-change rules put in place by Obama. The US protests took place on the same day as similar demonstrations in Britain, Europe and Australia."
"It is 14 years since the heatwave of 2003 killed 2,000 people in southern England and the alarm was raised about hot weather being as dangerous for vulnerable people as winter cold. Since then a UK-wide warning system has been put in place that will inform people when the temperature is likely to exceed 30C for a day and a night. Weather forecast warnings of an imminent heatwave ask that vulnerable people take steps to keep cool.  Hospitals and care homes are supposed to provide a “cool room” for those most at risk. The last such warning was given in August 2016. But scientists are concerned that this is nowhere near enough to protect the public because, even in moderately warm weather, some places can become dangerously hot. Researchers at Loughborough University forecast: “Overheating in UK homes is a public health disaster waiting to happen.” They say this is partly because the government has concentrated its regulations on insulating homes to keep people warm in winter, thereby making them more likely to overheat in summer. This plus poor design of houses and more high-rise building has made many homes uncomfortably warm even in mild summers. Tests show that hospital wards and homes for the elderly are among the most dangerous places in a heatwave. Loughborough says new regulations are required to improve design. This means providing easy-to-open windows and shading to keep out the sun. A public education plan is also needed so people know to open windows at night to let in cool air and close them during the day to keep the heat out. "

"Environmental activists held a rally inside Trump Tower in New York City on Tuesday, ahead of an expected decision from the president on whether to leave the Paris climate change agreement. About 90 people gathered in a public garden on the fifth floor of Donald Trump’s building in midtown Manhattan to encourage the New York City government to divest its pension funds from fossil fuel companies. Organizers from environmental group 350.org said individual states and local councils can still take action on climate change, even in the face of a government that seems ambivalent on the subject.  “We need our governments to act, but we’re not powerless when they don’t,” said May Boeve, executive director at 350.org. “We’re trying to make a connection between the fact that the Trump administration is run by fossil fuel millionaires, from Rex Tillerson to Scott Pruitt. And there’s an effort to try to get the public and elected officials to break sides with fossil fuel industries and divest.” Trump is expected to make a decision on whether to remain in the Paris climate agreement later this month. The president has promised to “cancel” the agreement, under which almost 200 countries agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but his current thinking is unclear. A meeting of his top advisers on the subject was set to take place on Tuesday but was postponed. Tuesday’s “teach-in” protest was part of a week of Global Divestment Mobilization organized by a coalition of activist groups. Rallies encouraging governments to divest from the fossil fuel industry were taking place in 46 different countries. In New York City, activists are pushing for comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the city’s $175bn pension funds, to divest investments in oil and gas companies like Exxon.  The rally took place in one of two “public gardens” in Trump Tower, which as privately owned public spaces are open to members of the public. It included a quiz on which banks invest in fossil fuels, and a slightly on-the-nose tug-of-war which depicted Stringer being pulled in different directions by oil and gas companies and “the people”. New York City council member Helen Rosenthal, state senator Liz Krueger and state assemblyman Felix Ortiz are among the elected officials also demanding that the city ditch its investments in fossil fuel industries. “By fully divesting New York City pension funds from coal, oil and gas, we would take a prudent step toward protecting 1.5 million pension holders, withdraw our support from companies that are driving climate change, and align our financial interests with our goals of moving toward a cleaner, fossil fuel-free energy system,” Rosenthal said. A spokesman for Stringer said the comptroller did not have the power to unilaterally divest. The city’s $175bn is spread across five different pensions, each of which has its own board of directors who decide where money will be invested. The rally, organized by 350.org and New York Communities for Change, is part of a series the groups have held in Trump Tower. Trump has not returned to the building, where his wife, Melania, and 11-year-old son Barron have lived since his inauguration in January. The first lady has said she and Barron will move to Washington at the end of the school year."
"Australia’s big four banks have all ruled out funding or withdrawn from Adani’s Queensland coal project, after Westpac said it would not back opening up new coalmining regions, prompting a scathing attack from the resources minister, Matthew Canavan. Westpac, the country’s second-largest bank, released a new climate policy on Friday, saying it would limit lending for new thermal coal projects to “only existing coal producing basins”.  The coal mined must also have energy content “in at least the top 15% globally”, meaning at least 6,300 kilocalories per kg, according to the Westpac policy. Adani’s Carmichael mine would be the first in the Galilee basin and the coal would have only 4,950 kilocalories per kg, the miner told the Queensland land court in 2014. Canavan, thealso the minister for northern Australia, invited Queenslanders seeking home loans or term deposits to boycott Westpac as a result of its decision. “I can only conclude from this decision by Westpac that they are seeking to revert to their original name as the Bank of New South Wales, as they are turning their back on Queensland as a result of this decision,” he said. “May I suggest those Queenslanders seeking a home loan or a bank deposit or some such in the next few months might want to back a bank that is backing the interests of Queenslanders.” Canavan also accused Westpac of turning its back on “the Indigenous people of Queensland” because of majority support for the project among Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners, although this is contested by an anti-Adani faction. The Queensland senator castigated the bank for “almost zero consultation with the people of north Queensland”, saying it was “more interested in listening to the noisy activists in Sydney than the job hungry people” in his constituency. Westpac has come under pressure from environmental groups and various activist campaigns, including one that targeted its cash machines and a rally that interrupted the bank’s 200th anniversary celebrations in Sydney this month. Adani’s final investment decision on Carmichael had been slated for this month but the company subsequently said it would be made by June before mine construction from August. An Adani Australia spokesman said the company had not approached Westpac for funding for the mine, rail or port expansion. But Blair Palese, the chief executive of climate advocacy group 350.org, said Westpac’s decision represented “an enormous blow to this project and the future of coal in Australia”. Palese said the federal and Queensland governments, which both support the proposed mine, were “becoming increasingly isolated as businesses and international investors refuse to touch coal and the Adani project”. “After months of community pressure, Westpac’s announcement is a strong indication that people everywhere are ready to stop this climate disaster in its tracks and that Adani and our government ignore them at their peril,” he said. Adani is seeking a $1bn concessional loan from the commonwealth for its rail project linking the mine to its Abbot Point coal terminal. On Thursday Andrew Harding, the CEO of Adani’s rival Aurizon, told the Melbourne Mining Club his company could build the line for “at least $1bn less” than Adani’s proposal, with fewer land acquisitions and less impact on the environment.  Adani wrote off that suggestion as “fanciful and monopolistic”. “The so-called plan is a smokescreen aimed at defending Aurizon’s expensive monopoly of coal rail lines in Queensland,” Adani said. “The Aurizon plan is designed to instil fear and stifle hope in the people of regional Queensland.” The CEO of Westpac, Brian Hartzer, also said the bank would increase its lending target for “climate change solutions” from $6.3bn to $10bn by 2020 and $25bn by 2030. “Westpac recognises that climate change is an economic issue as well as an environmental issue, and banks have an important role to play in assisting the Australian economy to transition to a net zero emissions economy,” Hartzer said. “Limiting global warming will require a collaborative effort as we transition to lower-emissions sectors, while also taking steps to help the economy and our communities become more resilient.” Adani previously received a $543m loan facility in two deals with Westpac, alongside others from Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank, to acquire a 99-year lease on the Abbot Point terminal, according to the climate advocacy group Market Forces. NAB ruled out funding the Carmichael project in September 2015, a month after Commonwealth Bank parted ways with Adani as project finance adviser. The CEO of ANZ, Shayne Elliott, in effect ruled out financing the mine last December when he predicted a downward shift in the bank’s exposure to coalmining would continue for the foreseeable future. Critics of the Adani proposal, which would be Australia’s largest and one of the world’s largest coal mines, argue the impact of carbon emissions from its coal is incompatible with global attempts to limit warming to less than 2C. Canavan said Adani’s target markets in India and north Asia would simply source lower quality coal with higher emissions elsewhere, a conclusion he said was shared by the Queensland supreme court in its recent rejection of a “green activist claims” against the mine. The Adani spokesman said the company was “fervently committed” to the project “despite Westpac and other Australian financial houses choosing to ignore the opportunity to invest”. “The financial houses have, instead, chosen to bow to environmental activists,” he said. “In so doing, they have chosen to continue to invest in overseas coal projects that will generate jobs in those countries at the expense of Australians, many of whom are their investors and depositors.” The Carmichael coal “easily meets the emissions standards announced by Westpac”, the spokesman said."
"It started with a crowdfunding startup, an investment from Prince, and the idea to help new solar companies tackle business challenges that can be hard to overcome on their own. Now, four years later, the idea has morphed into a group called Powerhouse, and notably, in a world flush with tech startups, it’s one of the only incubators out there focused on launching and growing solar companies.  Powerhouse runs an accelerator and an incubator program. An accelerator typically provides a small amount of funding, free or low-cost office space, and networking opportunities with investors and customers for young companies that are still developing their first technology and business plans. Since its launch in 2013, Powerhouse has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively into 15 startups, and this summer plans to welcome another few solar entrepreneurs into the program. The group’s incubator division rents office space to more established solar and energy startups across 15,000 sq ft and three floors in downtown Oakland, California. Sometimes the accelerator entrepreneurs graduate into rent-paying companies in the co-working space. Powerhouse now hosts about 15 companies and about 100 people across both groups. Its goal is simple. The organization wants to play a unique role in fostering a new wave of tech innovation in the solar market. Many of the Powerhouse companies are using software, data and the web to make selling or designing solar systems cheaper and easier. They rely on the advice and networking opportunities through Powerhouse to raise money, find customers or exit – through an initial public offering or acquisition. “Powerhouse gave us so much validation and credibility at the beginning, when we didn’t have much to show. It was just enough to get people to believe in us,” says Elena Lucas, the co-founder and CEO of UtilityAPI, an energy data startup. An earlier wave of solar startups was dominated by companies experimenting with different materials and designs for solar cells and panels. Many of those materials-focused solar startups failed in getting the desired technical performance despite large investments from the Bay Area’s venture capitalists. As the price of solar panels dropped dramatically in recent years, the new generation of entrepreneurs and startups are chipping away at other stubborn problems, such as shortening the time it takes to get permits or honing the sales pitch to homeowners. It’s like when fast internet connections finally got cheap and ubiquitous enough to attract the entrepreneurial-minded to build new websites and services on top of it. Tough challenges remain for solar startups. Big utilities and power companies, who are potential investors or customers, don’t generally have experience working with young, renewable energy companies. Meanwhile, US government funding for energy innovation is minimal, particularly with potential federal budget cuts looming and a lack of clean energy support in the White House. But as solar energy becomes cheaper, it’s attracting public and private investments worldwide, evidenced by the $116bn that flowed into solar projects, companies and technologies in 2016, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. “The ultimate mission of Powerhouse is to make solar energy the most accessible form of energy in the world,” says Emily Kirsch, co-founder of Powerhouse. Sitting on a bean bag in a nook of the seventh floor of Powerhouse’s headquarters, Kirsch says that despite the rise and success of Silicon Valley-style tech accelerators such as Y Combinator and Techstars, no one else has tried to do the same targeting only the solar industry: “We’re it so far.” The group’s model is showing some success, at least on a small scale, though it’s still early days. Powerhouse takes a small equity stake in its accelerator companies and makes money if they get acquired or go public. Currently Powerhouse gets the bulk of its investment money from a combination of grants, corporate sponsors, like SolarCity and SunPower, and office space rental fees. It’s considering raising money from angel investors so that it could make larger investments and in more companies. None of the companies in its portfolio has gone public or been bought yet, but some of them have attracted funding since going through the accelerator program and increased the value of the companies in the process. Kirsch says the top startups in the accelerator program have seen their values increase by as many as 40 times. Four of the startups in its incubator program have been acquired so far, says Kirsch, though the company doesn’t take a stake in those. But their exits help to build Powerhouse’s reputation among entrepreneurs and investors. Kirsch has been involved since day one. Years ago, when Kirsch was working for Van Jones, an environmental and human rights activist who briefly served as a green jobs adviser to former President Obama, he asked her if she would be interested in helping the then new startup called Solar Mosaic, which provides financing to install solar panels on rooftops, pilot a solar program in Oakland. Meanwhile Jones’s friend Prince was looking to invest a quarter of a million dollars into solar projects in Oakland, and ended up funding Solar Mosaic’s first four solar buildings. Based on that experience – connecting a young solar startup with partners and capital – Kirsch and Danny Kennedy, a former Greenpeace campaign manager who co-founded solar installer Sungevity, launched a company to try to see if the model could work for many more young solar companies. They changed the name of the company, SFunCube, to Powerhouse two years ago. On a visit earlier this year to Powerhouse’s headquarters, dozens of entrepreneurs were heads down working on their products and mingling with potential partners during a weekly open house event. The Powerhouse team connected UtilityAPI with its first investor, Better Ventures, as well as an adviser, Jon Wellinghoff, who is a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. After going through the accelerator program, UtilityAPI, which creates software to collect data about a building’s energy use and deliver it to customers such as solar or energy storage installers, has grown to nine people from the two co-founders. It now has an office space on the sixth floor of Powerhouse after previously using shared desks. Lucas says the co-working space served as a “brain trust” because all the entrepreneurs brought with them different types of expertise. That allowed her to get quick answers about energy policy or technical standards. Another accelerator program graduate, BrightCurrent, which works with big box retailers and solar companies on marketing solar panels and installation services, now employs 120 people and became profitable last year, says John Bourne, the co-founder and CEO of the five-year-old company. Bourne says Powerhouse helped his company connect with investors (like Better Ventures) and customers and hone his sales pitch. During the accelerator program, Bourne met with Kirsch or Kennedy once a week to walk through BrightCurrent’s plans and brainstorm for ways to overcome obstacles. “It can be really isolating, lonely and tough being an entrepreneur. You’re working alone and trying to build something,” Bourne says. When he joined, Powerhouse was operating out of Sungevity’s offices and, he says: “It was a warm great environment, and I found people who cared about what I cared about. That was a huge win for me.” Solar Mosaic’s co-founder and CEO, Billy Parish, says that his company – which is now six years old and employs more than 150 people – has partnered with at least three of the Powerhouse startups on projects, including UtilityAPI, Sunible and BrightCurrent. “Powerhouse is one of the hubs of the solar ecosystem and they are helping bring breakthrough ideas for the industry into existence. Being close to them keeps us in touch with those new ideas and entrepreneurs,” says Parish. In total numbers, Powerhouse is still pretty small. Its companies have contributed to the installation of 242 megawatts of solar, employ 386 people, and have generated $52m in revenue. That’s probably the group’s biggest drawback – it’s limited, it’s very narrowly focused and it’s still operating on a tiny scale. But they’re part of a larger movement to invest and nurture new companies in low-carbon energy. Other companies running energy-related accelerator programs include Cyclotron Road, which has partnered with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Otherlab in the Mission District of San Francisco. Last year, Bill Gates and a group of investors launched Breakthrough Energy Ventures to spend $1bn on early stage breakthroughs in energy. Powerhouse co-founder Danny Kennedy, who now heads up the California Clean Energy Fund, describes the importance of ventures like Powerhouse and the California Clean Energy Fund like this: “We need early-stage energy investing programs now more than ever to enable the energy transition. It’s critical.”"

"Finland, the new chair of the Arctic council, has appealed to climate change scientists to fight the threat of the US and Russia tearing up commitments to combat global warming. The Nordic country takes up the two-year chairmanship of the body, increasingly a forum where arguments about climate change play out, at a ministerial meeting on Thursday in Fairbanks, Alaska, where the US secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, will represent the Trump administration.  The meeting is due to set targets to reduce black carbon in the Arctic, a pollutant that traps atmospheric heat, but comes amid fears the US is poised to downgrade its commitments made at the 2015 Paris conference on climate change. Harri Mäki-Reinikka, the Finnish ambassador for northern policies, called for the Paris treaty to be respected.  “We hope there will be no deals over the heads of others – these are very global issues. Arctic conditions are changing. If the temperatures are two degrees higher globally that can be four degrees higher, or even six degrees in the Arctic,” he said. “What is even more worrying is that ice and snow are melting faster than we estimated, and that will change the composition of the waters and even the sea level might be rising. If we have two countries, Russia and the US, not sharing the view that climate change is happening or is manmade or how much it is manmade, it is very difficult to proceed.” Mäki-Reinikka said “a month ago Putin said climate change is not man made” but recent reports of bubbles of methane gas forming in Siberia, potentially putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, could mean “a vicious circle of climate change and global warming will be faster, and the Paris climate change agreements will need to be stronger”. Russian scientists have mapped out 7,000 dirt-covered mounds in Siberia, which have mysteriously taken shape in the otherwise flat tundra landscape. Some are slowly filling up with pressurised carbon dioxide and methane, with some on the verge of exploding. Efforts are under way by some British climate experts to persuade senior Russian scientists to think again about climate change. A debate is still raging within the US administration about whether Donald Trump should stick to his campaign commitment to abandon the Paris treaty. Another member of the Arctic council, Norway, has also been putting pressure on Trump with its environment minister, Vidar Helgesen, this week saying that climate change was now seen by military planners as a serious international security challenge.  There are eight member states on the council and about $400bn (£310bn) is being invested in the region, with the majority of that sum from Russia. "
"Climate change is the most urgent challenge facing humankind. Other issues make headlines: terrorism kills; inequality affects everyday life for billions around the globe. But climate is paramount, because in sustainability human survival itself is at stake. Why then have the nations governing the planet been so hopelessly ineffective in addressing the grave environmental crisis?  Is it because the consequences of carbon emissions seem hypothetical, or too far off? Politicians pay few costs for doing nothing, and receive little credit for acting aggressively. In the US, a nation that contributes one-fifth of all global greenhouse emissions (China is responsible for another fifth), Donald Trump has promised to reopen coal mines and free up oil drilling. The problem isn’t the science. The merchants of doubt who claim there is a climate science that is open to scientific debate are not scientific adversaries at all. They are political adversaries, mostly bought and paid for. It is in the realm of politics that the struggle for sustainability must be fought and won. Politics is hardly at its best right now, and that is perhaps the greatest challenge facing us. The weakness of politics undermines democracy – the faith behind politics. But democracy is crucial because climate change is also about justice: how to distribute the costs of decarbonisation and the transition to renewable energy fairly among rich and poor, developed and developing, large and small, north and south. This politics can’t be found in increasingly dysfunctional nation states. The good news about the attempt to address climate change through government action is that it’s happening. The bad news is that it’s happening far too slowly. For every new hydroelectric plant built in the global north, some enormous lake dries up in the global south – Poopó, Bolivia’s second largest, has literally vanished over the last few years. The US state of California is a leader in green public policies, but farmers there also grow pecans in semi-desert conditions where each nut harvested uses up to 300 gallons of water. For every urban fracking ban enacted, there is a move to block it in the courts. Coal is shut down, but fracked natural gas is accepted as a “transition” fuel – however pernicious its effect on decarbonisation. The best-case scenario for what is likely to be done through nation-based environmental programmes hardly dents the worst-case scenario for the catastrophic consequences of all that is not being done. However, there is an ample menu of sustainable options available to cities wishing to address climate change aggressively – and they can amplify their impact by coordinating their policies. The list includes divestment of public funds from carbon energy companies; investment to encourage renewable energy and green infrastructure; municipal carbon taxes; fracking and drilling bans; new waste incineration technologies; regulation of the use of plastic bottles and bags; policies to improve public transport and reduce car use; and recycling. Oslo has been in the forefront of sustainable urban development. With Norway’s energy needs almost completely met by hydroelectric power, and its lion’s share of North Sea oil and gas going almost entirely to exports, almost all of the income goes to Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund. Oslo has thus had the luxury of pursuing a zero-emission campaign, and appears likely to achieve that goal by 2025. The city is applying the goal with particular efficiency to transportation, and electric vehicle charging stations are plentiful. The plan is to make Oslo the most electric vehicle-friendly city in the world – one in four new cars sold in Norway are electric – and a champion of green housing and architecture: its new opera house is set in a neighbourhood that gleams with green infrastructure. Asia also has exemplary green-leaning cities, including Hong Kong and Seoul. The greater Seoul region has a population of almost 25 million, and in 2015 it was ranked the continent’s most sustainable city. Seoul has made a massive investment in electric-powered buses. It already has the world’s third largest subway system, but its carbon fuel bus fleet of 120,000 vehicles has been a massive source of pollution. Current plans are to convert half this fleet to electric by 2020, which would be the world’s most ambitious achievement of this kind. Such approaches can be undertaken to great effect one city at a time, but they are also mutually reinforcing: networks of collaborating cities can amplify their global impact. They can also make it more difficult for courts or governments to oppose environmental initiatives, standing firm on common approaches to sustainability and decarbonisation. The challenge facing cities and citizens is to summon the necessary political will to do the things we know how to do – but have not done – and then to do them democratically. That will not be easy because democracy is in trouble, because moneyed interests and global oligarchies are corrupting government. But the fate of the campaign against climate change and other existential threats depends on democratic politics within and among cities. Cities are the coolest political institutions on Earth. The odds are two to one or better that you live in a town or city, and not just for economic reasons. Spend a few days in Singapore or Cape Town or Nashville. Witness Oslo’s Tesla taxicabs, or Seoul’s rehabilitated centre-city river or Medellín’s public cable-car system. Keen to confront global warming, but not yet fully empowered to do so, cities must not only accept their responsibility for assuring a sustainable world but assert their right to do so. There are two formidable obstacles blocking a larger role for cities: a paucity of resources and the absence of autonomy and jurisdiction. The European Union favours regions over cities, and works more on agricultural subsidies than affordable urban housing. In the United States, the structure of congressional representation means a suburban and rural minority rules over the urban majority. If cities are to get the power they need, they will have to demand the right of self-governance – as I argued in my book If Mayors Ruled the World. The Global Parliament of Mayors, an international grouping of city mayors and the “global city rights movement”, held its inaugural session in The Hague last year. Because urban citizens are the planet’s majority, their natural rights are endowed with democratic urgency. They carry the noble name of “citizen”, associated with the word “city”. But the aim is not to set urban against rural: it is to restore a more judicious balance between them. Today it is cities that look forward, speaking to global common goods, while fearful nations look back. The world is getting too hot. Science makes it clear that sustainability is both necessary and possible. Politics shows it is achievable. Cities are poised to make it happen. • Benjamin Barber, who died last month, is the author of Cool Cities: Urban Sovereignty and the Fix for Global Warming. This article is an edited extract from that book"
"After receiving misinformation from the anti-vaccine movement, including its founder Andrew Wakefield, immunization rates plummeted in a community of Somali immigrants in Minnesota, causing a measles outbreak among their children. It’s a disturbing trend on the rise in America that shows the importance of immunization and the dangerous power of misinformation. A new paper published in PLOS One by John Cook, Stephan Lewandowsky, and Ullrich Ecker tests the power of inoculation; not against disease, but against the sort of misinformation that created the conditions leading to Minnesota measles outbreak. Inoculation theory suggests that exposing people to the tricks used to spread misinformation can equip them with the tools to recognize and reject such bogus claims.  The study focused specifically on misinformation about climate change. The scientists wanted to determine if inoculation could boost peoples’ resistance to false balance in the media, and efforts to cast doubt on the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. The two issues are connected – in climate stories, journalists will often present arguments by climate scientists and climate deniers with equal weight, creating the perception of a 50/50 split when in reality, 97% of experts are on one side, as elegantly illustrated by John Oliver in this clip with over 7 million views from his HBO program Last Week Tonight : In one experiment, before showing people a media story with this sort of climate false balance, the study authors first provided a group with information about the 97% expert consensus, and delivered an “inoculation” explaining the misleading effects of false balance media coverage. They found that in the group that was only exposed to the false balance story, average perceived consensus, acceptance of human-caused global warming, trust in climate scientists, and support for climate policy all fell. When subjects were first inoculated against false balance and told about the expert consensus, these factors instead all increased. The authors concluded: In sum, the effect of false-balance media coverage had the greatest effect on perceived consensus among the various climate attitudes measured. However, a consensus message presented with the false-balance message was effective in increasing perceived consensus, thus neutralizing the negative influence of the misinformation. In addition, we found that an inoculation message was effective in neutralizing the effect of misinformation on perceived consensus. In a second experiment, they exposed participants to consensus misinformation via the infamous Oregon Petition, explained in the video below, and again inoculated one group against the misinformation The inoculation this time consisted of a mixture of text and a figure of a tobacco ad with the text “20,679 Physicians say ‘Luckies are less irritating’” to show participants a similar previous example of the fake experts technique employed in the Oregon Petition.  As in the first experiment, exposure to only the misinformation decreased participant perception of the expert consensus, acceptance of human-caused global warming, and support for climate policies. However, exposure to the inoculation offset the effects of the misinformation. I asked lead author John Cook how these findings can be implemented in the real world where misinformation about subjects like climate science and vaccines is pervasive. One of the unique elements of the inoculation we tested in our study is that we never actually mentioned the myth that we were inoculating against. Instead, we explained the general fallacy that the misinformation employed - the technique of using fake experts to cast doubt on expert agreement on a scientific topic. This tells us that explaining the techniques of denial can help people spot attempts to mislead them, hence neutralizing misinformation that uses those techniques. Arguably, the most effective way to practically implement inoculation is in the classroom. Decades of research have found that one of the most powerful ways to teach science is through misconception-based learning: teaching science by directly addressing misconceptions and misinformation about the science. Two ways we’ve put this into practice is through a Massive Open Online Course on climate science denial that uses the misconception-based-learning/inoculation approach and a college textbook that teaches climate science while debunking common climate myths.  In short, the more we explain the techniques of science denial and misinformation, the more people will become inoculated against them. When we’re exposed to examples of people using cherrypicking or fake experts or false balance to mislead the public, it becomes easier to recognize those techniques, and we’re less likely to fall for them in the future. Teaching people to recognize those techniques is a primary goal of the Denial101x free online course mentioned by Cook. When anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield was confronted with the consequences of misinforming the Somali immigrants in Minnesota, he told a Washington Post reporter “I don’t feel responsible at all.” One wonders whether we’ll be hearing those words from climate deniers in the coming years. Hopefully it won’t come to that, if we can avoid the worst consequences of human-caused climate change. Inoculating people against the techniques used by climate deniers and misinformers can help us achieve that goal."
"Environmental campaigners were given some hope that the US may stick to its commitments under the Paris climate change treaty when Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, signed a commitment to protect the Arctic and extend scientific co-operation. He was speaking at the end of a meeting of the eight-nation Arctic Council in Alaska, a consultative body dedicated to sustaining the Arctic. The members signed a document “noting the entry into force of the Paris agreement on climate change and its implementation, and reiterating the need for global action to reduce both long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants.” The representatives also state that they recognise that “activities taking place outside the Arctic region, including activities occurring in Arctic States, are the main contributors to climate change effects and pollution in the Arctic, and underlining the need for action at all levels.” Temperatures have been rising faster in the Arctic than elsewhere, revealing the acute threat to the region and leading to fears about a wider knock-on effect around the globe. There have been fears that the council, which is not a formal decision-making body, would be unable even to agree a joint declaration. Donald Trump, in his presidential campaign, described climate change as a Chinese hoax, but since then there has been a huge debate raging inside the administration about whether to pull out of the Paris treaty, signed in 2015, or to lower the level of US commitments. Tillerson sought to reassure the international Arctic community, saying “we’re not going to rush” to make a decision, but that the American government would make “the right decision for the United States”. “We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view, and you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns,” Tillerson said. “The Arctic Council will continue to be an important platform as we deliberate on these issues.” There were also fears that wider geopolitical tensions will develop in the Arctic as the US, Russia and China battle for oil and gas resources likely to be opened up by the melting of icecaps and unfreezing of waters. But in their opening remarks, foreign ministers from the world’s eight circumpolar nations instead reaffirmed their commitment to keeping the world’s geopolitical tensions out of the forum’s work, which focuses on environmental issues and sustainable development. “The Arctic Council is so valuable to all of us, and very much for Canada, [because] it’s where we, the Arctic nations, can set aside issues outside the Arctic and appreciate that we have shared stewardship of this region,” said Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland. “The US-Russia initiative will make it easier to move equipment, samples and data across borders in the north and facilitate scientific collaboration and sharing.”"
"There is no upside to the Trump presidency. To be in DC – I’ve come for Saturday’s giant climate march – is to be reminded up close what all Americans have known for months: we’ve put the country in the hands of a man completely unequal to the task. A man so cluelessly over his head that he keeps telling reporters he’s in over his head.   But if you want a few grayish linings to the dark-orange cloud, you can find them. In fact, the last few days have given those of us in the climate fight a few glimmers of light.   At midweek, and quite unexpectedly, the man who invests Harvard’s billions announced at a seminar that the world’s richest and most famous educational institution had more or less divested from fossil fuels. Of course he didn’t say that explicitly since it would require backtracking on the university’s strident declaration that it would never do such a thing. But close enough – Harvard had “paused” investing in fossil fuels, and was unlikely “ever” to resume.   Credit a remarkable campaign. Harvard students – like those at so many other places, including Penn and Cal where campaigners are currently sitting in –waged a relentless fight, even as officials told them no over and over again. Great credit is due them, and the alumni and faculty they enlisted. Leaders like Chloe Maxmin, who I met while she was still in high school, spent their entire college years on the fight, showing what persistence looks like.  But they were aided, I think, by Trump’s unlikely victory. In the past, plenty of players could look for someone else to pass the buck to: surely dealing with climate change was the government’s responsibility, not Harvard’s? That was always a moral lapse, but in the Trump era it’s completely absurd. We’re ruled by a man who thinks global warming is a hoax manufactured by the Chinese – clearly the rest of us are going to have to step up.  And that rest of us includes Democratic politicians, too many of whom have tried to straddle the climate issue in the past. Barack Obama, remember, spent his years in office championing an “all of the above” energy policy that saw America vault past Russia and Saudi Arabia as the biggest hydrocarbon producer on the planet. But Trump throws such temporizing into sharper relief.  That’s why Oregon senator Jeff Merkley and Bernie Sanders felt empowered Thursday to introduce legislation that, for the very first time, draws the line where it should be. Their bill demands that America move to 100% renewable energy. Not some solar panels but also some frack wells, not some windmills but also some new pipelines. 100%.  That bill’s not going to pass anytime soon, obviously, but it is going to become the new bottom line for any serious progressive politician. Whoever leads the fight to replace Trump is going to have to do it on a platform of 100% renewable energy –and in contrast to Trump’s craziness on the issue, it will look statesmanlike instead of aspirational.  If the capitulation of some parts of the establishment, and the invigoration of some progressive leaders, count as two small positives, there’s also a third: the unleashing of the full energy of lots and lots of people who have had to speak more softly in the past. One of the strongest voices at the ceremony launching the Merkley/Sanders bill, for instance, came from Mustafa Ali, who for many years ran the environmental justice program at EPA.  The environmental justice program probably won’t exist much longer – the Trump EPA budget zeroes it out, which tells you all you need to know. Ali resigned – and immediately joined the staff of the HipHop Caucus, one of the most vibrant and dynamic climate justice campaigns on this particular planet.  In his first few weeks, Ali spoke powerfully – but with a bit of the habitual reserve of the bureaucrat. By yesterday he was sounding a lot like the Rev Lennox Yearwood, the charismatic founder of the caucus: he had US senators, fists in the air, chanting “Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop.”  Which is pretty much what all of us who will march tomorrow are saying. We’re under no illusions: Trump is the worst thing that could have happened to the planet. It’s possible the damage he’ll do will be eternal – we’re clearly on the edge of breaking the planet’s climate system. But we will fight on, looking for the holes in the Death Star. And finding some.

"People don’t talk about how global warming has stopped, paused or slowed down all that much any more – three consecutive hottest years on record will tend to do that to a flaky meme. But there was a time a few years ago when you couldn’t open your news feed without being told global warming had stopped by some conservative columnist, climate science denier or one of those people who spend their waking hours writing comments on stories like this.   The issue at hand was one of the multiple measurements used by scientists to monitor the state of the planet – the globally averaged temperature. Depending on which particular set of data you looked at, and how you calculated trends, there was an argument that temperature rises had slowed over a period of about 15 years. When deniers and contrarians talked about this “slowdown” the implication was that somehow, the laws of physics had suddenly changed and loading the atmosphere with CO2 might not be a problem any more.  As I argued three years ago, this global warming pause was never really a thing.  Despite all the other indicators of global warming showing business as usual – sea-level rise, temperature extremes, glacier melt, species movements, ocean heating, permafrost melt – the unhealthy fixation on one aspect, the average temperature of the globe, stuck firm.  But scientists reacted to the public commentary in the only way they know how. They started to study this “pause” to find out what might be going on. They published scores and scores of papers in academic journals.  This, in turn, fed a narrative that in the public eye that the fundamentals of human-caused climate change were in doubt when, in fact, none of the credible studies found this to be the case.  Some argued the pause did not exist at all, others looked at the role of the oceans, the trade winds, greenhouse gases, volcanic eruptions or even the way ship thermometers recorded the water temperatures (and then how scientists accounted for the different methods).  But many scientists agreed too that the wobble in the temperature was well within the bounds of what’s called “decadal variability” – the natural ups and downs in the climate system that are superimposed on top of the warming caused by burning fossil fuels.  As the contrarian talking point went, the existence of different studies coming to different conclusions was proof enough that policy makers should wait rather than act.  In one paper that appeared in the journal Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, three researchers argued that the scientific community had unwittingly been distracted by the claims of global warming contrarians. Now a new study in the leading journal Nature has tried to reconcile the differences between the various pause studies and make suggestions about what went wrong.  There was not a clear and agreed definition of what a pause was and if it was consequential. Scientists didn’t always communicate nuances clearly. “In a time coinciding with high-level political negotiations on preventing climate change,” write the authors from Switzerland’s Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science, “sceptical media and politicians were using the apparent lack of warming to downplay the importance of climate change. It is easy to paint a controversial picture, but as often the devil is in the detail.”  Just to be clear, this is was never about whether or not the threat from global warming caused by burning fossil fuels was in doubt for a while a few years ago. It wasn’t.  Indeed, the Nature paper concludes that out of all the studies, the community is “more confident than ever” that human activity is now dominating the warming of the planet.  But I’ve asked several leading climate scientists for their take.  Dr James Risbey, a senior research scientist at CSIRO who has co-written an accompanying commentary in Nature, told me: “It never hurts to go back and see how we did.” But he said: “A short-term trend was too blunt an instrument to speak directly to our confidence in climate change anyway, but its overall relevance is that it helped us to explain the bumps along the way.”  The Penn State University climate scientist Prof Michael Mann (he of the hockey stick graph) expected the Nature paper would gain attention because of the high profile of the journal and that it was talking about the “faux pause”. But in an email he wrote there were no real “bombshell” findings in the Nature paper.  “The work of many groups, including our own, has shown that [climate] models and observations are consistent in terms of long-term warming, and that this warming – and recent extreme warmth – can only be explained by human activity, namely the burning of fossil fuels,” he said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said: “I think the main lesson to be learnt from this discussion, by scientists, the media and the public alike, is to be highly sceptical of narratives pushed by so-called climate sceptics.”  Rahmstorf was a co-author on a paper in the journal Environmental Research Letters in April which found neither the claimed “pause” nor the recent spikes in global temperature were outside the bounds of how the climate should be expected to react when it is loaded with extra greenhouse gases. He added: “Global temperature is a noisy data set due to natural short-term variability, and the debate was all about the noise and not about any meaningful change in the global warming signal. Let me add that understanding the precise nature of this short-term variability is of course a very interesting science question, and work done on the so-called ‘hiatus’ has certainly improved our understanding of that a lot. “Incidentally, when in the journal Science in 2007 we pointed to the exceptionally large warming trend of the preceding 16 years, which was at the upper end of the [climate] model range, nobody cared, because there is no powerful lobby trying to exaggerate global warming.  “And of course in our paper we named natural intrinsic variability as the most likely reason. But when a trend at the lower end of the model range occurs it suddenly became a big issue of public debate, because that was pushed by the fossil fuel climate sceptics’ lobby. There is an interesting double standard there.”  Prof Matt England, of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, is another scientist to have carried out research in response to the “hiatus” and found that a change in the strength of trade winds was also a factor in holding temperatures down.  “Yes, the post-2000 slowdown was totally real,” he said. “Just like the acceleration in surface warming between 1980 and 2000 was totally real. It’s called decadal variability, and it’s superimposed on the long-term warming trends. Studying the physical mechanisms giving rise to decadal variability is an important component of the work we do, and will continue regardless of definitions of surface warming slowdowns and accelerations.” So what to make of it all?  The short version is that global warming didn’t stop, scientists knew global temperatures would wobble around and climate scientists aren’t always the best communicators. But also, to paraphrase Stefan Rahmstorf, climate sceptics are not really sceptics at all."

"As protesters prepare for nationwide demonstrations against Donald Trump’s environmental agenda, Bernie Sanders on Thursday backed legislation that would phase out the use of fossil fuels in the US by 2050.    “Mr President, start listening to the people and the scientists, not the greed of the fossil fuel industry,” Sanders said at a rally on Capitol Hill, where he was flanked by environmental advocates and two of his Democratic colleagues, Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who authored the bill, and Ed Markey of Massachusetts. “As you all know,” the Vermont senator and former presidential candidate told the crowd, “Donald Trump is wrong about a lot of things. But there is no area where he is more wrong than on the issue of climate change.” Sanders added: “No, Mr President, climate change is not a hoax. Climate change is real.” At the event, held just outside the US Capitol, Sanders, Merkley and Markey unveiled legislation which seeks to completely phase out the use of fossil fuels through a transition to 100% clean and renewable energy by the middle of this century. But the bill, called the 100 by ’50 Act, is unlikely to be considered by a Republican-controlled Congress, where many GOP lawmakers are still unwilling to acknowledge the science behind global warming and contribution of human activity. The partisan nature of the debate was not lost on the audience, as one attendee interrupted the proceedings to ask: “Where are the Republicans?” “We’re going to have to recruit those colleagues across the aisle,” said Merkley, who ranks among the Senate’s most progressive voices. “This is not a red or a blue issue,” he said. “There is no excuse for failure. This is the biggest test facing human civilization and we have to respond and win this battle.” Demonstrators are set to gather in Washington for the People’s Climate March on Saturday, which will also mark the 100th day of the Trump administration. Similar marches are expected in major cities across the US, as part of a broader effort to oppose Trump’s efforts to roll back the climate initiatives put in place by Barack Obama. The president has signaled his intentions to tear up the landmark Paris climate agreement, forged by more than 195 nations in late 2015, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28% over a decade. Trump’s top aides, who are split on whether or not the US should remain part of the Paris accord, were scheduled to meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss the deal’s future. Trump’s chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, is a vocal proponent of pulling out immediately. Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and has already taken steps through executive action to begin the process of overturning Obama-era environmental regulations. Among them was a directive to the EPA to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, one of Obama’s signature climate policies to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. Trump also signed an executive order that aims to unravel the Obama rule designed to protect American waterways from pollution, and proposed in his budget draconian cuts to the EPA. At the rally, Markey said Trump’s actions were precisely why hundreds of thousands of people felt compelled to take to the streets. “Donald Trump [is] still saying that he’s going to issue a new executive order allowing for more oil drilling on the public lands of the United States of America,” he said, drawing jeers for the president from the crowd. “That is just completely and totally unacceptable.” "

"It doesn’t matter how many winters I endure, I am never less astounded by the arrival of spring. Suddenly, green shoots and the hint of daffodil yellow start breaking through the muddy earth. Birds sing. The air is sweet. It’s a time of renewal – one that is so desperately needed for our planet and our politics.  The Earth, our mother, is the body that feeds us, nurtures us, inspires us. In more than three months, Trump and his government have begun a process to remove as many protections for the Earth and for women as they can. They are willing to destroy the Earth and, ultimately, threaten the people she feeds and gives life to, in order to take care of their immediate desires. The long-term consequences are irrelevant in their minds.   Many of the terms for climate destruction and violence against women are interchangeable: extraction, rape, plunder, plowing, battery and excavation. But the similarities don’t end there. Many of those who don’t believe in climate change are very often the same as those who do not trust the stories and reports of women who have been harassed, battered and raped.  Even when more than 97% of climate scientists warn us of the same thing we don’t believe them. More than 10 women have come forward to accuse Donald Trump of sexual assault – allegations he has denied – and we don’t believe them. It took 58 women coming forward for the stories about Bill Cosby to be believed. And there are still some who deny it. There are parallels between the high stakes scientists face in telling the truth and the potential ruin women face in coming forward to report their stories to families and courts.  Or perhaps it is not and never was about believing scientists and women. No, it is clear that land exploiters and rapists actually do know what they are doing. Often they are strategic about it. One only has to read the early Exxon reports on what extraction would do to climate change or listen to the Access Hollywood tape with Donald Trump to hear their swagger and pride in being able to do what they do because they have the power.   Whether it is pulling back EPA regulations and railing against the Clean Air Act or the mad dash for money through extraction and pipelines such as the Dakota Access pipeline. Whether it’s defunding Planned Parenthood or cutting funding to violence against women programs or reinstating and expanding the global gag rule so that healthcare for women across the world is devastated. All in the name of preventing abortion and being pro-life when their actions and policies are murderous and destructive in every direction.  For years I have been fighting rape, battery, incest, female genital mutilation and sex trafficking. The staggering numbers of one out of three women raped and beaten on the planet have occupied my life from morning till night. But the story is even bigger, the mindset more pervasive. We can’t separate out the pieces of the story.   Humanity is struggling to determine whether we will accept living and dying in a world where 0.1% of the people reign over our Earth, our bodies, our rights in service of their own interests and profit or whether we collectively rise and fight to transform this predatory paradigm.  But this morning as I awoke to the softness and generosity of spring, it was so clear and simple. Every struggle we have – women’s liberation, racial justice, economic inequality, immigration rights, gender rights, disability rights – happens on the Earth, because of the Earth.   So that’s why I am rising on 29 April with the climate march. Let our passion and fight for our mother be the energy and trajectory that fuels us and binds us to a larger struggle to end and transform this deadly and exploitative mindset.  Let our fight for the mother bring forth a global spring. Now more than ever we need a renewal in our dedication to a world where women, and indeed, all of life, triumph over destruction and the forces of anti-life.

"Donald Trump owes his election in no small part to the support of farm country. But since entering office, almost all his actions and pronouncements have betrayed an abysmal understanding of farm and rural concerns. No surprise, then, that food and farm advocates have looked eagerly to Sonny Perdue, who was sworn in as agriculture secretary on Tuesday, to educate and temper the president on their issues. The new secretary has his work cut out for him. The president unveiled a budget blueprint last month that slashed funding for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) by 21%.  Will Perdue become the champion that the advocates hope for? He gave mixed messages about his vision during his confirmation hearing. Perdue wants to preserve the “broad tent” approach of his predecessor, such as supporting organic and locally grown and consumed food. Unfortunately, he also stated that “the jury is still out on whether humans are causing climate change”. He also indicated that he would be open to allowing school districts to formulate their own meal plans, a move that could undermine the 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, which requires schools to provide nutritious meals with more fruits and vegetables. Frozen- and junk-food companies have lobbied for loosening the regulation. Most worrisome is that it appears that, under Trump and Perdue, the USDA will double down on an industrialized, corporate food and agriculture model that is already failing most farmers and rural residents. Perdue’s Senate hearing centered on USDA programs that cater to large-scale companies producing commodity crops. The former governor said farmers and taxpayers are getting “good value” from these programs. Tell this to farmers, most of whom run small family-owned operations, who in 2017 will face a fourth consecutive year of diminished income in spite of record productivity. It shows an inconceivable lack of imagination if the nation’s top agricultural leadership is suggesting we tackle low prices by pushing production, new product development, new markets and exports. Plus, Perdue wants to establish a new undersecretary for trade. While a minority of large-scale farmers will benefit from this spent approach, we are not going to produce our way out of the current agricultural doldrums. The USDA would do better to invest in programs serving a wider swath of farmers and struggling rural communities, including those that encourage more farmers to enter rather than leave the business, help farmers produce a diverse mix of healthful foods for regional consumption, and create local jobs (the very same approach worked well for Perdue in his home state). Farmers also need programs that would curb the soil erosion and runoff that pollutes drinking water from Des Moines to Toledo and many rural communities in between. Does Perdue believe in the market economy? If so, farmers need markets to reward them for clean water and carbon sequestration. Farmers – who will be hit harder and more frequently by the catastrophic floods, droughts and pests that accompany a changing climate – need programs to help their farms become more resilient, a point reinforced by a recent bipartisan task force, that found these interrelated issues to be “among the most significant threats to food and nutrition security”. Yet the Trump administration has worked to systematically dismantle the government’s ability to tackle climate change, even suggesting it will back out of the Paris Agreement, a move opposed by the National Farmers Union. Other critical issues are also question marks. For example, when asked about his commitment to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), more commonly known as the food stamp program and the largest single expenditure in the federal farm bill that will be renewed next year, Perdue said he hoped to do it “more efficiently and more effectively than we have”. That sounds like shrinking this safety net vital for low-income families, especially those in rural communities – research shows that a larger percentage of households in rural areas receive Snap benefits than in urban areas, contrary to the stereotype. During his first 100 days in office, Trump has shown little intention of investing in rural communities. Only today, three months into his administration and the first with a secretary of agriculture, has he met with a group of farmers in a rushed photo opportunity, and signed an executive order that essentially calls for a 180-day regulatory review. His new secretary of agriculture has given every indication of catering to the farmers and agribusinesses that least need public support while neglecting the majority of farmers and rural communities. Trump may not be personally affected by his broken campaign promises – so far he has failed to replace the Affordable Care Act with something better, or to deploy his secret plan to defeat Isis in 30 days – but the rural electorate that put its faith in him will suffer the consequences. They will continue to see more polluted drinking water, depressed farm incomes, failed businesses, farmland vulnerable to floods and droughts and loss of hope. Status quo is what the farm and rural constituencies voted against, and precisely what Trump and new secretary of agriculture will all but ensure."
"A Republican move to undo limits on the emission of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, has suffered an unexpected defeat in the Senate. A bill to repeal a Department of Interior rule that reduces the venting, flaring and leaking of methane from oil and gas drilling on federal land failed by 51 votes to 49, with Republicans John McCain, Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham siding with Democrats to vote it down. The unexpected defeat is a blow to Republicans who eyed the methane rule as a priority for repeal. The rule, crafted under Barack Obama’s administration, would prevent around 180,000 tons of methane entering the atmosphere a year and save states more than $20m a year in lost royalty revenues. Methane is a short-lived but potent greenhouse gas, being about 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. About a third of US methane emissions come from oil and gas drilling, which put the industry in the sights of the Obama administration’s climate change agenda. Donald Trump has supported ditching the methane rule, which requires operators to use the latest technology to prevent leaks, and the House passed a bill to get rid of it. The Republican-controlled Senate appeared set to follow suit after senator Rob Portman of Ohio, considered a swing voter, said the rule “would have hurt our economy and cost jobs in Ohio by forcing small, independent operators to close existing wells and slowing responsible energy production on federal lands”. However, the vote has instead resulted in a surprise win for environmental groups and climate researchers, who warn that methane emissions must be curbed if the US is to avoid the worst ravages of climate change. “Methane emissions are not just a climate problem but contribute directly to poor air quality,” said Gavin Schmidt, a senior Nasa climate scientist, on Twitter. Schmidt added the vote was “good news”.  Michael Brune, executive director of the environmental group the Sierra Club, said: “Today is a victory for our public lands and for the health of families across America, and a defeat for Donald Trump, corporate polluters and their friends on Capitol Hill.  “People across the country will continue to resist and hold Congress and Trump accountable for any efforts to put the profits of polluters before the health of our families and our communities.”"
"We often forget we ourselves are animals. Perhaps this is what makes it easier to eat them, wear them and experiment on them. Some of the more hardcore carnivores will loudly claim that the taste of a bacon sandwich is worth committing any cruelty for, but most of us eat meat while averting our gaze from its source. Of course, we are not alone in eating other animals. Many other species have a meat-based diet – even some species of plant. Animals eating other animals is a critical part of the food web. But humans have twisted their natural inclination into a highly destructive, carnivorous, corporate machine.  Some people forswear meat for health reasons, and some, following in the footsteps of Leonardo da Vinci, see the killing of animals and humans in a similar light. But it starts to get more difficult to separate fact from fiction when we focus on the environmental impacts of livestock. They are a major contributor of carbon emissions, certainly, but placing the blame for climate change entirely on cattle farming is misleading. When it comes to farm animal numbers, the statistics are frightening. The world’s average stock of chickens is almost 20bn, or three per person. Cattle are the next most populous breed of farm animal at 1.4bn, with sheep and pigs not far behind at around 1bn each. And farm animals that are raised intensively require a staggering amount of animal feed and water. Soya production, mainly for animal feed, has devastated ecosystems in Latin America. All in all, livestock production occupies the vast majority of agricultural land and is the main reason why 50% of the wildlife we share our planet with has disappeared since the start of the industrial revolution. As a result there is a general consensus that eating less meat and dairy produce is one of the best ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, feed 7 billion-plus people and protect biodiversity. And the focus, up until now, has been on cattle rather than pigs and poultry. This is partly because ruminants or grass-eaters emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Cattle farms have also been responsible for large-scale destruction of important ecosystems both directly for grazing and indirectly for animal feed. The expansion of cattle farming in the Amazon, for example, has been responsible for one-eighth of all forest destruction globally in recent times. So there is no denying that cattle have caused extensive environmental damage in many parts of the world. And over-grazing of cattle, especially in drought-prone regions, has been a significant cause of soil degradation. Soil is key. Soil is the largest land-based reservoir of carbon on Earth, absorbing it from trees and vegetation as they die and decay. Losses of carbon from chemically intensive use of soils and land-use change from ploughing up grasslands and clearing forests and peatlands constitute the second-largest source of CO2 after burning fossil fuels. It’s a little-known fact that soils store four times more carbon than all trees and other life. We will not be able to feed people in the future if the soil continues to be degraded, and we are degrading soils at a faster rate than ever before. Our number one priority has to be to protect the soil, but the destruction of our soil is where the issue of meat becomes a bit less one-sided. The traditional solution to soil exhaustion is crop rotation. Without the use of crop rotations which include grass and legumes, crop production comes to depend more and more on synthetic chemicals: manufactured fertilisers – a huge source of climate emissions – and heavy use of pesticides to control weeds, pests and diseases. Turning exhausted cropland over to grass pasture can protect soils and build soil carbon, while still producing food. Small numbers of animals that eat grass and arable byproducts which we cannot eat could be good for the environment – if they are not displacing critical wildlife habitat such as forests and peatlands. Low-intensity grazing allows fallow land to remain productive, encouraging farmers to protect their soils and reducing the pressure on the land. And if you have pasture anyway, why not use it to give cattle a free lunch? So the distinction diehard carnivores need to make is not between cattle and chickens or pigs but between intensively farmed animals – which depend heavily on grain or soya and are therefore in direct competition with humans for land – and those that predominantly eat grass or, in the case of pigs, heat-treated swill from our waste food mountains. This means no industrially raised chicken and pork, as it is nearly all intensively reared indoors on animal feed. Factory farming is not only unacceptably cruel, but unsustainably inefficient. So for people who are not vegans or vegetarians, but still want to do their best for the planet, the most sustainable option is much smaller quantities of higher-quality, mainly grass-fed meat, along with less dairy, more fruit and vegetables, and less processed food. How much less meat? A lot less. Unless, that is, you can persuade all of your friends to go vegan."
"Donald Trump’s advisers have postponed another meeting on whether the US should remain in the Paris climate agreement, amid growing nervousness from businesses and other countries over a potential withdrawal. A gathering of Trump’s top advisers was set to take place on Tuesday but has been postponed due to scheduling conflicts, as the administration ponders US involvement in the international climate deal.   The unusually public internal debate over the future of the deal has shown deep divisions within Trump’s administration as to whether to ditch the pact, which was struck in 2015 when nearly 200 countries agreed to curb their greenhouse gas emissions to avoid dangerous climate change. Trump, who promised to “cancel” the agreement during the presidential election campaign, has said there will be a “big decision” on the accord ahead of a G7 meeting of countries later this month in Sicily. On Tuesday however, Sean Spicer, Trump’s spokesman, said a decision will now be made after the G7 meeting. “It’s a sign that the president wants to continue to meet with his team ... and come to a decision on what’s (in) the best interest of the United States,” Spicer said The president is reportedly leaning towards exiting the agreement, although he may still decide to downgrade US involvement rather than end it completely.  Different factions in Trump’s orbit have clashed over whether the US should pull out. Steve Bannon, Trump’s top strategist, favors withdrawal, as does Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator, who has called it a “bad business deal for this country”. Rick Perry, the energy secretary, said last month “we probably need to renegotiate” the agreement.  Meanwhile, Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, and Trump’s family members and advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, are understood to favor remaining in the deal. Ivanka Trump is set to meet separately with Pruitt on Tuesday to discuss the Paris pact and according to the Associated Press has been handed the task of reviewing US climate policy. Discussions have become somewhat bogged down in a legal debate over whether the US could downgrade its emissions reduction goals. Barack Obama’s administration set a target of a 26-28% reduction in emissions by 2025, based in 2005 levels. The Paris agreement states: “A party may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition.” Pro-exit elements in the administration have argued that this text would make it hard to cut the US’s emissions reduction target and may even be used by environmentalists to challenge Trump’s attempts to dismantle Obama’s clean power plan.   The Paris agreement is built on a series of voluntary targets set by individual governments with no penalty for failing to meet them. Obama-era officials who helped craft the UN document point out that the language specifically encourages further ambition while allowing nations to backtrack if necessary, as Japan has done in the wake of the Fukishima nuclear disaster.  “The issue of changing targets has come up during the negotiations and the answer is clearly yes – you can change them,” said a former US government official familiar with the process, who asked not to be named.  “There’s clearly an expectation that you’d change it in the higher direction but it’s not legally prohibited to change it in the other direction. This is a red herring, used to get people nervous about legal risk. People seem very focused on an imaginary risk and not the very real economic and diplomatic risk of withdrawing.”  Several countries have urged the US, the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, not to leave the Paris agreement and risk undermining it. Only two other countries – Nicaragua and war-torn Syria – are not party to the deal.  On Tuesday, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, vowed to maintain the Paris deal in a call with the French president-elect, Emmanuel Macron. According to the Chinese foreign ministry, Xi told Macron that China and France “should protect the achievements of global governance, including the Paris agreement”. Obama has also defended the agreement, telling a conference in Milan on Tuesday: “It’s important that big countries that are big emitters like the US and China ... lead the way. “The current administration has differences with my administration in terms of environmental policy,” the former president said. “The good news is the private sector has already made a determination that the future is clean energy. Those things are locked in now, into the energy sector.” Some US foreign policy experts have warned Trump that the US’s standing in the world and its position as a clean energy leader would be weakened by withdrawing, for no tangible benefit.  “Withdrawing would be harmful mostly to the reputation of the US; it would severely downgrade its leadership status in the world,” said Maria Ivanova, a global governance expert at the University of Massachusetts. “There’s no space for a vacuum, so if the US leaves the world of clean energy and energy efficiency, then that vacuum will be filled by somebody, probably China.  “Some countries would decry the US leaving while others will say: ‘Now we can pull together on this.’ Countries stepped in when the US pulled out of Kyoto and we got the Paris agreement. There shouldn’t be a place at the table for countries who say they disrespect the agreement but will stay and influence what other nations do.”  Big businesses have added their voice to the debate, with a group of more than 200 large investors this week joining calls from companies, including fossil fuel interests, to stick with the status quo. A recent letter signed by BP, Shell and Rio Tinto informed Trump that the Paris deal “expands markets for innovative clean technologies, generating jobs and economic growth”, adding that “climate change presents US companies with both business risks and business opportunities”. But dozens of conservative and free market groups are urging Trump to follow through with his promise to exit the deal, claiming it wages “regulatory warfare” against America. “The Paris climate treaty is an all-pain-for-no-gain agreement that will produce no measurable climate benefits and exacerbate energy poverty around the globe,” said Myron Ebell, former head of Trump’s EPA transition team and a director at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.  The American public is largely supportive of the deal, according to polling conducted by Yale University. Nearly seven in 10 registered voters say the US should stay involved in the climate pact, with just 13% wanting an exit. A slim majority of Republican voters want to remain.  The world’s average temperature has increased by around 1C since mass industrialization, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record all occurring since 2000. The Earth hasn’t experienced carbon dioxide levels as high as they are now for at least 3m years, when the sea level was about 80ft higher than it is today.   Scientists have warned that countries face a shrinking window of time in which to cut heat-trapping emissions to avoid further warming beyond 2C that would cause severe sea level rise, heatwaves, spread of disease and the potential mass displacement of people. "
"People in the US and beyond concerned about climate change may be alarmed at the Trump administration’s policies and attitudes – but there are plenty of businesses and innovators doing work at various scales.  From solar to fake meat and low-carbon concrete, Oliver Milman explores some of the best examples of climate change-tackling innovations and innovators.  Large-scale solar is a booming industry in the US, with the sector now employing twice the number of people involved with coal mining. But the decarbonization of America’s energy system is happening at a more local level, too.  There are 25 states with at least one community solar project online, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, and 2016 was a bumper year, with 218 MW added.   “It’s picking up speed, and there’s a lot in the pipeline, so it’ll be a mainstream driver of solar in the future,” said Alex Hobson, a spokeswoman for the association. “There is room to grow and there’s a lot of interest from people who never thought about solar, such as those renting or who are moving out of their buildings in the near future.”  Community solar works by allowing several people, such as those in a building with several apartments, to derive energy from a solar project installed on their building or elsewhere. Some utilities provide customers the ability to purchase the renewable energy from a shared facility, while in other cases groups of people band together to take advantage of state and federal incentives to make the investment themselves. California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Minnesota are currently leading the way.  Agricultural activities currently contribute about 10% of America’s total greenhouse gas emissions each year, largely due to the methane expelled by cattle.  Americans are eating less beef than they did a decade ago, but further reductions would be handy if the US is to reduce its emissions to levels that would help avoid dangerous climate change. A raft of new meatless meat options have been made available for those who are reluctant about going vegetarian but can’t quite stomach the impact of meat production.  The Impossible Burger, a fake meat offering, has gained plenty of headlines due to the fact it “bleeds” much like the real thing. The $12 burger, backed by investors including Bill Gates and Google, has confused some diners but it’s hoped it will help make people cut down on beef, saving land, water and emissions in the process. There is plenty of competition, too, from brands such as Beyond Meat, Gardein and the venerable Tofurky.  Worldwide use of concrete is soaring, largely due to a building boom in China and, to a lesser extent, India. In fact, China has used more cement since 2011 than the US did during the entire 20th century.  The greenhouse gas emissions in its production are significant, prompting researchers to come up with a greener alternative. In February, Rutgers University’s Richard Riman announced a new technology that can make a variety of materials, including concrete. Combined with cement, the product can reduce the carbon footprint of cement and concrete by up to 70%, according to the university. “I looked at how shellfish make ceramics at low-temperature, like carbonate crystals, and then looked at what people can do with water to make landing strips in Alaska, and I said we should be able to do this with ceramics, but use a low-temperature chemical process that involves water,” Riman said. “When you can develop technologies that are safe and easy to use, it’s a game-changer.” A technology company called WISErg has developed a product called the Harvester, which transforms food waste into fertilizer than can be applied to lawns. The product, launched in 2014, has helped the company get more than $30m in investment.  In the same area, a startup in Connecticut is working on replacing gasoline-run mowers with a solar-charged alternative that, for each lawn, saves emissions equivalent to those of a car on the road for 12,000 miles.  Wind currently supplies around 5% of America’s electricity but the sector is on the up thanks to the introduction of offshore wind farms.  In December, the first US offshore wind turbines started turning near a small island off the coast of Rhode Island. The Block Island wind farm is small – capable of powering about 17,000 homes – but has opened up the way for further developments along the coast.  Donald Trump isn’t a fan – he has fought a losing battle to prevent a wind farm near one of his golf courses in Scotland – but the falling cost of turbines is making offshore wind more competitive. Maryland is currently mulling two different proposals for offshore wind which would dwarf the Block Island development.  Electric vehicle sales jumped 70% in 2016, following a disappointing previous year, with more than 30 different models on sale by the end of the year. Tesla, Chevrolet, Nissan and Ford lead the way, with more than half of sales occurring in California, which mandates a certain slice of auto sales must be electric.  Continued growth could depend on whether a federal tax credit is extended but the electric vehicle market is maturing from a niche oddity to a competitive international field. The Chinese government is calling on auto manufacturers to sell more electric vehicles to improve air quality, with Ford announcing it will electrify 70% of the vehicles sold in the country by 2025. There’s still a long way to go – many drivers still worry about the availability of recharging stations – but this is yet another clean energy market that America could lead in.  Even the sober assessment of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) leaves much to guesswork when it comes to meeting emissions reduction goals. If the world is to avoid 2C or more of warming, as-yet undeveloped technology will need to be used to extract carbon dioxide from the air at some point, due to the patchy progress in cutting emissions.  One desperate intervention could be solar engineering, which is being studied by a team led by David Keith at Harvard University. The researchers are looking at how chemical compounds, such as limestone dust, can be dispersed in the atmosphere, thereby scattering sunlight and sparing an area below from its heat.   How this can be achieved, and whether it is even desirable to do so, is an ongoing debate. But if we continue to cook our planet, then governments may have to turn to the likes of Keith to help avert the worst."
"Ikea has bought forest in Romania and the Baltics, wind farms in Poland and now it is investing in a plastic recycling plant in the Netherlands. For the Swedish furniture giant, extending control across its supply chain in this way could help it become more sustainable by avoiding environmentally damaging activities like illegal deforestation and plastic waste. Ikea is not alone in this strategy.  Apple, for example, has invested in forest in the US to increase the supply of sustainable pulp and paper goods that it needs for packaging. Google and Amazon, meanwhile, are two of a number of big companies that have bought renewable energy, in part to protect themselves against variable electricity prices. The latest Ikea move saw it acquire a 15% minority stake in Dutch plastic recycling plant Morssinkhof Rymoplast, spending some of the €3bn (£2.54bn) the company has allocated to sustainability investments. Plastic production accounts for 6% of global oil consumption (pdf), a figure expected to grow to 20% by 2050 on current trajectory. With increasing consumer awareness around plastic waste, Ikea’s investment in Morssinkhof Rymoplast builds on the company’s goal (pdf) to make its plastic products (representing around 40% of its total plastic use) using 100% recyclable and/or recycled materials by August 2020. Pia Heidenmark Cook, Ikea’s acting chief sustainability officer, says the investment is intended to help Morssinkhof Rymoplast develop its capabilities. The Dutch company currently has facilities across the Netherlands and the capacity to produce more than 220,000 tons of high grade recycled materials a year. “It is our first investment with the recycling industry […] so at this point, it’s really a learning experience to understand more about what is needed for getting high quality plastic that can be fed into our products,” says Cook. Jakob Rehme, professor of industrial economics at Sweden’s Linköping University, suggests that such investments can be a logical preemptive step for a company whose demand for materials is so significant. “This [demand] means they often need to tackle the sourcing strategy that could lead to a resource scarcity – of recycled plastics for instance,” says Rehme. If and when regulation gets tougher and producers are required to have a percentage of recycled plastic in new products, an investment in recycling will help Ikea secure what could become a highly sought after material. “We’ve seen this trend in a number of business sectors,” says Dexter Galvin, head of supply chain at CDP. “Climate change and resource scarcity present global supply chains with significant risk […] some businesses respond with a broader global sourcing model but many are pursuing vertical integration [where a business expands its operations in the supply chain].” For some, however, there are concerns around the motivations and consequences of businesses expanding in this way. Rehme says, for example, that a significant driving force behind the food and drink industry’s investments in recycling has been to avoid regulation and shape a voluntary system instead. He warns that while large company involvement can potentially be a force of good, they can also end up dominating an entire supply chain and hurting SMEs or companies from developing nations. For Donna Marshall, associate professor at University College Dublin, it can also be about greenwash. In the absence of demonstrating real progress when it comes to reducing environmental impact, she says, providing innovative sustainable suppliers with support is “great PR for a company”. Ikea disputes such criticism of its latest investment. “Our approach to the circular economy is not to buy up recycling companies,” says Cook. “It’s one element to learn more and better understand upcycling, but it’s not the prime strategy.” With Ikea’s plans to open its first store in Hyderabad, India, next year, and ambitions to hit €50bn (£42.29bn) revenue by 2020, Cook says the circular economy is integral to expanding without using further raw virgin materials.

"Hundreds of global protest marches in the name of science kicked off in Australia and New Zealand on Saturday, ahead of large crowds expected across the US. Tens of thousands of scientists are this weekend rallying around the world in a rebuke of Donald Trump’s dismissal of climate science and attempts to cut large areas of scientific research. More than 600 marches, largely concentrated in the US, Europe, South America and Australia, began amid warnings from organisers that science is “under attack” from the Trump administration. Placards demanded “science not silence”, declared “there is no plan b”, and offered support from “florists for research-based legislation”, showing the crowd was not restricted to those in scientific community.  Chants asked what people wanted? “Science”, the marches bellowed. When? “Following peer review.” Wellington in New Zealand, was one of the first marches to start, with protesters gathering on the waterfront and waving signs calling for action. Similar crowds gathered in Auckland. New Zealand is off in #marchforscience @ScienceMarch_NZ pic.twitter.com/1PWdGeeAto In Sydney, hundreds gathered at Martin Place in the centre of the city and walked to Hyde Park. Speakers included Dr Angela Maharaj, lecturer at the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre, and former Liberal party leader, Dr John Hewson, who told the crowd politicians’ ignorance of climate change was “an embarrassment beyond belief”.  Anti-tobacco campaigner Professor Simon Chapman, science writer Dr Jonica Newby, and writer and feminist Eva Cox, were also scheduled to speak.  GO CAPTAIN PLANET #marchforscience Saving our planet is the thing to do! #heisahero #hero #sciencenotsilence pic.twitter.com/FoCjXJmSyT Australian scientists and supporters flocked to 12 national events, including Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart, Adelaide, and Melbourne. “It is very important that the March for Science is a community-led march; it’s a statement that is coming from the community,” professor Stuart Khan, an organiser of the Sydney march, told the ABC. “It’s not led by the academics, it’s not led by eminent scientists because it’s not about them, it’s about the community saying: ‘This is what is important to us’.” In Melbourne, immunologist and nobel laureate Prof Peter Doherty called for a price on carbon. A preview of his speech on Friday said there were “major threats to the global culture of science” in today’s world. “Why? A clear understanding of what is happening with, for example, the atmosphere, oceans and climate creates irreconcilable problems for powerful vested interests, particularly in the fossil fuel and coastal real estate sectors.” Small crowds also gathered in Tokyo and South Korea’s second biggest city of Busan. We are here! #marchforscience pic.twitter.com/3cQ0x36TdJ Sydney #marchforscience pic.twitter.com/TqrNTVO5Aj The marches, which take place on Earth Day, come one week before the Peoples Climate March, a series of large-scale climate change events that will be more overtly political. “The March for Science and the Peoples Climate March go hand-in-hand,” said Dr Geoffrey Supran, an expert in renewable energy at Harvard University. “Because attacks on science don’t just hurt scientists, they hurt scientists’ ability to protect the people, and climate change epitomises that. When politicians cater to fossil fuel interests by denying the basic realities of climate science and pursuing anti-science climate policy, they endanger the jobs, justice, and livelihoods of ordinary people everywhere.” The global March for Science movement was not specifically directed at Trump, but he has proved to be a catalysing force, honorary national co-chair of the group, Lydia Villa-Komaroff, a molecular cellular biologist said last week. “There seems to have become this disconnect between what science is and its value to society,” she said. “Fundamental, basic science really underlies all of modern life these days. We have taken it so for granted.” In the US, the main march in Washington DC will see thousands of protesters converge on the national mall decrying attempts to slash funding for basic government research into cancer, climate change, forensics and other areas. Scientists have also been perturbed by the Trump administration’s attempts to sideline or ignore research and by repeated gaffes by key Trump appointees, such as Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt, who denied that carbon dioxide is a key driver of global warming. Ayana Johnson, a marine biologist and march organiser, said Trump’s policies have been “horrifying” but added that the hundreds of companion marches around the world showed there is a “global trend of anti-intellectualism” where politicians reject evidence-based policymaking in favour of playing to voters’ base emotions. Some scientists have criticised their colleagues for throwing themselves into the political fray by openly touting the benefits of science in front of the White House. But Bill Nye, a well-known science communicator in the US, said scientists are in a “dangerous place” and must speak out. “Science has always been political but we don’t want science to be partisan,” he told the Guardian. “Objective truths have become set aside and diminished and lawmakers are acting like a strong belief in something is as valid as careful peer review.”"
"A push from developing countries to force fossil fuel lobbyists taking part in UN climate talks to declare their conflicts of interest has won a significant battle against resistance from the world’s biggest economies including the European Union, US and Australia. The UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) has agreed to enhance “openness and transparency” for outside parties and will accept submissions from any stakeholder – which could be any person or group affected by climate change or climate change policy – on how it could do so.  “The result was pretty good – understanding that the world’s largest economic powers were adamantly opposed to anything to do with integrity or conflict of interest at all,” said Jesse Bragg from Corporate Accountability International, which has been running a campaign on the issue. Since May 2016, Ecuador and Venezuela – on behalf of the Like Minded Group of Developing Countries that represents that majority of the world’s population – had been fighting to have a conflict of interest policy introduced where groups with “observer status” must declare their conflicts. Organisations that have observer status, and can therefore attend meetings and walk the corridors of the conferences, include industry groups that represent all of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and BHP. Many of them have lobbied against policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In May 2016 at a UNFCCC meeting in Bonn, the Venezuelan delegate said the Paris agreement was an “instrument between states” and made a “moral request” that lobbyists should have to declare conflicts of interest. The move was successfully opposed by rich nations, with the US, EU, Norway and Australia leading the battle. But the issue was raised again in November at COP 22 in Marrakech and continued this month in Bonn where the Australian ambassador for the environment and lead delegate to the UNFCCC, Patrick Suckling, championed the role of fossil fuel companies in helping to craft climate change policy. “Some of the companies being alluded to as the polluters of policy, they will be, some of them, the providers of the biggest and best solutions,” Suckling said. “And you could look at some of the statements coming out of ExxonMobil and Shell recently to underline that point.” ExxonMobil famously hid their knowledge about climate change for decades and investigations have revealed they continue to fund efforts to manipulate public discussions of climate change. On Tuesday, in a closed-door meeting in Bonn, the discussion continued with the US and Australia fighting to remove any language that included the phrase “conflict of interest” or “integrity”. The Guardian understands the US delegate argued that the US and Ecuador had “divergent views” on what integrity meant. The US, New Zealand, Australia and the EU also opposed Ecuador’s moves to call for a reporting process, where stakeholders could submit their views on developing a conflict of interest policy, or on a way of improving the “integrity” of the UNFCCC’s engagement with non-party stakeholders. But on Tuesday in Bonn, Ecuador successfully negotiated an agreement that committed the UNFCCC to enhance the “openness, transparency and inclusiveness of the UNFCCC process” and another that called for stakeholders to submit their views on how that could be achieved. As a result, the discussion will continue in a year’s time, with the input of anyone who submits their views through the UNFCCC website. The discussions appeared to shake-up the fossil fuel lobby, with some organising side events at the Bonn meeting to defend their role at the UNFCCC. Stephen Eule, a climate analyst at the US Chamber of Commerce – a group with observer status at the UNFCCC – led one meeting where he spoke of the need to engage the coal industry; described the US commitments under the Paris agreement as “unrealistically ambitious”; and approvingly described Donald Trump’s moves to dismantle Barack Obama’s environmental regulations. Eule said the Paris agreement was “lopsided and puts the US at a competitive disadvantage”, saying he expects the Trump administration to negotiate “to get a better deal for the US”. In a piece published on a US Chamber of Commerce website, Eule defended the role the body plays in the the UNFCCC processes, saying it would continue to “look after the interests of our members and speak out on the issues that concern us”. According to a Corporate Accountability International report, the US Chamber of Commerce has received millions of dollars from ExxonMobil for “public information campaigns” and executives from Peabody Energy, ConocoPhillips, and Sempra Energy sit on its board of directors. “As longs as your business model depends on extracting and burning fossil fuels, you have no place helping to craft climate policy,” Bragg said. “Your profit incentive is going to keep you from doing the right thing. And, frankly, corporations have a duty to maximise profits – so they would be in violation of their shareholders if they were doing anything but.”"
"One of Britain’s newest arrivals inhabits a kind of ingenious microflat sadly not available to human victims of the housing crisis. Constructing secure compartments with resin inside a grass stem or beetle nest is a neat trick performed by the small-headed resin bee, a tiny insect more familiar with Mediterranean climes, which has now taken up residence in the UK. We are living in a golden era for species-hunters, if you like your species minuscule and obscure. I recently talked to David Notton, senior curator of Hymenoptera at the Natural History Museum, about the 25 stinging bees and wasps that have arrived in this country since 1978. We usually only hear scary stories about invaders such as the Asian hornet, a lethal predator of honeybees. (When a nest was discovered in Gloucestershire last year, the government quickly moved to exterminate it. We’ll find out this summer if it has succeeded or not.) But most of these new arrivals are unobtrusive, such as the 5mm-long small-headed resin bee, and positive additions. As Notton points out, bees add to our range of pollinators, enhancing diversity in wild plants and benefiting the crops and fruit upon which we depend. The European orchard bee was first spotted only a month ago – it is black and bright orange-red, and a pollinator of orchards. What’s not to love? Another new insect is the black bee-fly, an awesome fly with a comic-strip baddie’s scientific name Anthrax anthrax (Greek for “coal”), which recently revealed itself by posing on someone’s bee hotel. Most obligingly, many new arrivals take up home where we live. Notton discovered the country’s second small-headed resin bee and another newcomer, viper’s bugloss mason bee, at Greenwich peninsula ecology park in London, a brownfield site converted into a nature reserve. Rare invertebrates love brownfield sites, where concrete and poor soil create Mediterranean conditions. These places are also often conveniently located near ports, where many arrivals disembark via a container or a crate. Some new species bring disease or threaten native fauna or flora but most provide us with a thrilling spectator sport – if we’re looking closely. Climate change and human globalisation assist most travelling species but many journeys are still mysterious. My favourite newcomer is a slime-covered, basket-shaped fungus which pitched up on a lawn in the Norfolk village of Hethersett this spring. Tony Leech, chairman of the Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists’ Society, initially thought it was the New Zealand basket fungus, previously found in west London – where the spores were presumably accidentally deposited by a human arrival at Heathrow. But the newcomer turns out to be a different species – the Australian basket fungus. How this charismatic-if-potentially-stinky Antipodean reached rural England is anyone’s guess. David Cameron has acquired a faux-rustic shepherd’s hut, in which he is hoping to write. We can use this news to rant about housing inequities but to be honest I’ve fantasised about scribbling in a garden shack ever since reading Roger Deakin, the Suffolk-based nature writer. Our former prime minister has a knack for ruining my generation’s objects of desire – the Smiths, Converse, festivals. His latest act of cultural appropriation must mark peak shepherd’s hut. Will huts be like tattoos? Will the next generation survey our mess and wonder, what were they thinking?"
"It’s now “inevitable” that the contiguous United States will lose all of its glaciers within a matter of decades, according to scientists who have revealed the precipitous shrinkage of dozens of glaciers in Montana. Warming temperatures have rapidly reduced the size of 39 named glaciers in Montana since 1966, according to comparisons released by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Portland State University. Some have lost as much as 85% of their expanse over the past 50 years, with Glacier national park, site of 37 of the surveyed glaciers, set to lose all of its eponymous ice formations within the next few decades. Of the 150 glaciers that existed in the park in the late 19th century, only 26 remain. The disappearance of glaciers in Montana is part of a broader loss that will see all glaciers, defined as moving bodies of snow and ice larger than 25 acres, largely vanish from the lower 48 states of America by the mid point of the century, according to Dr Daniel Farge, lead USGS scientist. “It’s inevitable that we will lose them all over the next few decades,” Farge said. “The Colorado glaciers started melting before Montana’s and while there are larger glaciers in the Pacific north-west that will hold on longer, the number vanishing will steadily grow until none are left.” Andrew Fountain, a geologist at Portland State, added: “While the shrinkage in Montana is more severe than some other places in the US, it is in line with trends that have been happening on a global scale.” Rising temperatures – Montana is warming nearly twice as quickly as the global average – and changes in precipitation patterns are eroding away glaciers in the state and elsewhere along the Rocky mountains. Last year, scientists in Colorado found that the Arikaree glacier, which is likely more than 1,000 years old, has been thinning by around a metre (3.2ft) a year over the past decade and will vanish within 25 years. Warming winters are bringing more rain, rather than glacier-forming snow, to Montana and other states. Even when there is plenty of snow, as Montana experienced this winter, the increasing heat of spring and summer is melting it away more quickly. Spring snow melts are now occurring at least two weeks earlier than they were in the 1960s. Scientists analyzed the extent of the 39 Montanan glaciers by studying aerial and satellite imagery stretching back to 1966. The latest data, from 2015, shows that there are now just 26 glaciers larger than 25 acres. The largest, Harrison glacier, is now 410 acres – a 19% decrease over the past 50 years. Others have declined by up to 85%. Glaciers have been in this stretch of the northern Rockies for around 7,000 years and the study of tree ring data and piles of rocks left behind by shifting glaciers show there were around 150 of the ice formations in the Glacier national park area in 1850. Most have now disappeared. Farge said glaciers started to shrink from around 1910 and then entered “rapid and continual” melting from the 1970s onwards. The environmental conditions now experienced in the region are a marked departure from historical norms. “The glaciers have waxed and waned with different climate fluctuations but this is the first time they are heading for almost certain extinction,” Farge said. “This is the first time in 7,000 years they’ve experienced this temperature and precipitation. There’s no hope for them to survive. We’d need a major reversal where it would get cooler, not just stop getting warmer. There’s nothing to suggest that will happen.” Farge said the decline of the glaciers outlined in the research is probably conservative as it focuses upon the extent of the glaciers, not the volume. Thinning glacier ice may cover a reasonable area but is particularly vulnerable to further warming and melting. Last year, 2.9m people visited Glacier national park. Future tourists will be confronted by a vista devoid of glaciers, a loss that Farge said will be “poignant”. “We hope that loss contributes towards a dialogue about what to do about it,” he said. “It’s important that the data is out there and is being discussed.” According to Nasa, the world’s glaciers have lost around 400bn tons of ice per year since 1994, a decline that has impacted wildlife, increased wildfire risk in places and contributed to rapid sea level rise."
"Alaska’s soils are taking far longer to freeze over as winter approaches than in previous decades, resulting in a surge in carbon dioxide emissions that could portend a much faster rate of global warming than scientists had previously estimated, according to new research.   Measurements of carbon dioxide levels taken from aircraft, satellites and on the ground show that the amount of CO2 emitted from Alaska’s frigid northern tundra increased by 70% between 1975 and 2015, in the period between October and December each year.  Researchers said warming temperatures and thawing soils were the likely cause of the increase in CO2 at a time of year when the upper layers of soil usually start freezing over as winter sets in.   In the Arctic summer, the upper level of soil, which sits above a vast sheet of permafrost that covers much of Alaska, thaws out and decomposing organic matter starts to produce CO2. From October, colder temperatures help freeze the soil again, locking up the CO2. Alaska’s warming autumns and winters are altering this process. Whereas soils 40 years ago took about a month to completely freeze over, the process can now take three months or longer. In some places in the state, the soil is not freezing until January, particularly if there is a layer of insulating snow.  The result is a huge and continuing expulsion of CO2, a planet-warming gas, into the atmosphere. In 2013, a particularly warm year racked by wildfires in Alaska, around 40m more tons of CO2 was given out by soils than absorbed by vegetation – an amount four times larger than that emitted by the state’s use of fossil fuels. “A lot of models were predicting this thawing would happen, but not for another 50 to 100 years – we didn’t think it would happen this quickly,” said Roisin Commane, researcher at the Harvard John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and lead author of the report, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  “The timescale of this surprised many of us,” she said. “There is a lot of potential CO2 from these soils, which worries people. We’d prefer the carbon stays there.”  Commane said the large volume of CO2 released suggested some of it was coming from permafrost. Typically found a meter or so below much of Alaska, permafrost contains carbon that has been frozen for up to 40,000 years. It is being scrutinized by scientists concerned that it is starting to thaw.   It is estimated that Arctic permafrost contains roughly twice as much carbon as the Earth’s entire atmosphere. This means its disappearance would probably contribute to a severe change in the climate that would be dangerous to many species, including humans.  “Some of this CO2 has to come from permafrost thawing but we don’t know how much,” said Commane. “That is something we really want to work out.”  Data for the research was taken from Nasa analysis of CO2 from aircraft and satellites, as well as readings from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration station in Barrow, Alaska.  The Arctic is warming at around twice the rate of the rest of the world and Alaska has experienced three record warm years in a row. In 2016, the average temperature was 5.9F warmer than the long-term average. “The entire Alaska region is responding to climate change,” said Donatella Zona of San Diego State University in California, who was not affiliated with the study.  “The amount of carbon lost from Arctic ecosystems to the atmosphere in the fall has increased significantly over the past 40 years. By better capturing these cold season processes and putting previous smaller-scale measurements into a bigger context, this study will help scientists in their efforts to improve climate models and predictions of Arctic climate change.” "
"The Slims river in northern Canada gained infamy, not for its fishing or pristine waters, but for vanishing in a matter of four days in May 2016. This week we learned that it fell victim to “river piracy” – and climate change was almost certainly to blame. The river – which stretched up to 150 meters at its widest points and averaged depths around three meters – lost its water source to another nearby river during a period of intense melting affecting one of Canada’s largest glaciers. As a result, the Slims was reduced to a trickle in less than a week.   We can now add river piracy to the growing list of unexpected, dramatic and tragic consequences of human-caused climate change. Although this is the first observed case of river piracy, it likely won’t be the last.  The melting of Yukon’s massive Kaskawulsh glacier – known to the local Southern Tutchone First Nation as Tänshī – caused the drainage gradient to tip in favour of the second river, redirecting the meltwater to the Gulf of Alaska, thousands of miles from its original destination.  The science says there’s a 99.5% chance that climate change caused this dramatic transformation of the landscape. The continuing warming trend that caused the glacier to thin so extremely means the change is likely irreversible. Such a rapid transformation of the river alters more than just the physical geography and ecosystems of one of Canada’s most majestic and ecologically sensitive regions. It also affects local Indigenous communities.  Residents near Kluane Lake, which the Slims river used to feed, reported water level changes immediately after the river’s disappearance. The lake is now about three meters lower than normal, and is in jeopardy of being cut off from its own outflows — making traditional food for the Kluane people, such as trout and whitefish, much harder to find. Climate change’s extreme impacts are obvious to communities throughout the north, from documented hunting season changes and wildlife migrations to rising coastlines and drunken forests, where trees now lean into rivers as permafrost melts and land gives way.  We’ve seen images of climate change shrinking the world’s glaciers before, which is worrying, if you consider that these glaciers are like bank accounts: they store snow and ice during cool, wet weather and release water when an area needs it most, during hot, dry summers or droughts.  When nature’s thresholds are passed, everything changes. Landscapes are radically transformed in the blink of an eye. In this case, river piracy is a dramatic reminder that the consequences of climate change are often unpredictable.  It’s also proof that climate change isn’t a problem of the future. It’s happening now. We’re seeing the increasing effects of climate change every day. So, what to do about this dismal assessment? We must transition our economies quickly and decisively away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and governments must play leadership roles to make this happen.  We must move forward with a common understanding that we are embedded in the natural world, and what we do to our surroundings, we do to ourselves. I was part of the wave of hope that ushered in Justin Trudeau as Canada’s prime minister in 2015. I applauded Canada’s commitments to the Paris agreement, especially our country’s push to limit the average global temperature increase to 1.5C.  But since Paris, Prime Minister Trudeau has approved two oil pipelines and one of Canada’s largest carbon dioxide-emitting liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, virtually ensuring that Canada will not meet its own climate targets.  As the new US president works to dismantle hard-won climate initiatives south of our border, a clear and effective approach to climate change in Canada is more important than ever. Making deep reductions in carbon emissions can’t wait until 2050. Humans are the dominant force on the planet, and we’re causing unprecedented impacts. Human-caused climate change is making events like hurricanes, floods and droughts stronger and more frequent.  I believe there’s still hope. Nature has the ability to continue to shock us. If we pull back and give nature room to recover, it may surprise us. So who are the pirates? In the case of the Slims, certainly not the second river, and certainly not nature. We are the pirates, and we’re robbing ourselves. If we don’t act on climate change now, we’re stealing the prospect of a clean and healthy planet from ourselves, our children and generations to come.

"The Brexit spotlight swung last week away from the familiar cast of bankers quitting the City and coffee-shop chains worried about recruiting staff to the fate of the energy industry tasked with powering the economy when the UK leaves the EU. The loudest warnings came from MPs, peers, engineers and the industry itself over the impact that blocks to trade or freedom of movement would have on the nuclear and oil sectors. However, the UK’s departure from the union also risks damaging urgent efforts to make the continent’s energy systems greener and more efficient, an adviser to the head of the United Nations has told the Observer. Rachel Kyte, special representative on sustainable energy to UN secretary general António Guterres, said anything that hampered the global switch to lower carbon power would be regrettable. “Brexit is at best a distraction, at worst a disruption of the need to continue to drive energy productivity across the UK and Europe – of having a much less energy-intensive economy and getting more productivity from each unit of energy, of having a cleaner energy system, of having much less use of carbon-intensive fuels,” said Kyte. The former World Bank executive highlighted the increasing amount of renewable energy generation in the UK, which had led to what she branded “breakthroughs”, such as the country’s grid recently going a whole day without coal power. As Europe gets an increasing amount of power from wind, solar and hydro, Kyte said it was vital that Brexit did not harm the growing number of interconnector cables being built. “We are seeing the beginnings of a highly interconnected European market and there are benefits to the UK of being part of that, so one hopes that interconnectedness will not be affected,” she said. From the power that keeps Britain’s homes lit to the crude that keeps its cars running, here is how Brexit could affect the energy sector: At least eight cables are being laid under the sea or through the Channel Tunnel to trade power between the UK, Ireland, France, Belgium, Denmark and Norway, tripling the existing number of UK interconnectors. Billions of pounds are committed to the projects under way, and ones even further afield have been mooted, such as a cable to bring Iceland’s volcanic power to the UK. The government hopes these interconnectors will continue to operate post-Brexit, and wants more beyond those planned already. “The ambitions are to go higher,” business secretary Greg Clark recently told MPs, citing a UK-France connector approved in February as a sign that leaving the EU was not affecting investor confidence. A UK that is more reliant on the variable nature of wind and solar power would make such interconnectivity with other countries even more important, he said. Key to the future prospects for interconnectors will be whether the UK continues as a member of the EU internal energy market, in a similar fashion to Norway. Alternatives include tracking the EU regime without any formal arrangement, or striking a series of bilateral arrangements similar to those Switzerland has made with the bloc. Being outside the EU market would be worse, according to experts. Silke Goldberg, a lawyer at Herbert Smith Freehills, said: “While the UK government is supportive of interconnectors, there are some concerns among investors that the economic case for new interconnectors in the Channel may be affected if the UK is not part of the internal energy market and electricity imports are subject to trade tariffs.” Those building the cables, which are made from vast amounts of copper, appear undeterred. “As long as there is a need on both sides to do trade, there is not really a worst case I can see, as the interest is on both sides,” said Auke Lont, head of the Norwegian state grid operator Statnett, which is building the world’s longest undersea cable between the Norway and the UK. The North Sea Link interconnector is expected to mostly be used for exporting hydro power from Norway to the UK when complete in 2020, after Brexit, but will also export surplus wind power from Britain in the other direction. “The moral of the story is there is enough economic interest on both sides that it will easily withstand the fact that the UK now leaves the EU,” Lont said. The nuclear industry potentially stands to lose the most from leaving the EU. Buried in the small print of Theresa May’s Brexit bill in January was the news that Britain would quit a vital atomic power treaty: Euratom, which underpins the transport of nuclear fuel and other materials across Europe. Last week saw a flurry of warnings from the industry, MPs and peers over the consequences of that decision. The nuclear trade body raised the prospect of disruption across the industry if alternatives are not in place within two years, urging ministers to avoid a “cliff edge”. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the difficulty was not the technicalities of putting in place new cooperation agreements with nuclear states or new inspection regimes for nuclear material, but the time window imposed by the article 50 process. “It’s an extremely pressing timeframe,” he told the Observer. “We’ve already lost three months by the time the general election is factored in.” Britain quitting the treaty has also raised doubts over the future of its involvement in research and development on nuclear fusion, a cleaner form of atomic power. The Joint European Torus (JET), a fusion research project at Culham in Oxfordshire, receives £50m a year from Euratom. But the current contract runs out in 2018, halfway through Brexit talks. One way for the UK’s nuclear industry to get back on the front foot after leaving would be to focus on a new generation of mini-reactors, according to a leading engineering body. “Pushing ahead on the demonstration and commercialisation of small modular reactors would be a key way for the UK to once again become a world leader in the field,” said Jenifer Baxter, head of energy and environment at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. But delays to a government competition to develop such reactors do not bode well. The government has given no hints on whether it will retain membership of the EU’s flagship climate change regime, the Emissions Trading System. The carbon market currently costs industries such as oil, cement, and steel just under €5 per tonne of carbon they emit. The oil and gas industry are among the sectors seeking clarity on whether the UK will stay or go. Some experts think the market’s links to EU institutions may mean an exit is inevitable. “The government has not announced plans to leave the ETS, although disputes are handled by the European court of justice, which may be a red line,” said the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank. When Nick Hurd, the climate minister, was recently asked if the UK had an alternative lined up to the ETS, he said: “We’re analysing it, as you’d expect us to do.” An obvious time to leave would be before the current phase of the scheme ends in 2019. On green energy, Clark maintains no decision has been taken on whether the UK will stick to the EU’s renewable energy directive after leaving the union. But government sources have said that after Brexit the UK will probably scrap the EU target to get 15% of all energy from renewable sources by 2020. That would seem likely if the Tories win the general election. The UK has lobbied Europe in recent years in favour of carbon-cutting targets and against ones for renewables, to leave ministers free to pursue their preference to largely use new nuclear to meet climate goals, rather than wind or solar. The big post-EU concern for the UK’s ailing oil and gas industry is the prospect of new tariffs being imposed. Industry body Oil & Gas UK warned last week that a hard Brexit, falling back on World Trade Organisation rules, would see trading costs almost double from £600m a year to £1.1bn because of changing tariff rates. At best, trading costs might go down £100m if the UK can strike more favourable deals outside the UK. In a letter to Theresa May, the industry also stressed the international nature of its workforce, and called on the government to prioritise “frictionless access to markets and labour” during Brexit talks."

"BP shareholders are being urged to vote against executive pay packages this week on the grounds they are too high and not taking climate change seriously. The UK-based firm suffered a rare and humiliating shareholder rebellion last year when chief executive Bob Dudley’s £14m pay package was voted down, against the backdrop of record company losses.  Another uprising is unlikely at the AGM on Wednesday, when investors will be asked to approve the £9m salary for Dudley in 2016 – 40% lower than in 2015 – as higher oil prices pushed the company back into profit. However, for the first time in three years, shareholders will also decide on a binding new pay policy for 2017-20, which would lead to a £2.9m cut in Dudley’s maximum payout. Campaigners are encouraging investors to vote against the policy on the grounds that company strategy appears “misaligned” with the Paris climate deal’s goal of avoiding dangerous global warming.  ShareAction acknowledged BP was doing better than rival Shell on removing oil and gas volume production targets from its pay policy, but said BP’s corporate strategy was failing to adapt the firm for a lower carbon world.  The group added that a green light would lock in a pay policy at a “critical” time for addressing climate change, as 2020 is seen as the last year by which carbon emissions must peak for the world to be likely to keep temperature rises below 2C. The Church of England, which has BP in the top holdings of its £9bn funds, said it would be voting against both Dudley’s pay and the remuneration policy. “We’ve noted this year that there has been some improvement on executive remuneration. That said, it is still an extremely large award when you look at the whole package and compared to peers so we obviously remained concerned,” said Adam Matthews, head of engagement for the church commissioners. But with just 50% of shareholders needed to approve the remuneration policy, it is unlikely to be derailed. The three big proxy shareholder advisory services – Glass Lewis, ISS and IVIS – have recommended a vote in favour or have no concerns with the policy, the first time all three have been supportive for several years. Separately, the authoritative Carbon Disclosure Project placed Shell one spot above BP at four out of 10 in a new league table of how oil and gas companies have responded to investor concerns on climate change. The group called Shell’s link between remuneration and carbon emissions a “landmark”, and noted that BP had no equivalent measure. Anglo-Dutch rival Shell’s AGM, which takes place on 23 May, will also have its remuneration and climate change policies scrutinised. "

"A leading government conservative has put a question mark over Australia’s continued participation in the Paris climate agreement in the event Donald Trump decides the United States will pull out. The assistant minister for social services and multicultural affairs, Zed Seselja, one of the government’s up-and-coming conservative figures, told Sky News on Monday that “as it stands” the Turnbull government was committed to Paris agreement, but if the US quit the pact, that would change the nature of the agreement. He added Canberra was currently “doing more than our share, in my opinion”. Seselja said Australia was committed to the Paris agreement and had put forward targets. “They are strong measures: 26-28% [in greenhouse gas reductions]. So we are doing more than our share, in my opinion,” he said Monday. Asked about what would happen if Trump followed through with his campaign threat to pull out, Seselja said: “When it comes to the US’s position that is a matter for the new US administration.” The Coalition frontbencher said if America withdrew, that would change the nature of the agreement. “Obviously you wouldn’t want to speculate, but if they were to pull out obviously that would change the nature of that agreement. “But as it stands, the Australian government is committed to the Paris agreement.” Trump is believed to be close to making a decision about whether to stay the course on the Paris agreement or pull out. The president has previously promised to “cancel” the deal, but reports suggest his advisers are split over whether quitting the compact would be worth the resulting diplomatic fallout. The president has already signed a new executive order to unravel a number of Barack Obama’s regulatory measures to combat climate change, including eliminating the clean power plan, which sets limits on the amount of greenhouse gases that power plants emit. Seselja’s comments on Monday follow an earlier public warning from the chair of the Turnbull government’s backbench committee on environment and energy, fellow conservative, Craig Kelly. Kelly said Australia would need to review its participation in the Paris agreement on climate change if Trump pulled out. Asked a month ago whether a majority of his Coalition colleagues would be in favour of quitting the Paris deal in the event Trump pulled out, Kelly told Guardian Australia “it would be a close run thing”. If Trump withdraws, it would embolden conservative MPs to reopen a deeply contentious issue within Coalition ranks. The Turnbull government has been attempting to hold the line on the Paris deal, arguing once Australia makes a commitment to a global deal, it follows through. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told reporters last November, on the day the Australian government ratified the Paris accord, that Australia would stay the course. He indicated it would take the US four years to withdraw from the agreement after ratification in the event Washington resolved to quit."

"The former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has urged world leaders not to follow Donald Trump’s lead on climate change, and declared his own intention to stave off the “tragedy” that would be the collapse of the Paris climate deal.  The billionaire said in an interview there was no political motive tied to the release of his new book, Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens Can Save the Planet, which is co-authored with the Sierra Club executive director, Carl Pope. “I’m not running for office,” the 75-year-old said, who considered a 2016 presidential bid after serving three terms as mayor of New York. His new book, he said, offers a specific policy objective: to help save the Paris climate agreement, which was signed a year ago. Under the deal, the US pledged that by 2025 it would reduce its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels, which would be a reduction of about 1.6bn tons. The Trump White House is debating whether to abandon the pact, as the president promised during his campaign. This week, days before thousands of protesters around the US marched in support of scientific research, a meeting on the issue was abruptly cancelled. On Sunday, a White House official told Reuters Trump would sign several executive orders on energy this week. In March, Trump signed an executive order to roll back Obama-era climate change regulations such as the clean power plan. “This builds on previous executive actions that have cleared the way for job-creating pipelines, innovations in energy production and reduced unnecessary burden on energy producers,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Bloomberg said he believed the US would hit its Paris goals regardless of what Trump chooses to do, because of leadership at the state level and market forces at play in the private sector. “Washington won’t determine the fate of our ability to meet our Paris commitment,” he said. “And what a tragedy it would be if the failure to understand that led to an unraveling of the agreement. We hope this book will help to correct that wrong impression – and help save the Paris deal.” Bloomberg has played a prominent role in some of the fiercest US policy debates, having invested millions in an advocacy group that pushes for stronger gun control and another that promotes liberal immigration policies. In his new book, which follows what a spokeswoman described as $80m in donations to the Sierra Club, he solidifies his status as a prominent advocate of action to combat climate change. His policy repertoire aligns him with core values of the Democratic party, although he has no formal political affiliation. In the interview, Bloomberg shrugged off conservatives who condemn him as an east coast elitist. He noted that policies he helped initiate in New York City – including a smoking ban and high taxes on sugary drinks – have caught on elsewhere. “My goal has been to save and improve lives,” he said. “Some ways of doing that can be controversial at first, but end up being highly popular and successful.” In his focus on climate change, Bloomberg directs particularly aggressive language at the coal industry. “I don’t have much sympathy for industries whose products leave behind a trail of diseased and dead bodies,” he writes in his book, adding: “But for everyone’s sake, we should aim to put them out of business.” Similar language haunted Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid last year and fueled criticism from Trump and other top Republicans that Democrats were engaged in a “war on coal”. Asked about the consequences for politicians who embrace such a stance, Bloomberg offered a pragmatic approach. “The fact is coal in Appalachia is running out,” he said, criticizing a Trump campaign pledge: “Washington can’t put generations of people back to work in a dying industry.” Saying coalminers “have paid a terrible price” for their work and the decline of the industry, Bloomberg disclosed for the first time plans to donate $3m to organizations that help unemployed miners and their communities find new economic opportunities. Bloomberg Philanthropies highlights the plight of coalminers in a new film to be shown at the Tribeca film festival on Wednesday. He avoided condemning the Trump administration directly, however, largely casting the new president’s steps on climate change as irrelevant. Asked about Bloomberg’s statements, the White House declined to comment. “As it turns out, Trump’s election makes the book’s message – that the most important solutions lie outside of Washington – even more important and urgent,” Bloomberg said."
"Last November, the Guardian environment columnist Bill McKibben  made the grim prediction that the “damage from the US election would be measured in geologic time”. One hundred days and counting into Trump’s presidency, there’s little reason for optimism. The former CEO Of ExxonMobil is our secretary of state. The new head of the US Environmental Protection Agency wants to dismantle the agency. The Keystone pipeline has been revived, the clean power plan is in peril, and vast swaths of the Atlantic seaboard may be opened to offshore drilling.  At this critical moment, the Guardian has expanded its environment desk, adding three heavyweight reporters to its continent-spanning, award-winning team to bolster our coverage in the US and around the world. “The environment barely exists as a political issue in many developed countries, and there are climate change deniers in the White House,” the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, wrote in a recent email to staff announcing the appointments. “There has never been a greater need for serious and innovative environmental journalism.” In the US, we’ll continue to aggressively cover the Trump administration’s ties to the fossil fuel industry and attacks on science. We’ll tackle issues of environmental justice, and the impact of climate change and pollution on the nation’s most vulnerable communities. Just today we launched Life on the Keystone XL, a three-part series documenting our reporter’s 1,700-mile journey along the proposed pipeline route to meet the people and communities who will be affected should the construction go ahead. We’ll also explore solutions and opportunities to the climate change crisis, such as innovative technology, renewable energy and green growth. As part of the new appointments, the Guardian’s Jonathan Watts will take up the role of global environment editor in a few months’ time. Below, he shares his thoughts on why, after 21 years reporting for the Guardian from Tokyo, Beijing and Rio de Janeiro, he believes this is the most important story on the planet right now. Support the Guardian’s in-depth and investigative reporting on climate change and environment by becoming a member or making a contribution today. The environment has always been a subject close to my heart and it has become an increasing focus of my work over two decades with the Guardian. That is no doubt because the problems of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and over-consumption have become bigger and more apparent. When I started out as a cub reporter in Japan in the mid-1990s, I learned a lot collaborating with Paul Brown, then the environment correspondent, on articles about the Tokaimura nuclear accident and Kyoto climate protocol. After moving to China in 2003, I increasingly found myself writing about smog, cancer villages, species extinction and carbon emissions. The ramping up of environmental stories was not a deliberate strategy. China’s crisis was so bad that it was impossible to ignore. This made for grim news, but it also made me hopeful that it might be a fulcrum for change.  After the Olympics in 2008, I switched jobs to become Asia environment correspondent. In this post, I covered the Copenhagen Climate Conference with John Vidal and Suzanne Goldenberg; the Nagoya biodiversity conference; the Fukushima tsunami and nuclear disaster; and the rapid growth of wind and solar power in the deserts of China. For the past five years, I have been the Guardian’s Latin America correspondent, writing on a broader range of subjects but still putting a priority on environment and development, including Amazon deforestation, killings of conservation activists, the role of indigenous communities in forest protection and the disturbing frequency of forest fires, floods and other extreme weather events. So why am I going back into full-time, specialised environmental reporting? Because it is the most important story of our age. China led me to suspect that global economic growth had run into an ecological wall, which is the underlying source of stress and conflict in the world. When I moved to Latin America, I hoped to find alternative, less destructive paths of development, but there was a part of me that also felt I was running away from my own conclusions. The new post will take me back. The responsibility is huge. The timing is crucial. The Brexit referendum was a vote against globalisation. Trump is waging war on the environment. To counter these trends, the Guardian has devoted more resources to its environment coverage. I am looking forward to being a part of an expanded team, but we have a tough act to follow. Brown, Vidal, George Monbiot, Damian Carrington and other present and former colleagues have been pioneers in this field with agenda-setting coverage and comment. Trying to maintain that quality, ambition and influence – while looking for new approaches to changing situations – will be a hard but worthwhile task. As to the task that humanity faces, I think the problem and the solution are environmental. The world’s current concerns – rising nationalism, swelling migration, financial instability, worsening inequality and lack of confidence in governance systems – are to varying degrees caused by insecurity and fear about the future. Underlying that is an awareness (conscious or unconscious) that our current path of capital- and carbon-driven development is wrecking our home planet, running down resources, devastating other species and building up environmental costs that are increasingly difficult to offload on distant countries and coming generations. We have to pay a bill that has been run up over centuries and it feels as if we are broke. But that is misleading. There is still plenty left if we manage it well and share it more fairly. We need to reconsider what is important, what is worth paying for and how decisions are being made. At a national level, why are we devoting so much public money to subsidise fossil fuels that are destroying the climate? Why are most politics determined by four-, five- or six-year electoral cycles that suit the markets but not the long-term interests of voters? Why do our economic systems make it cheaper to dump plastic in the oceans than recycle? Why do the traditional beliefs of some countries encourage the slaughter of endangered animals or denial of climate science? Why are forests worth less than cropland? Why do we continue to prioritise material growth when it increasingly leads to obesity, cancer, conflict and instability? The key, I think, is to realise that, contrary to what Bill Clinton’s election strategist once maintained, it’s not “the economy, stupid!” – it is in fact the environment that is shaping everything. Which is to say that we must put our home in order before we can consider anything else. That is tough. Currently, political systems are skewed against the environment and the subject is hidden away in a media ghetto. It is a depressing page on a news website or an unpopular slot on TV channels. Most of us would prefer to pretend it didn’t exist. Yet, for me the environment is not a subject, it is the prism through which everything else must be seen. It is the basis for the economy, for science, for society, for politics. Adam Smith, Albert Einstein, Karl Marx and Mao Zedong never understood this. Nor did the founders of the great religions. They didn’t need to. They did not live in the Anthropocene. So, how to put the environment front and centre is the big challenge. Following my predecessors, I will continue to visit the frontline of humankind’s impact on the natural world – the oceans, forests, mountains, deserts, poles, science labs, conference halls and affected communities – where I will continue to bear witness and record testimonies of change. But they are just symptoms. I hope I can also work with and encourage my colleagues on other news desks to consider the environment in their coverage of politics, social change, economics, psychology, art, religion and education. Those areas, close to home, perhaps inside our heads, are where we will find the cause and the cure. It’s time to colonise the colonisers. We are all entering disconcerting new territory. Given demographic, economic and consumerist trends, the next 30 years will be difficult. But there is more than enough new knowledge and technology, as well as old philosophy and religion, to make things much better. It is all about choices and action. – Jonathan Watts, incoming global environment editor for the Guardian  Support the Guardian’s in-depth and investigative reporting on climate change and environment by becoming a member or making a contribution today."
"Most of us have wondered about the human context of past crimes against humanity: why didn’t more people intervene? How could so many pretend not to know? To be sure, crimes against humanity are not always easy to identify while they unfold. We need some time to reflect and to analyze, even when our reasoning suggests that large-scale human suffering and death are imminent. The principled condemnation of large-scale atrocity is, too often, a luxury of hindsight.  I’m a climate alarmist because there is no morally responsible way to downplay the dangers that negligent policies – expected to accelerate human-caused climate change – pose to humankind. There can be no greater crime against humanity than the foreseeable, and methodical, destruction of conditions that make human life possible. Hindsight isn’t necessary. Scientists confirm, in overwhelming consensus, the fundamental facts that make anthropogenic global warming a clear and present threat to humanity and other species. There is no amount of ideological deception capable of altering basic physics, chemistry and biology. It is ethically untenable for intelligent people to look the other way while elected officials deny reality, and our opportunity to avoid catastrophe slips away. We know that the continued acceleration of climate change will bring more droughts, rising seas, more extreme weather, longer forest fire seasons and destructive storm surges. This in turn would lead to more water stress, crop failures, poverty, starvation, warfare and ever worsening refugee crises. We know that the warming already achieved is expected to displace millions of people in low lying regions. Indeed, at our current rate of warming segments of the Middle East, Africa, and south Asia, will likely become uninhabitable for future generations. This is not a problem for the distant future. People reading this right now risk dying of impacts related to climate change. Anyone who claims global warming is not catastrophic is ill informed – or playing a disingenuous game of privilege. Such a person is probably white, male, living in an affluent nation, politically conservative, and of a relatively wealthy demographic. It is a fact that those least responsible for global warming, the global poor living in the global south, are most immediately vulnerable to climate change. This reality carries profound moral implications. Whole island nations in the southern hemisphere, such as the South Pacific’s Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Indian Ocean’s Maldives, are under threat from rising seas. Citizens of these and other low-lying regions will be, or are already being, forced to assimilate to other lands. When indigenous populations are displaced and subjected to forced assimilation by outsiders exploiting resources for their own profit it constitutes a form of cultural genocide – and history teaches that the large-scale displacement of cultural groups can raise the risk of physical genocide. Consequently, if any nation were to enact policies calculated to systematically destroy cultural lands and displace native people, as climate change will, it would rightly raise international debates over genocide. It makes no difference to populations forced off their homelands whether the resource exploitation responsible is occurring in West Virginia or Papua New Guinea. The moral, and existential, implications of human-caused climate change should by now have triggered full-scale, second world war style effort to end fossil fuel dependence and associated greenhouse gas emissions. The global community ought to have engaged in a renewable energy “arms race” years ago. Instead, we burn away time while fossil fuel interests fund negligent campaigns of disinformation and politicians stage fake debates over the science of climate change. Despite efforts to poison public discourse the world agreed to a plan, in 2015, which might give humanity a fighting chance to avoid catastrophic climate change. To undo this progress now, while time is running out and physics is managing the clock, is to risk sentencing countless people to death via extreme weather, depleted resources, and associated political instability. We know the human consequences of our policies and the casual acceptance of those consequences incriminate us morally. Pulling out of the Paris accord is not the only way that Trump’s administration can undermine our attempts to address climate change: the United States can simply make it clear that it won’t honor its political and ethical obligations under the Paris agreement.  It is hard to imagine a clearer way to signal that message than proposing to cut research funding for climate science, gutting the climate change programs of the EPA, NASA, and NOAA, halting payments to the United Nations related to climate change, backing construction of the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, and issuing an executive order undoing the United States’ clean power plan, which restricts greenhouse gas emissions at coal fired-plants. The climate policies of the Trump administration, backed by many Republican leaders, are rooted in culpable ignorance and transparent corruption. And they place us all at risk on a scale that previous crimes against humanity never have. Civility and fair mindedness do not require hospitality to policies that hasten the destruction of a livable planet. We don’t depend on hindsight to recognize the moral gravity of our current situation. We will search in vain for a better reason to depose elected officials. Every legal resource to remove such leaders is justified. We can’t pretend we don’t know the nature of what is unfolding. We are witnessing a crime against humanity – and the potential prelude to future genocide. We are the bystanders who must choose to intervene or be defined by our failure.

"This past weekend, hundreds of thousands of people in the US and around the world marched in support of science. Next weekend, the People’s Climate March will follow. Redglass Pictures and StarTalk Radio created a short film in which the brilliant scientist and communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson – though not specifically talking about the science marches – perfectly articulated the motivations behind them. For example, last weekend’s March for Science was largely a pushback against the creeping science denial among today’s political leaders, about which Dr. Tyson said: But in this, the 21st Century, when it comes time to make decisions about science, it seems to me people have lost the ability to judge what is true and what is not; what is reliable and what is not reliable; what should you believe, what should you not believe. And, when you have people who don’t know much about science standing in denial of it, and rising to power, that is a recipe for the complete dismantling of our informed democracy. The climate march is in response to so many of our political leaders using science denial to obstruct the important debate about policy solutions: So once you understand that humans are warming the planet, you can then have a political conversation about that … [policy solutions] have political answers. And every minute one is in denial, you are delaying the political solution that should have been established years ago. Mythbuster Adam Savage was interviewed on MSNBC about why he decided to speak at and participate in the March for Science in San Francisco: we live in a time where people are passing legislation like in North Carolina to not pay attention to science when making legislation about coastal water levels rising. That is absolutely ludicrous and anti-human. We need to make, as you just said, policies based on the best evidence we have available to us, and that’s why I’m marching. The marches have drawn some attention. PBS NewsHour – the only American network news program to consistently report on climate change – did a story featuring our own Geoffrey Supran: The underlying problem is that it’s been decades since we’ve known enough about the threats posed by human-caused climate change to mitigate those risks. It should be a no-brainer: we have one planet with one climate that we depend upon entirely for our survival. We are in the process of fundamentally changing its atmosphere by dumping 35 billion tons of carbon dioxide into it every year. Our only reasonable option is to curb that carbon pollution as quickly as possible before we destabilize the Earth’s climate. We seemed to finally be moving in the right direction with the Paris agreement, and now the American government is reneging on its pledges and doing everything in its power to increase carbon pollution. Members of the House Science Committee, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the President of the United States deny basic scientific findings made decades ago. The President proposed a budget that would slash funding for scientific research, he’s failed to appoint people to key scientific posts in his administration, and Republicans in the House of Representatives passed two bills to stifle science at the EPA.  It’s madness. We are risking the future of our society on the slim chance that a 3% fringe minority of climate scientists is right and 97% are wrong. It’s like playing Russian roulette, but with far worse odds. At least with Russian roulette there’s a 5-in-6 chance (83%) you’ll be fine. That’s a far sight better than the 3-in-100 (3%) gamble our leaders are taking on climate change. Worse yet, even the 3% don’t deny that humans are altering Earth’s climate, which is an inherently risky proposition. This pic.twitter.com/nFIrONH35N We’ve reached the point where scientists are taking to the streets to make it known that we’re failing to heed their warnings. That’s a step far outside the comfort zone for most scientists, but it’s the right move. Our leaders will only act on climate change if their voters demand it. Right now while voter support for climate policies is high, because of an effective misinformation campaign and continued media false balance, many view it as a low priority.  Hopefully, seeing scientists marching in the streets will raise public awareness about the urgency of the problem we’re causing so that they demand change before it’s too late."

"In the 2015 Paris climate agreement, 195 nations committed to limit global warming to two degrees above pre-industrial levels. But some, like Eelco Rohling, professor of ocean and climate change at the Australian National University’s research school of earth sciences, now argue that this target cannot be achieved unless ways to remove huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are found, and emissions are slashed. This is where negative emissions technologies come in. The term covers everything from reforestation projects to seeding the stratosphere with sulphates or fertilising the ocean with iron fillings.   It’s controversial – not least because of the chequered history of geoengineering-type projects, but also because of concerns it will grant governments and industry a licence to continue with business as usual. But many argue we no longer have a choice. “Most things are not applied yet on larger scales but we have a pretty good feeling of things that will work and we can quantify roughly how much carbon we should be able to remove from the atmosphere with them,” says Rohling.  The scale of the task is staggering, says Dr Pep Canadell, from the global carbon project at CSIRO.  “The models are basically asking for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which will be equivalent of one-quarter of all carbon emissions at present,” he says. This amounts to about 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere and disposed of each year. The least controversial method of doing this is deceptively simple: plant more trees. “We have lost a lot of density of carbon in the landscapes because of deforestation and degradation. We have depleted carbon in the soils in all the problem areas of the world,” Canadell says. “What are the opportunities to bring some of this carbon back?” Again, the scale of reforestation efforts needed to make a dent in atmospheric carbon dioxide is substantial.  “We would need as many as three Indias worth of land globally – and good quality land, not marginal land,” Canadell says. Reforestation also needs enough water, and needs to be done in such a way that it enriches the soil and ecosystems, not deplete them. The fact that so many soils are carbon-depleted by intensive agriculture offers a way to tackle two environment challenges at the same time. Biochar is a form of charcoal produced by heating plant material in the absence of oxygen. Agricultural waste, which would otherwise be a major source of greenhouse gas emissions if burnt, could instead be turned into a biochar – a process that produces more energy than it consumes – and the biochar could then be used to enrich agricultural soils with carbon. Research suggests that biochars not only boost crop yields, but could lock away carbon for several thousand years.  Another approach designed to lock away carbon while also helping depleted soils is enhanced weathering.  Olivine refers to a group of silicate minerals that react with carbon dioxide to form other compounds. Enhanced weathering aims to amplify this chemical interaction by mining huge quantities of olivine – which is widespread and relatively abundant – and pulverising it to maximise its exposure to the air, then spreading it over areas such as agricultural fields to add carbon to the soils.  Rohling believes enhanced weathering is very promising, but it does have some significant downsides.  “It’s not one of the most expensive approaches but it does require large-scale mining, which we do for everything else anyway,” he says. The mining would also consume significant amounts of energy, which reduces the efficiency of the process by up to one-third. The oceans are of particular interest for negative emissions because of their enormous capacity for carbon dioxide. One proposal is to fertilise the oceans with powdered iron or olivine. This boost in important nutrients leads to an increase in phytoplankton which, when it dies, decomposes and sinks to the seafloor, taking the carbon with it. This phenomenon occurred naturally during recent ice ages, Rohling says, when the Southern Ocean was fertilised with dust from South America and Australia. But any project that attempted to alter the biochemistry and ecology of the oceans would very quickly run foul of international conventions, and rightly so.  “The law of the sea would forbid you from dumping things that will affect the environmental chemistry or ecology, and that’s exactly what you want to do,” he says. As atmospheric carbon dioxide rises above 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time in human history, there’s even talk of direct capture of carbon dioxide, using huge versions of the atmospheric scrubbers that remove carbon dioxide from the air on board spacecraft. Canadell’s strongest bet is on carbon capture and storage, but instead of sucking it out of the air, he wants to see every facility that produces carbon dioxide equipped with technology to capture it at the release point. “Anything that can be attached to any plants that are emitting carbon, either it’s a full power plant, a bioenergy burning biomass to produce electricity or carbon capture storage that is associated to industrial processes which release carbon,” he says. The captured carbon can then be disposed of deep underground in abandoned oil and gas wells, saline aquifers, or in the kind of geology that locks it away chemically. While not strictly a negative emissions technology, he argues that as long as we continue to emit carbon dioxide, we cannot hope to remain below two degrees of warming unless we find a way to capture it.  Whatever the choice of negative emissions technology, Rohling says we are running out of time to study and implement them responsibly. He’s worried that at the first big global climate change disaster, governments will respond with a knee-jerk embracing of whatever negative emissions technologies they can, regardless of whether scientists have adequately explored the consequences. “We need to start preparing so we know what we’re talking about when we need it,” he says.

"For the first time a majority of global investor heavyweights recognise the financial risks of climate change, according to the results of a major global index rating how investors manage such risks. But despite the advances, the Asset Owner Disclosure Project chairman, John Hewson, has warned there is still an “enormous resistance” to managing climate risk.  The AODP releases its fifth global index on Wednesday, ranking the world’s largest 500 asset owners and, for the first time, the 50 largest asset managers on their performance managing financial risks associated with climate change. Asset owners and managers were scored on governance and strategy, portfolio carbon risk management and metrics and targets, and graded as leaders (A-AAA) rating), challengers (B-BBB), learners (C-CCC), bystanders (D-DDD) and laggards (X). The index found that 40% of asset owners and just 6% of asset managers were classed as laggards, meaning they had a scored zero on the measures for managing and disclosing climate risks. The report concluded that “the scales have tipped”, as 60% of asset owners are now taking some action. Of the 500 asset owners, there are now 34 leaders, 34 challengers, 44 learners and 187 bystanders, an increase in all categories since the last year compared with laggards, which fell from 246 to 201 in number. Australia and New Zealand were among the 10 best-performing countries, which were all in Oceania and Europe. Asset owners in Australia and New Zealand average B compared with an average D across Asia. Australia’s Local Government Super ranked first among asset owners in the world and First State Super ranked third, both with a triple A rating. But Hewson said there was still “enormous resistance” among Australia’s asset owners because they tend to “take a very short-term focus, and rely on short-term remuneration, so they won’t take a medium to long-term challenge on easily”. Hewson said asset owners tended to have a “herd instinct” and many people saving for retirement haven’t focused on the risk of a climate-induced financial crisis and exercised their concern through choice of fund. “The government downplaying the need to transition to renewables doesn’t help ... It’s not conducive to a serious assessment of risk, that’s for sure.” The former Australian opposition leader warned a climate change-induced financial crisis would be a “global phenomenon and is a global risk”, agreeing with the former US secretary of the treasury Hank Paulson that the risks dwarfs even the US subprime mortgage crisis that precipitated the global financial crisis. According to the AODP report, nearly one in five asset owners have staff focused on integrating climate risk into their investments, two in five (42%) incorporate climate change into their policy frameworks, and 13% of asset owners now calculate portfolio carbon emissions, up from 10%. However assessing the risk of stranded assets is still quite an advanced tool used by only 6% of the index. All three asset managers in Australia and New Zealand rated D. Macquarie, the sole Australian investment manager included in this index, rated a D. The report said this was “a cause for concern giving its impending acquisition of the UK’s Green Investment Bank” and called on it to “dramatically improve its climate credentials”. Hewson called for regulators to mandate disclosure of climate change risks, suggesting the Bloomberg taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures and other G20 processes will “inevitably” lead to such disclosure. “The solution should be disclosure first, because once [asset owners and managers] admit this is the risk they’re running, naturally they’ll want to manage it.” Hewson also praised the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority for warning in March that individual directors may be financially accountable for failing to factor in losses from climate change, commenting “that’s shaken them up a lot”. Three of Australia’s big four banks are currently reviewing their exposure to fossil fuels, including their lending practices to households and farmers, in response to climate change."
"Imagine a city street filled with two-seater electric vehicles (EVs) zipping around. A Swedish startup claims these smaller, lighter EVs could help cut congestion and toxic levels of air pollution. Uniti, which crowdfunded €1.2m (£1m) to develop the prototype of its EV, has already managed to capture the attention of Siemens. The two companies recently announced a partnership which will allow the car’s entire production process to be planned in a virtual setting before implementing it in the real world.  The ultimate goal is to produce around 50,000 cars per year in a fully automated production facility in Sweden, with the first deliveries scheduled for 2019 and expected to cost £17,500 each – a figure that is likely to limit its success. The Renault Twizy, another micro EV that costs £6,995 (excluding the monthly £45 battery hire charge), has sold 19,589 units since its launch in 2012. “Mostly they are too expensive,” says Dr Peter Harrop, chair of IDTechEx and co-author of a report on the micro EV market. “But China and Taiwan will get the price down, and others are adding innovation to make them more attractive.”  Micro EVs are much smaller and lighter than standard EVs like the Chevrolet Bolt, Tesla Model S and Nissan Leaf. Uniti, for example, weighs 400kg and comes with a 11 or 20 kWh battery.  However, standard EVs’ bigger batteries allow for longer ranges; the entry-level Tesla Model S 60, which costs from £66,500, can manage just over 200 miles between charges, compared to an estimated 93 miles for Uniti’s two-seater EV. Nevertheless, Uniti’s range is ideal for city driving, says Lewis Horne, the company’s CEO. He feels the smaller battery, compact size and carbon fibre and bio-composite body also make it more environmentally friendly than EVs that cleave to traditional car designs. “If we make electric cars in the exact same way we’ve made cars for the last hundred years – big steel frame structure, remove the combustion engine and replace it with an oversized and overpowered electric powertrain – that’s problematic,” he says.  “A 90 kWh lithium iron battery that’s used to carry around one human occupant is not sustainable.” As well as the Twizy and standard EVs, Uniti faces competition from the Sion Urban, an upcoming EV with integrated solar cells that can recharge its battery from the sun, and the Eli Zero, a two-seater micro EV with a top speed of 25 mph, which is due to launch in January 2018 for around £8,000. Eli, the startup behind the car, envisions a future where low speed personal vehicles are used for central travel within cities, and high speed autonomous car-sharing services cater for journeys over longer distances. Shaina Denny, head of marketing at Eli, says the Smart car, which launched in 1998, has helped pave the way for micro EVs. “When Smart came along, they spent millions of marketing dollars showing people that they can accept a small car, and [...] people are now a lot more open minded than they were even a few years ago.” Although Tesla has shown that it’s possible for a new company to shake up the car industry, Tim Schwanen, director of the Transport Studies Unit at the University of Oxford, believes micro EV startups like Uniti and Eli still face a tough road ahead. “The car industry [...] is a sector that has extremely high entry barriers. It’s very difficult for new entrants to gain a foothold,” he says, adding that big players like Nissan and Renault “have a whole apparatus of marketing, distribution, maintenance and expertise behind them that these new companies really lack”. That might explain why the micro EV market has already experienced at least one false start – MIT’s CityCar, selected as one of the best inventions of 2007 by Time magazine, never made it out of the prototype stage.  In the long-run, says Schwanen, “popularisation of these micro EVs will depend to a substantial degree on the role of policy”. Governments could introduce parking exemptions to encourage people to purchase one, for example, though he feels the vehicles may be better suited to car sharing schemes and private fleets than individual ownership.

"Disney, the Gap and Pepsi are being pressured to quit the US Chamber of Commerce, America’s largest lobby group, amid criticism of its big-money efforts to fight climate change legislation and promote tobacco products. A coalition of pressure groups including Action on Smoking and Health, Greenpeace, Public Citizen and the Sierra Club have written to the CEOs of the three companies asking them to stop funding the powerful business group.  In a letter to Disney’s boss, Bob Iger, the coalition points to the media company’s commitment to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2020, its support of the Paris climate agreement and its ban on depictions of smoking in theme parks and all G, PG and PG-13 movies. “Unfortunately, the US Chamber of Commerce is doing everything it can to block efforts to combat both climate change and anti-smoking laws and regulations. It opposes the Paris Agreement that you publicly support, is suing to block the implementation of the Clean Power Plan, consistently lobbies against legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and spends millions of dollars in money on elections ads urging voters to back candidates who support the fossil fuel industry and oppose efforts to combat climate change,” they write. The US Chamber of Commerce is the world’s largest business organization and represents more than 3m businesses, large and small. Under its president and CEO, Thomas Donohue, who took over the chamber in 1997, it has become a political powerhouse with global influence, although it is secretive about its membership.  Last year alone it spent $104m on lobbying, the most of any lobby group. It has used its influence to fight anti-tobacco legislation across the world. The chamber campaigned against US sanctions on Russia after its incursions into Ukraine and Donohue met Egypt’s authoritarian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, after his recent White House visit.  The activists’ campaign comes as some of the world’s largest companies have quietly severed ties with the chamber. According to an analysis by Public Citizen, at least 13 of the world’s biggest companies (Costco, eBay, Hewlett-Packard, General Mills, Kellogg, Kraft Heinz, Mars, Mattel, Mondelēz, Nestlé, Starbucks, Unilever and Walgreens Boots Alliance*) have quit the US Chamber of Commerce in recent years amid political disagreements and worries about its stance on the environment.  A number of those companies confirmed to the Guardian that they were no longer members but would not speak on the record about their reasons for leaving. Other companies did not return emails and calls for comment. A spokesman for the chamber disputed the companies that had left and their reasons for leaving but she declined to confirm which companies had stayed. “The chamber has never disclosed and does not disclose its membership and therefore I will not be able to confirm or deny who is or isn’t a member. However, I can tell you that your list is simply wrong, and it would be inaccurate for you to report that those companies have left the chamber for the reasons you mentioned in your inquiry,” Blair Latoff Holmes, vice-president of media and external communications, said. The chamber claims to be a bipartisan organisation but has become increasingly partisan. For the first time last year, 100% of its election spending backed Republican candidates. Holmes said: “Our endorsements are made by a lawmaker’s scorecard, and their views on the issues that are important to our membership and the American business community, based on economic growth and job creation. In recent years, Republicans have scored higher than Democrats on issues of importance to the business community but we have maintained a bipartisan approach to the candidates we support and have bestowed awards such as the ‘Spirit of Enterprise’ award to Republicans and Democrats alike.” The pressure group’s lobbying has already led to a number of high-profile, and public, departures. In 2015, the pharmacy giant CVS quit, citing the lobby group’s pro-tobacco work. CVS, the first major drugstore to remove tobacco products from its shelves, said it had been “surprised” by a New York Times report that the chamber lobbied foreign governments to ease restrictions on tobacco sales. In 2009, the chamber called for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to hold “the Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century” – a trial that put creationist theory up against evolutionary science – in order to discuss humanity’s role in climate change. That same year, Apple and the utility companies Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and Excelon left the chamber, citing its anti-environmental advocacy.  “We find it dismaying that the chamber neglects the indisputable fact that a decisive majority of experts have said the data on global warming are compelling and point to a threat that cannot be ignored,” the PG&E chairman and chief executive, Peter Darbee, told the chamber. Nike too has voiced criticism of the lobby group’s climate stance, saying it “fundamentally disagrees with the US Chamber of Commerce’s position on climate change”. Dan Dudis, director of chamber watch at Public Citizen, said activists would target other chamber members in the coming months. “We are looking at companies that have explicit public policy positions that run counter to the chamber’s stance.”  He said the chamber was “pushing the interests of a minority” by claiming to represent a broad swath of businesses. “Those businesses might give $500,000 or $1m for trade lobbying but money is fungible,” he said. “That cash frees up money for the chamber to lobby against climate change legislation, for tobacco and against the interests of many of its members. *Walgreens Boots Alliance has informed the Guardian that it had not been a member of the Chamber for almost a decade."
"Insects and imitation meat are the best alternatives to real meat in tackling the huge and growing environmental impact of livestock on the planet, new research has shown. The world’s appetite for meat is rising fast as incomes grow but the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, already 12% of the total, are also soaring and taming global warming will be impossible unless the trend is reversed. Rising demand is also leading to more of the world’s natural areas being converted to farmland, a key factor in the mass extinction of species currently unfolding.  Globally, twice as much land is used to raise cattle, pigs and other animals than is used to grow crops. Furthermore, a third of those crops harvested are fed back to livestock. The new research is the first systematic comparison of the environmental impact of various sources of food, and found that imitation meat and insects are vastly more efficient than raising livestock. The work, published in the journal Global Food Security, found that if half of traditional animal products were replaced by imitation meat or insects the land required to produce the world’s food would be slashed by a third. However, the researcher found that another alternative – lab-grown meat – did not show such big advantages.  Peter Alexander, at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and who led the new research, acknowledges that eating insects is a challenging idea in western nations. But more than 2,000 species of insects are eaten by people across 119 nations today, including crickets and mealworm larvae.  “It is very widespread, especially in Asia, and not seen as unusual in those cultures,” said Alexander. “We are not trying to mandate or even suggest some policy that you eat insects every day [but] our work indicates the potential benefits that are there.” The researchers also note that foods can become acceptable that were once shunned, as the tomato was in Europe for two centuries and as lobster was in the US. Imitation meat, such as tofu and textured vegetable protein, has in the past been limited in its appeal. But the area is now seeing significant innovation, with products such as the Impossible burger promising the same taste as real meat.  Alexander said it is crucial to tackle the world’s growing appetite for meat. “The developing world is eating more meat as they can afford to do so. That really is a concerning trend if it continues,” he said. “If everybody eats meat like an American does currently, then it’s going to be very difficult to sustain. With current production practices, more than the entire area of the planet would be required.” The ideal solution is a global convergence on modest meat consumption, he said: “The west needs to eat less meat – though not none, I am not in favour of global vegetarianism – while allowing other countries with relatively low meat consumption to increase theirs.” High levels of meat consumption are also known to damage people’s health, by contributing to obesity, heart disease and cancer, and a recent study showed that climate taxes on meat and milk would save 500,000 lives a year as well as cutting carbon emissions.  “Even doing everything we can to reduce the emissions associated with meat production, rising demand means livestock emissions would take us beyond the global objective of 2C,” said Rob Bailey, research director for energy, environment and resources at Chatham House. “Therefore dietary change is a precondition for avoiding catastrophic climate change.” Bailey said assessing the land requirements of different strategies was important: “Competition for land will increase in the future, so we have to find ways to feed a growing population without expanding agriculture further into forests.” He said simply eating less meat, rather than substitutes, cuts environmental impacts the most. “We shouldn’t forget that the average British person eats two to three times more meat than is good for them, so this makes sense from both an environmental and a health perspective.” But he acknowledged this may not be easy and said the production of lab-grown meat was likely to become more efficient in future. Government and campaign groups have had little appetite for tackling the overconsumption of meat, but Alexander said awareness of the issue is growing rapidly, though action is slow. “We are moving slowly in the right direction,” he said. “There is some cause for optimism but equally some cause for pessimism. It depends what side of the bed I get out of.” "

"Speaking Darwinistically, the planet should have no truck with the spodoptera genus, commonly known as armyworms. Fat, slow over the ground and unspeakably terrible looking, they should never have evolved into anything more than an entomological pilot project.  In some variants, their heads resemble human brains that have been caramelized with a blowtorch. Mandibles, jammed into the bottom of the face part, glisten with alien goo. In their most gregarious morphological variation, black and dun stripes run down their bodies, mimicking something an avid golfer would wear to a funeral. They are speckled with sparse little hairs, like the budding moustache of a teenage Lothario, while their stubby legs appear to have been distributed randomly, and without consideration for balance and mobility. Unfortunately, as it happens, armyworms do not appear fat and ugly to each other – or not, following one of nature’s great acts of mercy, when they’ve hatched into the world’s most boring looking moth. They reproduce at a staggering rate, with each female laying about 1000 eggs in a 10-day lifetime. And though they may be slow crawlers, they are strong fliers. Every year spodoptera frugiperda, or the fall armyworm, travels from Mexico to Canada, a distance of at least 3000km. But if they have a dominant evolutionary superpower, it is rapacious communalism: in their larval stage, they advance in squadrons, platoons, battalions, armies – tens of millions storming the countryside, eating every crop or garden they can get their mandibles on. Most pests will consume only the good bits, but armyworms will strip even a fully-grown maize plant down to the last leaf.  Spodoptera have proved to be a blight in North America, South America, the Middle East, the South Pacific islands, Australia – pretty much everywhere. There are five species of armyworms, but we’re concerned here with the aforementioned frugiperda which is headquartered in North and South America; and the exempta, usually based in Africa.  Spodoptera exempta – the African armyworm – specialises in cereals, and has been causing havoc on the continent for decades now, spreading out slowly from the east and in 2009 sparking a state of emergency in Liberia.  The new arrival, however, is spodoptera frugiperda, more commonly and chillingly known as ‘the fall’. This variant, which eats pretty much anything, has enjoyed a long, awful history in South America – managing it costs the Brazilian economy a staggering $600 million a year. In January 2016 it was detected for the very first time in Africa, in Nigeria. (As for how it it got there from the Americas, it either flew in on prevailing winds, or caught a plane. No one is yet sure).  By April 2016, the pest had travelled to several other West African countries and to Central Africa. By December, it was detected in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi, and was storming South Africa’s borders. Last week, Ghana’s parliament was asked by the minister of agriculture to declare a ‘state of emergency’, and take urgent action as the fall arrived en masse.  Last week, Ghana’s parliament was asked to declare a state of emergency as a plague of ​​fall armyworm arrived But why this particular plague, and why now? Is it the newish mash-up between local and invasive species that has produced such unstoppable consumption machines? Or has modern farming – in particular, modern African farming, which depends increasingly on planting vast tracts of a single staple – made it easier for them to advance? In regions stricken by climate change, and which in some parts have recently suffered (or, in some cases, is still suffering through) a once-in-a-generation drought, are armyworms not just another manifestation, albeit the most revolting, of the colossal challenges facing Africans as the world warms? At this stage, no one is really sure certain how best to answer these questions. But there is one last, and far more pressing, problem: can the armyworms be stopped before they eat Africa bare?  If there is a three-star general currently conducting the war against genus spodoptera, it must be a Lancaster University professor named Kenneth Wilson. According to his university profile, Wilson “ is fascinated by the interactions between parasites and their hosts, be they insects, birds, mammals or humans.”  He first became interested in African armyworms after studying their migration through Kenya 25 years ago. The sweetener, as far as his particular discipline was concerned, was the armyworm’s achilles’ heel: when he tried to transport live specimens back to a lab in Nairobi, he found that they would succumb to a virus, and none of them would survive the journey. There was a devastating natural loop at work here: a voracious parasite was felled, and easily so, by a voracious infectious agent. His work began to echo almost exactly the plot of HG Wells’ War of the Worlds, in which invading Martians are eventually killed off by microbial infection to which they had no immunity – “slain, after all man’s devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.” Wilson, who is currently in the field in Tanzania, remains in equal measures enthralled and terrified by these critters. “I got to wondering how armyworms could be such a devastating pest when they seemed so susceptible to this virus,” he explained over email, “and I have been studying the interaction between armyworms and their viruses ever since.” His research suggested that the obvious solution to any armyworm infestation was to replicate the virus, and employ it as a biological agent in order to eradicate the blight. But this was easier said than done, and his research was anyway focused exclusively on the African armyworm. The recent introduction of the fall into the African theatre served, according to Wilson, “as the latest twist.” And not a good twist. Given that the fall has only been in Africa since January 2016, no one is quite sure how severe the impact will be. “People are rightly scared about what’s going to happen,” Wilson told me. Making matters worse, armyworms tend to love maize, the local staple. The practice of monoculture farming – lots and lots of maize, as far as the eye can see – is a key component to any form of industrial agriculture. But it has provided the African armyworm, which specialises in cereals, with a continent-wide all-you-can-eat buffet. “For the many farmers who also grow small amounts of other crops such as beans, peas and other vegetables, their livelihoods were safeguarded to an extent by these other crops,” Wilson explained. “But the fall armyworm has a much broader host range”– translation: it’ll eat anything – “so potentially can also eat these other crops if maize is not available.”  This attack on regional food security has been compounded by an X factor: climate change. “Drought followed by lots of rain is perfect for armyworms,” said Wilson, describing exactly the kind of weather conditions that are becoming the sub-Saharan norm. And so, in dry years, African crops suffer for the obvious reasons. In non-drought years, there are still the armyworms to contend with. Southern Africa’s recent drought, vicious by any estimation, was broken by the tropical cyclone Dineo, which touched down on the coast of Mozambique mid-February. Much of the region was swamped with massive, in some cases unprecedented, amounts of rainfall. Undaunted – nay, encouraged – onward marched the armyworm. When the infestation was detected in South Africa in January, it did not come as a surprise to the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Daff), who had effectively posted wanted posters throughout the agricultural community in preparation for a first sighting. The fall armyworm was already listed as a quarantine pest for South Africa in terms of the Agricultural Pests Act 1983. After the first suspected specimens were collected on a farm in the northern province of Limpopo, Daff requested a diagnostic report from the Agricultural Research Council, Plant Protection Research Institute (Arc PPRI), which on February 3 confirmed the armyworm’s identity.  Daff had already constructed a sort of historical narrative regarding the outbreak, which squared with Kenneth Wilson’s and other expert assessments. Relying on a worst case scenario, which had been realised in other countries as the worm made its way south, Daff thus informed commodity and research organisations of a possible threat, and encouraged farmers to report suspicious pest damage.  Serendipitously, Daff had recently introduced the South African Emergency Plant Pest Response Plan, which was designed to diagnose and detect new pest infestations. Wisely, the government treated the outbreak as a crisis, and detection was just the first in what was necessarily a tiered attack. According to Makenosi Maroo, Daff’s chief director, stakeholder relations and communications, the department set up an internal joint operations centre, along with a steering committee that included “research, industry and provincial government role players”. But if African armyworms were the known known, the fall was the known unknown – there was no protocol in South African on how best to halt its progress. As ever, the fallback option was to nuke them with chemicals. But which chemicals? “As the fall armyworm is a new pest to South Africa, no pesticide was previously registered to be used against it,” said Daff minister Senzeni Zokwana, during a hastily called press conference on 6 February. “A process of emergency registration of agricultural chemicals is ongoing with two active ingredients already registered to be applied against this pest. As with all agricultural remedy applications the label instructions must be followed in accordance to the supplier’s recommendations.” It’s possible that they will spread from Africa to Southern Europe, and then on to northern Europe and possibly Asia Which was sound advice. But given that the effectiveness of the pesticide regime was still largely speculative, South Africa was due a lucky break. And the country got one due to a quirk in the harvesting schedule: the bulk of the season’s maize crop was unaffected and already drying for harvest, which meant that the armyworms were late for dinner. And there was more good news, at least as far as South Africa was concerned: the country produces most of its maize crop in areas where frost occurs, and armyworms can’t handle the cold. But in the warmer northern provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, to say nothing of the rest of the continent, this was hardly an upside worth mentioning.  Still, Hamlet Hlomendlini, a spokesperson at AgriSA, a local lobby group, seemed to feel that the crisis was not much of a crisis at all. “We don’t see it as a threat right now,” he told me. “We feel that the department of agriculture is on top of it, and it was restricted to a few isolated farms in Limpopo. It was a question of finding the right pesticides. It seems like things are under control.”  This would likely sound like an excess of sanguinity to Wilson. When I asked him how seriously African policymakers should be taking the armyworm blight, he was unambiguous. “Very.” Nothing is certain at this point, but it’s clear that the infestation is spreading rapidly, without respite. A state of emergency has just been declared in Ghana. But the real kicker is that fall and African armyworms, as Wilson puts it, “have teamed up to provide a deadly double act.” This entomological suicide squad will cost a lot of money to control, and if they aren’t kept in check, the stakes get higher. From Africa, said, Wilson, “it’s possible that they will spread to Southern Europe, with seasonal migrations into northern Europe and possibly also into Asia.” There’s some hope of nailing down an effective pesticide regimen, but that comes with its own problems – poisoning the environment, pollinators, livestock and humans not minor among them. Besides, the fall is resistant to many of the chemicals currently being deployed across the continent. With this in mind, Wilson and his collaborators have been working on a biopesticide derived from the natural disease that was killing his specimens in Kenya all those years ago.  By his own admission, this is a time-consuming and expensive pursuit. At the moment, Wilson is in Tanzania battle-testing the new weapon. “We are currently at the stage where we are asking some fundamental questions,” he told me. “Will the armyworms develop resistance to the biopesticide in the same way as insects often do against chemicals? Will the virus evolve to be less effective if we produce lots of it under field conditions? And can we make the biopesticide more effective by formulating it in a different way?” The armyworm is not waiting for Wilson and his team. And while the outbreak is apparently under control in South Africa, no other African country can match Daff’s sophistication. The Central African Republic is in the midst a long-simmering civil war; Zimbabwe is in perennial economic free-fall; and even boring Zambia is undergoing political instability. Next year, according to the experts, a drought beckons. The world’s ugliest worm thrives on exactly this kind of chaos. Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

"Transport for London is spending £18m on upgrading the capital’s power grids to charge the first generation of battery-powered black cabs. From 1 January 2018, all new black cabs will have to be battery-powered electric models by law as part of TfL’s effort to reduce toxic pollution from diesel engines.  The cash will pay for network reinforcements to enable British Gas owner Centrica and other energy companies to install 300 rapid electric-car charging stations by 2020. The charging point can top up a car’s battery within minutes, rather than the hours it takes for the city’s thousands of conventional electric vehicles. An initial 75 fast chargers are due to be operational by the end of the year. While some of the sites will be exclusively for black cabs, the network will also be open to the increasing number of owners of Teslas, Nissan Leafs and electric BMWs in London. Ben Plowden, TfL’s director of surface strategy and planning, said: “An extensive, rapid charging network is fundamental in helping drivers make the shift from fossil fuels to electric.” The cost of installing the chargers will fall on the companies that won a TfL tender: Centrica, Bluepoint London, Chargemaster, Ireland’s Electricity Supply Board and Fastned from the Netherlands. Pricing has not been announced but the main existing network in the capital, Source London, would cost a Leaf driver £10.80 to fully top up with a rapid charger, plus a £4 monthly fee. TfL said the cost to drivers would be capped for the first two years. The Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association expects the first electric black cabs on London’s roads in September.  Cabbies with an existing taxi older than 10 years will be able to claim a payment from TfL of up to £5,000 later this year towards the cost of the new zero-emission taxis, which are being built at a factory in Coventry."
"Hundreds of thousands of climate researchers, oceanographers, bird watchers and other supporters of science rallied in marches around the world on Saturday, in an attempt to bolster scientists’ increasingly precarious status with politicians.  The main March for Science event was held in Washington DC, where organizers made plans for up to 150,000 people to flock to the national mall, although somewhat fewer than that figure braved the rain to attend. Marchers held a range of signs. Some attacked Donald Trump, depicting the president as an ostrich with his head in the sand or bearing the words: “What do Trump and atoms have in common? They make up everything.” More than 600 marches took place around the world, on every continent bar Antarctica, in events that coincided with Earth Day. The marches, the first of their kind, were officially non-political. They were, however, conceived by three US-based researchers – Caroline Weinberg, Valorie Aquino and Jonathan Berman – after Trump’s inauguration. Organizers have said science is “under attack” from the Trump administration and many protesters excoriated the president with signs that likened him to a dangerous orange toxin or disparaged his now defunct university. Trump released a statement that insisted his administration was committed to preserving the “awe-inspiring beauty” of America, while protecting jobs. “Rigorous science is critical to my administration’s efforts to achieve the twin goals of economic growth and environmental protection,” Trump said. “My administration is committed to advancing scientific research that leads to a better understanding of our environment and of environmental risks.  “As we do so, we should remember that rigorous science depends not on ideology, but on a spirit of honest inquiry and robust debate.” The US marches were some of the last to take place, following hundreds across the world. A common theme among protesters was a worry that politicians have rejected science-based policies.  “I’m encouraged by the marches I’ve seen already taking place around the world,” said Rush Holt, a former congressman and head of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. “For generations scientists have been reluctant to be in the public square. There is a lot of concern.” Speakers in Washington included Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations climate chief, and climate scientist Michael Mann. Hundreds of scientific institutions, environmental groups and union groups partnered with the march.  “There’s very low morale among government scientists because science is under assault from this administration,” Mann told the Guardian. “That being said, events like this will lift the spirits of scientists. They are finding a voice.” Pharmaceutical companies, concerned about the impact on research talent of Trump’s attempts to ban or restrict travel from certain Muslim-majority countries, risked his wrath by supporting the march. In a video, Pfizer said it was “proud to stand behind our scientists”. Trump has galvanized scientists with his comments about climate change, which he has called a “hoax”, as well as questions about whether vaccines are safe and threats to cut funding to universities that displease him.  The White House’s recent budget proposal would remove around $7bn in science funding, with the National Institutes of Health, which funds medical research, bearing much of the pain. Earth sciences, ranging from weather satellites to marine research to coastal preservation, are also lined up for severe cuts. Climate change was at the heart of the March for Science, spurred on by dismissals of the issue by Trump and his top advisers. The budget director, Mick Mulvaney, has said climate research is a “waste of your money”. Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has erroneously denied that carbon dioxide is a primary driver of global warming.  Other areas of science have been all but abandoned. The president has yet to nominate administrators for Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, nor to appoint his own science adviser.  John Holdren, science adviser during Barack Obama’s presidency, said Trump had “shown no indication of awareness of the role of science and the role of science in government”. “Scientists are understanding that they have to become activists, that they have to speak up, that they have to be heard,” he said. “The message isn’t, ‘Please save our jobs.’ Scientists would be in another line of work if they were just interested in their salaries. If funding for science is slashed, all of society will lose out.” The march has proved controversial within the science community, which is typically reluctant to be overtly political. Some scientists have raised concerns that the marches will invite attacks by Trump and his supporters, or will fail to convince the public that science has inherent value. But several famous voices have joined the cause. “Science has always been political but we don’t want science to be partisan,” Bill Nye, a prominent engineer and TV personality, told the Guardian.  “Objective truths have become set aside and diminished and lawmakers are acting like a strong belief in something is as valid as careful peer review.” Nye said science was in a “dangerous place” but hoped the march would help nudge Trump to a more amenable position. “The president changes his mind quite frequently,” he said. “We want to influence the people who influence him. That’s our goal for the march.”  Leland Melvin, a former Nasa astronaut who participated in two missions, criticized the administration’s plans to eliminate Nasa’s education budget.  “Doing that would keep people like me from getting a master’s or PhD,” he said. “If we want brown people and women getting these degrees and get them involved in science, we have to fund it. The administration needs to get its head out of the sand.” Cristian Samper, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society, said the march aimed “to celebrate science, not to politicize it”. “Science is behind the good news and bad news about wildlife conservation ,” he said. “it has nothing to do with the fake news. Science is the antithesis of fake news.” The marches came one week before the People’s Climate March, a series of large-scale events focused on climate change that will be more overtly political.  “Attacks on science don’t just hurt scientists, they hurt scientists’ ability to protect the people, and climate change epitomizes that,” said Dr Geoffrey Supran, an expert in renewable energy at Harvard University. “When politicians cater to fossil fuel interests by denying the basic realities of climate science and pursuing anti-science climate policy, they endanger the jobs, justice, and livelihoods of ordinary people everywhere.”"

"“Like a drop of water in a bucket, on its own is small, but if there are many, many drops, soon it is overflowing.” Erietera Aram’s water analogy is apposite. His country faces being lost under the waves of the Pacific Ocean.  The i-Kiribati man is in Australia delivering his message about the reality of climate change in his country, and of its immediacy. Each discussion, he says, is like a drop of water, adding to the one before it, slowly building understanding of the existential threat to his people and place. “Climate change is not something off in the future, it’s not a problem for later. We are living it now,” he says. The archipelago of Kiribati – 33 tiny coral atolls spanning 3.5m square kilometres of ocean – is the world’s lowest-lying country, with an average height above sea level of just two metres. Most of the 113,000 i-Kiribati live crammed on to Tarawa, the administrative centre, a chain of islets that curve in a horseshoe shape around a lagoon. “My place is very small,” Aram says. “If you stand in the middle, you can see water on both sides. We are vulnerable. One tsunami, one tsunami and our whole country will disappear.” Already, there is less and less of Kiribati for its inhabitants. The coastline is regularly being lost to king tides and to creeping sea levels, and in a very real sense, there is nowhere to go. The loss of land is causing conflict – Tarawa is growing ever more densely crowded, as families living on the coastline are forced inwards, infringing on another’s claim. The next round of multinational climate talks in November – COP 23 – will be chaired by Fiji, and is expected to swing particular focus of the global climate debate to the Pacific, where comparatively minuscule amounts of carbon are produced, but the effects of climate change have been felt first, and most acutely. Assuming the COP presidency, the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, said he would “bring a particular perspective to these negotiations on behalf of some of those who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change – Pacific Islanders and the residents of other small island developing states and low-lying areas of the world”. But the islands’ fight to be saved was everybody’s, Bainimarama said. “Our concerns are the concerns of the entire world, given the scale of this crisis.” Aram and compatriots from Kiribati and fellow low-lying islanders from Tuvalu are travelling with the Edmund Rice Centre, a social justice group, across Australia. They have met politicians, unions, coalminers, and officials from the CSIRO and power stations “and we think they have heard our stories, they understand how serious this is”. Recent reports from groups as disparate as the World Bank, the Menzies Research Centre and the Lowy Institute have suggested allowing open-access migration from Pacific Islands to Australia as a more effective economic stimulus than aid, and as a strategy for coping with the impacts of climate change, which are already beginning to see islands across the Pacific lost to the sea. In April, the former US deputy undersecretary of defence Sherri Goodman visited Australia, and said the Pacific was “right in disaster alley” and the region would be “on the frontlines” of widespread forced migration caused by climate. The issue of a mass migration is a contentious one for the Pacific Islands facing annihilation under the waves. Many islanders are resistant, but understand it may be inevitable. “We don’t want to leave our country,” Aram says. “We love our land, and it doesn’t have the same meaning to be living somewhere else. We don’t want to be migrants of climate, but if there is no change our country will disappear into the sea.” It feels terrible, he says, to worry about one’s country’s very existence. “What will happen to my children’s country, that’s why I worry. What am I leaving behind? We are the voice of the children of these vulnerable countries.” Aso Ioapo from Tuvalu says “migration is the last option of the Tuvaluan people”. “Our history and our culture are very important to us, and we believe that this is the place we are supposed to be. We don’t want to lose that, we don’t want to lose who we are.” Tuvalu has had an increasing number of cyclones, of greater intensity, over recent years. In 2015, Cyclone Pam sent massive waves washing over some entire islands. About 45% of the country’s 10,000 population was displaced, the government said. “The cyclones are occurring more regularly, and they are more powerful now,” Ioapo said. “We have to face that we might have to go to another place. That is hard. But migration is the last option. We want to save our countries.”"
"The Industrial Revolution left a deep mark on our world. Its dawning saw the start of the widespread burning of coal for factories and steam engines and, as a result, the beginning of significant outputs of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Our climate is now warming noticeably as these emissions have accumulated across the planet. The British landscape has also been changed dramatically. In particular, the countryside is now peppered with piles of slag left over from old steel mills. Landscaping these piles of industrial waste has required major efforts by local authorities in recent decades.  But now a British scientist is planning to use slag heaps to deal with the climate change. Based at Cardiff University’s school of earth and ocean sciences, Phil Renforth is preparing to test the feasibility of using iron and steel slag deposits to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. His three-year project, which has just been awarded a £300,000 grant by the Natural Environment Research Council (Nerc), is set to begin in Consett, County Durham, and Port Talbot, south Wales. Renforth’s first step will actually be to make more of the industrial waste piles. “The aim is not to use old slag heaps to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but to carry out trials that will show how we can extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by pumping air through newly created slag heaps,” he told the Observer last week. During the process of steel-making, iron ore is mixed with limestone or dolomite and heated to extremely high temperatures. The end results are steel and slag, a waste mixture of calcium and magnesium silicates and oxides. Piles of this ore-processing leftover have been dumped around the countryside over several centuries. “Often these heaps have been landscaped very nicely,” said Renforth, who has worked on the project with Will Mayes of Hull University. “There is one in Consett that has been turned into lovely parkland where people can walk their dogs. They are all round the country. Wherever we have made iron, we have left a pile of slag.” Earlier research by Renforth has shown that carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is absorbed by material inside slag heaps. “We now want to see if we can improve the rate of this absorption so that can we make significant reductions in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide in the future,” added Renforth. To do this, Renforth’s project will proceed in two stages. “First, we will drill into one of these old, historic slag heaps and see what has been happening there over the years and understand what chemical processes have been going on as rainwater has brought carbon dioxide into the heap. “And then we will start the second stage. We will create our own mini-heap – about the size of a skip – and play with its chemistry to try to optimise its ability to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.” These slag-based carbon sequestrators could then be used as models of larger devices that could reduce carbon levels in the atmosphere, Renforth added. The UK produces 3-4m tonnes of slag a year while the total global production is estimated as being about 500m tonnes a year at present. However, this rate could increase as developing nations catch up, added Renforth. “Our calculations suggest that we might produce between 100bn and 200bn tonnes of slag cumulatively by the end of this century,” added Renforth. “That has the potential to remove 50-100bn tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere, we believe.” Finding effective ways to achieve carbon dioxide extraction – or sequestration, as it is also known – is considered to be of vital importance in stabilising global warming to below 2C. While the burning of coal and oil for electricity generation can be substantially replaced with the use of renewable or nuclear energy sources, scientists say there will still be a need to burn some forms of fossil fuel – for the aerospace industry, for example – and this use will continue to add carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So finding ways to suck it out – to balance this continued output of carbon – could still have a very important role to play in limiting climate change. “We are going to have think about ways of not just limiting carbon emissions but of actually removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and it may well be that technology based on slag leftovers from the steel industry could play a key role,” added Renforth."
"The Wellcome Trust is not making any kind of threat. That would be vulgar. The trust is a unique institution that has helped to fund much of the worthwhile scientific research in the UK over the last 20 years. Without its annual £1bn investment in research, nearly all of which is spent in the UK, there would be a lot less world-class science in this country. Its open letter to the leaders of all political parties explaining that it may have to reconsider its funding if the post-Brexit order is inimical to scientific research is simply a helpful clarification of reality for a government that may not wholly have grasped some of the implications of some of its own rhetoric. Not a threat at all. Yet two possible consequences of a hard Brexit are singled out in the trust’s letter as potentially fatal to the health of first-rate science in the UK: a withdrawal from European cooperation, and – perhaps more obvious – a clampdown on visas for foreign researchers of any age and achievement, and their families. Both of those measures might appeal to the atavistic xenophobia which has gripped large sections of the Conservative party and indeed of the country as a whole. The crisis of science funding, and of faith in science more generally, is part of the wider contemporary rebellion against conspicuous elites. Considered sociologically, science is the embodiment of the transnational elitism that voters everywhere have revolted against in the last year. The scientist claims to know better than the rest of us; what makes this claim more aggravating is that it is often accompanied by the belief that everyone else ought to be able to understand scientific reasoning and if we can’t this must be the result of moral or intellectual deficiency. This has drawn science into the culture wars in the US and to some degree in Britain, and on that battlefield most scientists are helpless. To hold up a placard saying, “Without science it’s just fiction”, is to make a joke that your own side will appreciate and be warmed by. But outsiders can see that slogan is not itself scientific and so on its own terms fiction.  What complicates the story is that the scientists are in fact vitally right about the non-human world. On climate change, their message is both true and more urgent than almost anything else except the threat posed by nuclear weapons. They have a great deal more to be proud of, too. Almost all the improvements we need to make in the world, and almost all our defences against things getting worse, depend on scientific understanding and have done so for the last 200 years. But the advances of science are no use – or harm – to anyone on their own. It is not enough to understand the world. The point is to change it. And that requires all the skills of politics and of cultural warfare that some scientists shun and many believers in science practise rather badly. The recent march for science and march against climate change have both highlighted really important causes which we should all support. The Wellcome Trust’s letter lays out objective truths about the conditions necessary for science to flourish. The government here and still more in the US must respect science, and the judgment of scientists. But for that to happen there will need to be political sophistication as well as political force on the part of all the supporters of enlightenment. • This article was amended on 1 May 2017. An earlier version said the Wellcome Trust had helped to fund “almost every worthwhile piece of scientific research in the UK over the last 20 years”, and that without its research funding “there would be very little world-class science in this country”."
"The Guardian’s new global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, recently explained why he believes that there is currently no news story more important than climate change. “How to put the environment front and centre is the big challenge,” he wrote, before asking for your ideas for the new, expanded environment team.  We’ve received a notable volume of correspondence on this matter – and would like to thank all of you who took the time to write in with your thoughts. We wanted to share a small portion of those responses here, but will also be feeding back all your ideas and points of view to the environment team. If you missed Jonathan’s piece – you can catch up with it here – but would still like to contribute on this subject, then there is still time to do so. Send your thoughts by email.   As ever, we look forward to hearing from you. I’ve been active in the green movement for around 30 years, and think it’s fair to say that it has relied heavily on science for the legitimacy of its message. Many environment-related presentations start with a graph, table, or set of numbers. This is no doubt very important, but it has led to a corresponding reliance on science as a medium for communicating the environmental “message” and on technology as a means of dealing with our environmental problems. Arguably, there’s not enough politics and not enough culture. I’d like to see the Guardian covering the cultural aspects of green politics in more detail – novels, plays, the visual arts. What’s happening there? What’s its effect? In his article, Jonathan referred to the Anthropocene. That debate is currently dominated by scientists too. Of course the science is vital, but while the geologists are still debating whether we are in the Anthropocene or not, culturally we’ve been in it for 20 or 30 years. So, a key question the Guardian could consider is not what is the Anthropocene, but what does it mean? How do we think of ourselves and our futures under the sign of the Anthropocene? Does it change who we are? I applaud your decision to step up environment reporting. I note also the commitment to consider the environment in other areas of reporting.  A case in point: an article in the magazine the same Saturday as Jonathan Watts’ piece, Hit the Road: White Van Man 2.0, contained one sentence in four pages that dealt with the environmental impact of the growth in white vans. I understand that this was a piece about the people who are driving the many more vans on the road, but could it not have had at least an explainer looking at some of the issues? Some questions might have been: How much of this traffic is driven by internet shopping? Is it better for Ocado and Tesco etc to deliver just once to 30 households, than for 30 people to drive to the supermarket? Or are these extra journeys? I agree with considering environmental issues as a fundamental element in global crisis, and would be very interested in stories that draw attention to the big picture, such as the effect of the expanding global population on environmental threats. But I am as much – or more – interested in hearing about everyday contributions that individuals can make towards reducing energy use. I would like to see environment coverage include local issues, and ideas for small changes that are easy to make. Enough small changes by enough people, and you reach a tipping point. The result can be enormous environmental improvements. The Guardian should be educating us on the impact of every significant decision we make – we ought to be aware of the shape of our climate impact and carbon footprint. But talking even to those committed to the cause, it appears that few have a grasp of information that could really inform their decisions. Impacts can be very complicated, but one of the more simple ones to compute (and sometimes the biggest one to tackle) is travel, especially air miles. Please publish tonnes of carbon per holiday clearly for each option in the Travel supplement. A simple graphic of how it adds to the average Guardian reader’s footprint would bring it home. I was heartened to read the Guardian’s announcement about expanding its environment desk. I find it frustrating that climate change is so far down the agenda of most political parties, save the Green party. And while surveys reveal that most people are concerned about this subject, the day-to-day demands of living seem to relegate the subject to a peripheral position.  I have friends and acquaintances who take several flights a year for holidays. A focus on the damaging effects of frequent flying should, in my view, be a priority. It would be useful if the Guardian could compile a list of the most damaging behaviours supported by the relevant statistics. People can get depressed about environmental issues, not just because they seem so huge and difficult to tackle, but because it can be hard to understand how to make a real difference. I hope you will report on people and organisations that have made real changes for everyone’s benefit by getting involved at a level higher than the individual (it’s about more than cycling to work rather than driving!).  If people feel galvanised or even empowered, then things can change for the better. I have spent 40 years campaigning for the environment, often pushing water uphill but with enough “wins” to want to carry on. We need more people who want to do that. Can you encourage them? Climate stories often seem to come across in a disjointed way: we start the year with a news piece that the last year was hotter than ever; we get another story that Greenland’s ice is melting a bit faster than predicted; there’s mention of methane gas being released in the Arctic circle. I think the inter-connectedness between these stories needs constant reinforcing. Tipping points don’t just happen when we reach an arbitrary 2C average temperature rise – it looks like it’s happening now and happening faster than we expected. I also want to read the story on what we are doing about it. How much CO2 have we cut in emissions? Who is successfully capturing and storing it? Who has been effective in government to curb the excesses of the carbon conglomerate? The environment is telling us that ignorance, stupidity, fear, hatred, greed, and blind tribalism must be overcome if we are to survive. It is the world calling us to unite, as human beings. The environment is the one thing we all have in common which penetrates deeper than humanity. It is time for us, in every sense of the word, to grow up. Good luck with your new environment desk. Get off page 54 and on to the front page! "

"Human emission of heat-trapping gases is causing the Earth to warm. We’ve known that for many decades. In fact, there are no reputable scientists that dispute this fact. There are, however, a few scientists who don’t think the warming will be very much or that we should worry about it. These contrarians have been shown to be wrong over and over again, like in the movie Groundhog Day. And, a new study just out shows they may have another error. But, despite being wrong, they continue to claim Earth’s warming isn’t something to be concerned about. Perhaps the darlings of the denialist community are two researchers out of Alabama (John Christy and Roy Spencer). They rose to public attention in the mid-1990s when they reportedly showed that the atmosphere was not warming and was actually cooling. It turns out they had made some pretty significant errors and when other researchers identified those errors, the new results showed a warming.  To provide perspective, we know the Earth is warming because we can measure it. Most of the heat (93%) goes into the oceans and we have sensors measuring ocean temperatures that show this. We also know about warming because we have thermometers and other sensors all over the planet measuring the temperature at the surface or in the first few meters of air at the surface. Those temperatures are rising too. We are also seeing ice melting and sea level rising around the planet.  So, the evidence is clear. What Christy and Spencer focus on is the temperatures measured far above the Earth’s surface in the troposphere and the stratosphere. Generally, over the past few decades these two scientists have claimed the troposphere temperatures are not rising very rapidly. This argument has been picked up to deny the reality of human caused climate change – but it has been found to be wrong. What kinds of errors have been made? Well first, let’s understand how these two researchers measure atmospheric temperatures. They are not using thermometers, rather they are using microwave signals from the atmosphere to deduce temperatures. The microwave sensors are on satellites which rapidly circle the planet.  Some of the problems they have struggled with relate to satellite altitudes (they slowly fall over their lifetimes, and this orbital decay biases the readings); satellite drift (their orbits shift east-west a small amount causing an error); they errantly include stratosphere temperatures in their lower atmosphere readings; and they have incorrect temperature calibration on the satellites. It’s pretty deep stuff, but I have written about the errors multiple times here, and here for people who want a deeper dive into the details.  It’s important to recognize that there are four other groups that make similar measurement estimates, so it’s possible to compare the temperatures of one group against another. The new paper, completed by Eric Swanson and published by the American Meteorological Society compares the results from three different groups. He focused on measurements made over the Arctic region. His comparison found two main differences amongst the three groups that suggests the errors. To better appreciate the issues, the satellites have instruments called Microwave Sounding Units (MSUs) or more recently, Advanced Microwave Soundings Units (AMSUs). These instruments allow reconstruction of the lower troposphere (TLT), the mid-troposphere temperature (TMT), and the lower stratosphere temperature (TLS). But the measurements are not at a specific location (like a thermometer) - they are smeared out over large spaces. As a consequence, it’s possible to have one layer of the atmosphere contaminate the results of another layer. You wouldn’t for instance, want your measurement of the troposphere (lower atmosphere) to include part of the stratosphere (above the troposphere).  Among the key differences among the research teams are their methods to ensure this contamination is minimized. According to the recent paper, which was published in January 2017:  At present, the UAH v6 (most recent Christy/Spencer data) results are preliminary and a fifth revision has now been released as v6beta5 (Spencer 2016). The release of the UAH version 6 products before publication is unusual, and Spencer recently stated that a manuscript has been submitted for a peer-reviewed publication. While some may find it scientifically inappropriate to utilize UAH v6b6 data before publication, these data have already been presented in testimony during congressional hearings before both the U.S. House and Senate and have also appeared on websites and in public print articles.  The author compared the Christy/Spencer data (UAH data) with another group (the RSS group) and found that the results diverged during the 1986-1988 time period. This shift “could arise from a step change or bias in either series.” When the author compared UAH with the third group (NOAA), the difference was still evident. However, when he compared RSS to NOAA, there was hardly a difference.  The author also noted that the timing of this divergence coincided with the merging of a new satellite NOAA-9, and this satellite has previously been identified as a source of error in the UAH results. But the author continued the analysis to more recent times and found another anomaly in 2005 which has since been corrected in NOAA. Look, measuring temperatures from satellites flying high above Earth is hard. No one doubts that. But let’s not be deluded into thinking these satellites are more accurate than thermometers (as some people suggest). Let’s also not blindly accept low-ball warming information from research teams that have long histories of revising their data. I created the image below a few years ago to show the upward revisions made by the Christy/Spencer team over time in their global troposphere temperatures.  It is relevant to be reminded of these revisions; had we believed the results from the 1990s, we’d still think the world was cooling, and we’d still be wrong."

"Matt Canavan has redoubled his attack on Westpac – accusing the bank of a conflict of interest over financial links to the Newcastle port – as a direct competitor to future coalmines in the Galilee basin. “This stinks to high heaven,” the resources minister told the ABC in response to the bank’s new policy to limit lending for new thermal coal projects to “existing coal-producing basins”.  “You’ve got a situation where the Newcastle port has been actively campaigning against the development of the Galilee basin because in their view it hurt their interests to have other competing coal basins. “And you had a situation a few days later with Westpac saying we shouldn’t develop the Galilee for climate change reasons but at the same time not disclosing their financial interest in the Newcastle port.” Hastings, a fully owned subsidiary of Westpac, manages investments for the Infrastructure Fund (TIF) and other funds. This includes the Newcastle port, which is part owned by TIF, and ships coal for mines in the Hunter Valley.  Canavan said as the funds manager for “half of the owners of the Newcastle ports” Westpac had a financial interest in the Newcastle port doing well.  “At the very least you would have thought they would have disclosed those relationships at the same time as they were making direct comments on the development of a competing coal basin,” Canavan said. The minister also attacked the bank’s chief executive officer, Brian Hartzer, accusing the “bank of New South Wales” (as it was known until 1982) of having no understanding of the Galilee basin, the home of Adani’s planned $16bn coalmine.  “It’s clear to me at least at the high levels of the bank of NSW they really have no understanding of the Galilee basin and I’m not criticising the fact they don’t but then don’t go and make comments about it when you are not fully informed,” Canavan said.  As an enthusiastic supporter of the Adani mine, Canavan has led a sustained campaign against Australia’s second largest bank since it released its updated climate change policy which limits lending to existing coal areas and only for coal over a certain quality.  While Westpac did not mention Adani in its policy, these two conditions effectively ensured the Adani’s Carmichael mine was ruled out.  Canavan immediately criticised Westpac and urged Queenslanders to boycott the bank, even though he has a Westpac account. Canavan, a Queensland senator, has also supported Adani’s application for a $1bn government loan. Canavan said Westpac had made no commercial assessment of the Adani project but it was illogical to rule out coal basins in north Queensland, some of which would be higher quality coal than product from the Hunter Valley. “I’ve got no criticism of institutions seeking to establish good climate change credentials,” he said. “The criticism I have is of the illogicality of Westpac’s position – and now it seems some conflicts they have, they have not properly disclosed.” Westpac set a limit for coal of a quality of 6,300 kilocalories per kg or above as the threshold for investing in new coalmines. Canavan said even though three mines in the Galilee basin would be above that limit, Wespac would not fund them “just because those are in north Queensland”. “Now that would be worse for the environment, worse for climate change because you would be denying finance to coal mines of a higher coal energy specification,” he said. Westpac released its original climate change policy in 2008 and its latest update was released after consultations with Ernst and Young and Climateworks, an independent not-for-profit organisation whose founding partners include Monash University and the Myer Foundation.  In a statement Westpac said Hastings was a fund manager, not an owner, of the Newcastle port. It pointed out both TIF and Newcastle ports had their own boards and governance arrangements and TIF also had an interest in a number of airports in north Queensland. “It is important to note Westpac provides finance facilities to 400 large businesses in north Queensland,” a spokesman said. “This includes four coalmines, five coal ports and three LNG facilities.”"
"For the fisherfolk of India’s southern state of Kerala, risking life and limb is part of everyday life. As fish stocks deplete in coastal waters because of overfishing and climate change, fishermen have no option but to venture ever further out to sea on small boats, flimsy canoes and catamarans. These modest craft are prone to accidents, especially during the monsoon season from June to August. The absence of navigational aids, radio communication or safety devices heightens the risks.  Radio Monsoon, a collaborative project that grew out of a competition at the University of Sussex, is designed to help, using a low-tech forecast service to ensure safer working conditions among the 30,000-plus fishing families in the area. During its pilot, Radio Monsoon provided daily forecasts in the local language of Malayalam, specifically tailored for 10 fishing villages along the 80km Thiruvananthapuram coast. These areas are particularly vulnerable to bad weather and natural disasters.  Based on data from India’s national meteorological department and the centre for ocean information services , as well as local knowledge, Radio Monsoon’s forecasts are disseminated through social media, loudspeakers placed in harbours, and by word of mouth. Fishermen can also access forecasts over a phone line supported by an internet server. Their feedback is collected regularly and relayed to the forecasters so that the information can be adapted to their needs. Maxmillan Martin, who is from Kerala and is now a research associate at the University of Sussex, first had the idea for Radio Monsoon in collaboration with friends after the devastating tsunami of 2004.  The group – a retired teacher, a journalist, a user interface designer and a social media expert, all from Kerala – came up with a narrowcast system whereby forecasts recorded on to CDs would be played in the harbour. “It was a very low-tech intervention but the fishermen loved it and the local forecasters did too,” says Martin. “It worked but we went on with our lives.” Martin, who has a background in geography, resurrected the idea while doing his PhD at the University of Sussex, entering it into a competition for innovation funding. A full-blown pilot followed in 2014, and ran on a “shoestring budget” until 2016, when funds ran out. Team now plans to relaunch and expand the project, monitoring its impact on fatalities and the search and rescue operations that currently save about 3,000 lives a year. Before Radio Monsoon, there was no widely used local and regular marine weather information service for local fishing communities. With families reliant on the money made from fishing hauls, a culture of risk-taking emerged. “Once, my boat capsized and I hit my head. I had to swim and reach the shore,” recalls Sebastian Kristudasan, 40, a fisherman in Kerala. “In such situations, if someone is nearby, they will save the fisherman; we save ourselves or we are gone.” Fishermen usually venture 70-80km from shore, says Kristudasan, adding that it can be difficult to navigate back if they go out too far. “Long ago, people could navigate looking at [the] stars. Now we don’t do that. GPS can help us coordinate. If there is no GPS, we go to a distance where we can see the shore and the mountains. “Beyond that, we estimate the distance by using our hands [the distance between the tips of outstretched hands being one fathom or six feet].” Wilson Franklin, another local fisherman, says: “In June and from then on, it is do-or-die trips for us. The sea faces terrible storms. You can die, or lose your gear, you can escape on some other land, or suffer an accident while returning. Or you can come back safe. You have to careful during these three months. By September the sea becomes calmer.” Martin said fishermen do not always heed advice, especially since their livelihood depends on them going out to fish whatever the weather. “They told us they just take their gear on to the boats and nothing for safety, because they believe they just need to be able to swim. If they are good swimmers, then they can do it; if not, the attitude was ‘Well, that’s too bad.’ They are not really afraid because it’s just part of their lives. The way they perceive risk is totally different than how we do.”"
"The government attributes 40-50,000 premature deaths each year to the effects of airborne pollution; there are some 1 million cases of foodborne illness, which result in 20,000 hospital admissions and 500 deaths a year; and up to 50,000 people die each year as a result of injuries or health problems originating in the workplace (Enemies of the state: the 40-year Tory project to shrink public services, G2, 9 May). Yet the rate of inspection and enforcement actions for environmental health, food safety and hygiene, and health and safety have all been falling. The statistically average workplace now expects to see a health and safety inspector once every 50 years. In the name of cutting red tape, governments of all political persuasions have attacked independent regulation and enforcement. Budget cuts in the name of austerity have compounded the problem – especially at the level of local authorities. There is now a plethora of schemes to outsource and privatise wholesale some regulatory and enforcement activities. Private companies are increasingly involved in “regulating” either other private companies, or themselves, or both. Such changes mark the beginning of the end of the state’s commitment to forms of social protection put into place since the 1830s.Steve TombsProfessor of criminology, Open University  • Recent reports say parts of the British Isles are in the early stages of drought, with less than normal amounts of rain in the past few months. South-east England is particularly affected. But hasn’t our climate often broken the norms in the last 40 years? Past performance is no guide to what will happen in the future. It would be a good time now, in this pre-election period, to ask our politicians what contingency plans they have for a prolonged drought lasting two or more years. Our survival may depend upon them.Geoff NaylorWinchester • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"
"Theresa May is facing calls from Britain’s leading environment and development groups to use her influence to persuade Donald Trump that the US must remain committed to the Paris climate change agreement. In a strongly worded letter, the heads of Oxfam, the RSPB, Greenpeace, WWF, Christian Aid, Cafod and other groups have called on the prime minister to “pick up the phone” to the US president to warn him of the consequences of leaving the Paris accord, something Trump pledged to do within 100 days of coming to power, a timeline that passed last week.  The UK played a leading role in the complex negotiations that resulted in nearly 200 nations making the unprecedented commitment to tackle global climate change, signed in Paris in December 2015. The agreement is seen as crucial for the success of efforts to limit the global temperature rise to below 2C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. But reports in the US suggest that support for leaving the climate treaty is gaining ground among Trump’s key advisers as the president – who has said climate change is a Chinese hoax – prepares to deliver his decision, which is expected this week. The reported shift in opinion among White House aides comes despite strong calls from leading businesses and scientists for the US to remain in the climate accord. Last week, major US companies including Google, Microsoft and Walmart wrote to Trump stating the economic and business case for the US continuing to be a party to the agreement. May herself recently came under pressure from cross-party MPs and leading scientists who urged her to use her influence to persuade the US president to acknowledge and act on climate change. A recent ComRes survey showed almost two-thirds of British adults (64%) accept that climate change is happening, and that it is primarily due to human activity. The joint letter warns May that Trump “may be about to undermine a vital global agreement on which the health, security, and prosperity of hundreds of millions of people depend”. It continues: “This climate agreement was an extraordinary feat of international diplomacy, and the UK played a crucial role in securing it. This is now the best chance humanity has to avert full-blown climate change, and may well be the last. A strong majority of people in the UK believe climate change is happening. They will be looking to you as the prime minister to champion science, moral responsibility and international cooperation.” In recent days European ministers and EU officials have been lobbying senior White House staff after hearing Trump was leaning heavily towards leaving the accord. The UN environment chief, Erik Solheim, has also warned the US that it will “shoot itself in the foot” if it quits the Paris deal because China, India and Europe will snap up the best power sector jobs in future. “There is no doubt where the future is and that is what all the private sector companies have understood,” Solheim told Reuters. “The future is green. Obviously if you are not a party to the Paris agreement, you will lose out. And the main losers will be the people of the United States itself because all the interesting, fascinating new green jobs would go to China and to the other parts of the world that are investing heavily in this.” An online petition launched by Greenpeace calling on May to intervene had reached 78,000 signatories by Saturday evening."
"The US Environmental Protection Agency’s main climate change website is “undergoing changes” to better reflect “the agency’s new direction” under Donald Trump.   The announcement, made late on Friday evening, left empty what was previously the “official government site” providing “comprehensive information on the issue of climate change and global warming”.  The change came a day before thousands gathered in Washington DC and other US cities to protest about inaction on climate change, and hours before the symbolic 100-day mark of the Trump administration. At the marquee climate protest, the People’s Climate March in Washington, tens of thousands made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue in sweltering heat on their way to encircle the White House.  Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country, including in Seattle, Boston and San Francisco. In Chicago, marchers headed from the city’s federal plaza to Trump Tower. In Denver, marchers were met with a dose of spring snow. Some of the marches drew celebrity attendees, including former vice-president Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the capital and senator and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders at an event in Montpelier, Vermont. “Honored to join Indigenous leaders and native peoples as they fight for climate justice,” DiCaprio tweeted.  Any marchers who used their phones to look at the EPA climate change website would have been greeted with a message from the new administration: “This page is being updated.” “As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,” said JP Freire, an associate administrator for public affairs.  Previously, the website housed data on greenhouse gas emissions from large polluters and reports on the effects of climate change and its impact on human health.  “We want to eliminate confusion,” Freire said, “by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we’re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law.” Information from previous administrations is archived as a link from the EPA’s website.  The EPA is currently led by Scott Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who has denied that carbon dioxide causes global warming. The Trump administration has called for budget cuts of nearly one-third at the EPA and has sought to weaken protections for human health. For instance, the White House has proposed cutting funding and regulations regarding lead poisoning prevention and is considering rewriting regulations concerning smog. It has already rolled back a law that prevented coalmining companies from dumping waste in streams. In an op-ed piece for the Guardian published on Saturday, Sanders made an economic case for a focus on industries meant to ameliorate the effects of climate change, rather than those which contribute to it. The senator from Vermont wrote: “No matter what agenda President Trump and his administration of climate deniers push, it is clear that jobs in clean energy like wind and solar are growing much more rapidly than jobs in the coal, oil and gas sectors.”"
"Recent very butterfly-unfriendly icy winds remind me of an insect that endures horrendous weather every summer. The mountain ringlet is our only montane butterfly, meaning that you have to climb a mountain – or at least 400 metres up a Lake District fell – to see it. Some mountain ringlet caterpillars may live for two years so slowly do they grow, chewing grass in the most capricious British conditions, while the butterfly itself only survives for a few days in June and July. The mountain ringlet can endure wet and cold but is struggling as the climate warms. It’s disappeared from almost 40% of its locations since the 1970s and has moved 150m higher in recent decades. Scientists believe this is probably because temperature rises affect critical periods of its lifecycle. Now there’s a new crowdfunding campaign for a joint study led by RSPB scientist Dr Steven Ewing to investigate how mountainsides can be better managed to help the mountain ringlet adapt to global warming. As fickle as hilltop weather, this butterfly is probably the hardest in Britain to find, but Ewing has already observed 80 egg-laying females, measuring the composition and structure of the nearby grass species to learn more about what makes a mountainside hospitable for mountain ringlets. By learning more about this secretive species, we may be able to tailor upland sheep grazing to its needs – and counteract some negative effects of climate change. For instance, one way to help mountain ringlets survive climate change might be to create cooler microclimates by allowing longer grass in some locations. It’s laborious, heroic, fascinating science, and hopefully Ewing’s project will get the support it deserves. "
