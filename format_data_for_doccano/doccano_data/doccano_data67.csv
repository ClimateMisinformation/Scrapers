"A handful of US states – including New Mexico and California – are facing significant strains on their water supplies that will only intensify with global heating, according to new rankings. New Mexico tops the list and is the only state with “extremely high” pressures on its water availability. The state’s score is on par with the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East and Eritrea in Africa, the World Resources Institute (WRI) found. California ranks second, followed by Arizona, Colorado and Nebraska. “We’re stretching our water supply pretty much as far as it can go … and even further,” said Leah Schleifer, a spokeswoman for WRI’s water program. Experts with WRI said the data shows a global water crisis. “The picture is alarming in many places around the globe, but it’s very important to note that water stress is not destiny,” said Betsy Otto, WRI’s global water director. “What we can’t afford to do any longer is pretend that the situation will resolve itself.” The global research organization compared the water available in aqueducts to the amount withdrawn for homes, industries, irrigation and livestock. Around the world, stress on water supplies can exacerbate conflict and migration, threaten food supplies and pose risks for water-dependent industries, including mining and manufacturing, WRI notes. The US overall is not among the world’s most at-risk countries, although Mexico ranks No 24. A 2010 study predicted that climate-driven changes in crop yields in Mexico would lead to more emigration to the United States. And the global climate crisis is increasingly being recognized as a major factor in the exodus from Central America to the US. Worldwide, at the top of the list are Qatar, Israel, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories and Iran. A total of 17 countries are facing “extremely high” risks and another 27 are facing “high” risks. Scientists have also linked the violence and civil war in Syria to a drought driven by rising temperatures and massive water withdrawals. In the African Sahel, a semi-arid region that stretches coast to coast across northern Africa below the Sahara, they have documented similar water stresses as millions have migrated out of the countryside. WRI’s experts explained that water stress is different from drought. But places where people are using water at a faster rate than it is replaced could see serious problems if they hit a drought – or a prolonged period without enough rain. “With respect to climate change we know that in many places what we’re going to be seeing is more erratic, more unpredictable hydrology, precipitation. Either too much or too little, often in the same places,” Otto said. The mid-latitudes around the globe are likely to receive less rainfall as temperatures rise. And they will be using more water, as crops draw up more water during dry periods and people use water-dependent electricity to run air conditioners, Otto said. A recent analysis of 12m wells in the US found that as groundwater supplies are depleted, people and industry are digging deeper. Researchers called the trend an “unsustainable stopgap” that is only available to those who can afford it and where hydrologic conditions allow. The last widespread drought in the US was in 2012, when more than 80% of the country experienced abnormal dryness or worse, and two-thirds of the country experienced drought, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist for the agriculture department. California saw an extended drought with conditions beginning in 2011 and not subsiding across the state until the last couple of years. The state is expected to see huge population growth at the same time temperatures could be 5F warmer, sea levels keep rising and water from melting snowpack declines, said Joaquin Esquivel, chairman of the California water resources control board. In the 2010s, drought hit the US islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In 2016 it swept through the north-east. And in 2017 made its way through the northern plains. Today, south-east Alaska’s rainforest is feeling the most intense drought in the country. World Bank research has emphasized that “while the consequences of drought are often invisible, they are significant and cause ‘misery in slow motion.’”"

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In September 2016 an exciting paper by a team led by Katinka Bellomo was published in the Geophysical Research Letters.
It described a climate amplifier for the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) based on clouds. According to the study, the cloud effect accounts for up to one third of the AMO associated temperature change. The abstract:
New observational evidence for a positive cloud feedback that amplifies the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) affects climate variability in the North Atlantic basin and adjacent continents with potential societal impacts. Previous studies based on model simulations and short-term satellite retrievals hypothesized an important role for cloud radiative forcing in modulating the persistence of the AMO in the tropics, but this mechanism remains to be tested with long-term observational records. Here we analyze data sets that span multiple decades and present new observational evidence for a positive feedback between total cloud amount, sea surface temperature (SST), and atmospheric circulation that can strengthen the persistence and amplitude of the tropical branch of the AMO. In addition, we estimate cloud amount feedback from observations and quantify its impact on SST with idealized modeling experiments. From these experiments we conclude that cloud feedbacks can account for 10% to 31% of the observed SST anomalies associated with the AMO over the tropics.”
In the same journal already in February 2016, an article by Tianle Yuan et al appeared on the same topic. The authors called out that the climate models were not able to reproduce the AMO ocean cycle in the tropics. They then described amplification mechanism through low-lying clouds that could incorporate the AMO into the models. The abstract follows:
Positive low cloud and dust feedbacks amplify tropical North Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is characterized by a horseshoe pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and has a wide range of climatic impacts. While the tropical arm of AMO is responsible for many of these impacts, it is either too weak or completely absent in many climate model simulations. Here we show, using both observational and model evidence, that the radiative effect of positive low cloud and dust feedbacks is strong enough to generate the tropical arm of AMO, with the low cloud feedback more dominant. The feedbacks can be understood in a consistent dynamical framework: weakened tropical trade wind speed in response to a warm middle latitude SST anomaly reduces dust loading and low cloud fraction over the tropical Atlantic, which warms the tropical North Atlantic SST. Together they contribute to the appearance of the tropical arm of AMO. Most current climate models miss both the critical wind speed response and two positive feedbacks though realistic simulations of them may be essential for many climatic studies related to the AMO.”
While on the subject of clouds, for German speakers the following 2 videos can be viewed until January 21, 2017 can be watched on ZDF German television:

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German climate activist/alarmist site Klimaretter (climate rescuers) here has an opinion piece telling readers that there is in fact little difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton when it comes the energy policy. “Eco-green or coal-black? It really isn’t that simple.”
Klimaretter writes that while it may appear Trump wishes to save the American coal industry and Clinton promises to promote “clean energies”,  the two candidates have many more similarities’ than what meets the eye:
In fact there are more common points between the two than what their rhetoric would have us believe. Both Clinton and Trump wish to hold on to the controversial fracking technology for natural gas  and crude oil. The same is true for nuclear power.
Trump has long since added on to his pro-coal course by coming out in favor of ‘all types of energy’. Also solar and wind energy would also play a role under his administration. It’s a balancing act for the billionaire: Of course he wishes to gain the votes from the many unemployed coal workers, however he has in fact understood that renewable energies has become a good economic engine, and in the meantime offers more jobs than the coal industry.
Trump even appears to be worried that there might indeed be something behind climate change: One of his companies wants to build a protective wall around his golf course on the Irish coast. Rising sea level and increasing erosion necessitate it…”
Klimaretter’s opinion could be the case of a climate alarmist trying to see a silver lining in a Trump presidency. Let’s recall that Trump said he would stop payments to the UN climate programs, not sign the climate treaty, and rev up the American economic engines (hence more CO2 emissions).
Clinton would do the opposite.
Hillary Clinton would also very likely shackle the economy with massive environmental regulation and possibly even impose a carbon tax. These are points that Klimaretter would surely welcome.

(1998, 1999) graph that claimed to reconstruct  surface temperatures for the entire Northern Hemisphere (by extrapolating from a few select trees located in North America) was published without color.  The graph’s red “hockey stick” blade effectively allowed readers to see for themselves just how “dangerous” modern warming really is .

The IPCC has since abandoned Michael Mann’s (Mann et al., 1998, 1999) artwork depicting late-1990s Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures as +0.9°C warmer than they were during Medieval times.  (For example, the 2013 IPCC report even acknowledges that many NH regions were as warm or warmer than present during the “Medieval Climate Anomaly”.)
Removing the Mann “hockey stick” graph from the paleoclimate record has come at a cost, though.  In many of the graphs of the Middle and Late Holocene constructed since then (with some exceptions), it has become much more difficult to distinguish between warming that is “safe” (for example, warming that will not endanger the lives of polar bears) and warming that is “dangerous” (for example, warming that will endanger the lives of polar bears).
The difficulty distinguishing between “safe” and “dangerous” warming arises because, unlike Mann’s “hockey stick” graph, many recent millennial-scale reconstructions just don’t show enough of a difference between the past climate and the present one to know which is which.   In fact, many reconstructions depict the 20th/21st centuries as not any warmer — and in some cases, cooler — than temperatures from a few hundred to a few thousand years ago.  This makes the detection of “dangerous” warming even more problematic.
Although it helps to add the color red to aid in deciphering which warming trend is “dangerous” and which is “safe”, sometimes even the additional coloration isn’t  enough to tell a difference.  For example, consider Esper et al. (2012) .  In the main graph from the paper (a), the authors redden the 20th/21st centuries to aid in identifying the warming that is “dangerous” versus that which is blue and thus “safe”.    However, the long-term trend is one of cooling, not warming, and the secondary graph (b) even shows that Northern Europe has been cooling overall since the 1940s or so.  This can become confusing for the reader concerned about detecting “dangerous” warming.
Esper et al., 2012

So . . . as a service to those who may not be able to find the “dangerous” warming in modern scientific publications, below is a helpful guide with easy-to-understand pointing devices (arrows),  labeling (“Safe” versus “Dangerous Warming”), and red coloration embedded into the paper’s graphs.   The consistently-used bright red hue on the arrow tracking the graph’s “Dangerous Warming” allows readers to locate the “Dangerous Warming” right away — without needing to scan the entire graph.   With practice and repetition using these 20+peer-reviewed scientific papers, the average reader will ultimately become adept at distinguishing between the “dangerous” warming that kills polar bears and the “safe” warming that doesn’t kill polar bears.

“Peak Holocene temperatures occurred prior to 5.0 ka [5,000 years ago], a time when overall aquatic and terrestrial biological production was high. Chironomid-inferred summer air temperatures reached up to 7.5°C during this period. The region of Lake JR01 cooled over the mid- to late Holocene, with high biological production between 6.1 and 5.4 ka. Biological production decreased again at ~ 2 ka and the rate of cooling increased in the past 2 ka, with coolest temperatures occurring between 0.46 and 0.36 ka [460 and 360 years ago], coinciding with the Little Ice Age. Although biological production increased in the last 150 yr, the reconstructed temperatures do not indicate a warming during this time“

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online daily Abendblatt here and media all over Germany report that the country will not pass its climate protection act, which was supposed to be voted on tomorrow, thus meaning the Germany will come to the Marrakesh world climate conference later this month without any plan for decarbonizing its society.
Last June German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks put forth the Climate Protection Plan 2050 with the aim of starting the “climate-friendly transformation of society”. The plan called for reducing CO2 emissions 40% by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels) and 80 – 95% by 2050.
However the plan was quickly and “radically” gutted out by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Office, Economics Minister/Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, Transportation Minister Alexander Dolbridt and Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. The plan’s rejection sent a loud signal that the country was deeply divided on the issue, and that there were in fact other priorities far outweighing “climate protection”.
Plan withdrawn from a vote
The Ministry of Environment’s Climate Protection Plan 2050 was designed to systematically decarbonize German energy production, industry, transportation and agriculture by 2050, and was scheduled to be ratified by the German Bundeskabinett tomorrow, just in time for the world climate conference in Morocco, which starts next week.
However Minister Hendricks announced that she was withdrawing the latest plan, and thus it will not go up for a vote tomorrow. The reason, according to Klimaretter here: “It’s not ready for ratification.”

The move to allow the plan to fall apart sent a wave of surprise across the country as it signals that Germany will come to Morocco with no official commitment to substantially reduce CO2 emissions. Hendricks will attempt a new vote in December, long after the end of the Morocco conference.
“Unscientific hodgepodge of measures”
This is a devastating signal coming from a country often viewed as one of the leading proponents of CO2 reduction and climate protection. Initially Germany wanted to showcase it’s commitment to CO2 reductions, and so in Morocco serve as an example for responsible behavior to the rest of the world. Now Europe’s most powerful economy will have nothing to show, and Europe’s leadership on the issue appears seriously compromised.
According to the Abendblatt, Michael Fuchs of Merkel’s CDU party called Hendricks’s draft plan “an unscientific hodgepodge of measures” and that climate strategy has to be foremost focused on innovation and technology.
“Embarrassment”
Leading environmental groups and environmental activists blasted the government’s gutting out and opposition to the climate protection plan, calling it an “embarrassment” that Germany will show up in Morocco with no official intention of cutting back its emissions.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe mean temperature for Germany in August, 2016, was 17.7°C, which turns out to be 0.2°K colder than the figure reported in the overheated August 30, 2016 press release issued by the German DWD national weather service.
The August result makes the month 0.7°C warmer than the 1981-2010 mean. Nothing extraordinary.
However, the DWD has had a habit of overstating monthly mean temperatures in its press releases to the media.
German climate and weather blogsite wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de here reports that this has been the fifth false monthly report by the DWD so far this year – suggesting that the DWD is indulging in climate warming propaganda.
What follows is a chart of August mean temperatures in Germany since 1881:

Source: DWD- data series and trends. Overall trend since 1990 is flat.
The DWD August press release shouted that “August 2016 was too warm!”
Overall the summer of 2016 (June, July, August) posted a preliminary mean of 17.8°C, which makes it 0.6°C colder than last summer.
The wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de site scoffs at the DWD claim that August “was too warm!”, reminding readers that snow fell down to elevations of 2000 meters in all three summer months, with record lows being set at a number of locations. The German site writes:
The 0.7°K deviation for the summer of 2016 in Germany is well within the normal range for mean summer temperature over the years – the summer was neither too cold nor too warm. It was quite normal. The DWD press release is false.”
The site points out that there was in fact only one single heat wave this summer, with maximum temperatures reaching above 30°C at least five days in a row or more, and it took place at the very end of August – and only in parts of Germany.
The big cities of Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich did not see a single heat wave in the summer of 2016, as the following charts illustrate:

The wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de site suggests that the DWD is exaggerating to make it look like Germany had a hot summer when in fact it was nothing of the sort. The site writes: the DWD August 30th press release tried to produce the impression of multiple widespread heat waves in Germany this summer, when in fact this was not the case at al.
Moreover an NOAA reanalysis of Europe up to August 28 shows that the greater part of the European continent had a much cooler than normal August 2016:

Source: www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/composites/day/
Over the past months global temperatures have cooled, Germany is much cooler than it was 1 year ago, and the area of thick Arctic ice has tripled in size over the past four years. Yet, that doesn’t keep the DWD from announcing a summer that was “too warm” with a deviation of only +0.7°C.

"A catastrophic combination of heat, drought, storms, forest fires, beetle plagues and a fungi blight have so far this year destroyed swathes of German forest equivalent to more than 200,000 football fields. Forests are one of the most efficient ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and in Germany alone they are able to absorb 62 million tonnes of CO2 – about 7% of the country’s emissions – every year.  But forests have also been at the heart of Germany’s cultural identity for centuries, and politicians are now seizing the issue – known as waldsterben (dying forest) – as a top priority. The agriculture minister, Julia Klöckner, has announced a forest summit next month, at which national forestry and climate experts are to agree on a multimillion-euro action plan. Klöckner has pledged €500m (£460m), to be paid out of the government’s energy and climate fund, to finance it. “Our forests are massively damaged,” Klöckner said, visiting Moritzburg near Dresden, which has been badly hit, many of its trees brown and dying, mainly due to drought and beetle infestations. “Only if everyone unites will we manage the mammoth task that lies ahead of us – to save our forests not only for ourselves but for future generations,” she said. The society for the protection of the German forest, SDW, believes the extent of the destruction goes even beyond the government’s estimate. It has said the trees being lost at the most rapid rate are those that make up the bulk of the forests, including spruces and firs, pines, beeches and oaks. In last year’s dry summer and this year’s, the forests have been hit by a shortfall of 200 litres of rainwater per square metre, according to SDW, which Germany’s meteorological service says is the driest it has been for 50 years. The association of German foresters (BDF) has said German forests are close to collapse. “The forest is the best way to save the climate, but right now the forest itself is a victim of the climate catastrophe,” it said. A third of Germany is made up of forest, or 11.4m hectares (28 macres) – about a half of which is private property. The crisis is being keenly felt, not least after a recent survey on national identity in which 50% of participants cited forests as being central to their idea of heimat or sense of home. Germans have for centuries had a mythological, even spiritual, identification with their forests. Woodlands have formed the inspiration for much German music and literature –most famously the 19th-century folk tales of the Brothers Grimm. In everything from Red Riding Hood to Hansel and Gretel the forest is portrayed as a place of foreboding and threat and as well as retreat, safety and learning. For German romanticists in the late 18th century, the forest was an important symbol of unity and purity, the word waldeinsamkeit, forest loneliness, embodying the sense of inner peace to be found in the forest. This was later exploited by the Nazis, who encouraged the idea of the forest as a sign of German cultural solidity, encouraging people to plant German oaks to honour Adolf Hitler. The tabloid Bild recently published an ode to the German forest, calling it “part of the German soul”. “It is, alas, not some made-up fairytale … that our forest is in a state of emergency … and if we don’t do something to save it and ourselves, we might end up with the story: ‘Once upon a time, there was a place called the German forest,’” the paper stated. Experts are divided over the best plan of action. Solutions range from introducing more robust tree species to naturally allowing forests to adapt to the conditions. The opposition Greens are calling for a return to primeval forests – woods left to their own devices, after researchers at Zurich’s Technical University calculated that there was room on the planet for a third more forests than at present without encroaching on urban or agricultural spaces. While owners of private forests are tending towards planting Douglas firs and northern red oaks, the Association for Environmental and Nature Protection in Germany, a leading NGO, says non-native species are an ecological risk. The trees that are most under threat are said to be spruce, beech, ash, Norway maple and sycamore. Those most able to weather the climate crisis are robinia, plane, and sweet and horse chestnut trees. Among those likely to be increasingly imported in future are Turkish hazel, Italian maple, silver lime, and Lebanon cedar. The challenge is to find species able to cope with hot summers as well as harsh winters. Klöckner believes that as many species as possible are necessary, referring to experts who say nature cannot be left to cope on its own. “We need mixed forests and trees that are adapted to their habitat,” she said. Tanja Sanders, an expert in forest ecology who researches what the forest of the future might look like, said: “Forests are a vital part of our lives. They form groundwater, give us wood, filter the air, reduce CO2 and the temperature and offer space for species conservation and human relaxation. But we must face up to having to say goodbye to the forest as we’ve known it.”"
"Climate change is making the drought in eastern Australia more severe and contributing to the woes of the Murray-Darling river system. However, only around one in 20 news stories about the drought mention climate change. An analysis of media coverage of the drought was prepared for Guardian Australia by Streem, a media monitoring company. The analysis looked at drought coverage from October 2017 onwards across TV, radio, online and print. Each news story was scored for the occurrence of key phrases [more detail about the methods below]. Overall, the media were more likely to mention financial relief or assistance funding (7.6%) in news stories than climate change (5.8%). Since Scott Morrison became prime minister, he was more likely to be mentioned in a news story (6.4%) than climate change. The mediums least likely to include climate change in news stories were radio (2.5%) and TV (2.6%), with commercial stations particularly low. Channel Nine mentioned climate change in only 0.7% of their news stories about drought, and Channel Seven in only 1.3%. The breakdown by publisher for online and print shows a split along broadsheet and tabloid lines, as well as by publisher, with Guardian Australia and Nine’s newspaper mastheads much higher than News Corp: Guardian Australia scored the highest, at 38%. While the effect of climate change on rainfall in Australia is complex, there are some regions where the trend is towards lower rainfall annually. According to a report put out by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, the southern part of the Murray-Darling Basin is getting less rain annually, and this change has been attributed to climate change. The influence of climate change on temperature is comparatively more straightforward. Since 1910, Australia has warmed by 1 degree on average. According to Andrew King, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, climate change is making droughts worse. “In general, climate change is exacerbating drought, mainly because in a warmer world we experience more evaporation from the surface, and we project for that to continue in the future,” he says. “So when it does rain, more of that water is likely to be lost to the atmosphere through evaporation than before human-caused climate change.”  This increased evaporation makes droughts more severe, as it reduces soil moisture available to plants, and also reduces the flow of water into river systems that people rely on for irrigation and drinking water, as well as reducing the water available for river and wetland ecosystems. David Holmes is the director of the climate change communication research hub at Monash University, and has conducted similar studies of media coverage. Holmes says that coverage of extreme weather trends tends to get overtaken by several common narratives that push climate change out of the story. “The first is the ‘triumph over tragedy’ narrative, which is all about how people are doing it tough, but they’re a resilient bunch and work out ways to overcome adversity,” he says. “The second most dominant narrative is the ‘unstoppable power of nature’, so we’re at the mercy of natural forces. With drought, it’s tied to a narrative where there’s always been a changing climate and droughts, so let’s not try and make it some unique thing, let’s just work out how to adapt.” Holmes says these and other narratives often shift climate change out of the analysis and can naturalise or bury the amplifying effects of climate change in extreme weather events. As to whether the media should be making the link between extreme weather events and climate change more frequently, Holmes suggests that people should be informed by the science where possible. “Find the experts that deal with drought and allow the scientists to make the link,” he suggests. “The best time to talk about [climate change] is during extreme weather events because people want to know what is going on.” Analysis of media coverage combined the following search term “Drought AND (Australia OR Australian OR “New South Wales” OR Victoria OR Queensland OR Tasmania OR “South Australia” OR “Northern Territory” OR “Western Australia” OR NT OR SA OR WA OR NSW OR ACT)“ with other phrases: “climate change”, emissions, “climate change” OR emissions, “rainfall patterns”, “drought relief” OR “financial assistance”, livestock OR cattle OR sheep, “Scott Morrison”, “Michael McCormack”. It is entirely possible that some stories will not be about the current drought, but instead will be using the term in a more general sense (eg man drought). Coverage is from October 2017 onwards."
"Australia has just experienced its third-hottest July on record, beaten only by records set in 2017 and 2018, as fire and water authorities in the eastern states prepare for a worse than average fire season. The year-to-date temperatures from January to July were the second warmest on record, according to a monthly statement from the Bureau of Meteorology. Rainfall recorded during that period is the fifth lowest on record, with the drought worst in New South Wales, southern Queensland, and eastern and central Victoria.  The mean maximum temperature in July was 2.23C above average – the third highest mean maximum temperature for July behind 2017 and 2018. The warm winter follows Australia’s hottest ever summer. Global temperatures for July were on track to make it the hottest month ever recorded, following the hottest June ever recorded. The fire service in New South Wales has announced a historic early start to the declared bushfire danger period in two local government areas along the far south coast, Eurobodalla and the Bega Valley. Ten more regions in the northeast and mid-north coast – Inverell, Tenterfield, Glen Innes Severn, Armidale, Uralla, Walcha, Nambucca, Kempsey, Port Macquarie Hastings, and the Mid-Coast region – were also declared to be in a bushfire danger period from 1 August. Bush fire season starts in 12 local government areas across NSW today due to continuing dry conditions. Don't be the fire risk to your community. Check if permits are required for your area at https://t.co/HK6egynjyv #nswrfs pic.twitter.com/YAiUCrZxWQ Rob Rogers, acting commissioner of the NSW rural fire service, said the fire season had been brought forward due to very dry and warm conditions across most of the state. About 98% of NSW is in a declared drought. “Last season we saw more fires in July and August than the whole of summer combined,” Rogers said in a statement. Fire authorities in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia are yet to declare the start of their fire danger periods, but both SA and Victoria are expected to do so earlier than normal. Historically, the fire season ran from November to March in the southern half of the country, and October to March in NSW. In recent years, the fire season, during which there are restrictions on burn-offs or lighting fires on private land, has been extended in all jurisdictions. The Murray Darling Basin Authority has also issued a grim outlook for the Murray Darling, warning that it expects to manage the river system for very dry conditions. Most dams are already very low and the authority does not expect to be able to draw any water from the Menindee Lakes in the coming year, which means the Lower Darling will depend totally on flows from upstream. The storages are now at 32% on average, but in the northern basin, dam levels average just 9%. Many towns in north-west NSW are already preparing to access alternative water sources, including sinking bores and installing desalination equipment, laying pipelines to bring water from other river systems, and even trucking in water. Inflows to the Murray Darling in the past 12 months were the eighth lowest in more than 100 years, the MDBA said. While the MDBA plans for all scenarios, it said the Bureau of Meteorology was forecasting very dry conditions for the next three months, when the river system usually receives rain. “Water in storages is lower than this time last year,” the MDBA. Most of the water is in Dartmouth Dam, on the Murray, to reduce evaporative losses. It is currently at 49%. One of the key risks is whether spikes in water demand will be able to be delivered though narrow parts of the Murray. There has been significant expansion of plantings of almonds and grapes around Mildura. “There is no indication at this stage that a shortfall will occur in the coming year, however, the risk remains real,” the MDBA says. “If conditions remain dry and state water use is as planned, there will be low storage levels at the end of this year,” the MDBA warns."
"Seventeen heatwaves already – and more to come. That’s what the Mallorca newspapers were reporting in early July, as holidaymakers endured day after day of punishing 35C-40C conditions. And they were right. Another unbearable heatwave arrived a fortnight later. The waitress in Palma was in despair. At least you can go back to an aircon hotel, she told me. Her home was a small shared apartment with no air conditioning. “When I get home, I lie on the bed, put ice over my body and hope I get some sleep before returning to work,” she added.  “We used to get maybe a few days like this in August every year. Now it starts so much earlier and lasts so much longer. I have no idea why you want to come here in this heat.” Ten million tourists visit Mallorca every year, with Brits jostling with the Germans as the biggest contingent. Airlines massively inflate their fares in July and August; hotels jack up their room rates; even the tabac in central Palma felt it could get away with charging €2.50 for a small plastic bottle of chilled water. What do we get for our money? Beaches now so insanely hot they are effectively off-limits until 5.30pm or later. Hotel bedrooms where you hide from the sun with the aircon on full blast, knowing you’re contributing to climate destruction, but feeling you’ll pass out otherwise. Even Palma’s wondrous cathedral loses its charm when you’re faced with an entrance queue snaking out into the scorching midday sun, largely made up of refugees from the monstrous cruise ships in the bay. The Boeing 707, Lunn Poly and Judith Chalmers of Wish You Were Here gave us the cheap Spanish package holiday in the 1970s, and British families have been heading there ever since. Sun and cheap food and drink in Mallorca, or a washout week in Margate for about the same money? It was hardly a tough choice. Then, more recently, we’ve seen the huge expansion in weekend break tourism, encouraged by budget airlines and Airbnb. But the climate crisis changes all that. A report last month attempted to visualise its impact on various cities around the world by 2050. Both Madrid and Athens will be more like present-day Fez in Morocco, the already high temperature in summer moving up by as much as another 6.4C. I’m no stranger to the Spanish summer heat, having lived for a year in Madrid. “Seis meses invierno, seis meses infierno” is how Spanish friends described their capital’s climate. The alliteration doesn’t work in English, but it translates to “six months of winter, six months of hell”. But that was the 1980s; that “infierno” is going to be full-on Dante within a few years. Margate is beginning to look rather more attractive. Spain, apart from the booze, is no longer the super-cheap destination it once was. The pound has fallen steeply, and may become permanently depressed post-Brexit. Holidays to Spain could turn into a financial disaster, with families paying a small fortune just to sit inside their hotels to escape intolerable conditions outside. Once is bad luck. But after your second or third holiday in unbearable heat, you won’t go again. Parts of Palma have already sunk into decay, with many of the 1970s high-rises built during the package holiday boom now tawdry and dated. Will the British seaside resorts, that were so decimated by Spanish competition, revive over the next few decades? A hotel in Bournemouth could be a much better investment than a development in Benalmádena. The report, that said Madrid will be engulfed by horrifically high temperatures, suggested London’s climate will, by 2050, become like Barcelona’s today. It was unfortunately worded, given how many commenters of the Daily Mail’s report seemed to think that “if this is climate change, great, bring it on”. If the climate changes that rapidly, then it’s not clear if much of London will be above water. There is much discussion among environmentalists about how we reduce the climate impact of flights, either by rationing or by price. Maybe neither will be necessary – we won’t go, because it’s just too damn hot. p.collinson@theguardian.com"
"Here’s the problem: in two months’ time I must travel to Malawi in southern Africa to help Gumbi Education, a small, Guardian-led kids’ education charity that I chair. There’s no Skype option, no railways or boats, and travelling 3,000 miles across Egypt, Sudan, Kenya and Tanzania by bus is not recommended. I’ve cut my annual holiday flights, I’ve reduced my work travel, and my carbon footprint is nothing to what it was. But realistically, I must fly the 10,200 miles to and from Lilongwe – and I want to offset my emissions in some way. If done correctly, this should mean that I do less harm overall. But what I thought would be easy to arrange has proved a minefield. There is no agreement on how much carbon dioxide a journey may emit, confusion about what actions best reduce emissions, a huge choice of where to direct your money, and growing cynicism as airlines, airports and giant carbon-greedy corporations use offsetting to sell more flights or get permission to grow even further. A decade ago, the voluntary carbon offset market was tiny, unsophisticated and largely unregulated. The little money raised was aimed at worthwhile projects, but few schemes to cut emissions or promote development were verified or certified. Exposés, the financial crash and painfully slow progress in the UN climate talks all helped discourage individuals and companies from offsetting. But as awareness of the climate crisis has grown, corporates in particular have turned to voluntary offsetting and sent the market mainstream. Small companies have been weeded out, highly regulated global carbon and renewable energy markets have been set up, and thousands of participating companies and charities are now theoretically held to international standards by independent verifiers. As the climate emergency grows, so too does the money involved – and the need for accountability. Offsetting means calculating emissions and then purchasing equivalent “credits” from projects that prevent or remove the emissions of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. One tonne of carbon is usually the equivalent of one credit and the market for these credits, worth possibly a few tens of millions of dollars in 2007, is now valued at over $500m a year and growing fast. Even though the International Air Transport Association (IATA) says that just 1% of passengers offset their carbon emissions through voluntary programmes, there has been a 140-fold growth between 2008 and 2018, with 430 million tonnes of emission reductions generated since 2005. This is equivalent to more than all of Australia’s energy-related emissions in 2016, according to Forest Trends, a New York-based conservation finance company that tracks carbon offset projects. The company’s report, Voluntary Carbon Markets Insights, says: “Demand for voluntary carbon offsets has grown … from just 0.3 million tonnes of CO2 in 2008 to 42.8 million tonnes in 2018.” Sarah Leugers, communications director of the Geneva-based nonprofit Gold Standard, which was set up by environment group WWF, says that – paradoxically – Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris agreement transformed the market, with companies and individuals all now wanting to do the right thing in contrast. As the market matures, so the choice of ways to offset emissions increases. You can now offset rail, road and air journeys, your stay in a holiday hotel, your daily commute, your home heating – indeed you could offset the emissions of your whole life. You could have a forest of banana trees or avocados planted in Kenya, reduce the amount of methane emitted from an Indonesian waste dump, provide fresh water to Malawians, rewild Romania or reforest areas of the Amazon basin home to communities of indigenous peoples. Today, the big offset certifiers such as American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, Plan Vivo and Verra offer many hundreds of projects. To make it even more complex, the carbon price of these projects depends on where they are and the benefits they offer. Standards of verification also vary but in general are considered to be much tighter in Europe than the US. Most voluntary offsetting organisations operate as nonprofits, but few of them will spell out the fact that they might take up to 20% of what users contribute as running costs. The problem is knowing what is best. Tree planting is theoretically highly effective but some offset schemes have attracted criticism for displacing people or creating monocultures; wind and solar power projects are usually widely welcomed on a community level; capturing methane gas from waste tips and landfill sites makes total sense but is hardly attractive; and energy efficiency works best with the profligate rich. All schemes have pluses and minuses. “Offsetting must go hand in hand with an ambitious internal reduction strategy,” says Leugers. “The first priority should always be to reduce your own footprint before offsetting, but the reality is that not every individual or business can do that quickly. “Business is putting in more money, but the number of people acting individually is growing significantly. We have 1,500 projects in the pipeline. We don’t choose them; NGOs come to us. They are all independently verified. The best advice I can give is to always look for the underlying standards.” Robert Stevens of Climate Care agrees: “Until we reach a zero-carbon world … paying to reduce an equivalent amount of carbon emissions through voluntary offsetting is the most cost-effective, quickest and efficient way of doing this.”  But even trying to establish how much you emit on a journey is hard. Some offsetters take into account the extra impact of flying at an altitude above 35,000 feet; others look at the age of the aircraft type you are likely to fly in, whether you travel business class, any stop-off points and how full the plane is likely to be. As the market grows, it throws up anomalies and prompts accusations that it legitimises the growth of emissions. Twenty-nine of the most fuel-profligate airlines, including Emirates, Delta, BA, Air Canada and Gulf, now offer to offset their customers’ flights, and 15 airlines now voluntarily offset their own emissions in some capacity. According to Airport Carbon Accreditation, 43 European airports (representing 26% of European air traffic) are now certified Level 3+ neutrality, with a further 232 around the world part of the same accreditation scheme, meaning they have at least begun their journey towards reducing emissions. This allows Heathrow – which hopes that with a third runway it will be able to take an extra 265,000 flights a year – to say that it plans to use offsets to make it “carbon neutral” by 2030 and to be “zero-carbon” by 2050, even though it will build one of the world’s largest car parks and directly increase global emissions by millions of tonnes of CO2. This is wholly disingenuous, says Green MP Caroline Lucas, who describes Heathrow as “taking economy with the truth to new levels”. But there’s no doubt that companies, individuals, nonprofit groups, even cities are now using offsets to go “carbon-neutral” or even “zero carbon”. Liverpool is working with Malta-based blockchain nonprofit Poseidon to offset emissions with projects in Africa; and brands such as Disney, Microsoft, Lyft, Apple, Aviva and Sony have pledged to use offsets to become climate neutral. The bottom line is that to offset emissions, it is now possible to pay almost what you want to whom you want (though it is surprisingly difficult to calculate cruise ship emissions). The key to gauging the large-scale projects favoured by companies is to ascertain that they are real, measurable, independently verified and permanent, and would not have taken place without the finance provided by the sale of credits. Ideally, say observers, travellers should check to see whether they offer verified emission reduction (VER) credits, as offered by Gold Standard. The other approach is to use DIY offsets. This involves working out your emissions using an online calculator (see calculator tool above), then finding a project that roughly compensates (for example Gold Standard). Or you could just donate to an organisation working to suck up carbon or generate renewable energy. Many admirable environmental projects run by small energy and conservation groups do excellent work on tree planting and clean energy without always offering credits – just contributing would effectively help offset emissions. Forests Without Frontiers in Romania, Tree Aid and the Woodland Trust are personal favourites. Offsetting can work, and it allows people who have to travel to do so with a clearer conscience. But the best strategy must be to reduce your own emissions first. For his 10,200-mile round London to Lilongwe round-trip via Nairobi, John asked eight offsetting companies to calculate his CO2 emissions, how much they would cost to offset, and where the money goes. The results proved highly variable.

"A new generation of national nature reserves are being created to help improve people’s health and mitigate the effects of climatic extremes, according to the chair of the government’s conservation watchdog. The South London Downs reserve is the first in a series of landscapes that will be designated a national nature reserve this year, said Tony Juniper of Natural England. Several more will follow this autumn, including what he described as one “very significant” newly protected area.  Juniper said these new reserves highlighted his austerity-hit agency’s determination to do “the practical work of conservation” that would also help the government meet its target of net zero emissions and help England adapt to global heating. The South London Downs reserve is only the third national nature reserve to be created in the capital, and protects 417 hectares (1,030 acres) of flower-rich chalk downland on the border of Croydon and Surrey. It includes Farthing Downs and Happy valley. Juniper said: “It’s a wonderful area of natural beauty, it’s very close to where people live and another reminder of how much benefit we can get for our society through the intelligent and wise management of the natural environment and its restoration.” In a wide-ranging interview on his vision for Natural England, which he admits has been “massively depleted” by budget cuts, Juniper welcomed Boris Johnson’s reaffirmation of the emissions target and said the agency could play “a central role in helping government meet net zero”. Juniper, who has campaigned on climate change for years as former executive director of Friends of the Earth, said tackling greenhouse gas emissions had so far focused on reducing the use of fossil fuels in energy and domestic heating, and electrifying transport. But he said climate change policy and the nature conservation agenda “should be two sides of the same coin”. Restoring peatland helps capture carbon and prevent flooding, for instance, while forest restoration and wildlife-friendly food production can also sequester more carbon. Juniper also explained how natural systems can help adapt to global heating – such as planting trees in cities to lessen the urban heat island effect during heatwaves. “Improving the health of natural systems is one of our most cost-effective and effective ways of achieving adaptation to climate change,” he said. “The opportunity to harness nature-based solutions is huge but it does require quite a lot of joining up.” According to Juniper, such solutions require a coordinated effort across government and its agencies including Natural England, the Forestry Commission and the Environment Agency. Juniper said he hoped nature could be restored in England through legally binding targets similar to those for climate change, via a post-Brexit environment bill. Biodiversity would be measured using existing datasets on water quality, farmland birds, areas of flower-rich grassland and insect abundance, with successive governments committed to improvement. “It’s really about the extent to which the country wants to own that kind of long-term ambition, and I think we do,” he said. Juniper welcomed the emergence of Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes and said such mass protests helped him fight for more resources within government. “Sometimes it’s possible to think there’s some activists and a minority interest calling for big ambitious goals but actually when it appears as it is – a much more mainstream agenda – that helps enormously. When it comes to the children and the school strikes, nobody has got more moral authority than the young people who will own the consequences,” he said. Juniper’s appointment as chair of Natural England in April was a surprise, not least because the influential environmentalist was joining a beleaguered organisation whose funding has been halved over five years. Conservationist critics have attacked Natural England for licensing the badger cull and pursuing hen harrier “brood management” whereby chicks of the endangered bird of prey are removed from nests on grouse moors to help the shooting industry thrive. Juniper signalled his discomfort with the badger cull but said it was the watchdog for nature’s statutory duty to license it as the government instructed. He said: “I think it’s fair to say that Natural England would not have advised that a badger cull should be done but the reality is that we’ve been asked to do it and under the framework agreement that we have with Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] we are obliged to take forward that policy.” Critics of Natural England’s “hen harrier recovery plan” say it rewards lawbreakers, with hen harriers illegally killed to ensure there are enough red grouse to shoot. Juniper cited research by his agency that revealed tagged hen harriers mostly “disappeared” on grouse moors – strong evidence of illegal killing by grouse moor interests. “It’s pretty unequivocal that it is still a problem,” he said. But Juniper also argued that the “brood management” trial was vital to ensure shooting stakeholders assisted the hen harrier’s recovery. “We’ve got more chance of convincing those people to come on the journey if they can see that they’ve got part of what they think is the solution for them also on the table,” he said. “My only benchmark is whether the hen harrier recovers or not. That’s all I’m concerned about.” Juniper said he had not yet been promised any extra resources to help Natural England but he was determined to show that looking after the natural environment was not a cost, but “an essential investment in the future of our country”. “We know that dividend from healthy nature is bigger than ever,” he said. “This is an investment in the nation’s health but also an investment in resilience against climate change, it’s an investment in essential infrastructure in terms of flood protection and water purity and it’s also an investment in long-term food security because in the end all our food comes from nature. “Too often it’s been easy to see the environment as an inconvenience that’s getting in the way of development and progress. It’s the exact opposite – by investing in nature we make the country stronger and better.”"
"‘I no longer think of this as a technological problem. I don’t think of it as a political problem.” Alanna Mitchell is assessing the climate emergency. “I think of it as a cultural problem.” The Canadian journalist and playwright believes the arts play a key role in transforming public opinion. “That’s the way humans understand the world,” insists Mitchell. “We understand it in terms of narrative.” Some of the most successful environmental activism has used theatrical or artistic gestures to capture imaginations. Think of Extinction Rebellion’s dramatic funeral marches, or Liberate Tate’s oil spill installations. At the Edinburgh festival this month, theatre-makers are bringing the crisis to the fore, from drawing the links between colonialism and the changing climate in Kiinalik: These Sharp Tools to Tom Bailey’s meditation on the sixth mass extinction in Vigil.  Theatre is not Mitchell’s natural environment. “I’m not a performer, I’m a journalist,” she stresses. But transforming her 2010 book Sea Sick into a solo show allowed her to reach different audiences with her message about the terrifying impact of carbon emissions on our seas. “We are changing the chemistry of the ocean. And not just part of it – the whole global ocean down to a kilometre deep.” Facing the magnitude of such findings can be overwhelming. As theatre-maker Anita Rochon puts it, the climate crisis throws into question our entire existence and ways of living. Her show Pathetic Fallacy, which is playing at Edinburgh’s Canada Hub alongside Sea Sick, explores humanity’s complex relationship with the elements, from weather gods to the naming of storms, circling around the climate crisis without ever directly discussing it. Pathetic Fallacy also confronts something that eco-theatre has been coy about: the environmental impact of making and touring theatre shows. The play is taken on by a different local actor at each performance, removing the need for Rochon to jet around the world. The British theatre company Boxed In are also trying to make the way in which theatre is made more environmentally friendly. Throughout the Edinburgh fringe, their purpose-built venue The Greenhouse – constructed entirely from recycled materials and doing without mains electricity – will be hosting shows and workshops responding to the climate emergency. As part of their zero-waste commitment, the company will be marketing the programme without a single flyer. “We need to make these big leaps so that we can show it’s possible, and so that hopefully other people will take up the mantle,” says artistic director Oli Savage. At the Edinburgh international festival, meanwhile, a residency by the Royal Court theatre involves writers from Brazil, China, India, South Africa and Syria to highlight global perspectives on the climate emergency that we rarely hear in the UK.  All these theatre-makers identify a renewed sense of urgency around the climate crisis, largely thanks to the actions of the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion (which is curating a season of work at Edinburgh’s Summerhall venue). But these artists see themselves as storytellers, not activists: their role is not to provide solutions but to provoke thought. “People always ask me after my play, ‘So what’s the one thing I need to do tomorrow to make this better?’” says Mitchell, explaining that she refuses to answer. “I hope you go home and you’re awake all night trying to think about what it is that you can do.” Rochon agrees. “There’s not a bit at the end where I say, ‘Here are the resources you can check out afterwards and here’s five things that we can do,’” she says. “I think we all know what we can do.” Savage’s mindset is the same: “We’re not imparting ideas so much as inviting people to discuss ideas with us.”  Greta Thunberg has urged world leaders to “act as if our house is on fire”. But artists do not all agree. “We don’t want [audiences] to be scared and running about panicking,” says Savage, insisting on the importance of hope. The Royal Court’s international associate director Sam Pritchard agrees, observing a hint of optimism in how writers are addressing the climate crisis. “A dire prognosis is not the only artistic tone, voice or response to this subject,” he suggests. At its most ambitious, this work challenges audiences, theatres and other artists to completely rethink the system. “The way we make art now can’t be the way we continue to make art,” says Savage. “Just like the way that society functions can’t be the way that it continues to function if we’re hoping to avert this oncoming crisis.”"
"The Met Office has warned that thunderstorms and severe weather across much of the UK could cause flooding in some areas. Travel disruption was also a possibility, the forecaster said. There was a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded quickly during thundery downpours, with lightning strikes, hail and strong winds expected.  Power cuts and difficult driving conditions were also possible, and 20mm to 30mm (0.8-1.2in) of rain could fall in an hour in some areas. Met Office severe weather warnings covered swaths of England, Wales and Scotland across Tuesday and Wednesday. The area affected by Tuesday’s warning has been extended, with storms expected to hit more of the country than previously thought. Calmer conditions are forecast from Thursday, with sunny spells and occasional showers predicted for many. Last week, the UK was basking in a heatwave and a 38.7C (101.7F) reading in Cambridge set a temperature record, exceeding the previous high of 38.5C near Faversham, Kent, in August 2003. Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands also broke national heat records last week as hot weather spread across central and western Europe. Experts warn that global warming caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, which are increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is making heatwaves more likely and more intense."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here recently reminded readers of two things: 1) renewable energies are performing woefully and temperature trends for Germany are pretty much flat, meaning they do not even remotely resemble anything you’d expect from a rapidly warming globe.

A look at the “climate-rescuing” new energies
By Helmut Kuntz
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
This comment pretty much remains the same as the last one posted for October. Also in November the new energies have proven their uselessness. Supposedly they are already delivering 35% of the electric power demand – however only in the rare times that it actually gets produced.
Overall there are still no signs of a “reliable supply” and baseload capability to be seen anywhere.

Germany’s November plots for demand (red), wind power (blue) and solar power (yellow). Often both sun a wind were practically AWOL. Source: R. Schuster
If the installed green power capacity were to be tripled, then the result would look like that shown in the following chart. Consumption would still not be able to be covered – even using (currently unavailable) storage capacity. What’s glaring is the low level power yield seen in November with regards to the installed capacity. The power grids have to be designed to handle the rated installed capacity.
One can already imagine the feed-in act-related installation madness that remains ahead for Germany.

The above chart clearly shows that even a tripling of installed rated capacity to 270,000 MW would still not even come close to covering Germany’s electricity needs.
Very little warming in November since 1962
On temperature in Germany, the following chart shows the mean temperature for November, starting in 1962. A rapid heating looks much different.

Also November shows an unbelievable normalcy with respect to climate. The great breakaway change predicted by computer simulations is still nowhere in sight.

"Port Beach in Fremantle and South Thomson Bay at Rottnest Island have been identified as the top two Western Australian locations at risk of coastal erosion. In a report released on Monday, the state government listed 55 places where coastal erosion is expected to threaten homes, roads and other public assets over the next 25 years.  At Port Beach, which is among 15 hotspots in the Perth metropolitan area, this winter’s storms caused a car park to collapse and left buildings teetering on the edge. The council used earthmovers to pile up sand as a temporary protective measure but the Fremantle mayor, Brad Pettitt, said substantially pushing back existing infrastructure, including Port Beach Road, was needed in the long term. The WA government estimated the cost for managing the 55 locations could be up to $110m over the next five years and said it was seeking federal funding contributions. It is focused on seawalls and groynes, and the premier, Mark McGowan, said retreat was a last resort. McGowan said he wrote to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, about the federal government working with the states to tackle the climate crisis-related issue, which needed more than piecemeal solutions. He promised to raise the matter again at the Council of Australian Governments on Friday. “I think it deserves a national coordinated response ... [it’s] going to dramatically impact communities and infrastructure for decades if not centuries to come,” McGowan told reporters on Monday. Where industry was present, like Kwinana Beach, it would be asked to contribute, McGowan said. The tiny hamlet of Seabird north of Perth, where a seawall was built several years ago to stop homes being swallowed by the ocean, remained on the hotspot list. One of Perth’s most popular beaches, North Cottesloe, was among 31 locations that have been placed on a watch-list for future monitoring. At nearby Cottesloe Beach, billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest planned to replace the well-known landmark Indiana Tea House with a large new development, although keeping the existing building remained an option. Four ambitious designs, all including a beachside pool, have been narrowed down to two. Critics said the designs were too big and too close to the shore. A spokeswoman for Forrest’s Minderoo Group said managing environmental factors including coastal erosion was being considered as part of the design process. “Once a preferred option is chosen, it will be refined by architects and other consultants to mitigate any risks in this regard,” she said. Most of the hotspots are in the regions, including the historic China Town in Broome and Monkey Mia in the Shire of Shark Bay, which is famous for its dolphins."
"The Daily Express is calling it “the Boris effect”. Johnson’s election has reportedly caused a “record jump” in the polls for the Conservative party, with the Telegraph gleefully reporting that its prized former columnist has received the largest bounce of any Conservative leader in the past two decades. Though Tory hopes were dented by the party’s defeat in Thursday’s Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, supporters still believe Johnson is capable of winning a general election – which could happen within months.  And there are those on the newly energised right who feel that, after three years of the dour Theresa May, the sheer force of Johnson’s “personality” or “charisma” – yet to be convincingly defined – could yet bring young people into the fold and unite the country around a hard Brexit. His time as London mayor is often cited as evidence that a brand of socially liberal, business-friendly leadership can be repackaged and sold to younger voters. They are wrong. The disgust felt at the Brexit crisis that has consumed the past three years is difficult to overstate. The fanatical commitment of the Conservative membership to leaving the EU on 31 October, “do or die”, bears no resemblance to the wishes of the vast majority of young people, eight in 10 of whom want to resolve this crisis through a people’s vote. Johnson’s new cabinet, packed with Brexit purists, sends a clear message to young people: we do not represent you and we do not share your values. Faced with the choice of winning back support from the Brexit party or reaching out to unite the country, Johnson has unapologetically opted for the former. His cabinet is filled with ministers who are either deluded enough to believe no deal is a good thing or so devoid of principle, they are willing to pretend so in return for a seat at the table. A recent Barnardo’s report found that more young people think Brexit is an immediate threat to their future than is climate change. When Johnson wrote of the Extinction Rebellion protests in April that he was “utterly fed up with being told by nice young people that their opinions are more important than my own”, few would expect him to think otherwise for our concerns about Brexit. It has become clearer with each day that has passed since the 2016 referendum that Brexit – in any form – will leave us poorer, our opportunities fewer and our domestic priorities irrelevant amid the long-term political chaos that would follow. The Bank of England now warns of a one in three chance of recession – and that’s even if there is a deal. The damage to the economy is incontestable, and yet the single most destructive form of Brexit is about to be forced upon us without our consent. No prime minister championing this could even expect acquiescence from future generations, let alone support. And even if young people were in fact in favour of Brexit, they would still reject Johnson. This is a politician who, regardless of his personal beliefs, is happy to dabble in misogyny, xenophobia and homophobia as far as it appeals to those whose support he needs. This is a man who has described women wearing the burqa as “letterboxes”, claimed “voting Tory will cause your wife to have bigger breasts” and described gay men as “tank-topped bumboys”. His values are the antithesis of a forward-looking generation who want to see borders eradicated, not reimposed. It is why Stormzy got the crowd to sing “Fuck Boris” during his headline set at Glastonbury in June, and why T-shirts emblazoned with the same slogan have been selling in huge numbers since.  This is a prime minister whose cause is neither Brexit, nor Britain. It’s Boris. Johnson clearly believes that his political survival is best served by ignoring and alienating my generation, and MPs flock to him in the hope he’ll save their seat in the process. We’re under no such illusion: a Johnson premiership leaves our futures at the bottom of the pile. And if he does call a general election he’ll quickly consider the thousands of young people who protested in London on his first day in office a happy memory. Because many, many more will be sure to make themselves heard – on the streets, yes, but at the ballot box too. • Lara Spirit is co-president of Our Future Our Choice"

From about 7000 years ago to 2000 years ago, or from the Mid- to Late-Holocene, atmospheric CO2 concentrations varied between only about 260 and 270 parts per million, or ppm.  Such low CO2 concentrations are believed to be “safe” for the planet, as they are significantly lower than today’s levels, which have eclipsed 400 ppm in recent years.  These high CO2 concentrations are believed to cause dangerous warming, rapid glacier melt, and catastrophic sea level rise.
And yet, despite the surge in anthropogenic CO2 emissions and atmospheric CO2 since the 20th century began, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that global sea levels only rose by 1.7 mm/yr during the entire 1901-2010 period, which is a rate of less than 7 inches (17 cm) per century.   A new paper even suggests the global trend is better represented as closer to 1.3 mm/yr, or about 5 inches per century:
McAneney et al., 2017     “Global averaged sea-level rise is estimated at about 1.7 ± 0.2 mm year−1 (Rhein et al. 2013), however, this global average rise ignores any local land movements. Church et al. (2006) and J. A. Church (2016; personal communication) suggest a long-term average rate of relative (ocean relative to land) sea-level rise of ∼1.3 mm year.”
According to Wenzel and Schröter (2014), the acceleration rate for the sea level rise trend since 1900 has been just +0.0042 mm/yr, which is acknowledged by the authors to be “not significant” and well within the range of uncertainty (+ or – 0.0092 mm/yr) to put the overall 20th/21st century sea level rise acceleration rate at zero.
Further complicating the paradigm that contends changes in CO2 concentrations drive sea levels is the fact that ice core evidence affirms CO2 levels remained remarkably constant (fluctuating around 255 to 260 ppm) during the same period that there was an explosively fast rate of sea level rise — between 1 and 2 meters per century (about 10 times today’s rates) — between 12,000 to 8,000 years ago.    Sea levels rose by ~60 meters during those 4,000 years while CO2 levels effectively remained constant.
And casting even more doubt on the assertion that variations in CO2 drive sea level rise is the fact that there is robust paleoclimate evidence to suggest that today’s mean sea levels as well as today’s sea level rise rates are both relatively low (from a historical standpoint) and also well within the range of natural variability.  Nothing unusual is happening to sea levels today.  For even though we have evidence that modern CO2 concentrations (~405 ppm) are historically high relative to the last 10,000 years, we also possess a growing body of evidence that modern sea levels are still about 1 to 2 meters lower than they have been for most of the last 7,000 years.
The fundamental problem for the CO2-rise-causes-sea-level-rise paradigm, then, is that rising CO2 concentrations have not been correlated with rising sea levels for nearly all of the last 12,000 years.  In fact, the opposite has been observed during the last 2,000 years, or during the Late Holocene: CO2 levels have risen (gradually, then rapidly) while sea levels have fallen overall, with recent changes so modest (inches per century) that they do not override the overall trend.   In the 8,000 years before that, sea levels rose rapidly while CO2 concentrations remained flat.  Simply put, the supposed anthropogenic “signal” in sea level rise trends has largely gone undetected — a point that has been affirmed by more and more scientists.
Listed below are a collection of 35 scientific papers published since 2014 that indicate sea levels were, on average, about 1 to 2 meters higher than they are now throughout the Mid-Holocene (7,000-2,000 years ago) and even into the last millennium, with lower-than-now sea levels largely confined to the Little Ice Age period (~1300 to 1900 AD).  Links to the papers are embedded in the authors’ names and the regional locations for mean sea level are notated.

Dechnik et al., 2017 (Tropical Western Pacific)
[I]t is generally accepted that relative sea level reached a maximum of 1–1.5 m above present mean sea level (pmsl) by ~7 ka [7,000 years ago] (Lewis et al., 2013)

Zondervan, 2016    (Great Barrier Reef, Australia)
Preserved fossil coral heads as indicators of Holocene high sea level on One Tree Island [GBR, Australia] … Complete in-situ fossil coral heads have been found on beach rock of One Tree Island, a small cay in the Capricorn Group on the Great Barrier Reef. Measurements against the present low-tide mark provide a [Holocene] high stand of at least +2.85 m [above present sea levels], which can be determined in great accuracy compared to other common paleo sea-level record types like mangrove facies. The sea level recorded here is higher than most recent findings, but supports predictions by isostatic adjustment models. … Although the late Holocene high stand has been debated in the past (e.g. Belperio 1979, Thom et al. 1968), more evidence now supports a sea level high stand of at least + 1- 2 m relative to present sea levels (Baker & Haworth 1997, 2000, Collins et al. 2006, Larcombe et al. 1995, Lewis et al. 2008, Sloss et al. 2007).

Prieto et al., 2016  (Argentina, Uruguay)
Analysis of the RSL [relative sea level] database revealed that the RSL [relative sea level] rose to reach the present level at or before c. 7000 cal yr BP, with the peak of the sea-level highstand c. +4 m [above present] between c. 6000 and 5500 cal yr BP [calendar years before present] … This RSL [relative sea level] curve was re-plotted by Gyllencreutz et al. (2010) using the same index points and qualitative approach but using the calibrated ages. It shows rising sea-levels following the Last Glacial Termination (LGT), reaching a RSL [relative sea level] maximum of +6.5 m above present at c. 6500 cal yr BP [calendar years before present], followed by a stepped regressive trend towards the present.


Hodgson et al., 2016  (East Antarctica)
Rapid early Holocene sea-level rise in Prydz Bay, East Antarctica … The field data show rapid increases in rates of relative sea level rise of 12–48 mm/yr [1.2 to 4.8 meters per century] between 10,473 (or 9678) and 9411 cal yr BP in the Vestfold Hills and of 8.8 mm/yr between 8882 and 8563 cal yr BP in the Larsemann Hills. … The geological data imply a regional RSL [relative sea level] high stand of c. 8 m [above present levels], which persisted between 9411 cal yr BP and 7564 cal yr BP [calendar years before present], and was followed by a period when deglacial sea-level rise was almost exactly cancelled out by local rebound.


Dura et al., 2016  (Vancouver)
In northern and western Sumatra, GIA models predict high rates (>5 mm/year) of RSL [relative sea level] rise from ∼12 to ∼7 ka [12000 to 7000 years ago], followed by slowing rates of rise (<1 mm/year) to an RSL [relative sea level] highstand of <1 m (northern Sumatra) and ∼3 m (western Sumatra) between 6 and 3 ka [6,000-3,000 years ago], and then gradual (<1 mm/ year) RSL fall until present.


Spotorno-Oliveira et al., 2016  (Brazil)
At ~7000 cal. years BP the sea level in the bay was approximately 4 m below the present sea level and the upper subtidal benthic community was characterised by fruticose corallines on coarse soft substrate, composed mainly of quartz grains from continental runoff input. The transgressing sea rapidly rose until reaching the ~ +4 m highstand [above present] level around 5000 years BP.

Lee et al., 2016  (Southeast Australia)
The configuration suggests surface inundation of the upper sediments by marine water during the mid-Holocene (c. 2–8 kyr BP), when sea level was 1–2 m above today’s level.


Yokoyama et al., 2016  (Japan)
The Holocene-high-stand (HHS) inferred from oyster fossils (Saccostrea echinata and Saccostrea malaboensis) is 2.7 m [above present sea level] at ca. 3500 years ago, after which sea level gradually fell to present level.

May et al., 2016  (Western Australia)
Beach ridge evolution over a millennial time scale is also indicated by the landward rise of the sequence possibly corresponding to the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand of WA [Western Australia] of at least 1-2 m above present mean sea level.

Mann et al., 2016  (Indonesia)
Radiometrically calibrated ages from emergent fossil microatolls on Pulau Panambungan indicate a relative sea-level highstand not exceeding 0.5 m above present at ca. 5600 cal. yr BP [calendar years before present].

Clement et al., 2016   (New Zealand)
In North Island locations the early-Holocene sea-level highstand was quite pronounced, with RSL [relative sea level] up to 2.75 m higher than present. In the South Island the onset of highstand conditions was later, with the first attainment of PMSL being between 7000–6400 cal yr BP. In the mid-Holocene the northern North Island experienced the largest sea-level highstand, with RSL up to 3.00 m higher than present.


Long et al., 2016  (Scotland)
RSL [relative sea level] data from Loch Eriboll and the Wick River Valley show that RSL [relative sea level] was <1 m above present for several thousand years during the mid and late Holocene before it fell to present.

Chiba et al., 2016  (Japan)
Highlights: We reconstruct Holocene paleoenvironmental changes and sea levels by diatom analysis.  Average rates of sea-level rise and fall are estimated during the Holocene.  Relative sea level during Holocene highstand reached 1.9 m [higher than today] during 6400–6500 cal yr BP [calendar years before present].  The timing of this sea-level rise is at least 1000 years earlier in the Lake Inba area by Holocene uplift than previous studies.  The decline of sea-level after 4000 cal yr BP may correspond to the end of melting of the Antarctic ice sheet.

Leonard et al., 2016  (Great Barrier Reef, Australia)
Holocene sea level instability in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia … Three emergent subfossil reef flats from the inshore Keppel Islands, Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, were used to reconstruct relative sea level (RSL). Forty-two high-precision uranium–thorium (U–Th) dates obtained from coral microatolls and coral colonies (2σ age errors from ±8 to 37 yr) in conjunction with elevation surveys provide evidence in support of a nonlinear RSL regression throughout the Holocene. RSL [relative sea level] was at least 0.75 m above present from ~6500 to 5500 yr before present (yr BP; where “present” is 1950). Following this highstand, two sites indicated a coeval lowering of RSL of at least 0.4 m from 5500 to 5300 yr BP which was maintained for ~200 yr. After the lowstand, RSL returned to higher levels before a 2000-yr hiatus in reef flat corals after 4600 yr BP at all three sites. A second possible RSL lowering event of ~0.3 m from ~2800 to 1600 yr BP was detected before RSL stabilised ~0.2 m above present levels by 900 yr BP. While the mechanism of the RSL instability is still uncertain, the alignment with previously reported RSL oscillations, rapid global climate changes and mid-Holocene reef “turn-off” on the GBR are discussed.


Sander et al., 2016  (Denmark)
The data show a period of RSL [relative sea level] highstand at c. 2.2 m above present MSL [mean sea level] between c. 5.0 and 4.0 ka BP [5,000 to 4,000 years before present].  After that, RSL drops by c. 1.3 m between c. 4.0 and 3.4 ka BP to an elevation roughly 1 m above present MSL. Since then, RSL has been falling at more or less even rates. … Yu et al. (2007) present evidence for a sea-level ‘jump’ of several meters occurring at 7.6 ka bp [7600 years before present] in SE Sweden, and data suggesting RSL changes with a similar timing and magnitude were obtained for a field site in the southern Gulf of Finland (Rosentau et al., 2013). The suddenness of the RSL change has been attributed to the collapse of parts of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (Blanchon and Shaw, 1995; Carlson et al., 2007), though the global indications and the potential triggers of such a eustatic event remain inconclusive (Törnqvist and Hijma, 2012).

Bradley et al., 2016  (China)
In general, the data indicate a marked slowdown between 7 and 8 kyr BP, with sea level rising steadily to form a highstand of ~2-4 m [above present sea level] between 6 and 4 kyr BP [6000 and 4000 years before present]. This is followed by a steady fall, reaching present day levels by ~1 kyr BP.


Accordi and Carbone, 2016  (Africa)
Then, the skeletal carbonate storage on the shelf reached its maximum 5 to 4 ka BP [5000 to 4000 years before present] (Ramsay, 1995) during a highstand about 3.5 m above the present sea level, when shallow marine accommodation space was greater than at present. … A detailed sea level curve of the last 9 ka BP is reported for the Southern African coastline by Ramsay (1995), who indicates a sea level similar to that of the present (at about 6.5 ka). Ramsay also indicates successive, frequent oscillations below and above the present sea level, between a maximum of +3.5 and a minimum of -2 m. Sea level positive pulses since 7 ka BP are also documented in Siesser (1974), Jaritz et al. (1977) and Norstrom et al. (2012) for the Mozambique coast. Along the Kenyan coast, a sea level stand above the present one during the mid-Holocene is documented in many places along the coast by various authors (Hori, 1970; Toyah et al., 1973; Åse, 1981, 1987; Oosterom, 1988), where the sea level might have reached +6 m above the Kenyan Datum between 2 and 3 ka BP [2000 and 3000 years before present].


Hansen et al., 2016  (Denmark)
Continuous record of Holocene sea-level changes … (4900 years BP to present). … The curve reveals eight centennial sea-level oscillations of 0.5-1.1 m superimposed on the general trend of the RSL [relative sea level] curve [relative sea levels ~1.5 m higher than present from 1400 to 1000 years ago].

Macreadie et al., 2015  (Austalia, Eastern)
[R]esults from other studies … suggest that high-stand, at perhaps 2 m above present msl [mean sea level] was achieved as early as 7000 radiocarbon years BP [before present] (7800 cal. years BP) and that sea-level has exceeded the present value for much of the mid- to late-Holocene [~7000 to ~1000 years ago].

Lewis et al., 2015  (Australia, Northeastern)
Thick (> 10 cm) fossil oyster visors above the equivalent modern growth suggest higher relative sea-levels in the past (i.e. > 1200 cal. yr BP [prior to 1,200 years before present]). … [D]ata show a Holocene sea-level highstand of 1–2 m higher than present which extended from ca. 7500 to 2000 yr ago (Woodroffe, 2003; Sloss et al., 2007; Lewis et al., 2013). The hydro-isostatic adjustment is thought to account for these 1–2 m sea-level changes [falling] to present levels over the past 2000 yr (Lambeck and Nakada, 1990; Lambeck, 2002). … [R]eliable SLI data such as coral pavements and tubeworms from Western Australia suggest that relative sea-level was 0.86 m and 0.80 m above present at 1060 ± 10 and 1110 ± 170 cal. yr BP [~1100 calendar years before present], respectively (Baker et al., 2005; Collins et al., 2006).

Lokier et al., 2015  (Persian Gulf)
Late Quaternary reflooding of the Persian Gulf climaxed with the mid-Holocene highstand previously variously dated between 6 and 3.4 ka. Examination of the stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental context of a mid-Holocene whale beaching allows us to accurately constrain the timing of the transgressive, highstand and regressive phases of the mid- to late Holocene sea-level highstand in the Persian Gulf.  Mid-Holocene transgression of the Gulf surpassed today’s sea level by 7100–6890 cal yr BP, attaining a highstand of > 1 m above current sea level shortly after 5290–4570 cal yr BP before falling back to current levels by 1440–1170 cal yr BP.  These new ages refine previously reported timings for the mid- to late Holocene sea-level highstand published for other regions. By so doing, they allow us to constrain the timing of this correlatable global eustatic event more accurately.


Harris et al., 2015   (Great Barrier Reef, Australia)
This hiatus in sediment infill coincides with a sea-level fall of ∼1–1.3 m during the late Holocene (ca. 2000 cal. yr B.P.), which would have caused the turn-off of highly productive live coral growth on the reef flats currently dominated by less productive rubble and algal flats, resulting in a reduced sediment input to back-reef environments and the cessation in sand apron accretion. Given that relative sea-level variations of ∼1 m were common throughout the Holocene, we suggest that this mode of sand apron development and carbonate production is applicable to most reef systems.
Microatoll death was most likely caused by a fall in sea level that stranded the microatolls on the reef flat due to their location in open-water unmoated environments. This suggests that paleo–sea level between 3900 and 2200 cal. yr B.P. was 1–1.3 m higher than present (based on an offset from MLWS tidal level to fossil microatoll elevation; Fig. 2). This paleo–sealevel elevation is similar to the ranges of 1–1.5 m suggested by Lewis et al. (2013) and Sloss et al. (2007) and data from Moreton Bay in southern Queensland of an elevation of 1.3 m (Leonard et al., 2013).


Hein et al., 2015  (Brazil)
In southern Brazil, falling RSL [relative sea level] following a 2–4 m [above present sea level] highstand at 5 to 6 ka [5,000 to 6,000 years ago] forced coastal progradation. … Relative SL [sea level] along the southern Brazil coast reached a highstand elevation of 1–4 m above MSL [mean sea leve] at ca. 5.8 ka [5800 years ago].

Barnett et al., 2015  (Arctic Norway)
Relative sea-level fell at −0.7 to −0.9 mm yr−1 over the past 3300 years in NW Norway. … Prior to 3000 cal yr BP the marine limiting date represents an important constraint for the late Holocene sea-level trend and yields a minimum RSL [relative sea level] decline of approximately 2.2 m over 3200 years when assuming a linear trend. The maximum possible linear decline constrained by the data is approximately 2.6 m in 2800 years, providing an estimated late Holocene sea-level trend of 0.7 to 0.9 mm yr (shown by the grey shaded region in Fig. 8A).  [Relative sea level was 2.2 to 2.8 m higher ~3,000 years ago in Arctic Norway]


Engel et al., 2015  (Western Australia)
The foredunes overlie upper beach deposits located up to >2 m above the present upper beach level and provide evidence for a higher mid-Holocene RSL [relative sea level]. …  [O]bservations made near Broome by Lessa and Masselink (2006) [indicate] the deposition of backshore deposits up to c. 1.5 m above present MHW [mean high water] between c. 2100–800 cal BP [2100-800 calendar years before present].


Reinink-Smith, 2015  (Kuwait)
[B]ased on bottle characteristics, glass bottles within the debris zonemwere manufactured mostly between 1940 and 1960 (some as early as the 1920s), indicating high tides were more common in the recent past. … The normal tidal cycle affects only a narrow 0.6–0.7 km-wide band parallel to the coast when the prevailing wind (the Shamal) is from the northwest (Gunatilaka, 1986). Within this narrow zone, washed-up glass bottles were manufactured more recently than ~1960 and are not frosted. None of these new [made after 1960] bottles were found near the beach ridges … [A]ssuming the tidal ranges were similar in the middle Holocene, a rough estimate of the MSL [mean sea level] during the middle Holocene highstand is 5.2 m − 1.7 m = +3.5 m above the present MSL [mean sea level]. … The +3.5 m highstand estimate in northeastern Kuwait derived in this study is also higher than the previously reported maximum estimates of +2 to +2.5 m responsible for other Holocene beach ridges in the Arabian Gulf (Gunatilaka, 1986; Lambeck, 1996; Kennett and Kennett, 2007; Jameson and Strohmenger, 2012). Some beach ridges in Qatar and Abu Dhabi are at elevations of 2–4 m above MSL [present mean sea level] as far as 5-15 km inland (Alsharhan and Kendall, 2003).

Rashid et al., 2014  (French Polynesia)
Upon correction for isostatic island subsidence, we find that local relative sea level was at least ~1.5±0.4 m higher than present at ~5,400 years ago.


Strachan et al., 2014  (South Africa)
During the last 7000 years, southern African sea levels have fluctuated by no more than ±3 m. Sea-level curves based on observational data for southern Africa indicate that Holocene highstands occurred at 6000 and again at 4000 cal years BP, followed by a lowstand from 3000 to 2000 cal years B P. The mid-Holocene highstands culminated in a sea-level maximum of approximately 3 m above mean sea level (MSL) from 7300 to 6500 cal years BP [calendar years before present] and of 2 m above MSL at around 4000 cal years BP.  Thereafter, RSL dropped to slightly below the present level between 3500 and 2800 cal years BP.  Sea-level fluctuations during the late Holocene in southern Africa were relatively small (1-2 m); however, these fluctuations had a major impact on past coastal environments.  Evidence from the west coast suggests that there was a highstand of 0.5 m above MSL from 1500 to 1300 cal years BP [calendar years before present] or possibly earlier (1800 cal years BP), followed by a lowstand (-0.5 m above MSL) from 700 to 400 cal years BP [during the Little Ice Age].


Yamano et al., 2014 (Southwest Pacific Ocean)
Mba Island initially formed around ~ 4500 cal yr B.P. [4500 calendar years before present], when sea level was ~ 1.1 m higher than at present. 


Kench et al., 2014  (Central Pacific Ocean)
[T]he mid-Holocene [sea level] highstand is reported to have peaked at approximately +1.1 m above present and was sustained until approximately 2000 years B.P. [before present] in the Marshall Islands.


Hein et al., 2014  (Brazil)
Along the eastern and southern Brazilian coasts of South America, 6000 years of sea-level fall have preserved late-stage transgressive and sea-level highstand features 1–4 m above present mean sea level and several kilometers landward of modern shorelines.


Bracco et al., 2014  (Uruguay)
Highlights:  We present a sea level change curve for mid Holocene in Uruguay.  Sea level reached 4 m amsl [above present mean sea level] between 6000 and 5500 yr BP [before present].   A rapid sea level fall to about 1 m amsl [above present mean sea level] was inferred for 4700-4300 yr BP.  A further sea level increase to about 3 m amsl [above present mean sea level] was inferred after 4300 yr BP.  After 4300 yr BP there was a constant sea level a decline.


Holocene Sea Levels Rose Much Faster With Stable CO2 Levels

Khan et al., 2017  (Caribbean)
Only Suriname and Guyana [Caribbean] exhibited higher RSL [relative sea level] than present (82% probability), reaching a maximum height of ∼1 m at 5.2 ka [5,200 years ago]. … Because of meltwater input, the rates of RSL change were highest during the early Holocene, with a maximum of 10.9 ± 0.6 m/ka [10.9 meters per 1000 years, 1.9 meters per century] in Suriname and Guyana and minimum of 7.4 ± 0.7 m/ka [7.4 meters per 1000 years, 0.74 meters per century] in south Florida from 12 to 8 ka [12,000 to 8,000 years ago].

Zecchin et al., 2015 (Mediterranean)
Episodic, rapid sea-level rises on the central Mediterranean shelves after the Last Glacial Maximum: A review … The evidence presented here confirms drowned shorelines documented elsewhere at similar water depths and shows that melt-water pulses have punctuated the post-glacial relative sea-level rise with rates up to 60 mm/yr. [6 meters per century] for a few centuries. 

Boski et al., 2015 (Brazil)
A rapid sea-level rise, at an averaged rate of approximately 6.1 mm/yr [0.6 m per century], occurred between 8300 and 7000 cal. yr BP [8300-7000 calendar years before present]. Since then, the pace of relative sea-level rise slowed and non-eustatic factors, namely terrigenous sediment supply and coastal dynamics, became dominant in the evolution of the estuary.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEmissions trading was set up to entice fossil fuel intense companies to reduce their CO2 emissions, and thus in this way help bring atmospheric CO2 concentrations to a standstill, and thus rescue the climate, according to the man-made global warming theory.

New report by Carbon Market Watch shows large corporations raking in billions in CO2 emissions trading scheme.
However, things aren’t quite working out that way. Spiegel here cites a comprehensive report by the non-government organization Carbon Market Watch (CMW), which concludes that large companies are in fact making billions from free emissions certificates, and CO2 emissions aren’t improving at all.
The European large industry have managed to squeeze out 25 billion over the past years through special rights in the EU emissions trading system.”
The study looked at the 20 strongest countries from 2008 to 2015, Spiegel writes.
Easy money
Agnes Brandt of the CMW comments:
The figures show how easy it is to make money from pollution and just much the lobby-watered-down CO2 trading system has failed.”

Little wonder that so money companies happily adopted the climate protection and CO2 scam. Many have gotten rich from it without having to produce anything tangible for society to benefit from.
And who pays for the 25 billion? Billy Bob Blow and Jane Blow, of course.
Little wonder voters are voting to “blow up the whole goddamn system” with a “human Molotov cocktail“. And why not, after all? It. Is. Corrupt.
Growing resentment
In Europe too there is an intensifying aura out there that is telling us that more politicians are about to get the message, loud and clear –and big time. The energy system in much of Europe has gotten dearly expensive, unstable and now poses a real and gathering threat to the jobs and livelihoods of millions in the working class. The citizenry has been deceived and screwed over by a climate science scam, and they are not going to take it much longer.
Already tens of thousands of highly skilled, well-paid workers in the automotive and energy industries in Germany alone are seeing their jobs get slashed. And they do have a means of delivering the second biggest FU in history – with a vote for Le Pen in France, or for the emerging hard right wing parties in Germany, Austria and elsewhere.
The biggest earners from the scam, according to the report and Spiegel, are the steel and iron industry, cement, refineries and petrochemicals – to name a few. They are closing down and moving out their operations, and getting paid to do so.
And the working class? They’re getting angry, yet being scolded for doing so — being cast out as “deplorables” or irredeemables”, or even far worse. This can’t and won’t continue.

"The teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has hit back at the Australian News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt for writing a deeply offensive column that mocked her autism diagnosis. The Swedish schoolgirl posted a tweet overnight calling out the “hate and conspiracy campaigns” run by climate deniers like Bolt, adopting his insult that she was “deeply disturbed” and turning it back on him.  The widely read Herald Sun columnist and Sky News commentator used his significant platform to take aim at the 16-year-old campaigner, dismissing her followers as members of a cult and disparaging her decision to sail across the Atlantic in a high-speed racing yacht to attend UN climate summits in the US and Chile. “Thunberg has announced she’s finally going to the United States, the last bastion of the heathen, to preach the global warming faith to the Americans,” Bolt wrote. “Of course, she’s going by racing yacht, because she refuses to fly and heat the planet with an aeroplane’s global warming gasses.” I am indeed ”deeply disturbed” about the fact that these hate and conspiracy campaigns are allowed to go on and on and on just because we children communicate and act on the science. Where are the adults? pic.twitter.com/xDSlN0VgtZ The highly personal character assassination published in Rupert Murdoch’s tabloids repeatedly referred to Greta’s mental health, saying she was “deeply disturbed”, “freakishly influential” and “strange”. “I have never seen a girl so young and with so many mental disorders treated by so many adults as a guru,” Bolt wrote. “Far more interesting is why so many adults – including elected politicians, top business leaders, the Pope and journalists – treat a young and strange girl with such awe and even rapture. “Her intense fear of the climate is not surprising from someone with disorders which intensify fears.” Bolt even described Greta’s younger sister as having “a spectacular range of mental issues”. But the campaigner sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. The teenager, whose solo protest last year sparked the Fridays for Future global school climate strike movement, is taking a year off school to attend the summits, on 23 September in New York and 2-13 December in Santiago. Bolt said Greta was wrong on climate change because “the evidence does not suggest that humanity faces doom”.  B*lt goes for Greta & pathologises her. What a low blow. Must be feeling some relevance deprivation syndrome to attack a smart, articulate teen girl who is uniquely & effectively connecting with the masses on one of the big intergenerational matters for our times. But whatev. https://t.co/hICf4cwgqq The editor of the Herald Sun, Damon Johnston, did not respond to a request for comment. Attacks on the teenager are commonplace in the rightwing media. On the same day Bolt’s column appeared an anonymous column in the News Corp broadsheet the Australian referred to Greta as “the pig-tailed soothsayer”."
"Millions of Americans don’t know who John Delaney or John Hickenlooper are. They probably wouldn’t be able to correctly identify them in a photo. And yet, at the Democratic debate on Tuesday night, Delaney got to speak for nearly 11 minutes, and John Hickenlooper for almost nine. In one night, those two relatively unknown men combined got more airtime than the climate crisis has in all three debates thus far. And that’s despite the fact that, if we don’t do anything to address rising temperatures now, we will see several US cities underwater in the coming decades. So here’s my pitch: if these and other candidates without a shot in hell at winning actually cared about the future of this country, they would drop out.  There are plenty of substantive differences among the viable candidates that deserve to be explored in depth, on just about every issue raised at Tuesday’s debate – healthcare, immigration, climate, gun violence – plus many more. And while it’s great for the ratings of networks like CNN, it’s not exactly a boon to American democracy to watch a stage flanked with unrecognizable C-list primary hopefuls pad their own egos because they’re rich or well-connected enough to meet the debate criteria. That’s not to say that there isn’t a case to be made for long-shot candidates. Though Jay Inslee is unlikely to get the nomination, his detailed climate policy releases are invaluable resources for any future administration and set a high standard for other candidates on an issue that growing numbers of Americans are deeply concerned about. And I’m one of many that would love to see the Alaska senator-turned-internet-phenomenon Mike Gravel appear on stage and give voice to the millions of teens who are unable to vote. The DNC shouldn’t limit the field with stricter criteria to keep them out. But Delaney and other visionless outliers should have the humility to know that they’re adding next to nothing to the conversation besides hot air. And moderators should have the good sense not to let them drone on, let alone pivot whole debate topics around them. Consider the start of Tuesday night’s all-too-brief exchange on climate. In one of a long string of questions that might as well have been crafted by a Republican strategist, the moderator Jake Tapper asked Delaney what he thinks is unrealistic about the Green New Deal, a policy framework that most frontrunners, besides Joe Biden, have endorsed. The result was an extended detour into his half-baked plan for a bipartisan carbon tax and experimental technologies. You wouldn’t be wrong to say my frustration with Delaney and his ilk is a little misplaced; please forgive the weariness of a politics writer staring down the barrel of another 16 months of the horse race. But if progressives like me are angry with people like Delaney and Hickenlooper – who hold close ties to the healthcare and mining industry, respectively – it’s because they and their friends already enjoy such outsized influence over our political system. It’s thanks in no small part to the lobbying of the healthcare industry Delaney defended in the debate that America’s healthcare system is as broken as it is, and why this country hasn’t managed to catch up with other wealthy nations in providing care to everyone who needs it. It’s thanks to Hickenlooper’s buddies in the oil and gas sector that we’re only now even starting to have a serious conversation about what it will look like to curb climate breakdown at the scale that challenge deserves. It’s also for those reasons that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren’s gloves-off approach to these problems and the millionaires driving them is so appealing, to young Democrats especially. We’ve heard enough from elites dipping their toes into politics when it suits them. Instead, we want candidates who will call the one per cent’s influence over our politics and economy what it is: absurd, undemocratic and even – as Sanders said of the fossil fuel industry tonight – criminal.

"The Morrison government’s main climate change policy, the emissions reduction fund, has been labelled “a joke” after its latest auction bought cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas pollution. While the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced prior to the election that the policy would get an additional $2bn funding, the first post-election auction from the fund dedicated less than $1m to just three emissions reduction projects. Combined, the three projects are promised to cut emissions by 59,000 tonnes over a decade – just 0.06% of the 100m-tonne cut Morrison said the rebadged “climate solutions” fund would deliver as part of a government plan to meet the target set at the Paris climate summit. It will reinforce the expert view that Australia will not meet its Paris commitment under current policy settings. Australia’s emissions have risen each year since the Coalition replaced a carbon price scheme with the emissions reduction fund. The result is the worst of nine auctions using the fund, under which landowners and businesses bid for taxpayers’ support for projects to reduce emissions at lowest cost. The Clean Energy Regulator, the government agency that runs the fund, said the auction marked an important milestone “as the carbon market gears up”. The three contracts it signed will cost $840,000, at an average of $14.17 a tonne of carbon dioxide reduction. Richie Merzian, from progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, said the result “looked like a joke”. “This is the central mechanism for reducing Australia’s emissions and it purchases a minuscule amount. What’s the point of topping it up with $2bn?” he said. “The only thing the climate solutions fund solved was the government’s re-election. It sure won’t solve Australia’s rising emissions with this miserly effort.” The minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, said across nine auctions the government had signed contracts for 780 projects that would deliver 192m tonnes in cuts over a decade. He suggested the result of the latest auction, held on 24 and 25 July, was affected by Labor promising to abolish the fund if it won power at the election. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said the fund “was never anything but a fig leaf”. “This shows Scott Morrison and the Liberals have a disastrous climate change policy,” he said. The Carbon Market Institute, representing businesses holding contracts for 70% of the emissions cuts contracted under the fund, said the auction result highlighted the need to reboot Australia’s climate policies. The institute’s chief executive, John Connor, said it was a “surprisingly small” result even after factoring in uncertainties about the fund’s operation and an expectation that Labor would win the election and change national climate policy. He said the government was trying to improve and expand the fund but it should create a better carbon market by strengthening the “safeguard mechanism”, which was promised to limit emissions from big industry but under which companies have largely been allowed to nominate their own pollution level, leading to increases. In a statement, the Clean Energy Regulator said it had rejected several bids of more than $15 a tonne of emissions reduction as they were not considered “value for money in the current environment”. Bret Harper, the director of research at analyst firm RepuTex, said the regulator had faced a choice: to either pay more per tonne of carbon dioxide and make deeper cuts, or to maintain the current price. He said it should have paid more. “The price point is wrong,” Harper said. “At this rate they are in danger of having more abatement cancelled [through contracts from earlier auction rounds not being fulfilled] than they are contracting.” Taxpayers have so far paid out $564m and committed another $1.74bn, with $237m of historic funding yet to be spent. In February, Morrison promised an additional $2bn funding over 10 years, but that was stretched to 15 years in the pre-election budget. Just $149m has been allocated over the next four years. A Guardian investigation last year found while projects supported by the fund have merit, particularly those that restore native vegetation, it is difficult to know what taxpayers are getting for their money. Some methodologies paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have had any cuts more than wiped out by increases in pollution allowed elsewhere. The government says it will cut emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030. The independent Climate Change Authority recommended Australia should make a cut of 45% to 63% over this period. David Parker, the regulator’s chairman, said the agency looked “forward to working closely with participants and industry to explore new and innovative ways to implement the climate solutions fund”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve written on a couple of occasions about how some in the German government are demanding that Germany start banning the internal combustion engine already by 2030 and switch to electric cars — a radical proposal to say the least.
Some two weeks ago the online FOCUS magazine commented on this here, writing, however, that “the electric car is an economic disaster” and that some experts believe that the “German automotive industry has no chance to survive“.
It needs to be mentioned that the German auto industry is the backbone of the German economy, as it is directly and indirectly responsible for 1 of every 5 jobs. This makes it the logical place to begin for any anyone harboring a desire to destroy the German industrial base.
FOCUS quotes future expert Stephan Rammler:
Replacing 40 million internal combustion engine cars with 40 million electric cars makes no sense. As long as we have no closed loop economy, the electrification and digitalization will lead to an economic disaster.”
Rammler then goes on to predict that the German auto industry would never survive such a transformation because the competition in Asia is already able to make products that are just as good, citing Borgward or Lynk & Co., who are already planning to sell in Germany.

According to auto industry expert Professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, 250,000 German jobs of a total of 800,000 directly in the auto industry are at risk, especially jobs with mid-size automotive suppliers.
In a video posted by FOCUS here, Sebastian Viehmann explains that the lost jobs would result from the simplification of the cars. For example an internal combustion engine has some 1200 parts, while an electric motor has only 17. Suppliers for the individual parts and assemblies would no longer be needed. Also electric cars would become such a simple product that they could be snapped up at a supermarket in the same way a shopper buys a toaster. Automotive dealerships and repair shops would become redundant.
When looking at self-driving, autonomous cars, the insurance industry would also end up losing lots of business. In the event of an accident, the manufacturer would be liable, and not the driver. Many drivers would likely welcome that.
A lot of these changes of course can be viewed as advantages for the consumers, and highly skilled workers would be freed up to focus on other technical challenges and development.
But there are still the questions surrounding range and batteries, and the environmental impacts the manufacture and disposal of the batteries would have. Moreover, does it make sense to rush in a panic into a technology that is still a long way from being feasible? Perhaps a gradual, flexible transition over 50 – 75 years would make more sense.
Furthermore, internal combustion engines have made great strides when it comes to efficiency and cleanliness. In some categories they offer huge advantages.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI was a bit hesitant to write about this because it could lead to trouble for the person with the courage to speak up. After all, we’d hate to see riots, violence and rabid fits of shouting.
But the good fight must be fought, and we must never be forced into silence – even when our livelihoods depend on it.
German Parliamentarian and physicist Dr. Philipp Lengsfeld of Angela Merkel’s (once) conservative CDU party gave a short talk last year at the 10th IKEK international climate and energy conference late last year in Berlin.

Dr. Lengsfeld, the son of human rights, anti-Communism activist Vera Lengsfeld, sees the green movement for what it really is: an oppressive system designed to strip the individual liberties from citizens.
Skeptics, EIKE, doing “a service to science and democracy”
The European Institute fro Climate and Energy, which co-hosted the conference and posted the video, wrote:
He compares the ideals of communism to those of the climate rescue ideology, namely rescuing mankind from itself and leading it collectively to paradise conditions – if only it would surrender its rights and the dignity of individualism. Both of these can be achieved only by dictatorship and Lengsfeld calls them criminal – even with respect to those stated in climate ideology.”
At the 1:50 mark he thanks EIKE and reminds the audience that “science and democracy thrive from the same basis: freedom, creativity and competition”…
Autocracy, on the other hand, lives from conformity, solidarity and brutal selfishness when it comes to asserting their own interests. Therefore it is totally clear to me that you are performing a service to science and to democracy.” And for that my deepest thanks.”
He then adds that the skeptics are indeed “up against an autocratic system” of the likes of the former Communist regimes and that there are in fact many similarities between the climate movement and the communist regimes.
Climate science a dangerous mixture of dogma

He warns that the climate science is fraught with “belief and dogma“, what he calls “a very dangerous mixture“. He adds that although renewable energy sources have positive points, we now find ourselves in “a system of dogmas that has become complete certainty and that any thing else is wrong“.
He says that Germany’s attempt to be a leader in renewable energy has completely missed the target and has failed.
We are surrounded by interest-driven dogmatists who have staked a claim on morality and belittled anyone who challenges.”
His advice to skeptics on this is to continue doing what we are doing, but warns:
Please stay scientific. Do not make the mistake of multiplying everything by minus one. That is not going to work. You may get some short term success here and there, but I think it is not the right strategy.”
Let’s get loud
He then calls “evidence-driven policy” and illusion:
If you are honest, policymaking means evidence considering. […] Evidence-driven implies already an eternal truth, it already implies that one sole solution is needed and that it is only necessary to give it to the Parliamentarians and insist that it is what you have to do and everything will be fine. But it doesn’t work that way. That’s not how the world is. That is not how people are. That’s not how science is.”
Lengsfeld advises skeptics to continue with a “fair discussion, a balanced discussion, but certainly not with a quiet discussion“.
Lengsfeld is optimistic, and believes the skeptics actually will have an easy time because the opponents have “run afoul.”
Look like “idiots”
Lengsfeld believes that climate science likely will go the same way as continental drift, where continents were once believed to be fixed on the globe, and that Alfred Wegener was eventually proven to be correct by claiming they were moving. Today, Lengsfeld said, everyone says that the scientists insisting on static continents now look like “idiots.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs Europe and USA brace for more frigid weather, some are asking if this is what we need to expect to cope with in the future.
Now it’s clear that the recent “record warm” 2 years had little to do with CO2, and instead were almost entirely due to the well-known El-Nino phenomenon over the past two years.
And now that the recent El Nino has disappeared, temperatures globally are in a free fall and back at levels of the previous decade and indications show a further  drop.

The ENSO now in cool phase
Unfortunately even that enhanced layer of CO2 we have in the atmosphere was not able to trap any of the recent heat. The 20-year pause remains pretty much intact, and will be extended as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) hovers near the cooling La Nina territory.
Note that it will take the cooler equatorial Pacific surface temperatures a few months to make there way into the lower tropospheric satellite data. Don’t be surprised if this year we see a repeat of 1999.
Last El Nino not really warmer than 1998
Dr. Roy Spencer here wrote that 2016 will in fact NOT be statistically warmer of any significance compared to 1998.
According to global warming theory, the earth is supposed to warm some 2.0 to 4.5°C by 2100, which means 0.2 – 0.45°C per decade. So shouldn’t the recent El Nino have warmed the globe some 0.4 to 0.8°C more than 1998? Not even close, as the speedometer below shows! For hardcore warmists, it is increasingly becoming a huge challenge to explain the glaring lack of warming so far this century.

German weather and climate analysis site wobleibtdieerderwaermung here writes on this:
The IPCC climate models for the temperature development have been way too high with their estimation as the comparison of the model calculations to the real, observed development recorded by satellite for January 2001 to Juni 2016.
The Global Warming Speedometer for January 2001 to June 2016 shows observed warming on the HadCRUT4 and NCEI surface temperature datasets as below IPCC’s least prediction in 1990 and somewhat on the low side of its 1995 and 2001 predictions, while the satellite datasets show less warming than all IPCC predictions from 1990 to 2001. Later IPCC predictions are too recent to be reliably testable. Source: Is the Reuters “news” agency committing fraud?“
North Atlantic is cooling
Things also do not bode well for the global warming alarmists in the Atlantic as well, as Kenneth Richard pointed out here yesterday: “North Atlantic Cooling Has Plunged Below 1950s (And 1800s) Levels – And Scientists Project More Cooling“.

"Switching just some of the huge subsidies supporting fossil fuels to renewables would unleash a runaway clean energy revolution, according to a new report, significantly cutting the carbon emissions that are driving the climate crisis. Coal, oil and gas get more than $370bn (£305bn) a year in support, compared with $100bn for renewables, the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) report found. Just 10-30% of the fossil fuel subsidies would pay for a global transition to clean energy, the IISD said.  Ending fossil fuel subsidies has long been seen as vital to tackling the climate emergency, with the G20 nations pledging in 2009 to phase them out, but progress has been limited. In May, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, attacked subsidies, saying: “What we are doing is using taxpayers’ money – which means our money – to boost hurricanes, to spread droughts, to melt glaciers, to bleach corals. In one word: to destroy the world.” The new analysis shows how redirecting some of the fossil fuel subsidies could decisively tip the balance in favour of green energy, making it the cheapest electricity available and instigating a rapid global rollout. “Almost everywhere, renewables are so close to being competitive that [a 10-30% subsidy swap] tips the balance, and turns them from a technology that is slowly growing to one that is instantly the most viable and can replace really large amounts of generation,” said Richard Bridle of the IISD. “It goes from being marginal to an absolute no-brainer.” The transition from polluting fossil fuels to clean energy is already under way. Annual investment in renewables has been greater than that in fossil fuel electricity generation since 2008 and new renewable capacity has exceeded fossil fuel power each year since 2014. But progress is slow compared with the urgency required, said Bridle. “There is no question that renewables can power the energy system,” he said. “The question now is can we transition quickly enough away from fuels like coal, and subsidy reform is a very obvious step towards that.” Very few ways of cutting emissions actually save governments money, he said. “Taking away subsidies from fossil fuels and channelling them towards clean energy would boost their development at a much faster pace, and help secure our climate goals,” said Ipek Gençsü of the Overseas Development Institute. An added bonus is the social and economic benefits, such as reduced air pollution and health spending, she said. “A key breakthrough [in the energy transition] could occur if countries cut their fossil fuel subsidies, which are propping up dirty energy,” said Rana Adib, the executive secretary of the global sustainable energy network REN21. A recent REN21 report found 112 nations subsidised fossil fuel prices. Reform of fossil fuel subsidies could have a significant impact on global heating. An earlier IISD study of 20 countries with large fossil fuel subsidies found that a 30% swap to renewables would lead to emissions reductions of between 11% and 18%. Most experts define fossil fuel subsidies as financial or tax support for those buying fuel or the companies producing it. The IMF also includes the cost of the damage fossil fuel burning causes to climate and health, leading to an estimate of $5.2tn of fossil fuel subsidies in 2017, or $10m a minute. Ending the subsidies would cut global emissions by about a quarter, the IMF estimates, and halve the number of early deaths from fossil fuel air pollution. Bridle said funding fossil fuel subsidies was “madness”, but said ending them could cause short-term price rises and political difficulties, as the benefits of lower costs in the future and reduced air pollution are less obvious. “There are political problems but it is worth persevering because the prize is so big,” he said. “You have to bring people along with you.” Gençsü said governments must ensure that the most vulnerable people were not adversely affected by changes. Fossil fuel subsidies are most prominent in oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia, which subsidises petrol, and some coal-using countries such as Indonesia, which caps the cost of the fuel at 75% of the market rate. Some nations are making progress, with India cutting petrol subsidies by about 75% since 2014, according to the IISD."
"If your attention during the Women’s World Cup was on the pitch rather than the players, you might have noticed that the matches were all played on real grass. That was a hard-won change, made after the US team complained to Fifa that they sustained more injuries on artificial turf. In private gardens, however, the opposite trend is happening: British gardens are being dug up and replaced with plastic grass. But this isn’t the flaky, fading stuff on which oranges were once displayed at the greengrocer. Today’s artificial grass is nearly identical to the real thing.  With products named after beautiful places – Lake District, Valencia – modern artificial turf mimics not just the mottled colouring and shape of grass blades, but the warm springiness of earth. Unlike the grass itself, the market is growing. Dozens of specialist firms now market fake grass as a replacement for garden lawns. UK sales surged during last year’s record summer temperatures, according to the industry journal Hortweek, while a report by Up Market Research valued the global market at $2.5bn (£2bn) in 2016 and forecasts a “staggering” rise to $5.8bn by 2023. Andy Driver, sales and marketing director for the artificial turf supplier Evergreens UK, says that as artificial grass has become much cheaper and more realistic, it now appeals to a wide range of people: city residents with shaded gardens where grass doesn’t grow well, or to carpet urban rooftops and balconies; families with children or dogs who don’t want a muddy mess; older or disabled people who struggle to maintain a garden; schools and nurseries where playgrounds get heavy use. For many people, he says, there is a social pressure to “keep up with the Joneses” by having a perfectly trimmed, green lawn all year round. Perhaps aware of another kind of social pressure, some firms pitch their products as eco-friendly alternatives. For example, Royal Grass says its environmentally friendly turf, called Eco-Sense, is recyclable (“in other words, cradle-to-cradle”) and declares that it “has the look and feel of natural grass, but outperforms its natural source of inspiration”: “‘Green’ is a premium goal in our quest on how we can make our artificial grass more sustainable. This starts at the beginning of the process, with the careful selection of the raw materials that are used to produce the grass blades.” But while the fake grass might indeed be greener, at least in colour, its environmental impacts are difficult to gloss over. Paul Hetherington, fundraising director for the charity Buglife, says artificial turf is far from an eco-friendly alternative to natural grass. “It blocks access to the soil beneath for burrowing insects, such as solitary bees, and the ground above for soil dwellers such as worms, which will be starved of food beneath it,” he says. “It provides food for absolutely no living creatures.” This is a particular concern in view of the dramatic global decline in insect species. The UK is on course to miss its own targets for protecting its natural spaces, and has lost 97% of its wildflower meadows in a single generation. It is not just wildlife that artificial turf affects. The Committee on Climate Change recommends rewilding a huge area of UK land and growing many more trees to help tackle global heating by storing carbon. Not only does fake grass have no climate benefits, but producing the plastic emits carbon and uses fossil fuels. The common practice of replacing soil with sand to provide a more stable bed for the fake grass also releases even more CO2 stored in the earth, according to David Elliott, chief executive of tree-planting charity Trees for Cities. There is also the matter of microplastics: the tiny particles of plastic that have made their way throughout the globe, and are present in our food, water and even the air. Evergreen UK’s turf is made mainly of polyethylene, with polypropylene and polyamide for some purposes. Driver claims the microplastics problem does not affect the artificial grass industry because it doesn’t sell single-use products. “Our products don’t degrade, we’ve always not had it as an issue, basically.” He adds that products from legitimate firms conform to standards set by the industry. Madeleine Berg, project manager at the environmental charity Fidra, counters that most plastics are likely to contribute to microplastics through physical and chemical degradation, such as being stepped on and exposed to constant sunlight. “You would be hard-pressed to say that you have created a product which doesn’t shed anything,” says Berg. There are also growing concerns about the impact of the synthetic chemicals that are added to artificial grass on human health and the environment. The EU has been investigating specialist artificial turf used on sports fields for suspected carcinogens, and is considering banning intentionally added microplastics. While these are different products to those sold to home gardeners, Berg says artificial pitches are sometimes reused for landscaping. And what happens to fake grass when it reaches the end of its life in 10-20 years? Unlike Royal Grass, Evergreens UK doesn’t market itself as eco-friendly, a term Driver calls “a little bit misleading”, but he is keen to stress that his company’s products can be recycled. However, this can only be done at specialist plants in Europe and it is doubtful that many customers would go the extra mile. Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), says there is a place for artificial turf as an alternative to paving slabs, gravel and particularly concrete, which is its own environmental nightmare. “Hard landscaping can be very expensive, and people fancy a bit of green in a small garden. We’ve even laid a bit [of artificial grass] ourselves. “But I don’t think that for all but specialised purposes that it really compares with [real] grass. Not only does it not provide any of the environmental benefits of grass – like soaking up moisture, home for insects, feeding birds, self-sustaining – its life isn’t that long. It gets trampled on and quite soon looks poor. It can’t be relaid or reseeded; it has to be rolled up, lifted and sent to landfill.” Barter concedes that the root of the problem is social pressure for a perfect green lawn. “In the mindset of the British public you haven’t really got a garden unless you’ve got a lawn,” he says. “And I think a lot of people are put off by lawns because there’s so much quite confusing technical speak around it like mowing, feeding, weeding, moss control and overseeding. A lot of people just aren’t interested – they don’t have time in their busy lives.” There are some environmental benefits to using artificial grass. Unlike a real lawn, fake grass doesn’t need to be mowed – which some people do with electric or fossil fuel mowers – or watered, which is a serious consideration as the UK anticipates increasing water stress due to the climate crisis. Nor does it require fertilisers or herbicides, some of which have been subject to huge controversy, to achieve a uniform look. But lawns can also be maintained without those negative practices and products, and the soil loss problem is real: the RHS’ Greening Grey Britain survey has found a threefold rise in the number of front gardens that have been paved over. Barter also challenges the idea that artificial turf is maintenance-free, saying it still needs to be cleaned of litter and moss growth, and some owners have simply replaced mowing with vacuuming. “There are better solutions that would give people more pleasure than just looking out at this sheet of slowly degrading plastic,” he says. He suggests planting shady front gardens with tolerant shrubs, such as evergreen bushes: these provide greenery all year round, need little maintenance, suppress weeds, offer food for wildlife and places for birds to nest, and give hedgehogs and frogs cover to travel safely in urban streets. “After all, we are supposed to be a nation of gardeners.” To Trevor Dines, botanical specialist for charity Plantlife, the popularity of artificial grass shows how disconnected we have become from the natural world. “Whenever I see artificial grass my heart sinks – more nature smothered by more plastic. Where once we were famed for our lawns, we now opt for artificial, low-maintenance solutions. “This is not just to the detriment of wildlife but to us, too; children can’t make a daisy-chain on a plastic lawn.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"

That’s the story of Germany’s attempted Energiewende (transition to renewable energies).
The mood has turned 180° since the early days. Once welcome, Germany’s Energiewende is now being met with shock and outrage as the envoiornmental destruction takes on unforeseen dimensions.
Even German envivonrmentalists, once huge proponents of renewable energies like wind and solar, are no longer able to take it any more as the Energiewende ravages the country’s environment and turns the notion of environmental protection into a fiasco.

Now that Germany’s Energiewende has been in full swing for a number of years, many leading environmentalists are in a state of shock as huge areas of the country are being deforested and landscapes disfigured to make way for hundreds of wind turbines.
Environmentalist Georg Etscheit is a regular contributor at Germany’s leading climate alarmism site, Klimaretter, and he as well has had enough. Etscheit will be releasing a book in early November.

The title of the book: “Sacrificed Landscapes – How the Energiewende Is Destroying our Landscapes.” 
In the book’s promotion video here, a number of Germany’s leading environmental experts are seen denouncing Germany’s Energiewende, as they are aghast at what is going on.
Prof. Dr. Niko Paech, sustainability scientist, says:
What’s awful about the destruction of the landscapes and the government is that all of it has a legitimization.”
and
The German Energiewende has become a justification for destroying our last remaining natural landscapes.”
Dr. Gerhard Gronauer, pastor:
Climate protection that uses technical means against nature is a contradiction in itself.”

“Greatest fraud project”
Jörg Rehmann, journalist and author:
If we want to survive on this planet, we need an Energiewende. But what the policymakers have made of it is not an Energiewende, rather it is the greatest fraud project since the end of the second world war.”
Prof. Dr. Niko Paech, later adds:
Science is legitimizing a rampage against nature. We destroy the landscape while we claim it is serving the ecology. It’s a cannibalism by the measures. Climate protection is the aim that justifies the means to destroy all other remaining environmental media.”
Jörg Rehmann adds:
Serious science has long proven that the Energiewende cannot in any way reach its targets. Society has to bear billions in costs, already energy prices are exploding, and policymakers are driving us further into a nuthouse in the clouds.”

Rehmann continues and says the proponents are decieving the public into thinking it’s a green free-market capitalism. Paech reminds that despite all the destruction and money, no CO2 has been saved.
“No climate goals have been reached despite the billions invested,” says Rehmann.
Unprecedented amount of cronyism
Rehmann piles on even more:
Under the guise of a planned economy, there is now an unprecedented amount of cronyism and wasted money. It is shocking how far into a legal gray zone communities have gone with respect to the permitting in natural areas. It really reeks of corruption.”
Prof. Dr. Werner Nohl says that wind parks have no place in natural environments.
At the end Etscheit calls for an immediate stop to the “landscape and nature-destroying project” and that a whole new discussion needs to be taken up again.
My feeling is that the zeitgeist is right, and this book will do very well. It needs to be written in English (soon!) so that it can reach an international audience and hopefully help prevent the German blunder from being repeated elsewhere. -PG

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe DPA German press agency reported yesterday on the rapidly spreading energy poverty now engulfing the country.
The main driver is Germany’s skyrocketing electricity prices – primarily due to the legally mandatory feeding-in of wind and solar power. Currently regular household consumers are paying nearly 30 cents a kilowatt-hour – almost three times the rate paid in the USA.

Germany’s energy poverty. Over 330,000 German households saw their electric power service cut off in 2015. Photo cropped here.  
Back to the 19th century
Many households are no longer able to afford electricity and are seeing themselves catapulted back to the 19th century. According to t-online.de here, “More than 330,000 households in Germany have seen their electricity cut off over the past year alone.”
The German site writes that those hit the hardest are households on welfare, i.e. society’s poorest and most vulnerable.

German politician Eva Bulling-Schröter of the Left Party has called it “a silent catastrophe“.
Not only have the poor been broadsided by the high electricity prices, but so have energy intensive industries. This all makes many average workers uneasy. Over the past years a number of German plants have been moving their operations to less expensive locations abroad, especially in the chemical industry. Traditional power companies have also been getting creamed, seeing billions of losses and thousands of layoffs.
6.2 million threats to cut off service were made!
T-online cites the German Bundesnetzagentur, adding that in 2015 also 44,000 households saw their natural gas turned off. T-online adds that millions more have been threatened with the loss of electric power: “Power cut-offs were threatened 6.2 million times. The average outstanding amount that electricity providers demanded from the impacted households was 119 euros.”
According to Bulling-Schröter: “Energy poverty in Germany is a silent catastrophe for millions of people, especially in the cold and dark winter months.”
T-online.de calls letting hundreds of thousands of “children, the elderly, and the sick” go without power while the country posts record electricity exports an “injustice” and that the German government “does not want to see the energy poverty” that is rampant throughout the country.

"It’s almost funny – the start of a comedian’s dark, sardonic joke in an Edinburgh fringe show. We are in the midst of a climate emergency, witnessing firsthand the results of carbon emissions reaching record highs – and yet if you want to make your way from London to the Scottish capital this summer, you’re incentivised to travel in the most unsustainable way. The problem is, there’s no punchline. Taking a flight from London to Edinburgh results in 193kg of CO2 emissions; opting for the train means you produce 24kg – that’s 87% less. But as I compared both prices and travel times for my journey, opting for air travel was not only quicker, it also cost much less. Later in the year I’d like to visit a friend in Barcelona: I can fly in November for £37; train travel is more than £250.  The British population is now increasingly concerned about the climate crisis and its catastrophic consequences, so there must be a better way to encourage us all to make travel choices that help reduce our carbon footprints than relying on a personal sense of guilt. Money is limited for almost everybody – and the pressure to work to earn that money means that your time is limited, too. Consequently, the desire to save the world from self-destruction isn’t always enough for us to make the most ethical decision. That’s why the burden has to be shared. Some solutions are simple: state intervention to nationalise the railways and further subsidise prices would be a start. Meanwhile, banning all non-essential domestic flights within England, Scotland and Wales is common sense thinking. Simply increasing taxes on air travel isn’t going far enough. Restricting flight numbers might initially sound drastic, but with 8% of global emissions coming from travel, and the sector set to grow at 4% per year internationally, there is no other choice. Drink-driving might be the most convenient form of transport for the person at the wheel, but as a society we’ve come to accept this restriction on our travel liberty given the harm it does. Why should unnecessary internal air travel be any different?  Restricting internal flights is, however, only a part of the solution – other elements are a little more complex. Even if train travel was made more affordable, there’s no escaping the fact it takes longer to travel by rail. From London to Edinburgh, that might only be an hour or two one you’ve factored in check-in, security and travel to the airport. But for longer distances the difference can be days. The flight time to Barcelona is just over two hours, yet it’s more than 11 hours to Barcelona on the train each way. For those with permanent employment, limited annual leave days are precious; self-employed people and those on zero-hours contracts rarely have designated holiday time at all. So you not only pay more money for the train, you also pay more in terms of leave taken. Who wants to waste time cooped up on a carriage when you could be exploring Florence or sunning yourself on a Barcelona beach? But when a single return flight to Berlin clocks up the same amount of carbon as 13 return trips by train, we have to find a way. It’s why employers must also take on some of the burden. Schemes such as Climate Perks, being rolled out by climate action organisation 10:10, offer a taste of what could be done. Its research found that 50% of people say they are ready to reduce the amount they fly in response to the climate crisis – but only 3% of us actually act on that impulse. They’re encouraging employers to offer paid “journey days” on top of annual holiday allowances when employees opt to travel sustainably: if you’re prepared to help save the planet, employers should pledge to support you. “Climate Perks employers show the world that they aren’t just ahead of the curve on flight-free travel, they’re bending it in the right direction,” Emma Kemp, a 10:10 campaigner, explained to me. “The more people that make a planet-friendly choice for their next holiday, the quicker we’ll reach the low-carbon destination we all want.” Of course, travel is only one part of the global climate crisis, but it’s an area in which we can – with relatively little action – radically reduce the harm being done. To do so will require state intervention and employers making adjustments, and yes – we might have to briefly embrace our inner Michael Portillo when it comes to spending time sitting on trains. • Michael Segalov is a contributing editor at Huck magazine, a freelance journalist and author"

More Land Area Above Sea Level Now Than During 1980s

Image from  Mörner, 2017

A year ago, several geologists (Kench et al., 2015) published a paper in the journal Geology that revealed a curious phenomenon occurring along island coasts in the tropical Pacific.  Despite some of the highest rates of sea level rise in the world in this region (over 5 mm/yr  on average since the 1950s), the total land area for these islands has not only not shrunk while sea levels were rapidly rising, the coastal land area has expanded — by a net +7.3% — over the last 118 years.

Kench et al., 2015
“The geological stability and existence of low-lying atoll nations is threatened by sea-level rise and climate change. Funafuti Atoll, in the tropical Pacific Ocean, has experienced some of the highest rates of sea-level rise (∼5.1 ± 0.7 mm/yr), totaling ∼0.30 ± 0.04 m over the past 60 yr. We analyzed six time slices of shoreline position over the past 118 yr at 29 islands of Funafuti Atoll to determine their physical response to recent sea-level rise. Despite the magnitude of this rise, no islands have been lost, the majority have enlarged, and there has been a 7.3% increase in net island area over the past century (A.D. 1897–2013). “

Then, a few days ago, 6 scientists (Donchyts et al., 2016) published a paper online for the journal Nature confirming that the curious phenomenon in the tropical Pacific — coastal land growth exceeding recent sea level rise — has also been occurring across the world, or on a net global scale, since the mid-1980s.

Donchyts et al., 2016
Earth’s surface water change over the past 30 years [1985-2015]
“Earth’s surface gained 115,000 km2 of water and 173,000 km2 of land over the past 30 years, including 20,135 km2 of water and 33,700 km2 of land in coastal areas.”

The succinct translation is that sea levels aren’t rising fast enough to offset land area expansion.  The world’s sea coasts are growing, not shrinking.

Scientists Surprised?

Interestingly, in the BBC press release for their Nature paper, the Donchyts et al. scientists expressed surprise (“the most surprising thing”)  that coastal land growth has offset the recent sea level rise, and admitted that their findings ran contrary to expectations.

BBC  (press release)
Coastal areas were also analysed, and to the scientists’ surprise, coastlines had gained more land – 33,700 sq km (13,000 sq miles) – than they had been lost to water (20,100 sq km or 7,800 sq miles).
“We expected that the coast would start to retreat due to sea level rise, but the most surprising thing is that the coasts are growing all over the world,” said Dr Baart.  “We’re were able to create more land than sea level rise was taking.”
The researchers said Dubai’s coast had been significantly extended, with the creation of new islands to house luxury resorts.
“China has also reconstructed their whole coast from the Yellow Sea all the way down to Hong Kong,” said Dr Baart.

Shoreline Changes Are Not Primarily Determined by Climate

It’s a little puzzling that scientists should be surprised that the Earth’s coasts aren’t shrinking.  After all, relative sea level changes are not the predominant determinative factor affecting the growth or recession of land area.  Coastal erosion and accretion, tectonic uplift and subsidence…are far more influential.
Along the coasts of Alaska, for example, the land surface has been rapidly rising (uplift) for many decades.  Consequently, relative sea levels are falling in this region at a rate of -5 to -10 mm/yr (-2 to -4 inches per decade) according to NOAA tide gauges.

Along the U.S. Gulf Coast, on the other hand, the land surface has been on a long-term sinking (subsidence) trend.  Consequently, relative sea levels are rising at rates of +5 to +10 mm/yr (+2 to +4 inches per decade) according to NOAA tide gauges.

Obviously, these regional sea level trends are only very minimally — if at all —  connected to climate-related sea level changes — or, for that matter, anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
As Testut et al. (2016) have concluded, “sea level rise is not the primary factor controlling shoreline changes.”  It’s the “non-climate” factors that predominantly determine relative sea level changes over time.

Testut et al., 2016
“We show that Grande Glorieuse Island has increased in area by 7.5 ha between 1989 and 2003, predominantly as a result of shoreline accretion [growth]: accretion occurred over 47% of shoreline length, whereas 26% was stable and 28% was eroded. Topographic transects and field observations show that the accretion is due to sediment transfer from the reef outer slopes to the reef flat and then to the beach. This accretion occurred in a context of sea level rise: sea level has risen by about 6 cm in the last twenty years and the island height is probably stable or very slowly subsiding. This island expansion during a period of rising sea level demonstrates that sea level rise is not the primary factor controlling the shoreline changes. This paper highlights the key role of non-climate factors in changes in island area, especially sediment availability and transport.”

Dr. Nils-Axel Mörner, a renowned sea-level expert who has authored over 200 peer-reviewed scientific publications during his career, has recently confirmed there has been a lack of climate-related sea level rise in areas of the world where disastrous climate-related sea level rise has been assumed to already be occurring: the Maldives and along the coasts of Bangladesh.   Severe coastal erosion can explain the relative sea level changes in these regions.  In fact, Mörner reports that the Indian Ocean as a whole has been “virtually stable over the last 40-50 years.”

Mörner, 2016
“Coastal erosion is caused by many different processes like changes in prevailing wind direction, coastal currents, re-establishment of a new equilibrium profile, sea level rise, sea level fall, exceptional storms, hurricanes/cyclones, and tsunami events. These coastal factors are reviewed with special attention to effects due to changes in sea level. In the Indian Ocean, sea level seems to have remained virtually stable over the last 40-50 years. Coastal erosion in the Maldives was caused by a short lowering in sea level in the 1970s. In Bangladesh, repeated disastrous cyclone events cause severe coastal erosion, which hence has nothing to do with any proposed sea level rise. Places like Tuvalu, Kiribati and Vanuatu – all notorious for an inferred sea level rise – have tide gauges which show no on-going sea level rise. Erosion is by no means a sign of sea level rise. Coastal erosion occurs in uplifting regions as well as in subsiding regions, or virtually stable areas. Coastal morphology provides excellent insights to the stability.”

Scientists: Sea Levels Are Barely Rising — And The Rise Is ‘Not Anthropogenic In Origin’

The sea-levels-are-dangerously-rising narrative has become so commonly headlined in the popular media that it is effectively considered an unquestioned “fact” that needs no further investigation.
But some scientists have actually taken the time to investigate relative sea level rise in long-term records from tide gauges.  And what they have found is that in some locations sea levels are rising, in other locations sea levels are falling, and most of the world’s tide gauges show that sea levels are stable, with no significant trends either way.  In fact, scientists assert that the overall rate of rise from the 19th/20th centuries to now — including the most recent decades  — has only been about 1 mm/yr, which is about 4 inches per century.  These modest rates are well within the range of natural variability.

 Beenstock et al., 2014
“Tide gauges dating back to the 19th century were located where sea levels happened to be rising. Data reconstructions based on these tide gauges are therefore likely to over-estimate sea level rise.”
“We therefore study individual tide gauge data on sea levels from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) during 1807 – 2010 without recourse to data reconstruction. Although mean sea levels are rising by 1 mm/year, sea level rise is local rather than global, and is concentrated in the Baltic and Adriatic seas, South East Asia and the Atlantic coast of the United States. In these locations, covering 35 percent of tide gauges, sea levels rose on average by 3.8mm/year. Sea levels were stable in locations covered by 61 percent of tide gauges, and sea levels fell in locations covered by 4 percent of tide gauges. In these locations sea levels fell on average by almost 6mm/year.”

Parker and Ollier, 2016
“Tide gauges provide the most reliable measurements, and best data to assess the rate of change. We show as the naïve averaging of all the tide gauges included in the PSMSL surveys show “relative” rates of rise about +1.04 mm/year (570 tide gauges of any length). If we consider only 100 tide gauges with more than 80 years of recording the rise is only +0.25 mm/year. This naïve averaging has been stable and shows that the sea levels are slowly rising but not accelerating.  … We conclude that if the sea levels are only oscillating about constant trends everywhere as suggested by the tide gauges, then the effects of climate change are negligible, and the local patterns may be used for local coastal planning without any need of purely speculative global trends based on emission scenarios.”

Furthermore, even in the regions of the world where sea levels are indeed rising, and rising rapidly (i.e., the tropical Pacific), scientists have acknowledged that an anthropogenic fingerprint cannot even be detected in the sea level rise trends.  Natural oscillations related to internal ocean processes are predominantly what drive sea level changes, not anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

Palanisamy et al., 2015
“[B]y making use of 21 CMIP5 coupled climate models, we study the contribution of external forcing to the Pacific Ocean regional sea level variability over 1993–2013, and show that according to climate models, externally forced and thereby the anthropogenic sea level fingerprint on regional sea level trends in the tropical Pacific is still too small to be observable by satellite altimetry.”
“Furthermore, regressed CMIP5 MME-based sea level spatial trend pattern in the tropical Pacific over the altimetry period do not display any positive sea level trend values that are comparable to the altimetry based sea level signal after having removed the contribution of the decadal natural climate mode. This suggests that the residual positive trend pattern observed in the western tropical Pacific is not externally forced and thereby not anthropogenic in origin. In addition the amplitude of the sea level spatial trend pattern from regressed CMIP5 MME is low over the altimetry period in the tropical Pacific. This amplitude is significantly lower than the expected error in trend patterns from satellite altimetry (in the order of 2 mm yr-1 to 3 mm yr−1, Ablain et al 2015, Couhert et al 2015) and suggest that satellite altimetry measurement is still not accurate enough to detect the anthropogenic signal in the 20 year tropical Pacific sea level trends.”

Hansen et al., 2016
“[T]he large sea-level rise after 1970, is completely contained by the found small residuals, long-term oscillators, and general trend. Thus, we found that there is (yet) no observable sea-level effect of anthropogenic global warming in the world’s best recorded region.”

Summary
To summarize, the world’s shorelines have been growing, not shrinking, in recent decades.  This growth or relative net change in coastal land area is primarily related to the effects of non-climatic processes such as coastal erosion (or the lack of it) and subsidence and uplift trends —  just as the loss of coastal land area in some locations is predominantly due to these same natural non-climatic processes.
Tide gauges averaged from all over the globe indicate that sea levels are rising very modestly, and well within the range of natural variability.  In the regions of the world where sea levels are rising, the rise is predominantly due to internal processes, as an anthropogenic fingerprint in sea level rise trends has not been detectable.
Of course, the above analysis does not fit the narrative of anthropogenically-induced dangerous sea level rise that will wipe out coastal cities and lead to the catastrophic displacement of 100s of millions of people world-wide in the coming decades.  Perhaps this is why some may find this summary of scientific conclusions undermining this popular doomsday narrative so . . . surprising.

Germany’s Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) weather service reports the preliminary weather data for October. At a mean of 8.6°C, the month came in 0.6°C colder than normal (compared to the 1981-2010 mean) and even came in 0.4°C colder than the 1961-1990 mean.
The DWD hints that natural variability factors are to blame for the cool month, writing:
An unusually strong high pressure area in October 2016 blocked the train of Atlantic lows towards Eastern Europe.
The October mean was calculated from data collected from Germany’s approximately 2000 weather stations across the country. October 2016 was also wetter and less sunny than normal.
Cold and cloudy in Austria
The situation was similar over Germany’s southeastern neighbor, Austria. The Austrian ZAMG weather service writes here that the Alpine country saw a much cloudier than normal month with a mean temperature 0.4°C below the 1981-2010 mean:

Several cold snaps provided for wintery conditions especially at higher elevations. Austria had experienced a string of warmer-than-normal months, but that streak has ended. Already there are signs that November may be colder than normal as well.
Near record northern hemisphere snow cover
The wetteronline site here just reported that for this time of the year “snow cover in the northern hemisphere reached the second highest level in about 50 years“. Snow cover has extended to 31.48 million square meters. Only 1976 was higher. Over the past few days a vast area of Russia has seen temperatures fall well below normal. Because of the early and widespread snow cover , the air cools and results in significantly colder than normal temperatures.
What does this mean for the coming weeks? Wetteronline reports the massive snow cover will likely have consequences for Europe and North America. Widespread snow cover over northern Asia can lead to the formation of a powerful cold high system over Siberia, which in turn can weaken the polar vortex. The result:
The weaker it becomes, the more probable it becomes that there will be blasts of polar air over Central Europe.”
This was also the case over the past winters, yet Europe escaped with mild winters.
“Snowiest winter on record”
Not only Central Europe could be slammed by cold winters due to massive snow cover over Russia, also Eastern North America could get hit as well according to Weather Underground here. The site writes that some Siberian locations have seen “their snowiest winter on record“. Weather Underground reports that the current conditions for producing a hard winter “are the best they’ve been in years“.

" Josh Frydenberg’s eligibility to sit in parliament has been challenged in the court of disputed returns by a constituent who says he feels “betrayed” by the Liberal party’s inaction on climate change. Michael Staindl, a resident of Kooyong, filed a petition on Wednesday alleging the treasurer and deputy Liberal leader is disqualified by section 44(1) of the constitution because he is a citizen of Hungary, which Frydenberg denies. The allegation on the final day for petitions to be filed against the 2019 election results came on top of two challenges against Liberal MP Gladys Liu in Chisholm and Frydenberg over Chinese language signs that told voters “the correct voting method” was to put a “1” next to the Liberal candidate. Those challenges were brought by Naomi Hall and independent candidate for Kooyong, Oliver Yates. The petitions – seen by Guardian Australia – are the first eligibility challenges of the new parliament, after the 45th parliament was rocked by 14 MPs or senators resigning or being ruled ineligible due to dual citizenship. If successful they could trigger byelections in Kooyong, won by Frydenberg with 55.7% of the two-party preferred vote, and Chisholm, won by Liu with 50.57%. Frydenberg’s mother was born in Hungary in 1943, and he has declared she held Hungarian citizenship from 1943 to 1948, but Frydenberg has denied that he holds citizenship by descent, citing legal advice from Hungarian citizenship law experts, which he has not released. Staindl told Guardian Australia he had “known Josh for many years” and decided to bring the challenge because “I’ve been trying to get action on climate change and he makes you feel well heard but I think he’s consistently betrayed me, the electorate and the country on climate change”. “In the last parliament he gave assurances [of action on the issue] that weren’t convincing to me at all,” he said. “And as our legislator, I think he owes us better integrity than that. [Frydenberg] should show us he’s entitled to sit.” Staindl is an IT professional who has volunteered for Melbourne-based environmental group Lighter Footprints. Frydenberg has previously rejected the claim of dual citizenship, arguing “it is absurd to think that I could involuntarily acquire citizenship of a foreign country from a stateless mother and grandparents – it invokes the North Korean example of conferring citizenship on someone against their will”. Frydenberg has cited immigration entry documents from 1950 that describe his mother as stateless and has argued that his mother is not a Hungarian citizen and that he cannot be by descent. But Staindl’s petition claims Frydenberg’s mother “arrived in Australia in 1950 in possession of a valid passport, inferred to be a valid Hungarian passport”. It claimed Frydenberg’s mother “continued to be a citizen of Hungary after 1948”, making him a citizen by descent. The challenges by Hall and Yates argue the Chinese-language signs were “likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote” in breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Hall’s petition notes that more than 20% of voters in Chisholm speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home and are likely to be able to read Chinese; in Kooyong the figure is about 12%. The case argues that as a consequence of the signs some voters were likely to have voted 1 for Liu “notwithstanding that such was not the vote that they otherwise intended to cast”. “Had it been the elector’s intention to direct his or her first preference to a candidate other than Liu, that intention was not realised,” the petition said. On election day Liu defended the signs, telling Sky News they were “good signs” authorised by the party. The acting state Liberal director, Simon Frost, has told Guardian Australia the signs were “properly authorised as required by the Commonwealth Electoral Act”. The Australian Electoral Commission inspected the signs on election day and concluded they were authorised. It concluded they were not misleading or deceptive, relying on a high court precedent that the prohibition is limited to the process of filling in a ballot paper, not influencing how voters formed their decision. Earlier in July, Victorian lawyer Trevor Poulton – who has written a novel called The Holocaust Denier but says he is not antisemitic – said he was considering a challenge against Frydenberg on the basis of alleged dual citizenship. On 18 July, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was asked about that putative challenge and accused Poulton of seeking to advance an antisemitic agenda “by pretending to have some sort of constitutional purity on Josh Frydenberg”. At that time Frydenberg said the citizenship issues “were dealt with comprehensively through the last parliament, and the Coalition is confident that none of its members or senators have issues in that regard”. “No one should deny what was an appalling and tragic event in world history,” he said. Staindl said he noted “with great alarm and grief that whenever this issue is raised [Frydenberg] raised the Holocaust denier cannons and fires in every direction”. “This has nothing to do with denial of the Holocaust, it is simply a matter of whether he is an Australian citizen only.” Staindl said if Frydenberg shows evidence he is not Hungarian he could drop the case, “otherwise, yes, I’ll see it through”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterPhysicist Dr. Peter Heller wrote at the German language Science Skeptical here how the election of Donald Trump could mean “the return to reason in climate policy” and that there may be a course change: “one away from trying to do what’s good for the climate, to one that does what is good for man.”

Physicist Dr. Peter Heller. Photo: FDP
He writes:
This is neither dangerous nor unscientific – rather it is optimistic. It holds the promise for a better future that offers more than just the energy savings variant of the present.”
Heller views both opposite extreme positions taken by the radical elements on either side of the debate as irreconcilable and are in fact “nonsense that have more to to do with belief than with science.”
Heller then adds that if the climate alarmists had their way, they “would not only destroy our current prosperity, but also rob mankind of all options to further prosper in the future.”
Today Heller sees hope for a return to reason in climate policy given the “current developments“. One reason for hope he cites is the recently watered down Climate Plan 2050 submitted by the German government at the recent Climate Conference in Morocco. Ultimately Germany was not ready to deindustrialize after all. Heller believes:
Thirty years of climate diplomacy where tens of thousands of taxpayer-funded politicians, bureaucrats and scientists jetted to large conferences and congresses at attractive touristic locations were useless. […] After the election Donald Trump to President of the United States, the gate for better policy has finally opened endlessly wide.”
In his analysis Heller of course agrees that man has an impact on climate and that the greenhouse effect is real, but that this does not necessarily mean climate change is climate catastrophe. He thinks climate sensitivity is closer to 1°C per doubling of CO2. He calls the claims that climate is only worsening “pure speculation” and the claim that man-made climate change is taking us to a climate catastrophe is based on “numerous assumptions“.

Heller also thinks that human ingenuity with respect to adapting to new conditions is being hugely underestimated, reminding readers that humans have adapted to and mastered every climate zone on the planet.
Even in regions where there are frequent drought periods, powerful storms or flooding, man did not retreat. His ingenuity overcame all obstacles. The temperature range within which civilization spread went far beyond the range of 2°C.”
As part of this adaptation, Heller calls fossil energies “a moral necessity” because we use them to generate our prosperity and to produce products of every type that benefit our lives.
In many applications they are indispensable and some are not so easily replaceable, as the 2°C target demands. In summary their advantages substantially outweigh their disadvantages. […] Fossil fuels not freed humanity from feudal exploitation and slavery because they provide an efficient and effective supply through machines, they have foremost enabled us to refrain from consuming biomass as a form of energy and thus prevented the destruction of the environment. In the 18th century when charcoal was substituted by coke in iron smelting, forests once again were able to expand.”
Heller sees Donald Trump as a “new start”, someone who will expand the production of fossil fuels and end the climate protection policy of Obama, and thus with it usher in a series of economic, social and political advantages.
This could introduce the end of international climate diplomacy in its current form, as countries like Russia, China or India are also poised for a reorientation.”
The German physicist calls the howls and gnashing of teeth now taking place within the German mainstream media “over-the-top and wrong”.
He summarizes:
From the very beginning it was a fundamental mistake by climate policy to allow political activists from climate research to have the say. Donald Trump’s program puts the setting of guidelines where it really belongs: in a policymaking that that does not focus on the welfare of the climate, but rather on the welfare on mankind. Climate protection through decarbonization does not offer anything to anyone. In the end even its proponents are left with nothing except a good feeling.”

"Mining company Glencore could be forced to only sell coal from a new mine in New South Wales to signatories of the Paris climate agreement, under a proposal floated by the state’s independent planning commission. Opposed by Glencore and its joint-venture partner in the mine, Peabody, the condition would see approval of the Wambo open-cut coalmine in the state’s Hunter Valley linked to the countries it exports to. But the proposal has prompted a mixed response from environment groups. While some have argued linking the coal mine’s approval to global emissions is positive, others say merely restricting exports to signatories to the Paris agreement will not have any meaningful impact because virtually every country has signed up to the agreement. In a statement, the NSW independent planning commission said it was considering approving the mine under the condition Glencore prepared an export management plan showing how it would “use its best endeavours” to ensure any coal extracted from the mine only be exported to signatories to the Paris deal, or to countries that have similar policies in place aimed at minimising greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of the condition, the commission said, “is to ensure that all practicable measures are adopted by the applicant to minimise greenhouse gas emissions”. The proposal document circulated by the planning commission fails to distinguish between signatories to the Paris agreement and those that have actually ratified it; when it was negotiated in 2015 the Paris accord was signed by 195 countries covering most of the Earth’s greenhouse emissions. While the Lock the Gate Alliance said the group supported the proposal, the Environment Defenders Officer said the proposal was “flawed” because it assumed countries which had ratified the Paris agreement would meet climate abatement targets; under current commitments, the world is on track for more than 3C of global heating, well beyond what was promised in the Paris agreement. The EDO’s chief executive, David Morris, said the group was considering the “legal validity” of the condition, but that it was flawed because it was underpinned by “two factual inaccuracies”. “Many countries that have signed the Paris Agreement, on current trajectories, will fail to achieve their existing commitments,” he said. “Even if all signatories did meet their existing commitments, the world will warm far more than the goal set in Paris to limit the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees. “That is, despite the fact that most countries are signatories to, and have ratified, the Paris Agreement, there remains a huge disconnect between countries’ Paris Commitments and achieving the Goals of the Paris Agreement. “Also, given that the vast majority of countries have either signed or ratified the Paris Agreement, the proposed condition will do very little to change the business as usual approach to the mitigation of emissions from coal exports.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The planning commission’s proposal comes seven months after the chief judge of the state’s land and environment court, Brian Preston, dismissed an appeal by mining company Gloucester Resources over the controversial Rocky Hill open-cut coking coal mine 5km outside of the town of Gloucester in the state’s Hunter Valley, in part because of its impact on climate change. While that decision did not set a legal precedent, Georgina Woods from the Lock the Gate Alliance said the decision had “opened the door” for the commission to consider the global emission implications of an approval on a coalmine. “I think that basically the commission has been grappling with what it can and should do in the wake of Rocky Hill and this is them trying to find a position on what is in their power to do,” she said. “I think it’s positive that, rather than the commission taking at face value what Glencore is saying about its impact on emissions, it’s actually making that a legal requirement of its approval. “The condition they have proposed does need augmenting to recognise that simply being a member of the Paris agreement doesn’t in and of itself achieve what the commission is seeking to achieve, but it is significant because it is the first time ever that the approval of a mine in NSW would be tied to the global effort to reduce global greenhouse emissions.” Woods said that if Glencore was forced to develop an export management plan, it should be “dynamic”. “What we will be arguing is that the management plan needs to have an annual review plan. The Paris agreement is an instrument that recognises mitigation needs to be dynamic and something that increases over time. The commitments are not static so neither can any emissions management.” Glencore and Peabody argue that the condition should not be imposed because the most likely buyers of the coal were already Paris signatories. In a lengthy submission, it also argued against linking the mine with emissions from coal exported to a foreign country, as proposed by environment groups in the wake of the Gloucester decision. The buyers, the companies argued, were “ultimately responsible” for emissions. “[E]missions generated by the combustion of the project’s coal should not outweigh the significant social and economic benefits that the project will deliver at a local, regional and state level,” it said in a submission to the commission."

Observational evidence indicates that Antarctic sea ice has been advancing in recent decades, a trend that has puzzled climate modelers who assume that a warming globe will inhibit sea ice growth.  About 86% of all climate models have indicated that sea ice would show a declining trend for Antarctica, and just 14% (1 out of every 7) concluded sea ice extent would advance.  The average observed growth has been +1.29 (x 105 km2/decade) during the satellite era (since 1979), whereas the models projected a decline of -3.36  (x 105 km2/decade) on average.
Shu et al., 2015 

Forty-nine models, almost all of the CMIP5 climate models and earth system models with historical simulation, are used. For the Antarctic, multi-model ensemble mean (MME) results can give good climatology of sea ice extent (SIE), but the linear trend is incorrect. The linear trend of satellite-observed Antarctic SIE [sea ice extent] is +1.29 (±0.57) × 105 km2 decade−1 ; only about 1/7 CMIP5 models show increasing trends, and the [modeled] linear trend of CMIP5 MME is negative with the value of −3.36 (±0.15) × 105 km2 decade−1 .

Not willing to countenance the fact that their modeling was so terribly wrong, advocates of alarming anthropogenic global warming recently decided it was time to get creative in explaining why their modeling could still be quite right after all.  Of course, these advocates could not and would not admit that decades of growing sea ice trends would indicate that Antarctica and the surrounding Southern Ocean have not been warming, but cooling, during the last 3 decades in concert with the facile principle that cooler surface waters allow more sea ice to form.
Ackley et al., 2015

Sea-ice growth and melt are determined by the heat balance between the OHF [ocean heat flux] and the conductive heat transfer through the overlying ice cover. … Low atmospheric temperatures drive sea-ice formation, while relatively high ocean temperatures that can limit ice growth are a principal cause of sea-ice melt in the Antarctic.

Acknowledging that the southern pole has been cooling since the 1980s would serve to undermine the paradigm that says the entire globe has been steadily warming due to human activity.  In other words, a cooling Antarctica and Southern Ocean doesn’t advance the cause.
So instead of acknowledging that Antarctica and the surrounding Southern Ocean have been not been warming recently (as observational evidence clearly indicates), these advocates decided to issue a convoluted explanation about why sea ice grows in a warming world.  Well, in the Southern Hemisphere, anyway.  In the Northern Hemisphere, it is wholly accepted that warming causes sea ice to decline, which has been observed in the Arctic in recent decades.  In the Southern Hemisphere, warming causes sea ice to grow.  Confused?  We’re just getting started.
As mentioned, advocates of the position that human-caused global warming causes sea ice to grow in the Southern Hemisphere first deny that Antarctica and the Southern Ocean have been cooling in recent decades (despite the observational evidence).  Instead, they claim that the region has continued to warm, consistent with climate modeling and anthropogenic global warming expectations.  They then can claim that a warming Southern Ocean and Antarctic continent have led to enhanced land ice melt along the coasts of Antarctica.  This enhanced land ice melt has meant that the seas near the coasts have had new “cold, fresh layer” (from additional land ice meltwater) gliding over the surface of the ocean.  This “cold, fresh layer” of run-off water from enhanced land ice melt keeps the warming oceans from warming up too much, and this “cold, fresh layer” travels far and wide, suppressing the ability of the warming surface waters to limit sea ice growth.   In this way, the warming waters with a “cold, fresh layer” on top from all the additional land ice meltwater could be said to have caused the sea ice to grow.  Again, this process only works in the Southern Hemisphere.  It doesn’t work in the Northern Hemisphere, where the enhanced land ice melt in the Arctic does not result in sea ice growth, but a dramatic sea ice decline.
Surely this convoluted, ad hoc “explanation” for why anthropogenic global warming causes sea ice growth would not be taken seriously.  Right?  Well, actually, it has been taken very seriously.  No less than the journal Nature embraced it.  NSIDC’s director Mark Serreze promoted this makeshift conceptualization too.  And, of course, the usual suspects in the print media were all to eager to agree that human CO2 emissions cause sea ice to grow in Antarctica (and simultaneously shrink in the Arctic).
Nature News, 2013

Global warming expands Antarctic sea ice: In a polar paradox, melting land ice helps sea ice to grow.
Ocean warming may be a major driver of sea-ice expansion in the Antarctic, researchers report today in Nature Geoscience. … Scientists have known for several years that meltwater from ice sheets can form a cold, fresh layer on the ocean surface that protects sea ice from the warmer waters below. … “The paradox is that global warming leads to more cooling and more sea ice around Antarctica,” says Richard Bintanja, a climate researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in Utrecht.

UK Daily Mail (2014)

Global warming is creating MORE ice: Antarctic levels reach a record high because of climate change, scientists claim
Claim was made by Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Centre … Shift is caused by water melting from beneath the Antarctic ice shelves … Scientists claim it is then re-frozen back on surface, increasing sea ice

New Paper Debunks Claim That Humans Cause Antarctic Sea Ice To Advance
A new paper shreds this ad hoc explanation linking human activity to sea ice growth in the Southern Hemisphere.  Pauling et al. (2016) find that internal dynamics could explain the cooling and increase in sea ice extent in recent decades, and that an enhancement of the “freshwater input by an amount within the range of estimates of the Antarctic mass imbalance did not have any significant effect on either sea ice area magnitude or trend” — even if one assumes that anthropogenic forcing causes a decline in sea ice to offset the hypothetical growth trend due to enhanced “freshwater input”.
Pauling et al., 2016
The possibility that recent Antarctic sea ice expansion resulted from an increase in freshwater reaching the Southern Ocean is investigated here. … Two sets of experiments were conducted from 1980 to 2013 in CESM1(CAM5), one of the CMIP5 models, artificially distributing freshwater either at the ocean surface to mimic iceberg melt or at the ice shelf fronts at depth. An anomalous reduction in vertical advection of heat into the surface mixed layer resulted in sea surface cooling at high southern latitudes and an associated increase in sea ice area. Enhancing the freshwater input by an amount within the range of estimates of the Antarctic mass imbalance did not have any significant effect on either sea ice area magnitude or trend. 
A Better Explanation: Antarctica, Southern Ocean Have Been Cooling Since The 1980s
As mentioned above, Antarctica and the Southern Ocean have not been cooperating with anthropogenic “global” warming models.  The region has been cooling for decades.  And a cooling Southern Ocean has led to increasing sea ice trends.  In other words, no convoluted explanations are necessary.
Fan et al., 2014

[A]ll of these studies reported a close relationship between [sea ice extent] and sea surface temperature (SST) whereby sea ice gain is associated with lower SSTs and vice versa. … Cooling is evident over most of the Southern Ocean in all seasons and the annual mean, with magnitudes approximately 0.2–0.4°C per decade or 0.7–1.3°C over the 33 year period [1979-2011].

Doran et al., 2002

[O]ur spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000, particularly during summer and autumn.

Turner et al., 2016

Here we use a stacked temperature record to show an absence of regional [Antarctic Peninsula] warming since the late 1990s. The annual mean temperature has decreased at a statistically significant rate, with the most rapid cooling during the Austral summer.


Jones et al., 2016

Over the 36-year satellite era, significant linear trends in annual mean sea-ice extent, surface temperature and sea-level pressure are superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability. Most observed trends, however, are not unusual when compared with Antarctic palaeoclimate records of the past two centuries. With the exception of the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode, climate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends. This suggests that natural variability overwhelms the forced response in the observations, but the models may not fully represent this natural variability or may overestimate the magnitude of the forced response.



During 1950s – 1980s, Antarctica, Southern Ocean Warmed, And Sea Ice Declined
In the Northern Hemisphere, Arctic sea ice declines during warm phases (e.g., the 1920s to 1940s and the 1990s to present), and Arctic sea ice increases during cooling phases (like it did during the 1950s to 1980s).  Similarly, when the Southern Ocean and Antarctic continent warmed during the 1950s to 1980s, sea ice declined.  Since the 1980s, Antarctica and the Southern Ocean have cooled, and, consequently, sea ice area has grown.  Not only that, but a majority of East Antarctic glaciers have been advancing since the 1990s.  Again, no convoluted, ad hoc explanations are necessary.  Cooling contributes to ice growth trends, and warming contributes to declining ice trends.
IPCC (2001):

Another analysis of a 21-station data set from Antarctica by Comiso (1999) found a warming trend equivalent to 1.25°C per century for a 45-year record beginning in the 1950s but a slight cooling trend from 1979 to 1998. The slight cooling trend for this later 20-year period also was confirmed via analysis of surface temperatures over the whole continent, as inferred from satellite data.

Fan et al., 2014

[S]ea surface temperatures and surface air temperatures decreased during 1979–2011, consistent with the expansion of Antarctic sea ice. In contrast, the Southern Ocean and coastal Antarctica warmed during 1950–1978.

Sinclair et al., 2014

We present the first proxy record of sea-ice area (SIA) in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, from a 130 year coastal ice-core record. High-resolution deuterium excess data show prevailing stable SIA [sea ice area] from the 1880s until the 1950s, a 2–5% reduction from the mid-1950s to the early-1990s, and a 5% increase after 1993.

Miles et al., 2013

Despite large fluctuations between glaciers—linked to their size—three epochal patterns emerged: 63 per cent of glaciers retreated from 1974 to 1990, 72 per cent advanced from 1990 to 2000, and 58 per cent advanced from 2000 to 2010.  … Indeed, several studies report increasing sea-ice concentrations in the study region from approximately 1980 to 2010, which is consistent with the predominance of glacier advance since 1990, when above-average sea-ice and fast-ice concentrations could have suppressed calving by increasing back-pressure on glacier termini. In contrast, reduced sea ice concentrations from the 1950s to the mid 1970s are consistent with glacier retreat during the 1960s and 1970s, when air temperatures were also increasing along the Pacific coast.


Sea Ice Trends In Antarctica Are Incompatible With An Anthropogenic Or CO2 Influence
The reason why advocates of an alarming anthropogenic influence on climate are so intent on “explaining” why warming causes sea ice to grow in the Southern Hemisphere is simple: what has been observed with Antarctic sea ice undermines the claim that anthropogenic global warming is predominantly responsible for polar sea ice trends.  And the observation that Antarctica warmed during the 1950s to 1980s, when CO2 levels were in the “safe” range (under 350 ppm), but it has cooled since the 1980s as CO2 levels exploded past 400 ppm, is also very incompatible with the conclusion that humans determine the ice trends in the southern polar climate with their CO2 emissions.
Of course, what has been happening in Antarctica is entirely consistent with what would be expected with natural or internal variability, and not what would be expected from models of rapidly growing CO2 concentrations.
Latif et al., 2013

During phases of deep convection the surface Southern Ocean warms, the abyssal Southern Ocean cools, Antarctic sea ice extent retreats, and the low-level atmospheric circulation over the Southern Ocean weakens. After the halt of deep convection, the surface Southern Ocean cools, the abyssal Southern Ocean warms, Antarctic sea ice expands, and the low-level atmospheric circulation over the Southern Ocean intensifies, consistent with what has been observed during the recent decades. 

At some point it must be acknowledged that something is seriously wrong with climate models that presume anthropogenic influences dominate the trends in polar sea ice.  One wonders what the next makeshift “explanation” will be for a likely increase in Arctic sea ice extent at some point in the near future, or as the warming phase in the Arctic draws to a close in the coming years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLittle Ice Age as a suitable reference point for the warming of the last 150 years?  The case of Mont Blanc
By Uli Weber
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
On October 29 television station ARTE broadcast the documentary “Laboratory Mont Blanc“ (94 Min.). It’s available at Arte.tv until November 6, 2016.  The description at ARTE:
On a 6-day expedition three scientists climbed the Mont Blanc, which is considered the heart of the European Alps. At approximately 4810 meters tall the ‘white giant’ is a natural wonder of nature. Climbing the large mountain is a unique experience and is considered as a look at the past 240 million years of evolution…”
Of course the problem in the documentary all gets back to man-made climate change. Yet between the 37 minute and 45 minute marks, we found some rational documentation: The Mont Blanc glacier had retreated just as much during the Medieval times as much it has today. Back then a small town near what today is Chamonix (Le Chatelard?) was covered in 1643 by the Mer de Glace (sea of ice) glacier and destroyed. In 1860 – the end of the Little Ice Age – the Mer de Glace reached its greatest extent, which is documented by photos and other means.
Since then the Mer de Glace has been in retreat, as the following satellite photo from Google-Maps clearly shows:

Also other sources report of glacier advance during the Little Ice Age, e.g. the Blog History of Geology on October 8, 2016:
… In the year 1644 in the Mont Blanc region, a procession to the glacier was organized at the village Les Bois because supposedly it had advanced to only 120 meters away from the village and it was threatening. The bishop of Geneva blessed the Les-Bois-glacier personally…“
Wikipedia on the Mer de Glace, quote:
„… Earlier the glacier flowed over a steep part and into the valley of Chamonix, and right up to the settlement Les Bois. This part of the glacier was named the Glacier des Bois and used to be an attraction of old Chamonix. At the elevation of Montenvers the glacier used to be 130 meters thicker than today. Crossing the right bank was free of trouble. People even drove the herds of sheep over it…“
It is most astonishing that the mean temperature at the end of the Little Ice Age (usually 1850, but in the ARTE documentary 1860) gets misused as the “natural” yardstick for measuring our current warming, and thus used as proof of a “man-made” global warming – even though that it is clearly shown by the ARTE documentary and without a doubt as simply part of the ongoing natural cycle since the Medieval time.

"It’s my sad duty to inform you that the city of Sydney as we know it is set to be destroyed and replaced by the totalitarian spectre of a chilling dystopia. At least, that’s if you believe the Daily Telegraph’s latest reporting on the lord mayor Clover Moore’s 2050 vision. Moore has outlined a concept for how the city could look that year as part of the City of Sydney council’s broader move to make the city more sustainable.  Given the spectre of rising sea levels in a harbour city that has already declared a climate emergency, you would expect future planning to help mitigate the worst of these scenarios, if for no other reason than to help keep its spot on the most liveable city rankings. Instead, the Telegraph describes Moore’s future Sydney as a “wacky dystopian vision”. The City of Sydney Liberal councillor Christine Forster is quoted in the piece criticising Moore for “scaring children with alarmist rhetoric”, citing a feedback session that described children as being deeply anxious. Won’t someone think of the children? Not in a “handing them a better world” sense, of course, but at least coddle them until they inherit the worst of our sins. We really must figure out how to teach our children that their quality of life may be greatly reduced due to our inaction, but in a way that excites them. Perhaps Frozen 2 can be set in a steaming puddle or something. The Institute of Public Affairs, a thinktank partly funded by a mining giant and consistent in their unscientific denialism, are invited to pull up their diesel-fuelled clown car and spout off unchallenged, misleading statistics and claim the focus on climate change is “nonsense”. But, I’m afraid to say, the Telegraph is entirely correct. Clover Moore is building a dystopian world, which we shall call Cloverfield, in which Fahrenheit 451 is just the expected low temperature on a weather report for a spring day. What is this dystopian “radical climate agenda” that has frightened the Telegraph much more than the benign fact of Greenland rapidly melting away before our eyes? Well, unlike the atmosphere itself, the future Sydney can only be described as chilling. The Telegraph reports the vision for Sydney includes cars “banished underground” in a dramatic depiction of what some would call a tunnel. Renewables will power the city and single-use plastics will be banned. Will this ban be under pain of death? We can only assume yes. The poor, hapless residents will also be subjected to air conditioned “public urban cool rooms”, according to the report. This is pure Orwell. Who can forget the frightening moment in 1984 when poor Winston Smith is thrown into Room 101 only to be confronted by what he fears most: ducted air conditioning. Trains and light rail would be powered by renewable energy, urban farms would feed the city. On its face, this sounds like a great thing. Climate change is already driving global hunger and a major, growing city investing in its food security seems to have no downside. But you have to understand dystopian double speak. Urban farms? That’s clearly a thinly veiled guise for eating people. Moore may be an independent but this is a platform for the Soylent Greens. This is not a future we want. Sure, the government’s own modelling predicts higher temperatures and more extreme weather events, yet this is no reason to be frightened or even plan for this scenario. Rather, we should simply keep stumm and politely melt into the concrete. • James Colley is a comedian and writer for Gruen, Tomorrow Tonight and The Weekly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper just published online asks a timely and poignant question as the U.S. Presidential election splatters the headlines this week: What does the Paris Agreement actually do?  The author succinctly answers his own question, concluding that the Paris Agreement allows countries like China and India “permission to emit as much [CO2] as they see fit,” and therefore the international pact “makes the policy of mitigation of global warming impossible.”
Campbell, 2016
What does the Paris Agreement actually do?
“Though very widely believed to be inadequate in the target it sets, the Paris Agreement is commonly thought actually to set a binding target of reducing global CO2e emissions so as to limit global warming to 2℃. Proper legal interpretation of the Agreement shows it to set no such target. It rather gives the newly industrialising countries such as China and India a permission to emit as much as they see fit. These countries have been principally responsible for the huge growth in emissions since 1990 and they will be responsible for their continued huge growth until 2030. The Paris Agreement therefore makes the policy of mitigation of global warming impossible. However, this policy has been impossible over the whole of the now more than a quarter century of international climate change policy.”
To expand on this point, consider that global-scale CO2 emissions were still only 6.5 gigatons per year (GtC/yr) in the year 1999, but they grew to 7.5 GtC/yr by 2005, 8.5 GtC/yr by 2008, and 10.1 GtC/yr by 2014.  Here’s what that explosive growth in CO2 emissions looks like:

 
Notice the exponential expansion in climate change mitigation laws and policies from 1997, 2009, and 2014, and how they are negatively correlated with global-scale CO2 emissions growth (source: London School of Economics).  In other words, the more laws are passed that attempt to mitigate the growth in CO2 emissions, the sharper the growth in CO2 emissions.
London School of Economics, 2015
Three-quarters of the world’s annual emissions of greenhouse gases are now limited by national targets
“53 countries, including the 28 Member States of the European Union, have national targets that set either absolute or relative limits on annual emissions of greenhouse gases across their economies. … 98 countries and the European Union together had 804 climate laws and policies at the end of 2014, compared with 426 in 2009, when a previous attempt was made in Copenhagen, Denmark, to reach an international agreement. In 1997, when the Kyoto Protocol was agreed, these countries had just 54 climate laws and policies between them. … 47 countries, including the 28 Member States of the European Union, have introduced carbon pricing through either a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system.”
According to an analysis by the Washington Post, Gigawatt-hours (GWh) from fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil) grew from 5.8 GWh in 1980 to 15.4 GWh in 2012.  Gigawatt-hours from renewables rose from 1.8 GWh in 1980 to 4.8 GWh in 2012.  This means that total consumption of fossil fuel energies grew more than 3 times faster than renewables did (9.6 GWh vs. 3 GWh) between 1980 and 2012.
Washington Post (2015):

As appetite for electricity soars, the world keeps turning to coal
“[T]wo-thirds of the world’s electricity is still produced by burning fossil fuels, mostly coal — a proportion that hasn’t budged for 35 years. Emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants have more than doubled since 1980 as the world’s demand for electricity keeps rising.”
And fossil fuel use will continue rising – no matter how many more laws are passed.
India and China alone plan to build 1617 new coal power plants by 2030.
Between 50 and 86 new coal plants are planned for Turkey in the next few years.
Russia plans to rapidly expand their coal industry (source):

“The Russian government has endorsed a long-term coal industry development program, featuring an increase in coal production and coal-powered generation – a day after adopting a brand-new climate action plan.   The refurbished program sees coal production in Russia increase to 410-480 million tons by 2030, and exports are expected to grow by some 70 million tons.”
Japan is currently building 43 new coal plants.
South Korea is also adding more coal-fired energy according to a report from Reuters.com:
“Less than a week since signing the global climate deal in Paris, Japan and South Korea are pressing ahead with plans to open scores of new coal-fired power plants, casting doubt on the strength of their commitment to cutting CO2 emissions.   Even as many of the world’s rich nations seek to phase out the use of coal, Asia’s two most developed economies are burning more than ever and plan to add at least 60 new coal-fired power plants over the next 10 years.  Officials at both countries’ energy ministries said those plans were unchanged.”
The Netherlands…
“Dutch energy companies are burning more coal than ever, despite efforts to produce more green and sustainable energy, according to research by news agency De Persdienst. It says coal-fired power stations in the Netherlands used over seven million kilos of coal in the first nine months of last year, a 15% increase on 2013 and a 36% increase on 2012.”
World Research Institute assesses that ten developing countries are or will be building new coal plants.
“New coal-fired plants have been proposed in 10 developing countries: Cambodia, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Laos, Morocco, Namibia, Oman, Senegal, Sri Lanka, and Uzbekistan. Currently, there is limited or no capacity for domestic coal production in any of these countries.”
According to a report from The Guardian, the only two wealthy countries that did not expand coal production and consumption since 2009 are the United States and Canada.  For Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and the UK, coal consumption rose by 16% between 2009 and 2013.
“Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan and France together burned 16% more coal in 2013 than 2009 and are planning to further increase construction of coal-fired power stations. Only the US and Canada of the G7 countries meeting on Monday in Berlin have reduced coal consumption since the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009.”
The Paris Agreement was, is, and will be an exercise in futility.  It will not reduce global-scale CO2 emissions, as emissions rates will continue to grow on a net global scale, especially since Asian and Middle Eastern countries continue to “emit as much as they see fit”.
Analysts have suggested that our efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions “will almost surely fail,” and they may “actually make matters worse.”

“To even come close to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, 50 percent of our energy will need to come from renewable sources by 2028, and today it is only 9 percent, including hydropower. For a world that wants to fight climate change, the numbers just don’t add up to do it.”
Kelly, 2016
“[A]ll the actions taken together until now to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide will not achieve a serious reduction, and in some cases, they will actually make matters worse.”
Bannaga, 2016
“It is evident that UN efforts to combat climate change are not effective because past experience shows that CO2 generation cuts weren’t near enough.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAmericans’ beliefs about climate change were recently surveyed by the Pew Research Center, and the results were made public a few days ago.  Pew pollsters found that a combined 51% of Americans agree that (a) there is no clear evidence the Earth is warming, or (b) natural factors are the main cause of climate changes.  Therefore, just 48% of Americans believe the Earth is getting warmer, and this warming is mostly caused by humans.  This belief percentage has essentially remained unchanged for the last 10 years, or since the survey was first conducted in 2006.

One key question in the survey pertained to Americans’ perception of the scientific “consensus”.   The Pew Research Center found that just 27% of Americans believe that “almost all” climate scientists maintain the belief that changes in climate are mostly caused by humans.
Of course, the presupposition underpinning this opinion question is the claim that upwards of 97% climate scientists — translated into “almost all” for the Pew survey — believe that climate changes since the mid-20th century have been mostly (i.e., more than 50%) caused by humans.   This oft-cited 97% figure was derived from a subjective abstract-counting exercise conducted by “Skeptical Science” blogger John Cook and colleagues (Cook et al., 2013, “Quantifying the Consensus…”).  Selected abstracts from 11,944 scientific papers published between 1991 and 2011 were used for the sample size, and of those papers just 65 (0.5% of the 11,944) were classified by Cook and his fellow raters as endorsing the specified Category 1 position that “Explicitly states that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming” (Legates et al., 2013).  This wouldn’t do, of course.  So, to ultimately reach the 97% endorsement percentage the Cook team had set out to obtain in the first place, they intentionally combined the (65) Category 1 quantified “consensus” statement papers  with the (934) Category 2 and (2,933) Category 3 endorsement papers that only needed to state (2) or just imply (3) that humans are a cause of climate changes.  These Category 2 and 3 papers did not quantify the contribution or indicate humans are a primary (>50%) cause of climate change, but they were nonetheless combined with Category 1 papers anyway.
Of course, nearly all scientists would agree that a human contribution greater than 0% exists, or that humans can be a cause — however modest  — of some degree of climate change.  So by combining the very high endorsement rates from Categories 2 and 3 (that even most skeptics acknowledge, as they agree humans contribute to climate change to some degree) with the negligibly small endorsement rates for Category 1 (just 65 papers), and by excluding many hundreds of papers from consideration that were published by scientists questioning the theory, Cook et al. (2013) were ultimately able to get away with proclaiming that 97% of scientists believe that climate changes since 1950 have mostly been caused by humans.
But as the evidence from the Pew survey  indicates, despite their best efforts, John Cook and cohorts have not been able to convince the general public that subjective abstract-counting exercises are a sound or scientific means to gauge “consensus.”  As mentioned, only 27% of Americans believe that “almost all” (i.e., 97%) climate scientists maintain the belief that humans are the primary cause of changes in the climate system.  Not only that, just 28% Americans agree that climate scientists even understand (“very well”) what factors cause climate changes.

And Americans may be right.  According to analysis found in the peer-reviewed scientific literature (Prokopy et al., 2015, Lefsrud and Meyer, 2012, Stenhouse et al., 2016), surveys of professional climatologists, engineers, geologists, and agronomists indicate that the percentage of these scientists who believe that changes in the climate system are primarily caused by humans falls abysmally short of the claimed 97%.  In fact, these studies reveal that only 53% of climatologists and meteorologists, 36% of professional engineers and geoscientists, and 19% of agronomists believe that changes in the climate system are mostly human-caused.
53% Of Climatologists Believe, 19% Of Agronomists Believe
In a survey of Midwest-based climatologists and agronomists (here called “extension educators” who have “at least a Masters degree” in agronomic sciences), just 53% of climatologists and 19.2% of agronomists believe that changes in the climate system are primarily caused by humans.
Prokopy et al., 2015
“In 2012, a total of 22 state and extension climatologists were selected through a purposive sample to represent main outlets of publicly available and location-specific climate information in the region. … About 53% attributed climate change primarily to human activities.”

“Extension educators are a unique set of agricultural advisors who serve to connect and translate research from universities to farmers in order to decrease risk to the farm enterprise and increase productive capacity and resilience. Typically, Extension educators have at least a Masters degree and are trained in agronomic sciences, which may not include climate sciences. … [O]ver 19% attribut[e] climate change primarily to human activities.”

36% Of Engineers, Geoscientists Believe
Among professional engineers and geoscientists trained in the physical sciences, only 36% are believers in the “consensus” position that humans are the “main or central” cause of changes in the climate system.
Lefsrud and Meyer, 2012
“The largest group of APEGA respondents (36%) … express the strong belief that climate change is happening, that it is not a normal cycle of nature, and humans are the main or central cause.”

53% Of Professional Meteorologists Believe
Stenhouse et al., 2016
Conflict about Climate Change at the American Meteorological Society: Meteorologists’ Views on a Scientific and Organizational Controversy
“A web-based survey was sent to all professional (i.e. non-student) members of the AMS in December 2011. …  Members who said the global warming of the last 150 years was mostly caused by human activity (53% of full sample).  … Members who are convinced of largely human-caused climate change expressed that debate over global warming sends an unclear message to the public.  Conversely, members who are unconvinced of human-caused climate change often felt that their peers were closed-minded, and were suppressing unpopular views.”
Ninety-Seven Percent Bunk
To summarize, the American public is about as likely to believe that climate changes are mostly caused by humans as are meteorologists and climatologists (48% vs. 53%, respectively).  And Americans in general are much more likely to believe that humans are the primary cause of climate changes as professionals trained in the physical sciences: 48% of U.S. citizens are believers, whereas ~20-35% of professionals with physical science degrees (engineers, Earth scientists, agronomists) are believers.
To put it non-delicately, the claim that “almost all” scientists (i.e., 97%) believe that most changes in the climate system are caused by humans is … bunk.
And most Americans already knew that.

"Pacific leaders have called on Australia to abandon plans to use carry-over credits to meet Paris climate targets and to immediately stop new coalmining, warning some of their countries could be uninhabitable as soon as 2030. In a strongly worded statement issued at the end of a Pacific Islands development forum in Fiji, the leaders said they were deeply concerned about a lack of “comprehension, ambition or commitment” from developed nations despite the climate crisis posing grave consequences for their people.  They called for greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced immediately, pointing to the “stark warnings” in a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change setting out what would need to be done to limit global heating to 1.5C. “The science warns of the real possibility that coral atoll nations could become uninhabitable as early as 2030,” the statement, called the Nadi Bay declaration, said. “By 2100, the coral atoll nations of the republic of the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Tokelau and the Maldives and many [small island developing states] could be submerged.” Last week Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, rejected calls from Pacific states for Australia to do more to combat climate change, telling the ABC they “should be pleased” that it was meeting the target it set at the 2015 Paris meeting. Most climate experts say Australia is not expected to meet its 2030 emissions target – a 26%-28% cut below 2005 levels – under current policies and the country would need to make much deeper cuts than proposed to play its part under the Paris agreement. Australia’s emissions have risen year on year since the Coalition repealed a national carbon price scheme. In a clear reference to Australia, the statement called on the countries to refrain from using carry-over credits from the Kyoto protocol to meet targets under the Paris agreement. Other developed countries have said they will not use carry-over credits, which Australia has access to after over-achieving compared with its Kyoto agreement target of a 5% cut below 2000 levels. Analysts say using these credits effectively reduces Australia’s Paris commitment by about eight percentage points. Climate campaigners say the credits do nothing to escalate efforts to combat the problem as is required and Australia has access to carry-over credits only because it set itself unambitious Kyoto targets. The statement signed by nine leaders also called on coal producers “to immediately cease any new mining of coal and develop a strategy for a decadal phase-out and closure of all existing coal production”. It wanted developed countries to take immediate steps to stop subsidies to fossil fuels and to support climate finance and technology transfer for vulnerable nations. It said the climate emergency “poses the single greatest threat to the human rights and security of present and future generations of Pacific Island peoples”. The development forum came two weeks before the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, attends the separate Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu. Australia is yet to respond to a request from the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, asking countries to outline plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 ahead of a climate action summit in New York in September. Frank Bainimarama, Fiji’s prime minister and chair of the development forum, called on all developed countries – but especially what he called “our larger neighbours in the Pacific” – to hear the call ahead of the Tuvalu meeting and make their Paris commitments more ambitious. “We cannot allow climate commitments to be watered down in the meeting hosted by the nation whose very existence is threatened by the rising waters lapping at its shores,” he said. Richie Merzian, from the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, said the call by Pacific leaders for carry-over credits to be cancelled was unprecedented. “The Nadi Bay declaration is an unadulterated and powerful message to Australia and other major economies that, ahead of the UN climate summit in September, they need to lift their game on climate action,” he said."
"Over the past couple of weeks things have been happening on the climate change front but, unfortunately, little is changing in parliament, where the government’s direct action policy has continued to be an utter failure and a Queensland LNP MP suggested in his first speech in the House of Representatives that schools should teach both sides of the climate change debate in school – to prevent them being “brainwashed with extreme left or right ideologies”.  Last week came news that BHP was going to spend US$400m over five years on a “climate investment program to develop technologies to reduce emissions from its own operations as well as those generated from the use of its resources”. Its CEO, Andrew Mackenzie, stated in a speech in London, “Society’s combustion of fossil fuels and industrial processes like steelmaking and agriculture have released greenhouse gases at rates much faster than at any other time in the geological past.” To ram the message home he concluded: “The evidence is abundant: global warming is indisputable. The planet will survive. Many species may not.” Just ponder that: many species will not survive. Thus it was not particularly surprising really to hear this week that the NSW HSC was going to include climate change in geography classes. The surprising element was that it doesn’t already. Neither was it surprising to see conservatives across the media come out against it, arguing that if they are to teach climate change then they need to teach “both sides”. The IPA’s “director of the foundations of western civilisation program” Bella d’Abrera (yeah, I know) suggested on Sky News that “they’re going to hear hopefully that climate change is not necessary manmade”. Or in other words, students should hear that conspiracy theories are real. This is the type of guff that you expect to hear from the libertarian romper room that Sky News is now. It’s a station that gives a voice to the likes of Andrew Bolt, who this week devoted a column to calling 16-year-old climate-change activist Greta Thunberg “deeply disturbed” and mocking her autism diagnosis. She responded by flicking him away with ease – which to be honest was not wholly difficult given I’ve had cases of tinea that have contributed more to our national intelligence than has Bolt’s entire media career. But she did it with class. In parliament you would hope for better than the dredge we get on Sky News. But no. On Wednesday, newly elected Queensland MP Terry Young gave his first speech, in which he stated “we want our children and grandchildren to hear the theories of evolution and creation, different religions, climate change advocates and climate change sceptics. I can say what we don’t want for us and our kids is to be brainwashed with extreme left or right ideologies.” “Theories of creation”? Religion is a theory now? He continued arguing, “When I hear a school principal stand up at school assembly and say ‘if this government doesn’t do anything about climate change, the world will end in 2030’ I get angry, because we should not indoctrinate our kids with fear mongering.” Now, firstly, I’d like to know where that happened because I can find no record of it. It sort of happened in the TV show Big Little Lies, so maybe that was it. But here’s the thing, he should get angry if he hears that – not because it is brainwashing but because his government is not doing anything about climate change. The world is not going to end in 2030, but if we have not taken massive steps by then, our ability to prevent massive global degradation and harm due to climate change will be beyond us. This is not extremist, it is science – science that was announced in October by the UN IPCC. Its co-chair said at the time: “This is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilises people and dents the mood of complacency.” But no, it didn’t. Young went on to suggest personal responsibility was more important and the fact his family own a hybrid car and have solar panels was a sign of how conservatives go about things the right way. It is much the same line we have heard by so many conservatives – a variant of if we all plant a tree and recycle then that’s all we can do. It won’t be anywhere near enough, and it might seem like “common sense” to Young but it is not. Just how lacking the LNP’s climate change policy is in anything approaching substance was revealed this week when its latest auction under the “emissions reduction fund” bought cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas pollution. The government is utterly failing to achieve even its own pathetically low emissions reduction targets. And time is running out fast. This week in the Monthly, ANU climate scientist Dr Joëlle Gergis wrote that, while in 2013 scientists had estimated that a doubling of CO2 levels from pre-industrial levels (which we’re on track to do by 2060) would lead to a temperature increase of between 1.5C to 4.5C, now as scientists continue to get more data, their models suggest the temperature increase is more likely to be between 2.8C and 5.8C. That’s scary because all efforts at the moment are assuming if we reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 we can limit warming to 1.5C. That might now be rather too optimistic. Add into the mix came further news this week that glaciers appear to be melting 10 to 100 times faster than expected. It’s time to stop being mealy-mouthed about this and to give silent passes to those peddling climate-change denialism either explicitly or implicitly by demanding we listen to both sides. But OK, here’s both sides of the debate – for well over 40 years scientists have been researching and testing evidence that climate change is occurring due to CO2 emissions. They have found conclusive evidence that there is a link and that on the current path by 2100 global temperatures will likely reach 3C above pre-industrial levels. The other side is that they have kept researching and testing the data, and sorry, they were wrong – it’s even worse than they thought. • Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia"

Share this...FacebookTwitterJapanese climate blogger Kirye caught my eye here at Twitter when posting a comparator chart of Arctic sea ice extent (and thickness) for 2007, 2015 and this year (2016) for September 4. In a nutshell, what is all the alarm about?
She comments that “Arctic ice is not doomed in the real world.” Clearly Arctic sea ice this summer will most likely not set a new record. There’s far more ice up there then what global warming alarmists hysterically projected earlier.
Also a recent chart of Arctic sea ice extent by the National Snow Ice and Data Center (NSIDC) shows that current sea ice extent is some half a million square kilometers over the 2012 level:

Source: NSIDC
Clearly over the past years Arctic sea ice has refused to have anything to do with the often claimed “death spiral” and alarmists are always forced to go back a number of years in order to get the sharp downward overall trend they want to see.
Lately, however, it has not been downward at all.

No downward trend over past decade
Looking back at the past 10 years, we see there has been practically no downward trend whatsoever. A chart generated at Woodfortrees here for the past 10 years clearly illustrates this:

No melt in 10 years! Chart: Woodfortrees
Clearly the Arctic is nowhere near a death spiral, and the polar ice has in fact defied the models and the many earlier predictions that it would disappear by 2015 altogether. With all that ice still up there, it’s time for the sea ice and global warming modelers to discard their equations – and to start over again from scratch.
With millions of square kilometers of ice still up there reflecting summer radiation back into space, it’s time readjust the energy budget.
Tipping points postponed again!

"A former senior government analyst has accused the Trump administration of “undercutting evidence” of the threat to national security from the climate crisis after his report on the issue was blocked by the White House. Rod Schoonover, who worked as an intelligence analyst for the federal government for 10 years before resigning earlier this month, submitted a written testimony on the “wide-ranging implications” of global heating over the next 20 years, for submission to the House intelligence committee last month.  But he said on Tuesday that the report was stopped by the White House because his findings “did not comport with administration’s position on climate change”. That prompted him to leave his post – one of a stream of scientists sidelined or forced out over what critics of the Trump administration characterize as a war on science, because warnings for the dangers of human-caused global heating conflict with the Donald Trump’s industrial objectives. “The decision to block the written testimony is another example of a well-established pattern in the Trump administration of undercutting evidence that contradicts its policy positions,” Schoonover wrote in an opinion article for the New York Times, published on Tuesday. “Beyond obstructing science, this action also undermined the analytic independence of a major element of the intelligence community.” At the last minute he said he was permitted to verbally summarize the 11-page testimony at the hearing, but it was not a full analysis. “The bottom line of written testimony was this: ‘Climate change will have wide-ranging implications for US national security over the next 20 years,’” he wrote. Schoonover, who previously worked as a tenured university professor and has a background in physics and chemistry, said the report included peer-reviewed studies, as well as the findings of government scientists. “The intelligence community has repeatedly warned of the dangers that climate change poses to national security,” he wrote, citing the outgoing director of national intelligence Daniel Coats’s warning about the likely future impact of the climate crisis. Coats, who is soon to be replaced by the Texas Republican and Trump loyalist John Ratcliffe, wrote in the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment that the climate crisis and environmental and ecological degradation “are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress and social discontent through 2019 and beyond”. Schoonover said the impact of environmental changes are likely to include issues with global food and water security, increased migration and political and economic instability. The Trump administration is routinely ignoring or blocking expertise from being aired, according to whistleblowers and groups that track agency decisions. Maria Caffrey, a former climate scientist for the National Park Service, recently filed a whistleblower complaint and testified to Congress that she was prevented from publishing data about the potential flooding of coastal parks as a result of rising sea levels. “In February 2019, I lost my job because I was a climate scientist in a climate-denying administration,” she wrote in an opinion article for the Guardian. “And yet my story is no longer unique.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMr. Kyoji Kimoto has asked me to post the following essay, which tells us leading climate sensitivity scientist Dr. Robert Cess admits the IPCC assumptions are erroneous. (Note: Because WordPress didn’t handle some of the scientific notation, I had to cut and paste parts of the text as images).
===================================
Dr. Robert D. Cess admits mathematical errors in the AGW theory of the IPCC
by Kyoji Kimoto
Soden & Held [1] shows climate sensitivity is 3°K for 2xCO2 from the 14 GCM studies for the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (2007) as follows:
Climate sensitivity = no-feedback sensitivity (Planck response) x feedbacks
= 1.2°K x 2.5 = 3°K
Here, feedbacks are water vapor, ice albedo, lapse rate and cloud feedback.
In the AGW theory of the IPCC, the central assumption is that the Planck response is 1.2°K. Cess [2, 3] obtained the Planck feedback parameter lambda0 of -3.3(W/m2)/K utilizing eqn (1), giving the Planck response of 1.2K with the radiative forcing RF of 4W/m2 for 2xCO2 as follows:

Coincidently, the Planck response of 1.2°K by eqn (3) is in very good agreement with the Planck response of 1.2 – 1.3°K obtained with one dimensional radiative convective equilibrium model (1DRCM) studies in the literature [4, 5, 6]. Therefore, the Cess method has been followed by many researchers, including the IPCC 1st Assessment Report (1990) and the 14 GCM studies for the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (2007).
It is the sole theoretical basis of the central assumption of the IPCC that the Planck response is 1.2°K at present time [7, 8, 9], because the 1 DRCM study is fudged due to its strong dependence on lapse rate used according to Hansen’s idea expressed in an interview with Spencer Weart held on 23 October, 2000 at NASA.

On 23 August, 2016, Dr. Robert D. Cess gave me the following answer to my mail, admitting his mathematical errors in the derivation from eqn (1) to eqn (3). Dr. Cess was the leading climate scientist of Intercomparison Project of GCMs for the IPCC Assessment Reports. He wrote:
I will try this one more time, and then I will give up. A lot has happened since M&S (1964) and M&W (1967). In modern usage, the no-feedback sensitivity refers to holding all climate parameters fixed except surface temperature. It addresses the question: What would the sensitivity be if there were no interactive climate feedback mechanisms?.  Simply stated, it is a hypothetical reference sensitivity.  NO ONE HAS EVER CLAIMED THAT THE NO-FEEDBACK SENSITIVITY IS A TRUE INDICATION OF THE REAL SENSITIVITY.“
The AGW theory of the IPCC is constructed on the Planck response of 1.2°K produced by the mathematically erroneous Cess method. Since Cess has admitted his mathematical errors in the above reply, the theory totally collapses together with the high climate sensitivity of 3°K for a doubling of CO2. It raises sea surface temperature as much as 2°K, thus leading to the various AGW scares such as rapid sea level rise and severer extreme weather in the GCM studies of the IPCC.
Kimoto [11] showed the surface climate sensitivity of 0.14-0.17°K with the surface radiative forcing of 1.1 W/m2 for 2xCO2. It is reduced from the radiative forcing of 3.7 W/m2 at the tropopause due to infrared absorption overlap between CO2 and water vapor plentifully existing at the surface.
Policy based on false science
There is no need for the restriction of fossil fuel usage from the AGW scares claimed by the IPCC with its mathematically erroneous GCM studies. And ratification of Paris climate deal is harmful to mankind due to its useless CO2 regulations causing huge economic losses to the world.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe often hear claims from the media of how president-elect Donald Trump unfairly got help from Vladimir Putin and the Russians to win the election, and that it’s outrageous a foreign government would meddle with and influence the US political process. (Never mind these allegations continue to be based on practically nothing.)

Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment donated between $1 million and $5 million to the Clintons during the third quarter of 2016. 
And just days ago Germany’s CDU and CSU parties issued a warning to Russia not to interfere with the affairs and political processes in other countries, especially as Germany prepares for next year’s national election.
Surprise: it turns out that if any country has been attempting to skew the US election, it is Germany itself.
The country’s Federal Ministry for the Environment, a powerful arm of the German government, is reported here to have made a donation to the tune of 1 – 5 million dollars to the Clinton Foundation in the third quarter of 2016, i.e. right at the very peak of the presidential campaign.
Daniel Wetzel at the online national daily Die Welt here reports:
According to a donor list from the ‘Clinton Foundation’ the Ministry transferred between 1 million and 5 million dollars.”

Wetzel asks:
Why does Germany have to finance the US election campaign?”
The donation has come under fire from critics — Wetzel writes — such as former parliamentarian Vera Langenfeld at her blog:
Why is a German federal ministry supporting the election campaign of an American candidate? Obviously the German taxpayers have to finance Hillary Clinton’s campaign without their knowledge of it.”
The Ministry, however, denies the charge of having meddled with the US election, stating that it “fundamentally does not make donations” and that the money was for financing projects “within the scope of international climate protection”.
However, the timing of the donation makes the appearance all the more dubious. During the campaign, Clinton was attacked massively by Trump for the huge and frequent donations coming from an array of outside special interests. Trump went on to accuse Clinton of being up for sale.
Overall the German government and press have been openly hostile to Donald Trump’s election victory. In the current Trump-German relations, it has to be said that Germany drew first blood by unfairly smearing Trump as a racist, misogynist and an out-of control rabble-rouser, and refusing to congratulate him or to give him a chance.
As it stands, there’s no reason for Trump to be extend the hand of friendship to the German government, or especially to the media. Germany enjoys a huge trade deficit with the USA and so don’t be surprised if Trump answers by luring German industry to America by offering lower taxes, less red tape and far cheaper energy. Already German electricity rates are approximately three times higher than those in USA.

"Fiji will introduce one of the world’s most ambitious legislative programs to tackle the climate crisis, and has labelled the global community’s decision to set aside the call for global heating to be capped at 1.5C “grossly irresponsible and selfish”. In a speech to the Fijian parliament on Wednesday morning announcing the upcoming climate change act, Fiji’s attorney general and minister for economy and climate change, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, called global heating “a fight for our lives and our livelihoods”.  Sayed-Khaiyum was speaking ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) in Tuvalu next week, which will be attended by leaders of Pacific countries including Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama – a former president of COP23, the UN’s influential climate body, and world leader in the climate fight – and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison. The act will include tighter restrictions on the use of plastics, a framework for Fiji to reduce its emissions to net-zero by 2050, the introduction of a carbon credits scheme and the establishment of procedures for the relocation of communities at risk from the adverse effects of the climate crisis. The attorney general said that at the PIF Fiji would “make the case for more ambition on the part of the island states and our larger neighbours”. Over the years, Bainimarama has regularly criticised Australia for putting its economic interests ahead of environmental concerns and the wellbeing of neighbouring Pacific countries, which are on the frontline of the climate crisis. In 2015, in a blistering attack, Bainimarama said: “The Australian government, in particular, seems intent on putting its own immediate economic interests first … The ‘lucky country’ determined to stay lucky, at least for the short term, at the expense of its unlucky island neighbours.” Sayed-Khaiyum outlined the impact the climate crisis was already having around the world, including the Arctic ice melt, record high temperatures, droughts, floods and wildfires. “And here in the vast Pacific sits our beloved Fiji. Small and increasingly vulnerable as we scan the horizon anxiously year by year for the kind of extreme weather event that three years ago, took the lives of 44 of our loved ones and inflicted damage equal to one third of our GDP,” he said, in reference to Hurricane Winston in 2016. “[T]hat is the grave situation in which we find ourselves through no fault of our own and why this government puts such a strong emphasis on the climate issue.” Sayed-Khaiyum also shed light on discussions at UN climate talks in Bonn in May, during which Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing nations were accused of ignoring a crucial IPCC report that urged action to keep temperatures below 1.5C. “In Bonn in May, we suffered a significant setback when the nations of the world – under pressure from certain fossil fuel producers – set aside the IPCC scientific report endorsing the call for global warming to be capped at 1.5 degree Celsius above that of the pre-industrial age,” he said. Sayed-Khaiyum said the decision was “a blow to our hopes” and “grossly irresponsible and selfish”. The climate change bill, announced by the attorney general on Wednesday, will be introduced to the parliament in the September session, ahead of the UN secretary general’s climate summit. Fiji was the first, and is one of the only governments in the world, to combine their economy and climate change ministries, said Sayed-Khaiyum, who holds both portfolios. “We understand the relationship between a strong economy and a stable climate,” he said. Sayed-Khaiyum said he hoped the legislation would pass parliament with “unanimous support” from MPs to send a clear message to the world about Fiji’s commitment to tackling the climate crisis and that other nations would emulate the legislation."

Ocala, FL (PRWEB) Global Weather Oscillations (GWO) veteran meteorologist David Dilley says in his early forecast that the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season will be stronger than last year – with the potential for 6 named storms making United States landfalls.
It will also be the most dangerous since the 2005 season, which saw 5 hurricane landfalls and 2 tropical storms.
GWO has issued the most accurate preseason predictions of any organization the past 8 years, including last years’ prediction that the “Atlantic Basin” (which includes the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico) – would enter a Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle in 2016.
David Dilley, Senior Meteorologist for Global Weather Oscillations (GWO) – correctly predicted months in advance that GWO’s prediction zones for the Florida Panhandle and Florida’s East Coast northward to North Carolina – would experience hurricane and/or strong tropical storm conditions in 2016, with multiple strikes likely (see GWO’s 2016 hot-spot predictions graphic).
Here is the GWO’s prediction from last year.
As it turned out – 5 named storms made United States landfalls with Hurricane Hermine making landfall on the Florida Panhandle in the Eastern Upper Gulf (see Hot Spots graphic). But more importantly was Hurricane Matthew – a major hurricane that moved north across Haiti and the Western Bahama’s – then hugged the coastal areas from Florida to North Carolina. 1,739 people died from hurricanes in 2016, most of which were from Hurricane Matthew in the Caribbean. The last time the death toll was that high was in 2005 when nearly 4,000 people were killed by hurricanes.

The official hurricane season begins on June 1 and ends December 1. The Atlantic Basin on average has 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2.7 major hurricanes. As predicted by GWO, the 2016 hurricane season was more dangerous and costlier than average. The official season (minus Hurricane Alex in January) – had 14 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes – and the United States experienced much above normal activity with 5 out of the 14 named storms making landfall in GWO’s predicted Hot Spots, 2 of which were hurricanes (Mathew and Hermine).
2017 prediction
GWO’s Climate Pulse Hurricane Model indicates that 2017 will once again be influenced by a Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle – with very conducive conditions for hurricane development due to the lack of an El Niño, or La Niña conditions. In addition ocean water temperatures continue to run warmer than normal across most of the Atlantic Basin (red and orange in the graphic), and especially in the Caribbean region and the Atlantic near the United States. This warmer ocean water will be conducive for tropical storms and/or hurricanes forming and/or strengthening close to the United States.
Mr. Dilley, a 40-year veteran, also expects the Bermuda-Azores High Pressure Center will be weaker this summer – thus allowing more named storms to maintain strength – or strengthen as they move from east to west across the Atlantic toward the United States.
He believes the upcoming 2017 hurricane season will be stronger than last year, and it will be the most dangerous and costliest in 12 years for the United States.
The upcoming season will have 16 named storms (14 last year), 8 hurricanes (6 last year), and 4 major hurricanes (3 last year). In addition the United States will have the potential for 6 named storms making landfall, the most since the 2005 season that saw 5 hurricanes and 2 tropical storms make landfall.
GWO also expects 3 out of the 6 landfalls will be hurricanes – with 1 or 2 having the potential for being a major impact hurricane. More information is available at GlobalWeatherOscillations.com, or GlobalWeatherCycles.com.
GWO is the only organization that issues detailed predictions two years into the future for 11 United States prediction zones stretching from New England to Texas. GWO’s hot spot zone predictions for the United States have been nearly 87 percent accurate since 2006 – with GWO correctly predicting 1 to 3 years in advance – the occurrences of Hurricane Ike (2008), Irene (2011), Sandy (2012), Matthew and Hermine (2016). Detailed zone and hot spot predictions for the 2017 and 2018 hurricane seasons can be obtained through GlobalWeatherOscillations.com, or GlobalWeatherCycles.com.
GWO and Senior Meteorologist/Climatologist David Dilley is an expert on climate cycles and climate change. A “free” climate change e-book “Earth’s Natural Climate Pulse” (authored by Mr. Dilley) can be acquired through the Global Weather Oscillations web site.

"We tend to learn better from experience than from what we have simply been told. So for many in Europe, sleepless nights and suffocating buses or workplaces have helped to make real the threat posed by global heating. Now statistics are reinforcing the message. Last week the UK had the hottest day on record: 38.7C in Cambridge. New records were set in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands in July, and June was the hottest month in US history. The Met Office says that the UK’s 10 hottest years on record have all been since 2002. Heatwaves naturally occur in summer, but they did not used to be so hot, or so frequent. Experts say that the UK’s sweltering weather last summer was made 30 times more likely by global heating. That link has sunk in: in a new survey, 77% believed the recent heatwave was partially or wholly caused by the climate crisis. As temperatures reach unprecedented levels, so does public concern about the environment.  Yet while global heating is just that, its impact varies even within countries. Most people surveyed in July considered the weather too hot. But, while 73% of people in the east of England judged it too hot, in chillier Scotland only 47% of people agreed – and a slightly larger proportion thought it just right or not warm enough. Some may look forward to warmer staycations and the chance to grow grapes in their back garden. Even those alarmed by July’s heat may not envision the full scale of the climate crisis. The connection between global heating and heatwaves seems self-evident. It’s intuitively harder to link it to other extreme weather events, and to take in experts’ warnings that Britain seems to be getting wetter as well as warmer. It’s more difficult still to fully comprehend how harsh its impact will be elsewhere. For many people, even a small rise in temperatures will be catastrophic. A new report from Monash University in Melbourne warns that the climate crisis is already causing deaths; one of its authors said almost 400 people died from heat stress and heatstroke during fires in Victoria 10 years ago. It predicts climate-related stunting, malnutrition and lower IQ in children within the coming decades; a 2018 report from the World Health Organisation predicted that an additional 250,000 deaths a year will occur between 2030 and 2050 due to global heating. Some places will experience more severe temperature shifts or will find it harder to adapt than others, often through lack of resources. Poorer countries, which broadly speaking are the least to blame for the climate crisis – emitting less carbon dioxide per capita – will suffer most. A hurricane or wildfire is deadlier when there is little capacity to prepare for it or to speed recovery. Families that spend most of their income on food struggle to eat when crops suffer. A recent study found that global heating has already increased global inequality: in most poor countries, higher temperatures are very likely to have resulted in lower economic output than they would otherwise have enjoyed, while richer nations were not harmed to the same degree, and some were potentially able to actually benefit. Bangladesh and sub-Saharan African nations are among those hit. The research ties in with previous projections that by 2100 the average income in the poorest countries will be 75% lower than it would be without climate change, and that some wealthy countries might even see higher incomes. Yet none of these problems will be fully contained within national borders. Drought and famine are already forcing families from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to attempt to migrate to the United States when they are unable to feed themselves. A World Food Programme study of Central American migrants found that almost half were food insecure. A 4C rise this century, which is now considered a realistic prospect, would produce at least 300 million refugees and drown cities in the US and China. It is the duty of richer nations to do all they can to hold back the soaring temperatures which they did most to produce, and to take what action they can to mitigate their impact – abroad as well as at home. It is also in their self-interest."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s DWD national weather service just issued the preliminary results for the country’s January 2017 mean temperature.
According the DWD’s approximately 2000 stations scattered across the country, January’s mean temperature came in 2.7°C colder than the 1981-2010 mean. Especially southern Germany was cold, as was its neighbor Austria, see below.
The lowest recorded temperature in Germany was measured in Reit im Winkl: -26.3°C. Most of the precipitation this past January, which was 27% below normal, fell as snow.
The DWD attributed the colder temperatures to a wintry weather pattern.
No warming
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) has analyzed the German data for the Erfurt-Weimar station and has found that there has been no warming in January over the past 45 years (since 1973):

Despite rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, January temperature at the Erfurt-Weimar station has remained flat since 1973. Chart: Stefan Kämpfe, EIKE.
Josef Kowatsch also analyzed Germany’s January temperature trend and found that the month has in fact cooled almost 2°C over the past 25 years. I’ll see if I can chase down his chart.

EIKE also looked at the Central England January temperature record and found that there has only been a slight warming over the past 105 years!
In fact the warmest years in Central England were recorded in the early part of the 20th century.

Meanwhile Austria’s ZAMG national weather service reports that January 2017 in the country was “extraordinarily cold”, the second coldest in 30 years, with the preliminary mean coming in at 3.0°C below the long term 1981-2010 mean.
The chart shows the temperature deviation from the mean.

"Instead of letting your dirty dishwater go down the drain, consider using it to water the trees on your street. That is the message from tree experts, who say survival rates for urban trees could be boosted significantly by volunteers. Russell Miller, a London-based arboricultural consultant, said: “If you plant trees from good stock, at the right time, and provide enough water, you’d lose almost none prematurely. But get that wrong, and more than half can die.”  Miller says a big issue is that local council budgets often do not stretch to include proper watering, which is critical in the first three years of a tree’s life. “Watering is less sexy than planting. It’s cheaper to replace them,” he said. New street trees need at least 20 litres of water a week – about two large watering cans – from April to September, especially in hot weather, says Miller. Any tap or grey water, including dishwater, bathwater and water from washing cars, windows and even clothes, is fine, as long as it does not contain bleach. England’s tree-planting fell 71% short of government targets last year, with just over 2m planted. Last October, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, announced a £60m scheme to plant 10m trees, including 130,000 urban trees. But there are concerns that both the money and trees could go to waste unless the right aftercare is prioritised. “The idea is not just to plant a million trees, but to establish a million trees,” warned Tony Kirkham, arboretum head at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. Most species of street tree, such as the London plane, are chosen especially for their resilience and tolerance of urban stress. But even these species need years to develop root systems that can find their own sources of moisture among the networks of cables and pipes, and compacted soil under pavements and roads. “Once street trees get stressed it’s difficult for them to bounce back, they really struggle, and have to rely on rain falling the following year,” Kirkham explained. “If this doesn’t happen, the problem is compounded from year to year.” Citizen-led projects are making an impact, and some local councils, including Cambridge, Sheffield, Camden, Kingston-upon-Thames, Waltham, Enfield and Richmond, have started social media campaigns, put signs up on trees and sent out leaflets urging residents to water their local trees. “Councils are hoping for rain, and hoping they’ll survive, but there are heavy losses when it comes to urban tree planting. The public can dramatically improve their chances of survival,” said Kirkham. “Anything we can do to relieve the stress on our trees is a massive bonus, for both our local authorities and our trees.”"

"The Whaley Bridge dam scare is a warning of the potentially disastrous consequences of failing to build new infrastructure to cope with the climate emergency, experts have said. As the environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee on efforts to make the dam safe, the government was facing calls for an urgent overhaul of flood defences and water infrastructure. Villiers said the government was ensuring that “everything possible is being done to draw down water levels, fix damage to the dam and protect homes and businesses.” Bob Ward, a policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said: “This is an example where our infrastructure is not up to scratch and we are not acting quickly enough to upgrade it. It is a warning to Villiers that she has got to put climate resilience at the top of the government’s list. “It is all very well worrying about Brexit, but without upgrading infrastructure we are going to suffer more and more grave consequences. If you delay on this, all you are doing is setting us up for disaster.” Ward said the government had been “caught on the hop” by the two wettest winters on record, in 2013 and 2015. In response it promised a flood resilience review, but so far it has examined only river flooding and not the impact of surface water flooding. In May the Environment Agency said an increase in extreme flooding events could force thousands of people to move away from coastal regions. Ward said: “We have the flood defence system fit for the climate of the 20th century when we need it fit for the 21st century. We are going to see more record rainfall, more flooding along our coasts and rivers, and we are just not prepared for that.” Paul Sheffield, a senior vice-president at the Institution of Civil Engineers, said incident at the Whaley Bridge dam, which was built in the 1830s, was a “timely reminder that we cannot afford to underinvest in infrastructure”. He said: “Every bit of infrastructure is going to be exposed to more onerous events than it was originally designed for, so it obviously has to be reviewed.” Sheffield, who was a civil engineer on the Maentwrog dam in north Wales, one of the only new concrete dams built in the UK in the last 50 years, said flood defences should be built at least a metre higher. “In Holland whenever they strengthen their sea defence structures they are taking the precaution of building them a metre higher than they were 50 years ago because of the possibility of flood events. This is something the UK government needs to look at. Our flood defences will need to be raised,” he said. The government is due to respond soon to a review by the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) that urged it to commit to spending 1.2% of GDP on infrastructure and ensure a further 1.8% of GDP is provided by the private sector. Sheffield said much of this potential investment was now in jeopardy. “We just need to be really careful in this country that we don’t frighten overseas investors away from investing in infrastructure,” he said. “Political uncertainty, not only around Brexit but also the meltdown in UK politics, will inevitably make infrastructure investment organisations from overseas more nervous about investing in this country.” The NIC also called for a series of six-year funding programmes until 2050 to ensure UK households were resilient to flooding. The cost to the public purse would be about £1bn annually, but as yet no government minister has adopted the proposals or set about putting what is a long term flood resilience programme into action. Phil Graham, the chief executive of the NIC, said: “Flood resilience is a major issue, it is important for the economy and for society and we are a world away from where we need to be. It requires a long-term, ambitious response because the impacts of climate change are going to make events like this more and more likely, not less and less likely.” Terry Fuller, the chief executive of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, said: “There is no doubt the UK is nowhere near resilient enough or ready for even the current climate let alone anything we are going to see in the coming decades. The message is getting through [to the government] but whether something is done about it remains to be seen and there is very little doubt that we will see more events like this.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitter“The current eager acceptance of oceanic thermal lag as the ‘explanation’ as to why CO2 warming remains undetected, reemphasizes that the atmosphere cannot warm until the oceans do. The logical implication follows that most current climate models are lacking in relevance; they have not been constructed with ocean surface temperature as the fundamental variable. When the problem is attacked from this view, sensitivity to CO2 is significantly reduced; a position also strongly supported by the available palaeoclimatic data.”  — Ellsaesser, 1984

According to the IPCC (2013), 93% of the heat energy change from global warming can be found in the oceans (AR5, Chapter 3).  Only a tiny fraction of climate change can be accounted for in the atmospheric record, as the heat capacity of the oceans is more than a thousand times greater than the heat capacity of the air.  In other words, the widely-publicized surface air temperature change of about +0.6° to +1.0°C since the 19th century is not the main barometer of whether or not global warming has occurred – – and if it has, by how much.  Global warming (or cooling) is primarily accounted for as a change in ocean heat content, not surface air temperatures.
Climate models that prognosticate what the temperature of the global climate system might be 100+ years from now, or when atmospheric CO2 concentrations reach 560 ppm (doubled pre-industrial levels) are fundamentally flawed, for they presume that CO2 concentration rise (or decline) is a primary determinant of changes in atmospheric temperature change.  It is not.  Because of the magnitude of difference in heat capacity, it is the global ocean that determines the temperature of the air (predominantly), not the other way around.
It therefore needs to be established that (1) CO2 variations and ocean heat content changes are correlated (when CO2 falls, ocean heat/temperatures fall, and vice versa); and if they are correlated, then it still needs to be scientifically established (i.e., via experimental observation and measurement) that (2) ocean heat/temperature changes are primarily caused by CO2 variations.  Just because there is a correlation between two variables does not necessarily mean that one variable is the cause of the other.
So, as mentioned, first we need to establish a correlation before we can even consider causation.  And when it comes to a correlation between CO2 variations and ocean heat content variations, we don’t have one.  According to scientific studies of long-term ocean heat content, for 99.975% of the last 10,000 years, there has effectively been no significant correlation between rising or falling CO2 concentrations and rising or falling ocean heat.  As will be clarified below, the only period in the last 10,000 years in which CO2 and ocean heat/temperatures sharply rose or fell in concert was the period between 1975 and 2000.
Just 0.09°C – 0.18°C Of Net Warming In 0-2000 m To 0-700 m Ocean Since 1955
Levitus et al. (2012) estimate that, between 1955 and 2010, the global ocean heat energy change (converted to temperature) amounted to an addition of a blistering +0.18°C in the 0-700 m layer, and +0.09°C in the upper 2000 meters of the ocean.  That’s less than one-tenth of one degree over 55 years in the 0-2000 m layer.
Levitus et al., 2012
“The World Ocean accounts for approximately 93% of the warming of the earth system that has occurred since 1955. … The heat content of the World Ocean for the 0–2000 m layer increased by 24.0 ± 1.9 × 1022 J (±2S.E.) [over 1955-2010] corresponding to a rate of 0.39 W m−2 (per unit area of the World Ocean) and a volume mean warming of 0.09°C. … The heat content of the World Ocean for the 0–700 m layer increased by 16.7 ± 1.6 × 1022 J corresponding to a rate of 0.27 W m−2(per unit area of the World Ocean) and a volume mean warming of 0.18°C.”
Below the 2000 m depth (and 52% of the ocean waters reside below 2000 m), the “entirety” of the Pacific and Indian Oceans as well as the Eastern Atlantic have been cooling for the last few decades, largely off-setting the already modest change in the 0-2000 m layer.
Wunsch and Heimbach, 2014
“Over the 20 yr of the present ECCO state estimate, changes in the deep ocean on multiyear time scales are dominated by the western Atlantic basin and Southern Oceans. … In those same regions, a longer-term general warming pattern occurs below 2000 m. A very weak long-term cooling is seen over the bulk of the rest of the ocean below that depth, including the entirety of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, along with the eastern Atlantic basin.”

But let’s consider the contextual magnitude of the 0.18°C of warming in the 0-700 m layer since 1955.  Below is a graph taken from the Rosenthal et al. (2013) paper published in the journal Science documenting the changes in 0-700 m Pacific Ocean heat content during the Holocene.   Pictured are the last 1,200 years (800 C.E. to 2010) of ocean heat changes, including the added blue dotted line on the right extending from 1955 to 2010 (+0.18°C).
As indicated by the black trend bars, notice (a) the amplitude of the rise for the 1900-2010 period is not as steep as 11 previous decadal- and centennial-scale demarcated warming periods during the last 1,200 years.  Also notice that (b) the overall sharp drop in ocean heat since the Medieval Warm Period ended (encompassing the 1200 C.E. to 1900 Little Ice Age) was not accompanied by a sharp decline in CO2 concentrations, and that the Medieval Warm Period had flat, not rising, CO2 levels,  indicating that CO2 variations could not have been a causal factor in the ocean heat content changes during this entire period (800 C.E. to 1900).  Finally, notice that (c) modern temperatures are still tenths of a degree cooler than they were during the 1300 to 1500 C.E. period, when CO2 concentrations still hovered around 280 ppm.  In sum, the data in this graph indicate that there has been no significant correlation between CO2 and ocean heat temperature variations for nearly all of the last 1,200 years.

Non-Correlation Between Human CO2 Emissions & Ocean Heat For Most Of The 1900-2010 Period

And yes, the non-correlation includes the 1900-2010 period.  There are very few reconstructions of global-scale ocean heat content prior to 1950 available in the scientific literature.  However, in a paper entitled “Consistent near surface ocean warming since 1900,” Gouretski et al. (2012) provide a comprehensive look at available evidence for the near-surface (0-20 m) change in ocean heat content for the early 20th century.  The supplemental graph below (using the available link [red] from the University of Hamburg) was made available upon the release of the paper.
Gouretski et al., 2012
http://icdc.cen.uni-hamburg.de/uploads/pics/hc_fig2.jpeg
Taking a closer look, the graph shows that the amplitude (+1.3°C) and rate (+0.27°C per decade) of the 1900-1945 ocean warming period was about 4 to 5 times as large as the 1945-2010 warming period (+0.3°C, +0.055°C per decade).

In the paper, Gouretski and co-authors point out that the twenty-first century has experienced a general cooling in large regions of the global ocean — just as anthropogenic CO2 emissions (and atmospheric CO2 concentrations) were rising most dramatically.
“[T]he first decade of the 21st century (2001–2010) was not uniformly warmer than previous decades. Before about 1920, the global ocean was almost everywhere colder than the reference decade of 2001–2010. After 1920, several regions of the global ocean were warmer than the reference decade [2001-2010]. … [A] rather abrupt cooling since the end of 1990s both in the East Pacific (connected to the weakening of El Nino and the shift to the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and in the Southern Ocean may have contributed to a flattening of the global temperature anomaly series after about 2000. …Decadal mean SST and 0–20 m layer anomalies calculated relative to the reference decade 2001–2010 give evidence of the general warming of the global ocean since 1900. However, large regions of the oceans have experienced cooling since the 1990s. Whereas cooling in the tropical Eastern Pacific ocean is associated with frequent La Nina events in the past decade, the cause of the cooling within the Southern Ocean remains unknown.”
The much larger amplitude and rate of warming that occurred in the early 20th century was not accompanied by a commensurate large change (increase) in anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  In fact, throughout the entire 1900 to 1945 period, human emissions only averaged about 1 gigaton of carbon per year (GtC/yr).  In contrast, human emissions rates rose sharply to 4 GtC/yr by the 1970s, 6 GtC/yr by the 1990s, and over 10 GtC/yr by 2014.  Atmospheric CO2 followed a similar trajectory, as concentrations rose by just 15 ppm in the 40 years between 1900 and 1950 (295 ppm to 310 ppm), whereas concentrations rose by 85 ppm in the 65 years after 1950, including 22 ppm just between the years 2000 and 2010 alone (Feldman et al., 2015) — a decade when near-surface ocean heat “flattened” according to Gouretski et al. (2012).  And despite this explosive increase in human CO2 emissions and atmospheric CO2, the near surface ocean heat content actually cooled between 1945 and 1975, and the rate of warming since 1975 has been much less pronounced than during the 1900-1945 period.

If we were to visually combine the record of the explosive rise in human CO2 emissions since 1945 with the record of near-surface ocean heat content for the entire 1900-2010 period, it would be evident that the only decadal-scale period in which CO2 emissions steeply rose in concert with ocean temperature was during the 25 years between 1975 to 2000.  For 1900-1975 and 2000-2010, there was no obvious correlation between rapidly rising CO2 and ocean heat content.

No Correlation Between CO2 Variations And Ocean Heat For The Entire Holocene
And not only is there a lack of correlation between rising CO2 and rising ocean heat content for all but the 1975-2000 period during the years 800 C.E. through 2010, there is also no correlation between rising CO2 and rising ocean heat for the entirety of the Holocene.  Actually, the general long-term trend is for there to be an inverse correlation: as CO2 rises, ocean heat content declines.   The following Rosenthal et al. (2013) graph of the Pacific Ocean’s 0-500 m layer demonstrates this.


Conclusion
To summarize, in the last 10,000 years, there was one 25-year period (1975-2000) in which CO2 levels and ocean heat content rose in concert.  Other than that, the rest of the last 10,000 years contained no obvious correlation between ocean heat content variations and the rise and fall of CO2 concentrations.  Without a significant long-term (or short-term) correlation between these two variables, we cannot even begin to address the causality question.
Simply put, the presumption that variations in CO2 concentrations cause global warming — net increases in global-scale ocean heat content — has not been established.

Top summer in the Czech Republic: Unexpected heat in 1540
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Temperature measurements as a rule go back one or two hundred years. Thus beyond the thermometer age, one has to work with so-called proxies. In the Czech epublic one team of scientists led by Martin Možný reconstructed the temperature history of the country using the historical data on grape harvests going back 500 years. (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Temperature of the Czech Republic over the past 500 years. From Možný et al. 2016. The blue curve since 1800 AD represents thermometer data.
The harvest time turned out to be a reliable indicator of the April to August temperature. As expected, the warmest 30-year interval occurred from 1986-2015. Interestingly, however, 1540 was identified as the hottest of the last 500 years and was part of an above average period in the 16th century.

What follows is the Abstract of the Paper in the journal Climate of the Past:
April–August temperatures in the Czech Lands, 1499–2015, reconstructed from grape-harvest dates
Viticulture has long been essential to the commercial and social well-being of parts of the Czech Lands (now the Czech Republic), and detailed records have been kept for centuries of the timing and relative success of the grape crop. Using such documentary data from the Bohemian wine-growing region (mainly northwest of the capital, Prague), series of grape-harvest dates (GHDs) were created for the 1499–2015 period. Because the link between harvest dates and temperatures is strong, GHD series, together with instrumental mean temperature series starting in 1801, were used to reconstruct mean April–August temperatures for the region from 1499 to 2015. Linear regression (LR) and variance scaling (VS) methods were used for calibration and compared in terms of explained variance and their ability to capture extreme values. It emerged that LR does not significantly underestimate temperature variability. However, VS shows far greater capacity to capture extremes. GHDs explain 64 % of temperature variability over the full calibration period. The 1986–2015 period was identified as the warmest 30-year period of the past 514 years, an observation consistent with recent global warming. The highest April–August temperatures appeared in a reconstruction for the year 1540, which was warmer than the next two very warm, and far more recent, seasons in 2003 and 2015. The coldest period occurred at the beginning of the 20th century (1900–1929). The series reconstructed for the Czech Lands is in close agreement with other (central) European reconstructions based on other proxies. The series created here makes an important contribution to a better understanding of long-term spatiotemporal temperature variability in central Europe.
It can be observed that the study’s period of investigation did not reach into the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). I t would have been interesting to have compared the the current warm period with the MWP. In general the data in the Czech Republic for the MWP is extremely scant.
Within the scope of the MWP charting project, not a single study has been found to date for this time period. Looking across regions, a warm MWP is highly likely when we look at the studies from neighboring countries (red points). From a hydro-climatological view, the Czech Republic borders on the humid northern European MWP (green points ) and the southern European dry MWP (yellow points).

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast month at the University College London, atmospheric scientist Prof. Murry Salby, formerly of Macquarie University in Australia, gave a damning presentation on man-made CO2 and its (lack of) impact on global climate.
Hat-tip: a reader by e-mail.

He begins by reminding that climate is a subject of “limited understanding” and that it one of “limited observation” He tells the audience that carbon in the atmosphere cannot be regulated and is NOT a pollutant. On why CO2 science got to where it is today, he cites Mark Twain: “Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.”
Neither cleaner nor greener
In his introduction he explains how CO2 will be a pollutant to our ecosystem only when the day arrives that water vapour becomes a pollutant – i.e. never in our geological lifetime.
He says that energy sources that circumvent CO2 emissions are neither greener nor cleaner – just different.
IPCC premise impossible
Later he shows that although humans have emitted twice as much CO2 into the atmosphere over the last decade compared to a decade earlier, growth in atmospheric CO2 concentration did not change at all. He states:
The premise of the IPCC that increased atmospheric CO2 results from fossil fuels emissions is impossible.”

Salby says this is “hardly a surprise”.  During the presentation Salby presents the scientific reasoning why CO2 is not the harmful gas it is claimed to be.
Worst agreement in human history
Near the end, the renowned dissident physicist slams the junk-science-based COP21 agreement, which would cost some 359 TRILLION dollars, and that the cost would be borne disproportionately by the disadvantaged in more ways than one.
40,000 people perished last winter alone in Europe due to hypothermia because they could not afford to heat their homes, he reminds us.
At 1:16:00 he concludes that 360 trillion dollars for climate protection will result in literally no benefit at all for citizens of the planet. On this scientific insanity:
My God. What an indictment of this era.”
Pseudoscience comparable to the quackery of bloodletting
In his concluding remarks Salby compares climatology to the medical quackery of bloodletting, which was used to try to treat George Washington’s throat infection. The treatment treated the infection, alright – after it had killed Washington in a mere 72 hours!
An excellent video that’s worth every minute.

While it has understandably not received much, if any, media attention, the North Atlantic Ocean has been rapidly cooling since the mid-2000s, or for more than 10 years now.   The longer the cooling trend continues — and scientists are projecting more cooling for the coming decades  —  the more difficult it will be to ignore.   The North Atlantic Ocean is, after all, a key trend-setter for hemispheric- and perhaps even global-scale climate changes.
In their new paper, for example, Reynolds and colleagues (2017) point out that natural fluctuations in heat transport initiated by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are “directly linked” to precipitation and warming/cooling temperature trends in Africa, Brazil, North America, and Europe.   Not only that, but the authors explain that a centennial-scale reduction in surface heat transport (AMOC) can explain the dramatic reduction in surface temperatures from the warmth of the Medieval Warm Period to the frigid Little Ice Age, which, of course, could imply that centennial-scale increases in surface heat transport could explain warming periods.

Reynolds et al., 2017       Evidence derived from instrumental observations suggest that Atlantic variability, associated with changes in SSTs and fluctuations in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), is directly linked with broader scale climate variability, including Brazilian and Sahel precipitation (Folland et al., 1986 and Folland et al., 2001), Atlantic hurricanes and storm tracks (Goldenberg et al., 2001 and Emanuel, 2005), and North American and European temperatures (Sutton and Hodson, 2005, Knight et al., 2006 and Mann et al., 2009). Furthermore, evidence derived from palaeoceanographic records suggests that a reduction in the meridional heat transport through the surface components of the AMOC was in part responsible for the reductions in temperatures associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 1000–1450) to Little Ice Age (LIA; 1450–1850) transition (Lund et al., 2006, Trouet et al., 2009, Trouet et al., 2012, Wanamaker et al., 2012 and Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2014).

Examining the Reynolds et al. (2017) graph of North Atlantic sea surface temperatures since the early 1800s, we notice that temperatures (shown to have declined by about -0.45 °C since 2005) are colder now than they were in the 1940s and 1950s, and that even the early 1800s had warmer temperatures than now.

Serykh (2016) points out that the warming enjoyed across Europe and Asia between the 1970s and late 1990s may have been associated with natural decadal-scale oscillations in heat transport.   Similar to Reynolds et al. (2017), Serykh’s graph of ocean heat content reveals no net warming in the last 60 years.

Serykh, 2016       A dipole structure of inter-decadal variations in the heat content of the ocean and heat fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere has been detected in the North Atlantic. The following fact deserves special attention: the cyclonic and anti-cyclonic atmospheric circulation anomalies, as well as the decrease and increase in the ocean heat content, take place concurrently and quasi-synchronously in the Iceland minimum and Azores maximum regions. Owing to this, the western heat transport anomalies along the 50th parallel increase or decrease the transport of heat from the Atlantic Ocean to the Euro-Asian continent, and the climate in Europe and Siberia becomes more marine or more continental. The very fast climate warming of the Euro-Asian continent that began in the 1970s may be associated with the enhanced heat transport from the North Atlantic in this period. This is evident from the fields and time series obtained in the present paper. The hiatus of this warming after 1999 may be due to the decreased heat transfer from the North Atlantic Ocean to the Eurasian territory.



Dramatic Cooling In the North Atlantic (Affecting Global Climate) Linked To Natural Variability, Not Human Influence
Scientists first began highlighting the North Atlantic cooling trend a few years ago.  Hermanson et al. (2014), for example, pointed out that the AMOC modulates the water temperatures in the North Atlantic by driving the transport of warmer (cooler) ocean water on decadal scales.   Using data that extended through 2012, they (correctly) forecast the cooling trend that had begun in the mid-2000s would continue.  It has.

Hermanson et al., 2014       The observed 5 year mean temperature averaged over the upper 500 m of the SPG [Subpolar Gyre, North Atlantic Ocean] [shows] a marked cooling in the late 1960s followed by a period with below average temperatures, and a warming in the 1990s followed by a period with above average temperatures. … The forecasts that were initialized between 2008 and 2012 (crosses) all show a general trend for further decreases in temperature, continuing the observed [cooling] trend. The 2012 forecast spread suggests that the chance of the observed warm SPG mean temperature anomaly of 2003–2007 (0.53) occurring again in 2013–2017 is less than 6%.
To gain further confidence in this forecast we examine the physical mechanisms that control SPG [North Atlantic Ocean] temperatures. Previous studies showed that the 1990s SPG warming was driven by increased convergence of ocean heat transport resulting from an increase in the AMOC, and the 1960s cooling was driven by reduced ocean heat transport convergence following a reduced AMOC. The hindcasts show changes in ocean heat transport convergence, consistent with these earlier events. The forecasts show a continued decrease in ocean heat transport convergence, consistent with a cooling SPG [Subpolar Gyre, North Atlantic Ocean].

A year ago, Robson et al. (2016) published a paper in Nature explaining that the previous warming trend (1995-2005) had “reversed” to a -0.45 °C cooling trend since 2005 (through 2015), and, like Hermanson et al. (2014) and Reynolds et al. (2017), they attributed both the 1995-2005 warming trend and the current cooling trend to the vagaries of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, even pointing out that the trends are not consistent with an anthropogenic influence.

Robson et al., 2016       In the mid-1990s the North Atlantic subpolar gyre warmed rapidly, which had important climate impacts such as increased hurricane numbers and changes to rainfall over Africa, Europe and North America. Evidence suggests that the warming was largely due to a strengthening of the ocean circulation, particularly the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Since the mid-1990s direct and indirect measurements have suggested a decline in the strength of the ocean circulation, which is expected to lead to a reduction in northward heat transport. Here we show that since 2005 a large volume of the upper North Atlantic Ocean has cooled significantly by approximately 0.45 °C or 1.5 × 1022 J, reversing the previous warming trend. … The observed upper ocean cooling since 2005 is not consistent with the hypothesis that anthropogenic aerosols directly drive Atlantic temperatures.


As the introductory graph of the North Atlantic trend shows above, Duchez and colleagues (2016) report that today’s temperatures are colder than they were in the 1950s — up to 2 °C colder than average — and the “most extreme in the modern record [1948-2015].”.
Duchez et al., 2016       [C]old ocean temperatures were the most extreme in the modern record [since 1948] over much of the mid-high latitude North-East Atlantic. … we consider the exceptionally cold ocean surface anomaly that was already in place prior to the onset of the 2015 heat wave. The SST anomaly field for June 2015 shows temperatures up to 2 °C colder than normal over much of the sub-polar gyre with values that are the coldest observed for this month of the year in the period 1948–2015 indicated by stippling. The cause of this cold anomaly has been the subject of widespread interest in the media, we now show for the first time that it can be attributed to a combination of air–sea heat loss from late 2014 through to spring 2015 and a re-emergent sub-surface ocean heat content [cold] anomaly that developed in preceding years.

Chafik et al. (2016) connect the warming-cooling-warming-cooling oscillatory patterns in the North Atlantic to the natural atmospheric forcing associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (which is symbiotically connected to the AMOC), and they also highlight the recent cooling trend in their graph (ending in 2012).   They further agree with other scientists that the North Atlantic region is “important for global mean temperature warming,” meaning that what happens in the North Atlantic may have broad implications for climate.
Chafik et al., 2016       The multidecadal variability of the North Atlantic Ocean has a strong signal in the sea surface temperature with many global climate linkages [Enfield et al., 2001; Knight et al., 2006]. An even stronger multidecadal signal can be found in the subpolar temperatures and salinities, where the Atlantic Water inflow variations constitute an essential part in the variability [Hátún et al., 2005; Häkkinen et al., 2011a; Reverdin, 2010]. The atmospheric forcing in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean is dominated by the variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), i.e., the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic sector, which modulates the atmosphere-ocean momentum and heat exchanges on a range of temporal scales. The subpolar ocean variability thus appears to be tightly connected to atmospheric forcing and associated basin-scale circulation changes, which together force the subpolar ocean properties toward extremes [Lozier et al., 2008, 2010], either to warm-saline or cold-fresh conditions on multidecadal scales. These regime changes have recently been argued to be important for global mean surface temperature warming acceleration and hiatus [Chen and Tung, 2014; Drijfhout et al., 2014].

Koenigk and Brodeau (2016) point out that Arctic sea ice area and volume changes (decline) in the last 30 years are “dominated by” the natural variability in heat transport (AMOC), and that a cooling trend may be in the works through 2030.

Koenigk and Brodeau, 2016       Decadal variations of Arctic sea ice extent and ice volume are of the same order of magnitude as the observed ice extent reductions in the last 30 years and are dominated by the variability of the ocean heat transports through the Barents Sea Opening and the Bering Strait. Despite a general warming of mid and high northern latitudes, a substantial cooling is found in the subpolar gyre of the North Atlantic under year-2015 and year-2030 conditions. This cooling is related to a strong reduction in the AMOC, itself due to reduced deep water formation in the Labrador Sea.

Still more scientists — Barcikowska et al. (2016) — observe a North Atlantic/tropical Pacific cooling-warming-cooling trend that may presage global temperature implications (cooling) for the coming decade(s).

Barcikowska et al., 2016       If the observations-based component of variability originates from internal climate processes, as found in the model, the recently observed (1970s-2000s) North Atlantic warming and eastern tropical Pacific cooling might presage an ongoing transition to a cold North Atlantic phase with possible implications for near-term global temperature evolution.


The North Atlantic Is Much Colder Now Than When CO2 Levels Were Much Lower
Because it is important to consider context, it should be pointed out that the 1995-2005 warming that occurred in the North Atlantic was not only well within the range of AMOC-driven natural variability, the relative warmth in that decade was still comparatively cold when considering the long-term temperatures for the North Atlantic region.  In fact, scientists have recently determined that the modern temperatures for the North Atlantic are still among the coldest of the last several thousand years — even the last few hundred.
The conspicuous lack of a net warming trend is significant because it is often claimed that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are the predominant cause of warming global ocean waters.  But there is no correlation between net ocean heat or surface temperature changes in the North Atlantic and the dramatic rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the 1950s.  Or since the 1850s.   Or since Medieval times.  Or since the Holocene began.

The Ultimate Cause Of Oceanic Temperature Shifts, Climate Change: Solar Variability
In their Nature paper entitled “Solar forcing of North Atlantic surface temperature and salinity over the past millennium”, Moffa-Sánchez et al. (2014) point out that North Atlantic sea surface temperatures have risen and fallen by as much as 3.5°C within only multi-decadal- to century-long time periods several times during the last millennium.  This magnitude and rapidity of oceanic change — which occurred without any significant changes in atmospheric CO2 — is obviously far more pronounced than the tenths-of-a-degree net change (if that) over the last 100 years in the North Atlantic.  It is also wholly inconsistent with the climate modeled presumption that natural variability in ocean temperatures is so small, and the anthropogenic forcing of recent decades is so dominant, that natural variability can be clearly separated from anthropogenic forcing.
Our results reveal abrupt multidecadal to centennial shifts in the temperature and salinity of the NAC [North Atlantic Current] waters of ∼3.5 °C and ∼1.2 °C, respectively, during the past millennium.   
Indeed, the massive increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions since 1950 have occurred during the same period of time that the North Atlantic has undergone essentially zero net temperature changes (as the papers and graphs above illustrate), strongly suggesting that anthropogenic CO2 climate forcing has exerted little to no influence on North Atlantic water temperatures.  This would also effectively rule out a significant anthropogenic influence on hemispheric- and even global-scale climate changes considering the North Atlantic’s seminal role as a climatic pace-setter.
Not only that, but as Smeed et al. (2014) affirm, the abrupt change (reduction) in the AMOC heat transport since the mid-2000s is far more pronounced in magnitude (ten times greater) and rapid than climate models have projected to accrue due to anthropogenic forcing, which also strongly suggests the AMOC (and oceanic heat transport in general) is not modulated by CO2 emissions.
Smeed et al, 2014       Model simulations predict a decrease of the AMOC in the 21st century in response to increasing greenhouse gases of the order of one half a Sverdrup per decade (IPCC, 2007). Our observations indicate that the actual change over the last decade is much greater. The magnitude of the observed changes suggests that they are a part of a cyclical change rather than being directly linked to the projected anthropogenic AMOC decrease.  … We have shown that there was a slowdown in the AMOC transport between 2004 and 2012 amounting to an average of −0.54 Sv yr−1 (95 % c.i. −0.08 to −0.99 Sv yr−1 ) at 26◦ N, and that this was primarily due to a strengthening of the southward flow in the upper 1100 m and a reduction of the southward transport of NADW below 3000 m. This trend is an order of magnitude larger than that predicted by climate models associated with global climate change scenarios, suggesting that this decrease represents decadal variability in the AMOC system rather than a response to climate change.
So if anthropogenic CO2 emissions are not the North Atlantic’s climate control knob, what mechanism does modulate the AMOC, which, in turn, leads to abrupt multi-decadal- to centennial-scale warming and cooling periods?   Returning to Moffa-Sánchez et al. (2014), we find that there has been a robust correlation between the undulations in the AMOC and the variability in solar irradiance for the last 1,000 years.
Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2014       There were several centennial-scale fluctuations in the climate and oceanography of the North Atlantic region over the past 1,000 years, including a period of relative cooling from about AD 1450 to 1850 known as the Little Ice Age. These variations may be linked to changes in solar irradiance, amplified through feedbacks including the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. … The reconstructed centennial-scale variations in hydrography correlate with variability in total solar irradiance. We find a similar correlation in a simulation of climate over the past 1,000 years. [L]ow solar irradiance promotes the development of frequent and persistent atmospheric blocking events, in which a quasi-stationary high-pressure system in the eastern North Atlantic modifies the flow of the westerly winds. … Our results reveal abrupt multidecadal to centennial shifts in the temperature and salinity of the NAC [North Atlantic Current] waters of ∼3.5 °C and ∼1.2 °C, respectively, during the past millennium. The magnitude of the hydrographic variability is substantial and comparable to that recorded in a lower resolution record spanning the present interglacial from a nearby site, which highlights the similarities in the ocean variability on a diverse range of timescales. The timing of the hydrographic shifts shows a strong correlation with total solar irradiance (TSI) variability. Periods of solar minima (maxima) generally correspond to cold and fresh (warm and salty) conditions in the NAC.
Recently published scientific papers have documented that the Modern Grand Maximum of very high solar activity ended in the early 21st century, and this has, in turn, led to many predictions of global-scale cooling in the coming decades (Abdussamatov, 2016, Torres and Guzmán, 2016, Yndestad and Solheim, 2016, Mörner, 2015, Evans, 2016).   The recently observed trends in the North Atlantic ostensibly support these projections of near-term solar- and AMOC-forced multi-decadal cooling, as they are in phase with the dramatic decline in North Atlantic heat content and surface temperatures since the mid-2000s documented above.   If historical trends repeat, and if the North Atlantic continues to act as a harbinger of what is to come climatically, we may be on the cusp of cold period reminiscent of yet another Little Ice Age – the 19th in the last 7,500 years.
For the sake of humanity and the rest of the biosphere, let’s hope these near-term global cooling projections are inaccurate, as warmth is much preferred to cooling.

"The frozen extremities of the northern hemisphere are melting at a near-record rate as heatwaves buffet the Arctic, forest fires tear through Siberia and glaciers retreat on Greenland fjords and Alpine peaks. Unusually high temperatures are eating into ice sheets that used to be solid throughout the year, according to glaciologists, who warn this is both an amplifying cause and effect of man-made climate disruption across the globe. Greenland – which is home to the world’s second biggest ice sheet – is likely to have shrunk more in the past month than the average for a whole year between 2002 and now, according to provisional estimates from satellite data. Surface ice declined in July by 197 gigatonnes, equivalent to about 80m Olympic swimming pools, according to Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute. An additional third of that amount is likely to have been lost from glaciers and icebergs. The trend is accelerating. Wednesday was by far the biggest single-day melt-off of the year. “This was one of the highest ever and it is possible today [Thursday] will be even bigger because the heatwave is continuing,” said Mottram. With more than a month of the melt season to go, 2019 is already one of the top 10 years for ice loss in Greenland. The extent is thought unlikely to beat the record in 2012, but Luke Trusel, an assistant professor of geography at Penn State university, said the strength of the melt was greater. Temperatures have been 10C or more above normal this week. Even at the summit of the ice sheet – which is 3,200 metres above sea level – there were 10 hours at or above freezing temperatures yesterday, which is extremely rare, he said. More broadly, ice core analysis has shown that the runoff is at levels expected only once every century, possibly even every millennium. “What was highly unusual in the recent past is becoming the new normal. The Arctic is far more sensitive to warming now than even a few decades ago,” Trusel said. The impact on sea level has not yet been calculated, but the high temperatures are likely to accelerate the calving of the giant Petermann glacier, where at least two huge cracks have been identified in recent years. Giant chunks of ice – each several kilometres in length – are expected to collapse into the ocean in the next few years. The Russian government has belatedly declared a state of emergency in four Siberian regions and reportedly sent troops to help extinguish forest fires that have ripped across an area the size of Belgium. This follows record-high temperatures in several locations. Last weekend, Norway registered its joint hottest day ever. More than 20 areas in the north of the country have recently experienced “tropical nights”, with temperatures above 20C from dusk until dawn. In the Canadian Arctic, which is warming two times faster than the global average, locals have suffered record wildfires, and permafrost is melting decades ahead of predictions. Last month, the far northern community of Alert, Nunavut, registered a record-high of 21C, which a local meteorologist said it had never been seen that close to the pole. European mountains have been affected too. Authorities have warned that the slopes below the Matterhorn’s 4,480-metre peak are increasingly prone to avalanches and landslides because the ice-core is warming. High-altitude lakes of meltwater have also been reported in the Mont Blanc mountain range in France. In Switzerland, the threat to alpine glaciers has been so alarming that more regions are using giant fleece blankets to try to insulate the ice from the hot air. Even so, the country’s glaciers lost about 0.8bn tons of snow and ice during the two recent heatwaves, according to glaciologist Matthias Huss. “Absolutely exceptional for a period of only 14 days in total!” Huss said on Twitter. “And the summer is not yet over.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWind turbines are ugly, litter the landscape, endanger wildlife, generate erratically, destabilize power grids and even cause health problems. They also have a habit of coming apart and self destructing — thus creating a hazard to persons and property.
The Saxony online daily Sächsische Zeitung (SZ) here reports how a wind turbine collapsed near Leisnig just days ago. An investigation revealed how one of three blades failed catastrophically, thus creating a huge imbalance that caused the tower to buckle 15 meters above the ground and led to the structure to come crashing down. The site reports:
Through the force of the impact, the gearbox unit was driven almost 2 meters into the earth.”
The following short video surveys the damage. Note how one blade had totally come apart.

Earlier in December, Germany’s BILD daily reported how in the Mecklenburg Pommeria town of Süderholz a wind turbine tower snapped in half and crashed to the ground. An investigation is now underway. Süderholz mayor Alexander Benkert ordered the other remaining turbines to be thoroughly inspected.
Bild reports the tower simply snapped 25 meters up but that no one was injured.
Collapsing even when not in operation
In neighboring Denmark one wind turbine shows us that turbines can come apart even when they are not operating. Danish vejr.tv2.dk television site here reports how the blade of one turbine simply “tore off” during a recent storm.

Also here the English Manchester Evening News here reports how a recent storm ripped off all three blades from a turbine one afternoon in England, almost killing a man who happened to be taking his dog for a walk.
Mounting opposition to ugly, unreliable wind power projects
The seemingly collapse-prone turbines are likely yet just another reason on a long list why people now resist them. Once welcome and viewed as a source of clean energy, huge protests are now organizing and mobilizing against wind park projects. Germany’s online nordkurier.de here reports how an online survey found only 15% were in favor of installing more turbines in the Uckermark region.
In the Rhine-Main region, the Frankfurter Neue Presse (FNP) reports on how authorities in Darmstadt recently rejected the building of wind turbines on the Taunuskamm mountain, citing “groundwater protection” needs. The local Green Party, of all people, fumed at the rejection.
Sabotage
The resistance to wind energy in Germany has grown to such an extent that some people are now sabotaging them. In Fulda a person, or persons, broke into a tower and destroyed the electrical gear, causing the unit to halt. The wind park operator suspects wind energy opponents.
First the suspect(s) had on two earlier occasions stopped the turbine by simply pressing the emergency STOP button. In the third attempt on December 26 the switchbox was opened and its contents destroyed. The online Fuldaer Zeitung writes at the end of the article:
Indeed the opposition against further wind turbines in the Eiterfeld area was large in the past.”
Wind energy in Germany is no longer welcome.

===================================
According to a just published article by the Online Mail of the UK here, a “high-level whistleblower” has disclosed that America’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) “breached its own rules on scientific integrity” and “duped” world leaders with manipulated global warming data.
The result of the manipulated data was to exaggerate the computed global warming. The aim was to make “the maximum possible impact on world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015,” the Sunday Online Mail writes.
Manipulated data and the breaching of scientific rule have long been an accusation made against the NOAA in the climate science community, especially in the wake of the 2009 leaked Climategate e-mails, which showed scientists colluding to manipulate climate data and to unethically suppress scientific dissent. The ensuing whitewash was equally controversial.
“Irrefutable evidence”
The latest revelation, according to Online Mail, comes from “impeccable” NOAA scientist Dr. John Bates, who has shown “irrefutable evidence” that an NOAA paper showing accelerating global warming was rushed to be published just before the Paris Conference in 2015, and was “based on misleading, ‘unverified’ data“. The paper became to be known as the “Pausebuster” and was central in spurring the 2015 Paris Treaty.
Central African data made up entirely
On another matter, the NOAA has just come under massive fire as climate science skeptic Tony Heller presented at his realclimatescience blog strong evidence that the government agency manipulated December 2016 data in order to make it “red hot” in Central Africa, “with record heat“. However, the problem is that there are no measurement stations whatsoever located in the vast region, and so the NOAA simply made up and filled in the hot data.
Heller notes that full-surface temperature measurement by satellites in fact show that “the NOAA’s record hot regions in Africa were actually close to normal“.

NOAA data actually recorded by thermometer (Source of above charts: realclimatescience.com.
Heller, a prolific critic of climate science, commented that the NOAA “reported” map (first chart) above “is fake” and that the “NOAA has almost no temperature data from Africa, and none from central Africa. They simply made up the record temperatures.”
Flawed datasets
Concerning the just challenged NOAA’s 2015 ‘Pausebuster’ paper, the Online Mail writes that it is based on “two new temperature sets of data“, both of which were “flawed.” The Online Mail adds that the paper used “unreliable methods which overstated the speed of warming” and that “revised data will show both lower temperatures and a slower rate in the recent warming trend“.
What is worse about the paper is that the data used to produce its results weren’t archived and made available, which violated NOAA rules and proper scientific methodology. The Online Mails adds:
Before he retired last year, he continued to raise the issue internally. Then came the final bombshell. Dr Bates said: ‘I learned that the computer used to process the software had suffered a complete failure.’ The reason for the failure is unknown, but it means the Pausebuster paper can never be replicated or verified by other scientists.“

Share this...FacebookTwitterPlenty of superlatives have been used to describe President Donald Trump’s speech to the nation on Februrary 28.
Fox News called it “one for the ages” as the newly elected President spoke on a wide range of pressing issues and daunting problems the nation faces, like immigration, drugs, crime, runaway debt, urban decay, economic stagnation, over-regulation, education, terrorism…to name a few.

Not among the pressing issues was “climate change”. Not once did the President bring up the issue, which some on the opposition side have long been calling “the greatest threat to civilization“.
What can we gather from this as the President undertakes to work hard to mobilize and find the scrace resources needed to fix the out of control messes Washington has created over the past couple of decades? Expect the President to (finally) take the chainsaw to government programs promoting the climate hoax.
First place to start is to cut off the money pipeline to the non-problems and to divert it over to the matters that are really pressing, i.e. real problems mentioned above. The President thinks very little of climate change being a problem, and so did not mention it once. Rather, he mentioned coal and growth.
The climate scare and hoax are about to lose their last legs.

Germany’s renewable energy feed-in tariff is expected to skyrocket another 0.75 euro cents/kilowatt-hour – to 7.1 euro cents. The following chart shows the annual growth of the feed-in tariff in cents per kilowatt-hour since 2000:



Source: Science Skeptical
After rising sharply since 2009, Germany’s so-called EEG feed-in tariff dropped slightly in 2015. This led to renewable energy proponents proclaiming that the sharp rises were over and that consumers could relax and expect a gradual drop. Of course few believed it.
Today Germany joins Denmark in having the highest electricity rates in the world. The EEG feed-in tariffs, which pay for the energy produced by renewable sources such as wind, solar and biogas, are set to rise in 2017 from 6.35 cents per kilowatt-hour to a staggering 7.10 cents, according to Germany’s number daily “Bild”.
In fact reports even say that the tariff could even jump to 7.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, which would be a whopping 15% jump in a single year. The reason of course is the expansion of the volatile renewable energies, which power companies are forced to buy before purchasing from fossil fuel plants.
For a family of three, the rise will mean an additional expense of 35 euros annually. Currently each citizen pays on average 250 euros annually for the feed-in tariff alone, costing Germans a total of 20 billion annually.
For all the money, Germans are only getting pain for it. Not only are thousands of Germans seeing their power get cut-off because they are no longer able to afford it, the power supply and grid have grown more unstable than ever before. South Australia type blackouts now threaten the country. In short: A junk product for a luxury price.

No CO2 reduction in Germany since 2009!
The reason for the massive investments in “green” renewable energies was of course to reduce CO2 emissions. However Krueger also writes that Germany’s CO2 emissions have not dropped at all since 2009. The following chart shows CO2 emissions in millions of tonnes (note in German 1.400 means 1,400 tonnes in English):


Moreover from 2009 to 2016 2009 und 2016, Germany’s installed capacity of renewable energies grew from 48 GW to 102 GW.

However, there’s been no reduction in CO2 emissions.
In summary, Germany’s Energiewende has failed to reduce CO2, and has only succeeded in driving costs to record highs, costing thousands of jobs, making the power grid more unstable than ever, leaving increasing numbers without power and theoretically lowering the global temperature a couple of a hundredths of a degree.
This is nothing less than social violence against the common citizens.

"Attempts to solve the climate crisis by cutting carbon emissions from only cars, factories and power plants are doomed to failure, scientists will warn this week. A leaked draft of a report on climate change and land use, which is now being debated in Geneva by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), states that it will be impossible to keep global temperatures at safe levels unless there is also a transformation in the way the world produces food and manages land.  Humans now exploit 72% of the planet’s ice-free surface to feed, clothe and support Earth’s growing population, the report warns. At the same time, agriculture, forestry and other land use produces almost a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, about half of all emissions of methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases, come from cattle and rice fields, while deforestation and the removal of peat lands cause further significant levels of carbon emissions. The impact of intensive agriculture – which has helped the world’s population soar from 1.9 billion a century ago to 7.7 billion – has also increased soil erosion and reduced amounts of organic material in the ground. In future these problems are likely to get worse. “Climate change exacerbates land degradation through increases in rainfall intensity, flooding, drought frequency and severity, heat stress, wind, sea-level rise and wave action,” the report states. It is a bleak analysis of the dangers ahead and comes when rising greenhouse gas emissions have made news after triggering a range of severe meteorological events. These include news that: • Arctic sea-ice coverage reached near record lows for July; • The heatwaves that hit Europe last month were between 1.5C and 3C higher because of climate change; • Global temperatures for July were 1.2C above pre-industrial levels for the month. This last figure is particularly alarming, as the IPCC has warned that rises greater than 1.5C risk triggering climatic destabilisation while those higher than 2C make such events even more likely. “We are now getting very close to some dangerous tipping points in the behaviour of the climate – but as this latest leaked report of the IPCC’s work reveals, it is going to be very difficult to achieve the cuts we need to make to prevent that happening,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. The new IPCC report emphasises that land will have to be managed more sustainably so that it releases much less carbon than at present. Peat lands will need to be restored by halting drainage schemes; meat consumption will have to be cut to reduce methane production; while food waste will have to be reduced. Among the measures put forward by the report is the proposal of a major shift towards vegetarian and vegan diets. “The consumption of healthy and sustainable diets, such as those based on coarse grains, pulses and vegetables, and nuts and seeds … presents major opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” the report states. There also needs to be a big change in how land is used, it adds. Policies need to include “improved access to markets, empowering women farmers, expanding access to agricultural services and strengthening land tenure security”, it states. “Early warning systems for weather, crop yields, and seasonal climate events are also critical.” The chances of politicians and scientists achieving these goals are uncertain, however. Nations are scheduled to meet in late 2020, probably in the UK, at a key conference where delegates will plant how to achieve effective zero-carbon emission policies over the next few decades. The US, the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, will have just had its presidential elections. A new Democrat incumbent would likely be sympathetic to moves to control global heating. Re-election of Donald Trump, who has called climate change “a hoax”, would put a very different, far gloomier perspective on hopes of achieving a consensus."
"John Vidal hit the nail on the head by linking Meghan and Harry’s choice to limit their family size for the sake of the climate to the lack of access many women globally have to services that would enable them to make the same choice (Having kids is bad for the planet. So are the royal jets, 1 August). Vidal highlighted that “many in areas of high growth want fewer children but cannot access contraception”, and as CEO of a global organisation providing women and girls with access to family planning, I agree. More than 214 million women and girls worldwide are unable to access contraception. Yet we know that when they have access to contraception and safe abortion, they often choose, like Meghan, to have smaller families. Women are increasingly and disproportionately bearing the burden of the climate crisis. It often falls on women to care for growing families in worsening conditions. Droughts mean limited access to food and water. Rising sea levels lead to floods. Humans and animals are competing for dwindling resources, especially in countries that contribute least to global carbon emissions.  By 2050, populations in low and middle income countries are expected to more than double to 1.7 billion – and offering women real choice in contraception to empower them to determine their futures in the face of the climate crisis is something that can no longer be overlooked. Women want it, the world needs it, and governments must take action to increase access to family planning now.Simon CookeCEO, Marie Stopes International • You write that “Poorer countries, which broadly speaking are the least to blame for the climate crisis – emitting less carbon dioxide per capita – will suffer most” (Editorial, 1 August). As overseas development charities like Cafod witness every day, there is no “will” about it. Poor people in poorer countries have been suffering the effects of climate change for many years. A 2013 DfID-funded paper found: “This analysis provides evidence that a drought in East Africa such as seen in 2011 has become more probable as a result of anthropogenic climate change.” The drought affected 10 million people in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda. Many of whom would have migrated, some possibly to Europe.David MurrayWallington, Surrey • There is a silver lining to the dark cloud of the insulting and offensive comments made by Andrew Bolt about Greta Thunberg (Thunberg hits back at columnist who mocked her autism, 3 August). The fact that Bolt has resorted to such a personal attack on her means he has no credible arguments against the substance and science of what she is telling the world about the seriousness of climate change. Small comfort for Ms Thunberg perhaps, but telling. Harvey Sanders London • Mark Carney is right to stress the need for urgent action to tackle climate change. However, his assertion that the invisible hand of the market will provide a fix (Report, 31 July) ignores the central role of capitalism in the climate crisis itself: oil spills, land grabs, slash and burn, intensive farming, resource exhaustion, and unhampered economic growth in a physically finite planet. To borrow a phrase from Audre Lorde, “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house”. We need to square the challenge of climate change with system change.Oliver TaherzadehCambridge • May I suggest that, as a climate emergency now officially exists in the UK, you reposition the regular item on your Weather page entitled “Carbon count”? Currently the information included under this heading – ie the daily atmospheric CO2 readings from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, compared against both a pre-industrial base and what is judged a “safe level” – are tucked away under the heading of “Weather”. Not only is this rather misleading as the information relates to climate, not weather, but in the current emergency I would argue that this is by far and away the most important item of daily news that you report in your paper.

Hambrecht, considered one of Germany’s most influential executives, gave an interview to N24/Die Welt together with FDP politician Volker Wissing.
German government putting out fake information
The German daily wrote in the photo caption that Hambrecht “is furious about government political information being totally disconnected from reality“.
He describes the German political environment as one that has been hijacked by emotional thinking and fear, with facts being left on the wayside.
The 70-year old executive, who recently joined the FDP Free Democrat Party, told N24/Die Welt that German competitiveness “is acutely at risk” — and what is especially irritating is the massive taxpayer-paid disinformation recently put out by the the Ministry of Economics in a brochure claiming page after page that the country’s Energiewende [transition to renewable energies] was a “success story”.

Energiewende in reality a “huge botch”
Yesterday this blog wrote here how in just one year more than 330,000 German households had their power supply cut-off because electricity had become too expensive, and how German energy-intensive companies — like chemicals — were hurting.
On the brochure put out by Ministry of Economics, Hambrecht commented to N24/Die Welt:
‘Our success story’ is its title. Then there many pages of praise over falling electricity prices and stable supply.”
Hambrecht says the brochure in fact “has little to do with reality” and that the truth is:
The Energiewende is a huge botch. The costs continue to rise and the supply stability will be at extreme risk if we phase out coal and gas after ending nuclear. That annoys me a immensely as the citizens are being deceived and given the runaround.”

"It was a quiet Monday afternoon in the picturesque town hall of Lingolsheim, outside Strasbourg. The school summer holidays had started and it was exceptionally hot. But at 4pm something extraordinary happened. Eleven people calmly walked in, politely greeted the receptionists, then headed to the room usually reserved for council meetings. They carefully unhooked the picture of the French president, Emmanuel Macron – the type of portrait that hangs in all local administration buildings – gently placing it in a special protective pouch, and then walked out.  The climate protesters took the portrait home and waited, wondering when the local gendarmes would knock on their doors. It was the latest act in an unusual and fast growing civil disobedience movement in France in which framed portraits of Macron have been taken down by protesters from more than 100 town halls, stretching from small Beaujolais villages to Normandy towns, from Biarritz to Paris, leading to a police crackdown and court appearances. “The blank space left on the wall symbolises the void in government policy on the climate emergency,” the protesters said in a statement after the latest portrait seizure in Lingolsheim. Climate activists from the association ANV Action non-violente COP21 say the “Take Down Macron” campaign is a “desperate and urgent” move to force France to do more about the climate emergency. Macron presents himself as a world leader in the fight against global heating, and the guarantor of the UN’s 2015 Paris climate accord. He has challenged Donald Trump on the issue, vowing France would “make our planet great again”. However, the nation’s independent advisory council on the climate recently warned of a “gap between ambition and reality” . Its report said France was failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions fast enough, particularly via road transport and buildings, and without major policy change was unlikely to meet its goals. France has a long history of civil disobedience on environmental and social issues, that has included a campaign by the farmer and activist José Bové to rip up GM crops, and a movement stressing that money lost in tax evasion could fund the fight against global heating. The removal of Macron’s portraits, however, has a special symbolism that has captured the public’s interest. French presidential portraits, which stare down on citizens from the walls of schools, town halls and government buildings, are a powerful sign of the republic. The basic portrait in a frame may be worth only a few euros, but as the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned: “You don’t attack symbols of the republic.”  The portrait activists, who have described themselves as normal, “resolutely non-violent” citizens, include public-sector workers, retired teachers, rail workers, students and small business employees. Last week, more than 1,000 people met at a climate camp in north-east France to prepare protest actions. Before taking each portrait of the president the activists carry out reconnaissance trips to the town halls. They do not cover their faces or hide their identities and often wear high-visibility jackets carrying their logo. But in a country preparing for the G7 summit at the end of August and still reeling from the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement, there has been a firm police response. Officers advised by the country’s anti-terrorism force have questioned 89 people and carried out 72 searches of properties. Several activists have gone on trial for “group theft by deceit” since the movement began five months ago. More trials will take place in the autumn in cities including Paris, Lyon, Orléans and Grenoble. The group argues that each time they appear in court, public support grows. “I asked myself what can I do to channel this anger I feel about the lack of real government action on the climate emergency?” said Anne-Sophie Trujillo Gauchez, 46, an activist who works as a consultant and who previously ran international humanitarian missions for big charities. She lives in a Beaujolais village where she recycles goods and uses an electric bike. “But individual gestures like that are not enough without proper structural change in society.” One Saturday morning in March, Trujillo Gauchez and 13 others entered the town hall of Jassans-Riottier and removed Macron’s portrait from a wall adorned with every French leader since Charles de Gaulle. A few days later police appeared at her house with a summons. Trujillo Gauchez was among six activists who stood trial for “group theft by deceit” in the first portrait removal proceedings in May, in the eastern French town of Bourg-en-Bresse, as more than 300 activists stood outside chanting “we’re all portrait removers!” The head judge asked one activist during the trial if he agreed that taking the portrait could be seen as an attack on the authority of the state. He replied: “I would hope the authority of the state isn’t just a portrait hanging in a town hall room used for marriages.” Each activist was convicted and received suspended fines of hundreds of euros, much less than the prison sentences and fines in the thousands of euros available to the court. But the state prosecutor has appealed, so a retrial will be scheduled to take place early next year. Christelle Mercier, a lawyer in the case, said the state’s appeal over the sentences was disproportionate for a protest that was “purely symbolic”. There are more trials to come. Thomas Fourrey, a lawyer preparing a defence in Lyon, said he would argue that the activists took down the portraits out of “necessity” over the climate emergency. Marion Esnault, 30, the national spokesperson for the Take Down Macron campaign, will go on trial in September over two portraits taken from Paris town halls, along with the person who filmed the removal for YouTube. Other observers have been caught up. A journalists’ union complained when local reporters covering a portrait removal in Normandy received police summons, first for taking part in group theft, then as witnesses. Esnault said it was symbolic that the court hosting the trial was also used for terrorist cases. “If France wants to position itself as a world leader on the climate emergency then it must at least respect its objectives,” she said, adding the movement began just as Greenpeace and other organisations moved to take the French state to court to force it to respect environmental commitments. “I think non-violent civil disobedience in France is going to increase as a form of action on this.” Michael Kluger, 30, a biomechanics researcher, is among three activists recently cleared of group theft in Strasbourg after he took down Macron’s portrait in Kolbsheim town hall, near a controversial motorway ringroad project. He said: “This is about opening people’s eyes to the need for change. There has to be an urgent leap in society to overhaul our infrastructure in order to save the environment.”"

=========================================
Game over: Dutch scientists refute Rahmstorf’s Gulf Stream alarm story


By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In March 2015 Stefan Rahmstorf (“stefan”) spread a hyped up alarm story at the IPCC-friendly climate blog Real Climate.
A cold anomaly in the Atlantic, off the east coast of Greenland, was alleged to be the proof that the Gulf Stream was gradually weakening – a consequence of man-made climate warming!
“stefan” wrote at Realclimate:
What’s going on in the North Atlantic?
The North Atlantic between Newfoundland and Ireland is practically the only region of the world that has defied global warming and even cooled. Last winter there even was the coldest on record – while globally it was the hottest on record. Our recent study (Rahmstorf et al. 2015) attributes this to a weakening of the Gulf Stream System, which is apparently unique in the last thousand years. […] It happens to be just that area for which climate models predict a cooling when the Gulf Stream System weakens (experts speak of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation or AMOC, as part of the global thermohaline circulation). That this might happen as a result of global warming is discussed in the scientific community since the 1980s – since Wally Broecker’s classical Nature article “Unpleasant surprises in the greenhouse?” Meanwhile evidence is mounting that the long-feared circulation decline is already well underway.
Rahmstorf showed the following chart (“Linear temperature trend from 1900 to 2013″):

In his post the Postdam PIK scientist painted a climate horror scenario, suggesting that it was something far worse than anything ever previously anticipated.
Subsequently international colleagues took it upon themselves to validate the Rahmstorfian horror scenario. One year later we now have the results of the examination.
On June 29, 2016, Femke de Jong and Laura de Steur of the Dutch NIOZ Institute at the OSNAP project site announced the results in a press release: Rahmstorf and his model were totally off. The especially observed North Atlantic cold anomaly in the winter 2014/15 had nothing to do with a weakening Gulf Stream, rather it was much more the consequence of a powerful vertical mixing with cold low level water.
The press release states:
A new record in mixing of surface and deep ocean water in the Irminger Sea has important consequences for the Atlantic overturning circulation

Scientists Femke de Jong and Laura de Steur of the NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research have shown that the recent temperature changes in the Irminger Sea between Iceland and Greenland can be explained through regional ocean-atmosphere interaction during the cold winter of 2014-2015. This rejects a hypothesis that posed that increased meltwater from Greenland weakened deep water formation and caused the cold blob. The article by de Jong and de Steur is accepted by Geophysical Research letters and has appeared online.
Deep water formation is an important process in the global ocean circulation. When high latitude winters are cold enough, the salty surface water of the North Atlantic cools enough to increase its density and mix with underlying deeper waters. This mixing is called deep convection. It forms the vertical link between the warm northward flow near the surface and the cold southward flow along the bottom, which is generally referred to as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The transport of warm water in the overturning circulation is partly responsible for the mild climate in northwestern Europe compared to similar latitudes in North America.
In climate model simulations the strength of convection south of Greenland is related to the strength of the overturning circulation. Some models predict that convection will weaken due to the input of freshwater released from the melting ice on Greenland. Because of the much lower density of freshwater compared to seawater it forms a barrier that isolates the deep ocean from the cold atmosphere. While the majority of the Earth warms as a result of climate change the region around southern Greenland would cool.
In temperature observations of the earth’s surface in 2015 a similar pattern seems to appear. The Earth warmed while the ocean southeast of Greenland cooled. This led to speculation that convection had already weakened as a result of increased melting of Greenland’s icecap. It would mean that the overturning circulation would be affected faster than expected.
Instruments moored in the Irminger Sea, southeast of Greenland, shows that this is not (yet) the case. This mooring, deployed by the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) at 3 km depth in 2003, shows that convection strengthened in recent years. Record depths of convection were observed in the Irminger Sea in the winter of 2014-2015. This strong mixing was caused by an extremely cold and long winter. Two NIOZ scientists, Femke de Jong and Laura de Steur, have shown that the temperature evolution in the Irminger Sea (including the strong decrease in 2015) can be explained through regional interaction between the ocean and atmosphere. The manuscript that describes the convection and explains the temperature changes is accepted in Geophysical Research Letters. This coincides with a publication by a German group in Nature Geoscience this week, in which they use a model to show that it will take some time before freshwater from Greenland enters the deep water formation regions in large enough amount to weaken convection.
The measurements in the Irminger Sea were partly funded by the European North Atlantic CLIMate (NACLIM) project and are part of the international OSNAP (Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program). The goal of OSNAP is to quantify the overturning circulation and its heat transport at high latitudes and to establish a relation to convection and wind forcing. On the 26th of July a research expedition will return to the Irminger Sea to recover the NIOZ and other OSNAP moorings and do a hydrographic survey. This cruise can be followed on the OSNAP blog at www.o-snap.org. A short video documentary of last year’s cruise can be found on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-lhCIQjE4c).
In the paper’s abstract in the Geophysical Research Letters, Femke de Jong and Laura de Steur leave little doubt that the Gulf Stream continues to flow reliably:
Strong winter cooling over the Irminger Sea in winter 2014–2015, exceptional deep convection, and the emergence of anomalously low SST
Deep convection is presumed to be vital for the North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, even though observational evidence for the link remains inconclusive. Modeling studies have suggested that convection will weaken as a result of enhanced freshwater input. The emergence of anomalously low sea surface temperature in the subpolar North Atlantic has led to speculation that this process is already at work. Here we show that strong atmospheric forcing in the winter of 2014–2015, associated with a high North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, produced record mixed layer depths in the Irminger Sea. Local mixing removed the stratification of the upper 1400 m and ventilated the basin to middepths resembling a state similar to the mid-1990s when a positive NAO also prevailed. We show that the strong local atmospheric forcing is predominantly responsible for the negative sea surface temperature anomalies observed in the subpolar North Atlantic in 2015 and that there is no evidence of permanently weakened deep convection.”
This is yet another failure for Stefan Rahmstorf and his Potsdam climate alarmism factory.
It is refreshing to see that the international research community is increasingly resisting these dubious PIK creations. It is also time for the German press to report on these results for the sake of balance. The Washington Post showed how to do it on 30 June 2016:

The mysterious ‘cold blob’ in the North Atlantic Ocean is starting to give up its secrets
[…] Stefan Rahmstorf, an ocean physicist with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and author of the study mentioned above, has writtenthat very cold temperatures in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean in the winter of 2014-2015 “suggests the decline of the circulation has progressed even further now than we documented in the paper.” But in a new study in Geophysical Research Letters reporting on deep ocean measurements from this region, two researchers present an alternative interpretation. They say that they found “exceptional” levels of deep ocean convection, or mixing of surface waters with deep waters of a sort that helps drive the overturning circulation, during in the winter of 2014-2015 — the height of the cold “blob.” And they attribute that temperature phenomenon to natural climate variability, driven by local weather and winds. “We find that the observed temperature variability is explained without invoking a trend in the lateral heat transport that would be representative of an AMOC slowdown,” Femke de Jong and Laura de Steur of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research write in the paper. […]”

And this warming will be unlike anything polar bears have survived before.”  —  Polar Bears International

Image: NoTricksZone
During the Pliocene, or from about 3 to 5 million years ago, subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere (Norway, Iceland, Canada) were up to 10°C warmer than they are now,  and the Arctic region itself was as much as 19°C warmer than now, with sea-ice-free summers and no permafrost.  All this warmth occurred while CO2 concentrations were well below today’s levels.  Polar bears somehow managed to survive in these balmy Arctic and subarctic climates.
Robinson, 2010
“Pollen from three subarctic sites in the Norwegian Sea, northern Iceland and Labrador Sea indicate that mid-Pliocene January temperatures in Norway, Iceland and southeastern Canada were 4 to 10°C warmer than today (Willard 1994). … Evidence of both mixed deciduous/coniferous and coniferous forests places mean July temperatures 10°C warmer than today [in Arctic Canada] (Vincent 1990). In addition, northwestern Alaska air and sea temperatures during peak Pliocene interglacials were considerably warmer than present, by 7 to 8°C, with no permafrost, and absent or severely limited sea ice (Carter et al. 1986; Kaufman and Brigham-Grette 1993).”
From the press release, Robinson states that Arctic summer sea surface temperatures were about 10-18°C (50 – 64°F) on average 4 million years ago, compared to 0°C (and lower) during summers today.
“The U.S. Geological Survey found that summer sea-surface temperatures in the Arctic were between 10 to 18°C (50 to 64°F) during the mid-Pliocene, while current temperatures are around or below 0°C (32°F).”
Ballantyne et al., 2010
“The consensus among these proxies suggests that Arctic temperatures were ∼19 °C warmer during the Pliocene than at present, while atmospheric CO2 concentrations were ∼390 ppmv.”
Cronin and Cronin, 2015
“Pliocene Arctic Ocean summer SSTs were appreciably warmer than modern and seasonally sea-ice free conditions existed in some regions. … At Lake El’gygytgyn (Lake ‘‘E’’) in Siberia summer temperatures were 8°C warmer than modern and at Ellesmere Island, Canada, summer and MAT [mean annual temperatures] were 11.8°C and 18.3°C higher than today.”
“[A] seasonally ice-free marginal and central Arctic Ocean was common … regionally during the early Holocene [6,000 to 10,000 years ago]. … Some species thought to be dependent on summer sea ice (e.g., polar bears) survived through these periods.” 
Arctic Also Much Warmer A Few Thousand Years Ago, With Sea-Ice-Free Summers
Although far less pronounced, the Arctic climate was also much warmer than now (by 2° to 3°C) throughout significant portions of the last 10,000 years, warm enough to elicit sea-ice-free summers (or far less sea ice than exists presently).  Somehow, polar bears survived during these warmer climates.
Spolaor et al., 2016
“We report bromine enrichment in the Northwest Greenland Eemian NEEM ice core since the end of the Eemian interglacial 120,000 years ago, finding the maximum extension of first-year sea ice occurred approximately 9,000 years ago during the Holocene climate optimum, when Greenland temperatures were 2 to 3 °C above present values.”
(press release): “Researchers have found that 8000 years ago the Arctic climate was 2 to 3 degrees warmer than now, and that there was also less summertime Arctic sea ice than today.”
Jakobsson et al., 2010
“The combined sea ice data suggest that the seasonal Arctic sea ice cover was strongly reduced during most of the early Holocene and there appear to have been periods of ice free summers in the central Arctic Ocean.”
Williamson, 1975

“Between 1000 and 1300 average summer temperatures were about 1°C higher than today, with the mean annual temperature higher by perhaps 4°C in a largely ice-free Arctic.”
Jakobsson et al., 2014
“Several studies suggest that the Early Holocene (∼6000–10,000 years BP [before present]) experienced less summer-sea ice than at present. …. [S]ea ice during the Early Holocene potentially could have moved over to a seasonal regime with sea ice-free summers due to the insolation [solar radiation] maxima the Earth experienced at that time.”
Funder et al., 2011
“Arctic Sea Ice extent during the Holocene Thermal Maximum 8,000 years ago was less than half of the record low 2007 level. … Multiyear sea ice reached a minimum between ~8500 and 6000 years ago, when the limit of year-round sea ice at the coast of Greenland was located ~1000 kilometers to the north of its present position.”
Arctic Sea Ice Cover Also Lower Than Now During 18th, 19th, Early 20th Centuries
According to scientists, not only was Arctic sea ice extent much lower than it has been in recent decades a few thousand years ago, it was lower during the 1700s, 1800s, and early 1900s too, when CO2 levels were still quite “safe” at about 300 ppm and less.  In fact, during the 1880s to 1940s period, when Arctic temperatures were warmer than they have been recently, the Arctic’s sea ice cover began forming more than one month later than it has in recent decades (or melted more than one month earlier than it has been) (Durantou et al., 2012).   And somehow polar bears survived these Arctic conditions.
Durantou et al., 2012
“Sea surface temperature [Arctic Ocean, Canada] between ∼ AD 1885–1935 are warmer by up to 3°C with respect to the average modern temperature at the coring site. For the period ∼ AD 1887–1945, reconstructed sea ice cover values are on average 8.3 months per year which is 1.1 months per year lower than the modern values.”

“[T]he series of climatic oscillations affecting the northern hemisphere are linked through a teleconnection sequence between the oceans and the atmosphere called “stadium wave” (Wyatt et al., 2011). This teleconnection plays a crucial role in climatic changes, notably in exchanges of heat fluxes within the Arctic through the Bering Strait (Woodgate et al., 2005). According to our results, the PDO pattern is closely linked with most of the sea-surface condition variability in the study area through upwelling events of Pacific origin.”
According to Zhang and co-authors (2015), sea ice extent in recent decades has followed the patterns of the AMOC and hovered around the average of the last 3500+ years, with many periods (for example, during the mid-1700s) having much lower sea ice extent anomalies than during the last few decades of human influence — or when polar bears have been classified as endangered.
Zhang, 2015
“Observations reveal multidecadal variations in Arctic surface air temperature (SAT), and amplified Arctic warming similar to that observed in recent decades also occurred during 1930–1940. Both observations and climate modeling results suggest that the reduced Arctic sea ice is crucial for the early twentieth century Arctic warming, and internal variability is a very likely cause for that event.”

“The estimated increase in the Atlantic heat transport into the Arctic since 1979 is consistent with the strengthening of AMOC since the mid 1970s implied by indirect evidence such as the AMOC fingerprints, and could have contributed substantially to the observed summer Arctic SIE decline.”
Polar Bears Survived The Arctic’s Warmer Past, And They’re Thriving Now
Somehow, polar bears survived an Arctic climate that was as much as 19°C warmer than now a few million years ago, with balmy (66°F), sea-ice-free summers.
Currently, polar bears are not only surviving, their numbers are growing, leading scientists to conclude that they cannot find support for the perspective that polar bears “are currently in any sort of climate crisis.”
York et al., 2016   
“Subpopulation growth rates and the probability of decline at current harvest levels were determined for 13 subpopulations of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) that are within or shared with Canada based on mark–recapture estimates of population numbers and vital rates, and harvest statistics using population viability analyses (PVA). … Considering both TEK [traditional ecological knowledge] and scientific information, we suggest that the current status of Canadian polar bear subpopulations in 2013 was 12 stable/increasing and one declining (Kane Basin). We do not find support for the perspective that polar bears within or shared with Canada are currently in any sort of climate crisis.”
Because of the tendentious preference to ignore observational and paleoclimate evidence that would not appear to portend their demise, polar bears will continue to be classified as an “endangered” species.  That’s what the concocted narrative of human-caused climate alarm dictates.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat’s wrong here? August in Germany is not getting warmer
By Josef Kowatsch and Sebastian Lüning
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
According to the German DWD national weather service August 2016 recorded a mean temperature of 17.7°C. The start of the month was really cool, but the last part of the month the temperature climbed to peak summer levels, and thus compensated for the otherwise sub-par summer. No record temperature was set, with the month’s high some degrees below the record of over 40°C set for a few minutes in 2015.
Using the station network operated by the DWD, which covers all of Germany, and looking over the long term (Figure 1), we can discern four segments since 1931:
1) It was warm during the Nazi times.
2) After the war, mean temperatures dropped, and cool Augusts persisted until 1975.
3) Beginning in 1975 a rapid rise took place until a new temperature high was reached.
4) Since the peak in 2003, the temperatures for the month of August have dropped again. In total the current temperature level is higher than in 1931.

Figure 1: Temperature in Germany for August since 1931. Chart: Kowatsch. Data source: DWD.
To make the trend look more dramatic than it really is, some reporters are using a trick: They like to start the trend at the bottom of a cold period. Many start their chart at 1961 (Figure 2). Clearly this is near the bottom of the 1960s cold period and thus it makes August mean temperatures look as if they are rising rapidly.
August has gotten much warmer over the past 55 years. According to the linear trend line, the mean temperature was near 16°C in 1961, while today we are close to 18°C.

However, Germany’s mean August temperature has stagnated over the past 29 years at a level of 1988. A temperature plateau has been established (Figure 3).

Figure 3: Temperature in Germany for August since 1988. Chart: Kowatsch. Data from DWD.
What’s interesting is a look at the last 20 years (Figure 4). The summer month of August has shown a distinct cooling trend over the past 2 decades.

Thus it’s worth keeping these facts in mind whenever the German media blare out headlines of extreme summer heat. Here it pays to maintain a cool head in order to distinguish between emotions and reality.

"The record-breaking heatwave that roasted Europe last month was a one-in-a-thousand-year event made up to 100 times more likely by human-driven climate change, scientists have calculated. Around the globe, July at least equalled and may have surpassed the hottest month on record, according to data from the World Meteorological Organization. This followed the warmest June on record.  Temperature records were broken in many countries, wildfires continue to devastate vast areas of Siberia, the Greenland ice sheet is melting at a near record rate, and the risk of drought has grown more acute across wide areas of central and eastern Europe. The extreme heat is particularly unusual because it is not an El Niño year – the phenomenon usually associated with prolonged temperature surges. Instead, scientists say it is driven to a large extent by carbon emissions from car exhausts, power plant chimneys, burning forests and other human sources. How much these factors loaded the dice in the two- to three-day heatwave during the last week of July was the subject of an attribution study by a consortium of meteorologists and climatologists at the UK Met Office, Oxford University and other prominent European institutions. It found that the extreme heat in France and the Netherlands, where temperatures peaked above 40C, was made at least 10 times and possibly more than 100 times more likely by climate change. In the UK, which set a record of 38.7C on 25 July, the human impact on the climate made the high temperatures at least two to three times more probable. There was considerable variation from place to place, but in all the studied locations the scientists said it would have been 1.5C to 3C cooler without climate change. Although the recent heat has been described as historic, it is unlikely to remain that way for long, according to the authors of the study. “It will not make history. These records will be broken in few years,” said Friederike Otto, of the University of Oxford. “What we see with European heatwaves is that all the climate models are underestimating the change that we see.” She said further study would investigate how likely it was to have two intense heatwaves in the space of two months. The paper says the extreme heat will have an impact on human wellbeing, though the data on this often lags, which can mean it fails to draw much public attention. “Heatwaves during the height of summer pose a substantial risk to human health and are potentially lethal,” the paper says. “The full impact is known only after a few weeks when the mortality figures have been analysed. Effective heat emergency plans, together with accurate weather forecasts such as those issued before this heatwave, reduce impacts and are becoming even more important in light of the rising risks.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, who has called a special climate summit of world leaders in September, said the seasons were moving alarmingly far from their usual path. “We have always lived through hot summers, but this is not the summer of our youth. This is not your grandfather’s summer,” he said. “Preventing irreversible climate disruption is the race of our lives, and for our lives. It is a race that we can and must win.” The World Meteorological Organization expects 2015-19 to be the warmest five-year period ever recorded. “July has rewritten climate history, with dozens of new temperature records at local, national and global level,” said the organisation’s secretary general, Petteri Taalas. “Unprecedented wildfires raged in the Arctic for the second consecutive month, devastating once pristine forests which used to absorb carbon dioxide and instead turning them into fiery sources of greenhouse gases. This is not science fiction. It is the reality of climate change. It is happening now and it will worsen in the future without urgent climate action.”"
"It may not be widely known, but the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has always been headed by a European, and the World Bank by a US citizen. This is the unwritten convention, or gentlemen’s agreement, that has held since these twin global financial institutions were established in the aftermath of the second world war. Yet those with an interest in how, and for whom, the global economy is run have long been deeply unhappy about this cosy arrangement. And these concerns have once again been brought into sharp focus after Christine Lagarde, the IMF managing director, announced she is stepping down next month.  An all-European shortlist was once again drawn up by the EU. But the European establishment has struggled to agree on who it wants to fill the role ahead of a 6 September deadline for nominations, with the Bulgarian Kristalina Georgieva chosen to be the EU’s nominee after a divisive round of voting on Friday. “The truth is that there is no readily available tried-and-tested European all-rounder,” a European minister told CNBC. Surely, with a final decision on Lagarde’s successor expected on 4 October, now is the moment for such regressive and anti-democratic leadership conventions to be scrapped. In April I chaired a discussion inside the World Bank in New York among 200 civil society leaders, and explicitly questioned the World Bank’s executive directors, arguing that it was “unbelievable that the recruitment and appointment to the [leadership of the] bank came from one single nation”. This governance issue is about so much more than mere cosmetics. As the world becomes ever-more politically polarised and vulnerable to populist leadership, and as the US administration turns away from multilateralism and takes a sceptical approach on the climate crisis, there is all the more reason for these major institutions – which are so keen to boast of their globalist credentials – to take an inclusive, merit-based approach to what ought to be a diversified recruitment process. The coming window for new leadership is an opportunity for the IMF to demonstrate a different model that is democratic and – crucially – inclusive of candidates from the global south. It simply cannot be right that the leadership of the institutions with the greatest power to tackle the climate crisis excludes applicants from those countries where that crisis is wiping out the lives and livelihoods of many millions of people. The IMF aims to create sustainable growth and to reduce poverty in the world. How can it do so when it is run on fundamentally undemocratic principles? It is time for all members of the IMF to stand together and vote against a model that mocks the principles and values that the same countries place above all else. The hypocrisy and double standards are damaging world peace and development progress. It is time to see leaders who have the courage and boldness to evidence the values they champion. The most vulnerable people in our communities are paying a huge price for weak leadership that serves the interest of the few in the name of the rest. And this is not just a question of figureheads. It goes to the heart of inherent deficiencies with these institutions. The growth-focused narratives at the IMF and the World Bank are simply not working for the world’s poorest and most marginalised. Instead they drive ever greater destruction of the natural systems on which we all rely, and ever greater global concentration of wealth and power. What is desperately needed are ways of reorganising the economy around principles of sustainability to keep within our boundaries of a single shared planet, and create democratically owned economic systems that will meet the needs of everyone, without giving way to the greed of the very few. Gentlemen’s agreements have no place in a world of diverse economies, communities, peoples, races and nations. They are not fit for purpose in a global institution of 189 countries, working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world. The IMF, like the World Bank, needs to modernise, or it is in danger of outliving its usefulness to the world. Now must be the time to act. We need global institutions that are fit for where we are going and not for where we have come from. Let us safeguard the future with the right values and actions. • Amanda Khozi Mukwashi is chief executive of Christian Aid"
"The UK’s 10 hottest years on record have all occurred since 2002, the Met Office has said. Its statistics stretching back to 1884 reveal a worrying trend, as the planet as a whole deals with the climate crisis. In a further indication of how the climate is heating up, the records show that none of the UK’s 10 coldest years have occurred since 1963. “The world has warmed 1C since pre-industrial times, meaning that hot years are the new normal,” said Dr Michael Byrne from the University of St Andrews. “Not only is the UK getting warmer, but also wetter, with 13% more summer rain compared to last century. With global emissions of greenhouse gases on the rise, the UK will continue to get warmer and wetter as global warming accelerates. “The science of climate change is now clear. The UK government must ramp up preparations and ensure that our infrastructure and citizens are prepared for what is to come.” The data formed part of the Met Office’s latest annual state of the climate report, published in the International Journal of Climatology. The temperature series for the UK has been extended back by 26 years from 1910, as the data was added as part of ongoing work to digitise historical weather records. Dr Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office’s national climate information centre, said the extra data revealed a “very interesting timeline, with the top 10 warmest years at the most recent end, since 2002”. He said no new warm years were added as a result of the additions, though some years that sit among the 10 coldest are now included. The records now show 1892 was the coldest year, with the average temperature just over 7C, while the warmest year was 2014, with an average temperature approaching 10C, he said. On average, the temperature across the UK between 2009 and 2018 was 0.9C warmer than the average for 1961–1990. Last year joined the top 10 warmest years at number seven, despite the severe “beast from the east” cold snap early in the year. The UK had the most significant snowfall since 2010 in those 12 months, though snow has become less common since the 1960s, the Met Office said. Sunshine also appears to be on the up: average hours of bright weather for 2009-2018 were up 7% on the average for 1961-1990, while the team found the period from May to June 2018 was the sunniest three month stretch since 1929. In a year of extremes, the UK had a heatwave last summer, which the experts said was made 30 times more likely by climate change, and the season was the equal-hottest summer on record along with 2006. The UK data adds to a global picture of a planet that’s heating up, with this July on track to be the hottest month ever recorded on Earth, and 2019 expected to be the second hottest year. The hottest was 2016, which was boosted by an El Niño weather system. Nine of the 10 hottest years ever recorded globally have occurred since 2000. Mike Kendon, a climate information scientist and co-author of the report, said the results reflect the trend in global heating. “What affects the globe also affects the UK,” he said. “Climate change is not some abstract thing in the future that we are predicting is going to happen. The point is that climate change is happening and it is happening now.” Kate Sambrook, a climate researcher at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the report, said the findings should be a wake-up call. “International comparisons of public climate change beliefs indicate that UK residents are unconcerned about climate change and favour the prospect of hotter summers,” said Sambrook, adding that more needs to be done to convey the full implications of the UK’s changing climate. “Understanding what shapes public perceptions of climate change is significantly important, as this could provide scientists, policymakers and campaigners with the tools they need to communicate climate change more effectively and as a result motivate more people to act.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAfter days of uncertainty, Hurricane Matthew finally took a track taking it directly to Florida. It’s the first major category hurricane to hit the sunshine state (and the US, if I’m not mistaken) in almost 11 years.
The last major hurricane to strike was Wilma in 2005. This 4000-day hiatus is a record since hurricane statistics began to be recorded in the 19th century. This all flies in the face of claims made by global warming believers and alarmists, who crystal-balled hurricane activity would become more frequent and ferocious over time. Yet, globally there has been no trend in global cyclone activity.
The reality is that Matthew will be the first major hurricane to hit that millions of children 12 years old and under can remember. And already no child on the planet under 18 years of age has seen any real global warming at all. Climate scientists could not have been more wrong.
Many more hurricanes when CO2 was low!
Veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi at Weatherbell reminds us that hurricane activity was far worse in Florida some 70 years ago, in the 1940s, back when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were down near the 310 ppm level:

6 major hurricanes in 7 years with CO2 at 310 ppm!
Count them! Six major hurricanes in only 7 years. Imagine the hysteria if that were to happen during the present time. Instead we are getting the first one in over 10 years – an unusual period of calm.

Clearly this tells us that there’s a heck of a lot more to it than just a trace gas. Of course ocean and solar cycles are the major climate factors.
Everyone’s prepared – except for Trump!
The table is already being set for the upcoming Presidential debate. And I’m ready to bet my last dollar that Trump is going to fall in the trap and make a terrible impression like he did in the first debate. The trap this time: climate change and Hurricane Matthew.
Hollywood megastar Leonardo DiCaprio has already launched it by declaring that anyone who denies climate change is unfit for public office. Hurricane Matthew is now slamming into Florida, and Hillary Clinton is already blaming it on man. The timing just before the debate couldn’t be better. The debate is already rigged: It is going to feature climate change prominently, and Hillary is being prepared well for it. They are going to make Trump look like an uninformed fool – if he allows it.
Trump can avoid this:
1. He has to acknowledge that climate is always changing.
2. Man, however, is playing only a small role.
3. 97% consensus is phony – the science is hotly disputed.
4. Already 750 published papers since 2014 dismissing catastrophic AGW.
5. Temperature trend is far below what scientists projected in 2000.
6. Fact: NASA’s Gavin Schmidt has been altering the historic data.
7. Hurricanes are less frequent today then they were 50, 60 years ago.
He should then ask Hillary directly: Can you honestly promise less storms and nice weather in exchange for more regulation and taxes? If so, then she’s a weather charlatan.
It should take Trump about 60 seconds to say this. But, expect him to come in unprepared and to babble a bunch a nonsense and look bad.
In this debate I expect to see Trump fumble in his own end-zone. You just watch.

"Three women were killed last week while sunning on a beach in Encinitas, California, when the bluff above them gave way. The sudden tragedy that befell Anne Clave; her mother, Julie Davis; and her aunt Elizabeth Cox, who had gathered at the resplendent coastline in the seaside community north of San Diego to celebrate Cox surviving cancer, made headlines around the world. But cliff erosion continues to imperil people and property around the state. California is falling into the sea piece by piece, and coastal conditions will only grow more dire with worsening climate crisis.  A woman was killed in Santa Cruz county when a cliff collapsed beneath her feet in 2017. A landslide on a San Francisco beach killed another beachgoer in 2019. Nearly three-quarters of California’s coastlines are actively eroding, putting lives, homes, roadways, railways, utilities and other infrastructure in danger. The cliffs have been crumbling since before the Arctic began melting, but natural geological collapse stands to worsen in the coming years. “We’re always striving to make our beaches safer – safety is a huge part of beach access,” said Jennifer Savage, California policy manager for the Surfrider Foundation, which is dedicated to coastal preservation. “We did not take everything into account when we started building, so now we’re trying to play catch up, and that’s really hard. But the cost in human lives and to the economy will be profound if we don’t start thinking differently.” Although researchers can’t point to a single cause of any particular cliff failure now, they expect to see more as the climate continues to collapse. “What we can say unequivocally is as sea level rises, these kinds of events will become more common,” said USGS research geologist Patrick Barnard. Scientists say sea level rise will accelerate cliff retreat, doubling average erosion rates in southern California by 2100, including some of the state’s most heavily populated, tony coastal communities. That’s because sea level rise and more extreme storms mean bigger, higher waves washing away beaches and lapping at the bottoms of the cliffs. California stands to lose two-thirds of its beaches by the turn of the next century, in a wave of coastal economic destruction worse than the state’s most devastating fires to date. “We expect the higher the sea level, the more the ocean is pounding the base of the cliff, the more frequently we can expect to have failures like the one in Encinitas,” said Barnard. Coastal residential development, too, contributes to erosion by adding weight to clifftops and changing water drainage routes. And sea walls meant to fortify bluffs and protect communities can actually help scour away protective sand beaches even faster. The stakes are rising along with the ocean. Apartment buildings and homes in Pacifica, south of San Francisco, were condemned and demolished after rapid erosion following an intense 2015-2016 storm season crept under property lines. Several homes in Sonoma, north of San Francisco, have been torn down or have fallen with the cliffs that had once supported them. Sections of California’s famed coastline-hugging Highway 1 have been closed or moved inland, and there are plans to shift more. One potential adaptation strategy is “managed retreat”, or the unbuilding of communities threatened by erosion and flooding along the coast using buyouts and eminent domain. “As time moves forward, we have less and less options,” Sara Aminzadeh, a commissioner with the California coastal commission, told representatives of several cities at a July meeting. “I think it’s incumbent on all of us together to change the narrative and make the case for why [managed retreat] is necessary.” The commission oversees how cities develop and protect their coastlines and has been working to prepare the coast for sea level rise for several years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, several coastal towns are defiant about nature’s inexorable push and instead hope to hold the line by better engineering the natural coastline to withstand more pressure from the Pacific, replenishing sand on the thinning beaches and further armoring cliffs against collapse. The precarious coastal community of Del Mar, for example, just a few miles south of Encinitas, has largely rejected the notion of moving back from the edge, even as its cliffs are crumbling at a rapid clip. Del Mar’s plan to protect the city, where the average home is valued at $2.5m, largely hinges on building up the beach with imported sand – not unbuilding parts of the town that hang in the balance. More of the coastline is bound to fall in the meantime, endangering beachgoers and homeowners alike. The deadly incident at Encinitas is a reminder of how much is at stake. “Just culturally we tend to want to stand our ground as Americans,” said Savage. “The idea of retreat is not who we feel that we are.”"
"Britain needs an overarching new sustainability law to bolster natural life-support systems and prevent economic and social collapse, according to proposals from one of the country’s most influential leftwing thinktanks. The paper says policymakers have made a “catastrophic mistake” by underestimating the risks posed by environmental breakdown and the potential benefits of switching to a different economic approach that focuses on building abundance rather than running down resources.  “A new model is needed to rapidly create societies that are more sustainable, just and prepared: bringing human activity to within environmentally sustainable limits while narrowing inequality, improving quality of life, and becoming better prepared for the accelerating consequences of environmental breakdown,” says the discussion document by the Institute for Public Policy Research. The paper is a follow-up to a widely circulated IPPR study, published in February, that said a gathering storm of human-caused threats to climate, nature and economy posed a danger of systemic crash comparable to the 2008 financial crisis. To avoid this, the document says there is an urgent need for parliament to pass a “Sustainable Economy Act” that would mandate statutory targets to rapidly reduce the effects of declining soil fertility, air quality, pollinator numbers, fish stocks, wildlife diversity and other benchmarks of a healthy environment. The move would effectively place a full sustainability constraint on all UK economic activity, allowing natural abundance to recover for the common good instead of running it down to the detriment of all but a super-wealthy minority. The model would be the Climate Change Act 2008, which put Britain at the forefront of efforts to ensure economic activity was aligned with goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause global heating. A sustainable economy legislation would go further by widening the range of targets and standards, including those relating to trade to ensure that imported goods were not only safe for human consumption in the UK, but also had a minimum environmental impact in the country of production. This would represent a major change from the current situation in which the UK is making some progress in reducing domestic emissions even as it continues to subsidise and support fossil fuel industries overseas. It would also be markedly more ambitious than the government’s plans for a new Environment Act because the IPPR – which is considered an influence on Labour policy – also proposes establishing a committee to regularly update goals in line with advances in scientific knowledge and creating a powerful watchdog body that would enforce the targets. Environmental groups worry that the government is planning a weak post-Brexit replacement for the EU’s strong monitoring regulations on water quality, wildlife and air pollution. The IPPR said a sustainability act would also require measures to reduce excessive consumption, which was worsening inequality and making it harder to improve living standards. This could include changes to advertising standards, wider introduction of carbon pricing and investment in public services that encourage more sustainable, fulfilling lifestyles. It would also encourage financial markets to include environment risks in asset valuations so that unsustainable investments become prohibitively expensive. Central banks would be asked to take a more prominent role in managing the financial risks from extreme weather and other symptoms of environmental breakdown. A new public investment bank and a network of regional development banks could fund the transition to a carbon-free economy, which would create jobs similar to the plans outlined in the “green new deals” that have been called for in the US and elsewhere. The authors of the IPPR paper say much of this will already be necessary as a result of the UK’s recent commitment to go carbon neutral by 2050. But their proposal would go further to ensure other natural life support systems are not sacrificed in the race to salvage the climate. “We are suggesting placing a boundary on our economy to ensure we live within our environmental means,” said Laurie Laybourn-Langton, the lead author of the report. “It is not just about the climate. Environmental breakdown might be the most complex, dangerous, difficult problem that we’ve ever faced. By its very nature, it requires ambitious, large-scale legislation.” He acknowledges that the current trend in global politics is in the opposite direction, towards a nationalist race to run-down what is left of the world’s resources, but remains optimistic about the positive potential of a new sustainability law, particularly compared to the alternative. “For those who want to listen to suggestions for solutions, this is roadmap,” Laybourn-Langton says. “And we think that a country doing this can unlock great benefits for society in terms of health, quality of life and a sense of a shared abundance … The actions needed to realise this will be hard, but what will be harder will be for my generation and those below me to try to live with the current set of cascading problems. Running down what we have leads to a horrendous, suicidal, self defeating spiral. A good life is where we benefit from a strong commons and not destroy those common resources.”"
" Big miner BHP is again reviewing its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia lobby group following disagreements over environmental policy. Last month, BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie described global heating as indisputable and called for drastic action in response, including but not limited to carbon pricing.  The Minerals Council moderated some of its policies after BHP announced a 12-month review of its membership in December 2017 but the Guardian understands that, despite the changes, and the resignation of its then CEO, Brendan Pearson, senior BHP executives believe the council needs to do more. BHP pulled out of the World Coal Association last year but decided to remain a Minerals Council member after objecting to its advocacy on energy policy, including calling for government support for new coal-fired power plants in Australia. The council is trying to hold its members together amid divisions over climate and energy policy. Its members include multinationals BHP and Rio Tinto, which provide the lion’s share of its funding, and smaller specialist miners less concerned about attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Rio also put pressure on the council last year over its anti-climate policy advocacy but it is understood the company is no longer considering pulling out. BHP’s climate pledge, announced by Mackenzie in a speech in London a fortnight ago, includes a promise to spend US$400m (about $590m) to develop technologies to reduce emissions from its own operations and the “scope 3” emissions that result downstream from the companies that buy its resources. It says it will limit its 2022 pollution at 2017 levels and have net-zero emissions by 2050. Mackenzie said the company would strengthen the link between emissions performance and executive pay from 2021. The Minerals Council chair, former Liberal government minister Helen Coonan, told the Guardian she did not know if BHP was reviewing its membership of the body. “The vice-chair of the MCA is Mike Henry from BHP. We’ve had many conversations about challenges right across the spectrum in the sector but I’ve not had any conversations of the kind that you allude to,” she said. She said there had been tensions with the company in the past over issues including the use of money from another industry body, Coal21 – which shares some directors with the council – on advertisements extolling the virtues of coal. “But I have a very clear understanding that some of those tensions, if not all of them, have been resolved, at least for the time being, and none of them have been raised with me,” Coonan said. The former MP called on the industry to stick with the council and not splinter into separate lobby groups. “A united voice is a much more effective way to deal with government, to deal with regulators, to deal with interest groups, than if you had a fragmented voice.” The council’s emphasis has shifted under Pearson’s replacement, Tania Constable, to saying that coal has a strong future as part of a “technology neutral” approach. Pearson is now an adviser to the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Constable welcomed Mackenzie’s speech, saying it was in line with the Minerals Council’s support of the Paris climate agreement. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal referenced in the Paris agreement, would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. Coonan said the council believed there was a place for “competing technologies”, listing renewables with storage, coal, gas, carbon capture and storage and “possibly even nuclear energy”.  “We don’t see that we’re completely out of step with BHP and we don’t see that we’re out of step with the coal interests either, because of our technology neutral approach,” she said. Climate groups said there was a clear divide between BHP’s goals and the Minerals Council’s public advocacy. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, a shareholder activist group, said the council had recently called for investment in new coal-fired power plants, and had run more than 40 pro-coal advertisements on Facebook and campaigned for the approval of the Adani Carmichael mine. Dan Gocher, the centre’s director of climate and environment, said these steps were “completely inconsistent” with BHP’s position. Matt Rose, an economist with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the council was taking a destructive approach on public policy and called on BHP to withdraw its membership. “BHP cannot keep walking both sides of the street, talking up climate action on one hand and funding the minerals council to trash it on the other,” he said. The director of policy with the Investor Group on Climate Change, Erwin Jackson, declined to comment on the BHP case, but said institutional investors were increasingly interested in whether industry associations were supporting or undermining climate action. He said critics had tried to dismiss concerns from institutional investors as the work of a few activists. In reality, he said, hundreds of investors controlling trillions of dollars were working with companies to minimise risks associated with climate change. “To try to portray investors as activists demonstrates a failure to understand that climate change is a core financial risk for investors and a systemic risk to the financial system and the economy,” he said."
"July’s record-breaking temperatures brought summertime smog to most of the UK. Worst affected was eastern England, from Kent to Yorkshire, where air pollution reached seven on the government’s10-point scale. The heatwave occurred just before the 100th birthday of the scientist James Lovelock. Best known for his Gaia theory, which hypothesises that life on Earth acts as a self-regulating system, Lovelock was also an atmospheric scientist. In 1973 he was part of a team investigating summertime smog in the UK and Ireland. Up until then the idea that the UK, with its damp grey summers, could experience smog like Los Angeles was thought so improbable that no one had made measurements to check. Lovelock and team set up a line of measurement sites from a water tower in Sibton, Suffolk, to Adrigole, near Cork. Not only was there enough smog in the UK to breach US health limits but it was taking days to form in the air, sometimes from sources up to 620 miles (1,000km) away in continental Europe.  They concluded that controlling our summertime air pollution needed European-wide cooperation. This is still valid today."

Solar Forcing Of Modern, Historic Arctic Sea Ice
Only Slightly Less Sea Ice Now Than Little Ice Age

In a new paper (Stein et al., 2017), scientists find that Arctic sea ice retreat and advance is modulated by variations in solar activity.
In addition, the sea ice cover during the last century has only slightly retreated from the extent reached during coldest centuries of the Little Ice Age (1600s to 1800s AD), which had the highest sea ice cover of the last 10,000 years and flirted with excursions into year-round sea ice.
The Medieval Warm Period sea ice record (~900 to 1200 AD) had the lowest coverage since the Roman era ~2,000 years ago.
Of note, the paper makes no reference to carbon dioxide or anthropogenic forcing as factors modulating Arctic sea ice.



Stein et al., 2017
The causes that are controlling the decrease in sea ice are still under discussion. In several studies changes in extent, thickness and drift of Arctic sea ice are related to changes in the overall atmospheric circulation patterns as reflected in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO). The NAO and AO are influencing changes of the relative position and strength of the two major surface-current systems of the Arctic Ocean.
The increase in sea ice extent during the late Holocene seems to be a circum-Arctic phenomenon, coinciding with major glacier advances on Franz Josef Land, Spitsbergen and Scandinavia.  The increase in sea ice may have resulted from the continuing cooling trend due to decreased solar insolation and reduced heat flow from the Pacific.
The increase in sea ice extent during the late Holocene seems to be a circum-Arctic phenomenon as PIP25-based sea ice records from the Fram Strait, Laptev Sea, East Siberian Sea and Chukchi Sea  display a generally quite similar evolution, all coinciding with the decrease in solar radiation.
The main factors controlling the millennial variability in sea ice and surface-water productivity are probably changes in surface water and heat flow from the Pacific into the Arctic Ocean as well as the long-term decrease in summer insolation, whereas short-term centennial variability observed in the high-resolution middle Holocene record was possibly triggered by solar forcing.

Robust substantiation for the trends documented in this new Arctic sea ice record comes from a 2005 paper by Lassen and Thejll entitled “Multi-decadal variation of the East Greenland Sea- Ice Extent: AD 1500-2000.”   Shown below is an annotated graph from the paper revealing Iceland’s sea ice cover during the last millennium.  These scientists also link sea ice variations to solar activity, namely solar cycle length.  Notice the direct correspondence between the Arctic trends as a whole (from Stein et al., 2017) and the trends for Iceland.



Lessen and Thejll, 2005
[W]e find that the recently reported retreat of the ice in the Greenland Sea  may be related to the termination of the so-called Little Ice Age in the early twentieth century. We also look at the approximately 80 year variability of the Koch [sea ice] index and compare it to the similar periodicity found in the solar cycle length, which is a measure of solar activity. A close correlation (R=0.67) of high significance (0.5 % probability of a chance occurrence) is found between the two patterns, suggesting a link from solar activity to the Arctic Ocean climate.
The ’low frequency oscillation’ that dominated the ice export through the Fram Strait as well as the extension of the sea-ice in the Greenland Sea and Davis Strait in the twentieth century may therefore be regarded as part of a pattern that has existed through at least four centuries. The pattern is a natural feature, related to varying solar activity. The considerations of the impact of natural sources of variability on arctic ice extent are of relevance for concerns that the current withdrawal of ice may entirely be due to human activity. Apparently, a considerable fraction of the current withdrawal could be a natural occurrence.

"The top priority of government is security of the people. Yet on the greatest threat of all, most governments are failing abysmally. As the global influence of western democracies wanes with the ascendancy of China, India and other emerging countries, the resulting power struggle is diverting attention from the great issues the world faces, to their symptoms.  The neoliberal market economy, with its unregulated consumption and rapacious short-term outlook, is destroying modern civilisation. The warning signs are obvious, not least burgeoning high-consuming populations, massive biodiversity loss and multiple resource scarcities. Yet rather than reform an unsustainable system, political leaders scramble to prop it up and compound the problem. The result is Brexit, Trump’s Mexican wall, escalating Middle East tension, the US-China trade standoff, a global arms and space race, Amazon deforestation and much more. In their quest for power, leaders – both democratic and authoritarian – ignore the one issue that is inexorably changing that system, namely human-induced climate change. This is an existential threat to human civilisation that will render current political priorities irrelevant as climatic consequences move beyond human influence. Countering this threat requires unprecedented global co-operation to initiate emergency action. Yet leaders opt for conflict, while suppressing information on the implications of their climate inaction. In May, we published a short paper that included a simple 3C global warming scenario for 2050, outlining the hard-nosed practical impact of climate change, as opposed to more theoretical scientific and business risk disclosure situations. This information was not new, but prompted extensive global discussion: some considered the situation entirely credible, others felt it too extreme. What became clear was the thirst for practical information of this kind. In response, we recently published a follow-up analysis: “The Third Degree: Evidence and implications for Australia of climate-related security risk”, detailing the basis for our assumptions on issues such as chronic water shortages, coastal inundation, mass migration and extreme heat – plus an in-depth global 3C scenario originally published by US national security experts in 2007. We also propose a major scenario-planning initiative for Australia. Scenario-planning does not forecast, predict or express preferences for the future; rather it is storytelling, painting pictures of alternative worlds that might emerge, to assist policymakers in imagining and thinking about future possibilities. Strategy is then assessed against each possible future. One of the initial tasks is to identify the “official future” – the future as it is supposed to be, upon which prevailing strategy is based. A large amount of political capital is tied up in that view, typically the result of group-think generated by ideology or by business models that have stood the test of time but may be inappropriate in the future. Scenario-planning explores the future, allowing constructive discussion on alternatives incorporating the full range of credible evidence. In particular, there must be a preparedness to think beyond conventional wisdom, after which a reassessment of the official future is often inevitable, and proactively undertaken. Nowhere is this more necessary than in Australia, the continent most exposed to climate change, where the official future for the last two decades has been, and remains, climate denial and delay. Political expediency, blinkered ideology and short-term business thinking rejects or deflects climate science and expert advice. Predatory delay is used to prolong the life of our high-carbon economy for short-term financial gain, irrespective of the damage to society. Policy, such as it is, views climate change as a non-problem. The blatant inconsistency of Australia’s position beggars belief. We are signatories to the UNFCCC, supposedly committed to avoiding dangerous climate change, which is already happening. Australia ratified the Paris agreement to restrict temperature increase below 2C and ideally towards 1.5C, yet our emissions are rising rapidly even though there is no carbon budget remaining to stay below even 2C. Incredibly, we ramp up new fossil fuel projects: Adani coal, gas expansion, fracking in NT and WA, and more. Then we have the gall to carry over unused carbon credits from the Kyoto protocol to obscure the failure of our wholly inadequate Paris emission reduction commitments; credits which were  unjustified in the first place. We are already the fifth largest carbon polluter globally when exports are included – about 5% of global emissions. On current projections, by 2030 Australia will be responsible for a massive 13% of global emissions. Our fossil fuel industries are subsidised annually by about US$29bn or 2.3% of GDP, far in excess of anything given to the low carbon industries. And this in a country with probably the greatest low-carbon energy potential in the world – potential we are wasting, blocked by deliberately obstructive federal policy. Australia’s climate stance is totally untenable in geopolitical terms, nothing less than a crime against humanity, as Pacific countries continually point out. The federal government does its utmost to hide these facts from public view. Accordingly, Australia must undertake serious scenario-planning to inform the public of the criminal damage being inflicted upon them by their government, and to develop contingencies for emergency action as the official future of accelerating high-carbon growth inevitably falls apart in the near future. The government’s role should be to protect the future from the past, not the past from the future. When government refuses to lead, others must. • Ian Dunlop was formerly an international oil, gas and coal industry executive, chair of the Australian Coal Association and CEO of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the most highly-cited estimate of recent (1992 – 2011) polar ice sheet melt rates, the land ice on Greenland and Antarctica has been contributing to sea level rise at a rate of 0.59 mm/year in the modern era, which means the equivalent of 5.9 centimeters (2.3 inches) per century of sea level rise might eventually accrue if the polar ice sheets continue melting at current rates for the next 10 decades.
Shepherd et al., 2012

Since 1992 [through 2011], the polar ice sheets [Antarctica and Greenland] have contributed, on average, 0.59 ± 0.20 millimeter year−1 to the rate of global sea-level rise.

Of course, a sea level rise rate contribution from Greenland and Antarctica that amounts to a little more than 2 inches per century is not particularly alarming.  And when observed sea level rise contribution rates from melting ice sheets don’t elicit the headlining attention they deserve, it’s time to promulgate climate modeling catastrophes that might occur at some point in the distant future.
For example, earlier this year Slate‘s resident meteorologist Eric Holthaus excitedly embraced the James Hansen ice-melt catastrophe paper (Hansen et al., 2016) as a welcome tenet of a supposedly authoritative scientific canon: “James Hansen’s Bombshell Warning Is Now Part of the Scientific Canon”.
The paper, which has undergone some wording revisions since the original version appeared in July, 2015, apparently “concludes” that the polar ice sheets will soon melt catastrophically, and that this ice sheet melt contribution will in turn result in sea level rise of “at least 10 feet in as little as 50 years“.
Eric Holthaus, Slate:

“The study—written by James Hansen, NASA’s former lead climate scientist, and 16 co-authors, many of whom are ered among the top in their fields—concludes that glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica will melt 10 times faster than previous consensus estimates, resulting in sea level rise of at least 10 feet in as little as 50 years.“

Again, the combined Greenland and Antarctica ice sheet melt contribution to sea level rise was 0.59 mm/year during 1992 – 2011 (Shepherd et al., 2012), or about 6 cm (2.3 inches) per century.  To achieve James Hansen’s claimed sea level rise prediction of 10 feet (3.05 meters) within 50 years due to rapidly melting Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, the current melt rates would have to increase by a factor of 100.  Instead of the polar ice sheet contribution rate of 0.23 of an inch per decade for 1992-2011, the rate in the next 50 years will need to average 23 inches per decade — two orders of magnitude more than presently observed.
And for the record, the observed melt-rate contribution from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets of 0.59 mm/yr for 1992 – 2011 is very likely an overestimate.  For one, NASA has reported that there was an overall ice mass gain for Antarctica during this same period (1992-2008), and thus a reduction in sea level rise equivalent to -0.23 mm/yr (rather than a net positive contribution of +0.19 mm/yr as determined by Shepherd et al., 2011).  Secondly, in current datasets the baseline period for establishing the surface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland ice sheet is the 1961-1990 tricade.  However, those 30 years were notoriously cold in Greenland, a full 1.5 degrees C colder than the 1920-1940s period, when Greenland was actually as warm or warmer than recent decades.  If the baseline data were not centered on the coldest decades of the century, but instead included the 1920s-1940s warm period, the record of net “loss” for the Greenland ice sheet since the 1990s would be significantly reduced, and there may have been an overall net mass gain relative to the 1920s-’40s for recent decades.  Succinctly, different baseline data would yield an even more negligible Greenland ice sheet contribution to sea level rise for 1992-2011 than reported by Shepherd et al., 2011 (0.4 mm/yr, or 1.6 inches per century).
Considering Paleoclimate Data, Sea Level Rise Projections Of Even 1 Meter Per Century Are ‘Sheer Nonsense’, ‘Demagoguery’
World-renown scientist Dr. Nils-Axel Mörner, a sea level expert who has authored hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific publication during his career, has recently weighed in on the preposterousness of claiming sea levels will rise even 1 meter in the next 100 years — let alone over 3 meters in the next 50, as James Hansen claims.  Using past records of sea level rise rates from the earliest decades and centuries of the Holocene (~11,000 years ago), Mörner concludes that it is not possible for modern sea levels to rise at rates of 10 mm/year (1 meter/century) — or faster than they did during a time when much of the Northern Hemisphere was still buried kilometers-deep in ice and temperatures were rising far more rapidly than today.

Mörner,  2016

Sea level is globally varying between ±0.0 and +1.0 mm/yr (0.5 ± 0.5 mm/yr). … At 11,000 BP we had enormous amounts of ice still left in the huge continental ice caps of the Last Ice Age. In Canada, the ice front was in St. Lawrence lowland, and in Scandinavia, the ice margin was at Stockholm. At the warming pulse ending the Pleistocene and starting the Holocene, ice melted at an exceptionally strong forcing. Today, there is neither ice nor climate forcing that in any way can be compared to what happened 11,000 – 10,000 BP. The conclusion is obvious; we can never in present time have any ice melting and sea level rise as strong- and certainly not stronger-than that occurring at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. Therefore, a rate of sea level rise of +10.0 mm/yr or 1.0 m per century can be held as the absolutely ultimate value of any present day sea level rise. Any present rise in sea level must be far below this value to be realistic in view of past records and the physical factors controlling ice melting. Therefore, we can also dismiss any claim of sea level rise exceeding 1 m in the next century as sheer nonsense and unfounded demagoguery.


Sea Levels Currently Rising Between 0 – 1 mm/yr; Modeled ‘Corrections’ To Sea Level Rise Data Artificially And Erroneously Raise Rates
A year ago, Dr. Mörner detailed his comprehensive critique of the alterations to observed data (euphemistically referred to as “corrections”).  He determined that if the “corrections” (i.e., modeled adjustments that artificially raise sea levels) for the satellite data are removed, sea levels only rose at a rate of 0.45 mm/year (2 inches per century) between 1992-2015, which is about 1/7th of the rate of rise reported by altimetry datasets.
Mörner,  2015

The satellite altimetry records are claimed to be “a proxy for ocean water volume changes”, but behind the curves are unspecified “corrections” hidden, applied by NOAA and CU in order to obtain the product they personally assumed to be the correct “proxy of ocean water volume changes”. There is a major problem, however: their satellite altimetry records differ by 100% to 800% from observed tide gauge measurements. With the removal of GIA corrections … from the satellite altimetry data, we finally obtain agreements among global tide gauge data, costal morphology data and satellite altimetry data; all agreeing on a mean global eustatic sea level factor somewhere within the zone ±0.0 to +1.0 mm/yr.
The mean of 182 sites (excluding a few outliers) scattered all over the globe is 1.6 mm/ yr. Because of long-term subsidence of many river mouth sites and site-specific compaction problems, this value may, in fact, represent a slightly too high value. The key sites here discussed provide values of about 0.0 mm/yr, and the Kattegatt and North Sea records give firm values around 1.0 ± 0.1 mm/yr. This data set is in deep conflict with the high rates proposed by the IPCC and satellite altimetry. The differences in rates can only be understood in terms of errors and mistakes. The true mean global eustatic component is likely to be found in the zone ranging from +2.0 mm/yr to ±0.0 mm/yr, and most probably in the lower half of this zone; i.e. within 1.0 – 0.0 mm/yr. The error was found to be in the satellite altimetry values for reasons of incorrect “corrections”
The only data set which hangs far above the others is the IPCC predictions. Those data, however, refer to assumptions and model out-puts, and are, by no means, anchored in observational facts. … [I]t is high time to abandon the idea of global isostatic adjustment, and to stop all kinds of GIA corrections of records of sea level changes (i.e. satellite altimetry, GRACE, tide gauges, etc.).


The reported rates exceeding 3 mm/year are based on models instead of direct observational measurements.  Echoing a 2015 paper from Beenstock et al., two more new papers (another by Mörner) indicate that observations (i.e., non-modeled, non-adjusted measurements from tide gauges from all over the world) of global sea level rise range somewhere between 0 and 1 mm/yr, or a few inches per century.
Beenstock et al., 2015

Using recently developed methods for nonstationary time series, we find that sea levels rose in 7 % of tide gauge locations and fell in 4 %. The global mean increase is 0.39–1.03 mm/year.

Mörner,  2016

Observational facts recorded and controllable in the field tell a quite different story of actual sea-level rise than the ones based on model simulations, especially all those who try to endorse a preconceived scenario of disastrous flooding to come. “Poster sites” like Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Kiribati in the Pacific have tide gauge stations indicating stable sea-level conditions over the last 20–30 years. The Maldives, Goa, Bangladesh, and several additional sites in the Indian Ocean provide firm field evidence of stable sea-level conditions over the last 40–50 years. Northeast Europe provides excellent opportunities to test regional eustasy, now firmly being set at +1.0 ± 0.1 mm/year. Other test areas like Venice, Guyana–Surinam, Qatar, and Perth provide a eustatic factor of ±0.0 mm/year. We now have a congruent picture of actual global sea-level changes, i.e., between ±0.0 to +1.0 mm/year. This implies little or no threat for future sea-level problems.

Parker and Ollier, 2016

Tide gauges provide the most reliable measurements, and best data to assess the rate of change. We show as the naïve averaging of all the tide gauges included in the PSMSL surveys show “relative” rates of rise about +1.04 mm/year (570 tide gauges of any length). If we consider only 100 tide gauges with more than 80 years of recording the rise is only +0.25 mm/year. This naïve averaging has been stable and shows that the sea levels are slowly rising but not accelerating. …The satellite altimetry returns a noisy signal so that a +3.2 mm/year trend is only achieved by arbitrary “corrections”.
We conclude that if the sea levels are only oscillating about constant trends everywhere as suggested by the tide gauges, then the effects of climate change are negligible, and the local patterns may be used for local coastal planning without any need of purely speculative global trends based on emission scenarios.

"It is fascinating to ponder what brought a group of ancient settlers to the windswept islands of Orkney. One thing is certain: 5,000 years ago the Neolithic village of Skara Brae, fed by a bountiful supply of sealife, was a thriving community. Tucked away in the dunes, on the edge of a horseshoe bay, the inhabitants built comfortable dwellings furnished with stone dressers and beds, played games, made pottery and tools, and even found time to craft jewellery from walrus tusks and whale teeth. No one can be certain when or why, but at some point an apparently abrupt event emptied the village of its inhabitants, leaving the nearby dunes to blanket Skara Brae for thousands of years.  The village is once again under threat – a recent climate vulnerability study, carried out by a group of environment and heritage experts on behalf of Historic Environment Scotland, concluded the Unesco-protected settlement was extremely vulnerable to sea-level change, increased precipitation and storm intensity. A century-old seawall now protects the main part of the site, but nearby, recent storms have nibbled away at the delicate sand dunes and peaty soils, leaving the site horribly exposed. The biggest fear is that one mighty storm, with just the right wind direction and swell, could do irreparable damage and sweep Skara Brae into the sea."

Dear Herr Beck
We take the liberty to bring your attention to the ZDF show ‘Frontal 21’, broadcast on 24 January, 2017, and one of its segments on newly elected US President Donald J. Trump, which in our view was completely defamatory.
Using suggestive, selected film footage and accompanying audio, the President of our most important ally and the leading western democracy was in spirit and in fact put in the same proximity as Adolf Hitler.
This is not only untruthful and completely defamatory, it also trivializes the historical assessment of an unprecedented crime committed by German war criminals and those responsible for the murder of 6 million European Jews.
We bring this case up because we assume that the broadcasting of this deliberate false content got by you, and so you did not exercise the input of your political and ethical responsibility for the broadcast content of this institution of public television.
With all regards for how essential freedom of the press is for democracy, we are convinced that the irresponsible dissemination of false historical references and defamatory content cannot and must not be a part of programs that are transmitted by public broadcaster ZDF. We therefore hereby request your corresponding and appropriate action to correct this scandalous situation and to be sure that this type of incident is effectively prevented from occurring again in the future.
For the sake of good order, we further point out that we have notified the appropriate US authorities for the possibility of legal proceedings concerning the appalling poor behavior of the “Frontal 21“ editorial board and to check for the possibility of launching a criminal proceeding against the responsible persons.
Yours truly
Dr. Rafael Korenzecher

"Capitalism is “very much part of the solution” to tackling the climate crisis, according to the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. Challenged in an interview by the Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow over whether capitalism itself was fuelling the climate emergency, Carney gave a strident defence of the economic system predicated on private ownership and growth but said companies that ignored climate change would “go bankrupt without question”.  “Capitalism is part of the solution and part of what we need to do,” he said in the interview broadcast on Wednesday. The economist, who previously worked for Goldman Sachs, said he recognised the costs of ignoring climate change were rising, but stressed there were increasing opportunities for “doing something about it”, and that capital would shift in this direction. “Now there is $120tn of capital behind that framework that is saying to companies: ‘Tell us how you are going to manage these risks’ – that’s the first thing,” Carney said. “The second thing the capitalist system needs to do is to manage the risks around climate change, be ready for the different speeds of the adjustment. And then the most important thing is to move capital from where it is today to where it needs to be tomorrow. The system is very much part of the solution.” He added: “Companies that don’t adapt – including companies in the financial system – will go bankrupt without question. [But] there will be great fortunes made along this path aligned with what society wants.” Carney, who is set to step down as governor in January after six years in the post, was interviewed at Coutts Bank in central London on Tuesday evening, where Sir David Attenborough told bankers and financiers the planet was in mortal danger and they “simply must act”. Many experts argue that ending the crisis would necessitate the end of capitalism and the introduction of a new economic model, due to the constant pursuit of GDP growth in capitalist economies where investment in fossil fuels continues to overshadow those in renewables. Others argue that capitalism harnesses innovation, which is key to the Earth’s survival and future prosperity – citing rapid advancements in renewable and clean energies. In response to Carney’s interview, Extinction Rebellion said societies must adopt more sustainable economic systems. “We are destroying our planet, and business as usual is not going to save us. We must question any system that has led us to this path of mass extinction, and look to more sustainable economic models that are not based on resource depletion and increasing emissions,” a spokesperson told the Guardian. “This is no longer about left versus right, we need to come together to face this. Political persuasion is going to be a distant memory when we are faced with failing crops and empty supermarket shelves.” The UK has committed to eliminating carbon emissions by 2050 through legislation passed last month. However, analysis published this week by the Labour party showed this target would not be met if the UK fully exploited the shale gas reserves in the country through fracking."
"The Arctic is on fire, hot on the heels of the latest scorching European heatwave. As the impact of the climate crisis mounts, more and more people are asking: how can we control this beast we have created? The scientific answer is fairly straightforward: reduce the amount of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere to zero. The sooner that’s done, the lower the stabilised temperature and the fewer devastating climate impacts we must face.  The world signed up to this in the Paris agreement, agreeing to “pursue efforts” to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, while committing to keep the rise “well below” 2C. To have just a 50% chance of meeting the 1.5C means halving global emissions over the next decade and hitting “net zero” emissions by about 2050. That means every sector of every country in the world needs to be, on average, zero emissions. That’s electricity, transport, industry, farming, the lot. For many areas of life, near-zero emissions is an attainable, if extremely ambitious, goal. We could refit our homes and use electric-powered transport from low-carbon energy sources. Energy from the sun, wind and waves could power societies worldwide. But there are some areas where zero emissions by 2050 is impossible. There will, for example, always be some emissions from the farming needed to feed more than 10 billion people this century, and there is no sign of flying long-haul on an electric plane any time soon. The answer to this is to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, using “negative emissions technologies”. By sucking carbon out of the atmosphere – at the same rate as it is being added – we can reach zero emissions. Whatever the shape of society in the future, a stable climate will require some working negative emissions technologies. They will be an indispensable tool to mop up the hard-to-eliminate emissions. How can it be done? The UK is betting on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, BECCS, where carbon is removed from the atmosphere by crops or trees as they grow. This biomass is then burned in a power station to generate electricity, and the waste carbon dioxide is pumped far underground into old oil and gas reservoirs or saline aquifers. A second approach is to restore or enhance processes that naturally remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Forest restoration removes carbon by storing it in trees, and soils can also take up carbon, for example, if crushed silicate rocks are spread on to them, enhancing a natural chemical process. With a range of options, we might think that negative emissions means that climate change can be tackled, and tackled fast. But evidence that these technologies can work at a small demonstration scale is causing the opposite. Negative emissions are treated as a “get out of jail free” card – a licence to keep emitting and clean up the mess later with new technologies. Politicians and their advisers love them, because they can announce a target such as 1.5C while planning to exceed it, with temperatures hopefully clawed back later in the century through negative emissions. A future where carbon is scrubbed from the atmosphere is also manna from heaven for the enemies of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. The greater the negative emissions, the less decarbonisation is needed. Negative emissions technologies are deployed as a weapon to avoid taking serious action on climate. The oil giant Shell, for example, is rolling out a scheme this autumn for UK drivers to pay an extra 1p per litre on their petrol to have this global corporation plant a tree to convince motorists that they can “drive neutral” using “natural climate solutions”. As the electric vehicle revolution approaches, Shell is again engaged in a sophisticated lobbying and disinformation campaign, putting its short-term profits above all else. But this is only part of the story: scrutinise the pathways in the recent IPCC report consistent with the 1.5C target and the stated amount of negative emissions envisaged is incredible. Most scenarios have more than 730bn tonnes of carbon dioxide sequestered as negative emissions this century. That is equivalent to all the carbon dioxide emitted since the industrial revolution by the US, the UK, Germany and China combined. There just isn’t enough land to suck up that much carbon into new forests. And using BECCS to remove this much carbon, as most scenarios assume, would require an area of new cropland larger than India, plus building a facility to store 1m tonnes of carbon a year every single day from 2025 until 2050. Negative emissions at this scale are the stuff of fantasy. While it is true that some negative emissions technologies are practically feasible at modest scales, this knowledge encourages both magical and mendacious thinking. We all want a magic bullet that solves the climate emergency, but negative emissions technologies are not it. Of course, it makes no sense to be against these technologies in principle. Investment in them is needed, as hard-to-mitigate emissions will need removing from the atmosphere, and some options such as forest restoration bring many additional benefits. But we should recognise the dual role they also play in encouraging a delay to the action we need to take: rapidly ending the use of fossil fuels. • Simon Lewis is professor of global change science at University College London"
"Climate change is “absolutely” already causing deaths, according to a new report on the health impacts of the climate crisis, which also predicts climate-related stunting, malnutrition and lower IQ in children within the coming decades.  The report, From Townsville to Tuvalu, produced by Monash University in Melbourne, pulled together scientific research from roughly 120 peer-reviewed journal articles to paint a picture of the health-related impacts of the climate emergency in Australia and the Pacific region.  It pointed to a 2018 report from the World Health Organisation, which predicted that between 2030 and 2050, global warming would cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year from heat stress, malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea. But Misha Coleman, one of the report’s authors, stressed that deaths were already occurring. “There are absolutely people dying climate-related deaths, [especially due to] heat stress right now,” she said. “During the Black Saturday fires [in Victoria in 2009] for example, we know that people were directly killed by the fires, but there were nearly 400 additional deaths in those hot days from heat stress and heatstroke,” said Coleman. A 2017 report in the journal Nature predicted that by 2100, 75% of people around the world would be exposed to heatwaves extreme enough to kill. The report found that as well as deaths caused directly by severe weather events such as hurricanes, flooding and fires, the “more deep and insidious impact” came from the secondary impacts of climate change. “Severe weather events are causing flooding, particularly in informal settlements in the Pacific, that leads to diseases including diarrhoea, that can be very serious and fatal in people, particularly children,” said John Thwaites, chair of the Sustainable Development Institute at Monash University. The report warned that rising global temperatures would expand the habitat of mosquitos, exposing more people to diseases including dengue, chikungunya and zika, and would cause other diseases to spread into Australia, including Nipah virus, which is spread by bats, and Q fever, which is already prevalent around Townsville. “Q fever is something that is carried by a lot of wild and domesticated animals,” said Coleman. “As climate change degrades their habitat through fires and drought, these animals go looking for green grass and fresh water [and] they find themselves on golf courses and on retirees’ two-acre blocks.” Coleman said the problem comes when the infected animals defecate on the lawns and the poo is then run over by humans with lawnmowers. “It becomes airborne, it becomes this highly, highly transmissible toxin, that’s why it’s being described, even by the Lancet medical journal, as a bioweapon in our own backyard.” Climate change is expected to pose particularly stark issues for childhood development, with the report citing research that shows children born to women who were pregnant while they experienced floods in Brisbane in 2011 had lower cognitive capacity (equivalent to at least 14 points on an IQ scale), smaller vocabularies and less imaginative play at the age of two. The decreased nutritional value of staple crops as a result of higher CO2 concentration was also expected to cause stunting, anaemia and malnutrition in children, within 10 to 20 years. “What’s the future for our children?” said Coleman. “These events are more common, more frequent and not going to become less so in a short amount of time.”"
"It’s turning into the greatest environmental challenge of our age – how do we transport celebrities safely and responsibly to global eco-summits, so that they can do a better job of lecturing the rest of us about carbon emissions? The world has been agog at Camp Google, the three-day mass gathering at the luxury Verdura resort in Sicily, of 300 or so celebrity environmental activists, including Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bradley Cooper, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Chris Martin and more – too many to list, even a rumoured (but unseen) Barack Obama. Not forgetting Prince Harry, who reportedly gave a stirring speech about the environment – barefoot! A startling image springs to mind of a Google aide shrugging off the carbon footprint of Harry’s journey (private jet and helicopter), but saying: “Uh, prince-dude, you need to lose the offensive shoes.”  Presumably the £16.5m eco-knees-up was at least partly enabled by Google’s ongoing tax avoidance, but let’s not spoil a beautiful moment with facts and stuff. A total of 114 private jets ferried the celebrities to Italy, releasing hundreds of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. As they arrived in Sicily, they transferred to Camp Google in luxury vehicles and/or helicopters. There followed what must surely have been intellectually invigorating A-list debates about how “we” (they mean us, not them) must conserve the Earth’s resources. After that, the celebrity activists retired to relax in their gratis £730-a-night-plus rooms, perchance haunted by the spectres of global eco-catastrophe and Coldplay agreeing to perform. Perhaps, like me, you’re thinking: “If only self-awareness could be solar-powered”? I mean, did anyone at Google realise how all this starry eco-activism might look to the outside world? The tiny disconnect between what Google and its guests were saying and what they were doing? Apparently not. However, and this is a serious question: how do people expect eco-celebs to get around? When they lend support, as Emma Thompson did for the recent Extinction Rebellion rally in London, they risk being roasted under the hot sun of public and media condemnation. Is this fair – presumably the publicity a celebrity generates justifies the carbon? Should the famous stick to local events and videolinks or just not bother? It’s not as if Harry could have micro-scooted to Sicily or descended in a hot-air balloon, like a woke, royal Phileas Fogg. Not that this excuses the gargantuan excess and repellent insincerity of Camp Google. (Note to Silicon Valley: if you want to throw grotesquely smug A-list beanos, spare us the ghastly faux-worthiness.) However, it’s worth asking if mocking the motivations-cum-emissions of eco-celebs is fast turning into a socially acceptable bloodsport. While A-list hypocrisy is always great fun, our own isn’t entirely without its amusements. British women with hideous, unsightly vaginas, rejoice – help is at hand! New York company VSPOT plans to open a “vaginal spa” in London’s Knightsbridge this autumn. Treatments could include vaginal steaming (I’ve always presumed this must be akin to crouching knickerless over a steaming kettle, but even better); “V-tightening” with a laser (a fun day out for all the family); and a mysterious herb-infused vagina “facial”. They do realise this isn’t where a lady’s face is, right? This is serious. Like labial surgery, popularised by pornography, it sends out the message that female genitals are unacceptable left alone and need to be prettified. That something very wrong is going on “down there” and should be fretted about and attended to. Never mind that medical people point out that the vagina is self-cleaning and doesn’t require such treatments. Also, that steaming might not only burn the vaginal walls, but alter the heathy balance of bacteria, leading to infections. Astonishing, isn’t it? Who’d have thought that going boil-in-the-bag with genitals would be a bad idea? Trust qualified gynaecologists to ruin a relaxing spa day. Another major alarm bell is that Gwyneth Paltrow appears to have no involvement in this company. Wasn’t Paltrow one of the intrepid pioneers of steaming vaginas? Didn’t she also champion inserting jade eggs until, again, some spoilsport gynaecologists said something about toxic shock syndrome and bacterial vaginosis? Sorry, but I can’t take anything in the arena of vagina maintenance seriously unless Gwynnie’s face is attached. She is our queen of down-below quackery and female genitalia spruce-ups. She should be alerted that someone is trying to steal her vaginal thunder. In the meantime, I’ll continue to feel thrilled that women are being encouraged to worry about the actual insides of their bodies. Next week: women, are you satisfied with the shape of your kidneys? Not to get all “judgey” on iron age women, but at least one was a lazy, sweet-munching fashion victim, say Swiss archaeologists. They discovered a hollowed-out, tree-trunk coffin in the Aussersihl district in Zurich bearing the body of a well-to-do Celtic woman, wearing fine clothes and jewellery, with indications that she had a sweet tooth and did little physical work. Could this be an ancestor of mine? There are eerie similarities, if you take away the upper-class bling, replace sweet with savoury and add “evidence” of entire weekends sprawled on the sofa watching boxsets of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars, with no movement visible to the naked eye. How did they get all this information from a 2,200-year-old corpse? And surely she could not have imagined that, in a couple of millennia, the world would be raising a censorious eyebrow over her amber necklaces and sweet-toothed indolence. Perhaps the trend will catch on and henceforth people will be buried judgmentally with their consumer detritus – mobile phones, KFC buckets and Amazon vouchers. “It’s what she would have wanted – I mean, seriously, she really did want that Accessorize bracelet.” Modern people are criticised for sedentary, over-indulgent lifestyles, but it would appear we are merely following tradition. • This article was amended on 5 August 2019 to omit a reference to Bono being at the Google event.

Chart: NOAA, public domain
In the heydays of global warming, in the early 2000s, scientists and activists loudly claimed hurricanes would become more frequent and even more powerful due to global warming supercharging – things would only get worse. And unless we changed our fossil-fuel indulgent lives, Mother Nature would certainly punish mankind like never before.
Odds: 1 in 2300!
Yet, since those hysterical days, hurricane activity over the East Coast has unexpectedly all but disappeared. Not a major hurricane (Cat 3 – 5) has hit the US east coast in close to 4000 days, thus making the period the quietest in recorded history. The whopping odds of this according to one estimate was only 1 in 2300. Read here and here.
Rare! Children see first east coast hurricane ever!
This means that almost all children under 14 have no or barely any recollection of a major hurricane hitting the US east coast.

For Florida, ABC News here reports that Hermine is the first hurricane of any category to hit the state in a decade.
In summary, the exact opposite of what climate experts predicted in 2005 has in fact happened. They could not have been more wrong. Hermine it turns out, just barely made hurricane status. ABC writes:
The Category 1 storm hit just east of St. Marks around 1:30 a.m. EDT with winds around 80 mph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Hermine later weakened to a tropical storm as it moved farther inland.”
The latest is that Hermine has weakened to a tropical storm and is located over Georgia. The track for the next hours is shown below.

Chart: NOAA
Though it’s early, the storm could pose a threat to southern New England.
Of course one calm 10-year period of hurricane activity does not mean it’s going to stay that way by any means. It’s just a question of time before hurricane activity naturally picks up again.

Share this...FacebookTwitterContrary to what is often claimed, Arctic sea ice is not in a death spiral, and has been stable for the past 10 years.
Yesterday Japanese skeptic blogger Kirye informed at Twitter that the sea ice volume and area rates of growth for September and early October this year are astonishingly rapid and at a pace we are accustomed to seeing in late October and November:
Chart: DMI
Volume is now well near normal level at over 9000 cubic kilometers. Sea ice area can be seen here.
Although Arctic sea ice reached a rather low level this year, September’s rate of volume growth was nothing less than spectacular, skyrocketing from some 6000 cubic kilometers to a bit over 9000 cubic kilometers in just a matter of three weeks! The impressive rate of growth is shown graphically by the next chart:

As shown the recent rate of growth is something that we commonly see in late October and in November. Usually the rate of growth is only about half as much.
Using the global warming theory on Arctic sea ice extent, i.e. it’s due to temperature, this year’s impressive growth would tell us that the Arctic must have been unusually frigid over the past three weeks. But looking at the Arctic temperature above 80°N latitude here, we see that temperatures have in fact been well above average. So what’s going on?
How can ice be forming so rapidly when it’s been mild over the past few weeks? What can we deduce from all this?
It tells us that Arctic sea ice extent has a lot more to do with other factors other than surface temperature. Critical factors include, ocean currents and cycles, wind conditions from weather patterns, and so on. So the next time an alarmist tries to tell us that sea ice loss is proof of warming, then just point out that there’s a lot more to it than just surface temperature. This year shows that in a very profound way.
The system is far more complex than just a trace gas (one, by the way, that happens to be a convenient vehicle to mass regulation).

In the early 1950s, the accepted scientific truth — as determined by thermometer records available at the time — was that global mean temperatures had risen by 0.7°C between 1860 and 1940.
 

Willett, H. C. 1950. “Temperature Trends of the Past Century” Centenary Proc. Royal Meteorol. Soc., pp. 195-206.

As recently as 1980, it was still considered “consensus” science that the Northern Hemisphere had warmed by “nearly 1.0°C”  between 1880 and 1940, and then cooled by a “nearly comparable” amount from 1940 to the late 1970s.

Agee, 1980


The Temperature ‘Truth’ Changes After The 1980s

The raw thermometer or instrumental temperature data available in the 1950s have not changed in the last 35 years.  In other words, daily high and low temperature numbers from thermometer accounts that were not available in the 1870s or 1910s or 1930s did not subsequently become available, or appear, in the years following the early 1980s.  And yet after the 1980s, the thermometric instrumental record accepted during the 1950s to 1970s was fundamentally changed to reflect a new truth that aligned with climate models.  For instead of a global warming +0.7°C between 1860 and 1940, the Met Office decided that the 1860-1940 warming trend should be +0.3°C instead.  Again, no new raw thermometric evidence had emerged.  And yet about 0.4°C of warming was lopped off the previously accepted trend anyway.

New Paper’s Ice Core Evidence Indicates Globe Was Similarly Warm In 1920s, 1930s

Interestingly, when graphs of regional temperatures using geophysical proxy evidence (ice cores, tree rings, etc.) are reconstructed for the last few centuries or millennia, the results look rather different than the current instrumental records do.  Instead of a sharp warming trajectory after the 1950s, for example, many regions do not show a significant warming trend at all.  In fact, more and more, temperature reconstructions using proxy evidence indicate that there has been no unusual or remarkable warming trend in recent decades that strongly aligns with the abrupt increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions after the 1940s.
To illustrate, consider the 60 papers published in 2016 (or the 17 papers already published in 2017) that display no clear evidence of an unusual warming trend after the 1940s — or in the last 100+ years relative to the last few thousand.  Instead, many reconstructions of regional temperatures using proxy evidence show that a large portion of modern era warming occurred prior to the 1940s, and not after it.
For example, consider the glacier melt rate in the 1920s to 1950s relative to recent decades in Gregory et al. (2013) below.  Could this explosive glacier melt rate have occurred with only modest warming as depicted in the highly altered instrumental record?

Gregory et al., 2013


Now, in a new paper, Steiger et al. (2017) have constructed graphs using compilations of ice core proxies to represent the globe.  As might be expected, there are notable differences in the reconstructions of global temperature using geophysical evidence when compared to the instrumental thermometer record (Berkley Earth).  Namely, (a) the instrumental record warms up the post-1970s period substantially relative to the ice core record (which shows an incompatible non-trend or cooling after the 1990s), and (b) the ice core record shows much more warming than the instrumental record does in the early 20th century.
In the graphs below, the instrumental (black) and isotope record (blue) appear together (as they do in the paper), and then the instrumental trend is removed in the subsequent representation.

Steiger et al., 2017
“Through several idealized and real proxy experiments we assess the spatial and temporal extent to which isotope records can reconstruct surface temperature, 500 hPa geopotential height, and precipitation. We find local reconstruction skill to be most robust across the reconstructions, particularly for temperature and geopotential height, as well as limited non-local skill in the tropics.  These results are in agreement with long-held views that isotopes in ice cores have clear value as local climate proxies, particularly for temperature and atmospheric circulation.”



 


Temperature ‘Truth’ Pivots Upon One’s Presuppositions, Biases

Convinced we have already obtained the truth about global temperatures, the Steiger et al. (2017) scientists possess the certitude to encapsulate that very word in their graph keys:



Considering scientists 30 years ago were documenting an artificial (urbanization) warming bias of more than 0.1°C per decade already existed in the post-1970s instrumental records, that 1/3rd of the oceans hadn’t even been sampled (temperatures) yet as of the 1990s, or that overseers of temperature datasets acknowledged that they just “made up” temperatures in places where there was no data,  can we really know the Earth’s true temperature?

Take a locality like Greenland.  When we consider that just a tiny fraction of the Greenland ice sheet has instrumental temperature readings available for both recent decades and for the beginning of the 20th century (see illustration below), just how certain can we be that we have the truth anyway?

Peterson and Vose, 1997


Or consider the below graphic of competing early 20th century temperature trends for Greenland.  Reeves Eyre and Zeng (2017) indicate modeling biases may reach 5°C for Greenland, and they point out that widespread temperature monitoring has only been available since the 1990s.
Of the spaghetti of trends depicted in the graph below, which one is the truth?  For those who believe the warming in recent decades is dangerously unprecedented, the lower early 20th century temperature trends are truth.  For those skeptical that the modern climate is unusually warm or that the Earth’s climate undulates in concert with CO2 emissions, the truth is likely that the 1920s and 1930s had warmer temperatures.  Which conceptualization is the “right” one?  Probably neither.

Reeves Eyre and Zeng, 2017
“Ice sheet-average annual mean SAT [surface air temperatures] from different datasets are highly correlated in recent decades, but their 1901–2000 trends differ even in sign [some show cooling, some show warming]. Compared with the MERRA2 climatology combined with gridded SAT analysis anomalies, thirty-one earth system model historical runs from the CMIP5 archive reach ~5°C for the 1901–2000 average bias and have opposite trends for a number of sub-periods. … Due to its remoteness and extreme climate however, continuous widespread climate monitoring over the GrIS has been carried out for only about the last two decades, and even then with rather sparse coverage in some geographic areas and glaciological regimes. … Box (2002) found a pattern of warming from ~1900 to ~1940, cooling from ~1940 to ~1990, and warming from ~1990 onwards. In addition, inter-annual variability was found to be closely related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). …Biases vary by season and by region of the ice sheet: in the ablation region (demarcated here by the 1500 m elevation contour) during summer, most reanalyses have a ~1°C positive bias (though 20CR and ERA–20C have negative biases) while CRU and Berkeley Earth gridded SAT analyses have larger positive biases.”

 

Before It Was Ignored, The Scientific ‘Consensus’ Was That Explosive Warming Occurred Prior To The 1940s

At the time, there wasn’t any disagreement among geologists.  The late 19th century to early 1940s was considered a period of unprecedented warming.  The highest temperatures on record.
The Arctic winter warmed by 7.7°C.  Antarctica warmed by nearly 3°C.  Sea levels rose at a clip of 8 mm/yr in the Atlantic.  Glaciers melted “catastrophically”. Dozens of animal species migrated north to escape the warmth.  Crops could be grown in regions where they hadn’t before.
At the time, this was the climate truth.   Below is a summary of accepted climatic trends as they existed in 1959, compiled by Princeton geologist Dr. Erling Dorf.

Dorf, 1959:  “CLIMATIC CHANGES OF THE PAST AND PRESENT”

•A 14°F (+7.7°C) winter mean warming in the Arctic (North Pole region) between the early 1900s and 1950, with ice-free ports 7 months out of the year rather than the mere 3 months per year that were common at the turn of the century.
“It has been observed, however, that the greatest temperature increases during the last hundred years have been in the Arctic regions. In Spitsbergen, only about 10 to 12 degrees from the North Pole, the mean winter temperatures have risen about 14° F. since 1910 (Willett, 1950). Ice-free ports there are now open to navigation about 7 months of the year as compared with only 3 months fifty years ago (Ahlmann, 1953, p. 32). If the warming trend of the north polar region should continue at its present rate, it has been estimated that the entire Arctic Ocean would be navigable all year long within about a hundred years.”
•A 5°F (+2.8°C) warming in Antarctica since the early 1900s.
“At the opposite end of the world, according to recent reports from the Weather Bureau (Wexler, 1958), the Antarctic region has undergone a rise of about 5°F. in average temperature in the last fifty years.”
•“Catastrophic” and “violent” wasting away of glaciers since 1900, with Muir Glacier retreating 2 miles (3.2 km) in 10 years.  The retreat began in the 1700s, with severe wasting between the 1920s and 1940s.
“What have been some of the notable results of this warming trend during the last hundred years? Glaciers throughout the world have been melting away at a rapidly increasing rate. Brooks (1949, p. 24). the eminent British paleoclimatologist, stated that “Since the beginning of the 20th Century glaciers have been wasting away rapidly, or even catastrophically.” In the Juneau region of Alaska, all but one of the numerous glaciers began melting away as far back as 1765. Muir Glacier, for example, has retreated as much as two miles in 10 years. Baird and Sharp (1954, p. 143) have referred to the “alarming retreat of glaciers” in the Alaskan region; along the Pacific Coast of North America and in Europe they believe the glacial melting “appears to be progressing violently.”   In only a few regions of the world, such as the Pacific Northwest, are there any records of glaciers advancing during the past century, and these have been mostly since 1950 (Hubley, 1956).”


Ahlmann, 1953
•Due especially to the massive glacier-melting during the 1920s to 1940s, there was as much as a 6-inch (15 cm) rise in sea level between 1930 and 1948, a rate of about 32 inches (+80 cm) per century, or 8 mm per year, which is 5 times the overall rate of rise for the entire 1901-2010 period (1.7 mm/yr) according to the IPCC (2013) and a “six-fold” increase relative to the 19th century rate.
“Believed in large part to be the result of the melting of the world’s glaciers, sea level has been rising at a rapidly increasing rate, amounting to as much as a 6-inch rise from 1930 to 1948 (Marmar, 1948). This is about four times the average rate of sea level rise during the past 9000 years [~2 mm/yr], as recorded by Shepard and Suess (1956). It should be noted that more than a six-fold increase in the rate of sea level rise occurred in the mid-1920’s at the same time there was a striking change in the rate of glacial melting in the north (Ahlmann, 1953, Fig. 11).”

•Agricultural crop lines shifted 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) northward, with 10-day longer growing seasons.  Tree lines moved 65 feet (20 meters) up the mountains in Sweden.
“Changes in vegetation brought about by the warmer temperatures include the encroachment of trees into the subpolar tundra as recorded in Alaska, Quebec, Laborador, and Siberia. In the Canadian prairies the agricultural crop line has shifted from 50 to 100 miles northward as a result of the lengthening of the growing season by as much as ten days. In parts of northern New England and eastern Canada the birch trees have been dying off over large areas, and the spruces and balsams have begun to suffer as a result of the rise in summer temperatures. In Sweden the timberline has moved up the mountain slopes as much as 65 feet since 1930 (Ahlmann, 1953, p. 35).”
•Many birds and mammals extended their habitats northwards; about 25 species of birds advanced from the south up into a warmer   Greenland; codfish replaced seals along the coasts of Greenland, which led “Greenland Eskimos” to switch to cod-fishing rather than seal-hunting.
“In the animal world many southern types of both birds and mammals have been extending their habitat ranges northward as a result of the warming trend. The cardinal, the turkey vulture, the tufted titmouse, and the blue-winged warbler, as well as the warmth-loving opossum, have slowly moved their ranges into the northern United States. A good many central European species of animals have been shifting their ranges northward into Scandinavia, Greenland, Iceland, and the Faero Islands. Twenty-five species of birds alone are reported to have invaded Greenland from the south since 1918 (Jensen and Fristrup, 1950). Codfish from the Atlantic have replaced the seals in the waters along the coast of Greenland. It is reported that compared to a shipment of 5 tons of codfish from Greenland in 1913, the 1946 shipment had risen to over 13,000 tons; the Greenland Eskimos have become cod fishermen instead of seal fishermen (Kimble, 1950). Farther south tunafish have moved northward into the waters off New England, and tropical flying fishes have become increasingly common off the coast of New Jersey.”

The ‘Truth’ About Past Climates…Is What We Want It To Be


But the truth about the climate as it existed in the 1950s is no longer accepted or acceptable.  And that version of the truth is to be ignored.  Why?  Because if we accept that dramatic and rapid warming (and glacier melt and sea level rise) could occur while anthropogenic CO2 emissions were flat and rather negligible (prior to the 1940s), then we would have to acknowledge that modern climate changes may not be predominantly influenced by human activity.  And that couldn’t be the truth.  So . . . it isn’t.
And 2016 was the Earth’s hottest year on record.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClaims that the earth is rapidly heating up because of man-made CO2 and thus heading for a “climate catastrophe” have taken a serious body blow over the past three years as a huge and fresh body of science emerges.

More than 1000 peer-reviewed papers published over the last 3 years expose climate alarmism as fake science.
1000 papers in three years
Yesterday Kenneth Richard published his list of 500 climate catastrophe skeptic papers appearing in scientific journals in 2016 alone. It is the latest addition to the 282 papers published in 2015, and the 248 papers published in 2014, bringing the total number of peer-reviewed papers published over the past three years to more than 1000.
As a result the once many dramatic hockey-stick shaped curves put out by some climate scientists over the past two decades showing the earth is headed for disaster have been exposed as fake science, which of course had spawned some 20 years of nonstop fake news – much of it designed to spread panic among the population.
Needlessly hyped
According to Richard, the vast collection of fresh papers show that natural factors play a much larger if not a dominant role when it comes to climate change. The expected global warming has been needlessly hyped, experts are now saying.
Puts IPCC to shame
Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Willie Soon thinks the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has strayed way off track. “I’m not surprised by the large number or empirical evidence that rejects the CO2 dangerous global warming alarmism,” wrote Soon in an e-mail. “This sort of literature review ought to put the sort of biased, if not anti-science, reports by the UN IPCC to shame.”

Dr. Soon has long been a sharp critic of the mainstream institutionalized climate science. He added: “It is high time for the wider public to not only bear witness to the unbalance and corruption of our science institutions, but also to demand answers on why there has been such a disregard for truth and fact.”
Climate well within natural variability
Many among the 1000 peer-reviewed scholarly papers show that extreme weather events are in fact NOT increasing in any unusual manner, that they were also common in the past, and that today they are still well within the range of natural variability.
Other papers show that biodiversity is not under any serious threat. Hundreds of other papers have found that solar activity and oceanic cycles are in fact the driving factors behind climate change. In short the latest fresh batch of scientific literature is telling us that all the past alarmism likely has been needlessly shrill and that it’s time to take a step back and to seriously refocus.
Although most of the papers listed by Richard do not refute global warming and that man plays a role – they do cast undeniable doubt over the cause of the warming, especially the warming over the past 35 years. The recent literature clearly shows that natural factors indeed play a major role, and CO2 much less so.
Climate science a UN charade
Not mincing any words, Canadian climatologist Dr. Tim Ball feels that global warming became a charade years ago and that it has gone on too long.
He offers an even harsher assessment of the UN climate science, writing that the IPCC is made up of “bureaucrats” who harbor a political agenda. “Extreme bias of climate research was deliberately created through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to prove rather than disprove the hypothesis that human CO2 was causing runaway global warming,” he wrote to NTZ in an email.  “The political message and funding were directed to only research that proved their hypothesis. Only journals that favored the objective were used and encouraged, so the preponderance of research and publications supported the predetermined message. It is a classic case of Lysenkoism”
Dr. Ball authored the climate science critical book: Human Caused Global warming – The Biggest Deception in History.

"Last week, as Paris faced down its hottest day since records began, the city authorities declared their readiness. Since the notorious heatwave of 2003 that killed thousands across France, the capital has put in place a heat strategy: cooling areas, a checking system for vulnerable people, shady parks kept open all night. Could these strategies actually work against a predicted record temperature of 42C (107.6F)? A study released this week shows that the world has never warmed faster than now. By 2050, the average temperature in the hottest month in Paris will rise by six degrees. This heatwave might be the new normal. I take my dog for a quick morning walk before the pavement becomes too hot for his paws Now that the heat has eased across Europe, it seems like time for some cool reflection on how effective the official advice actually was. Here’s what happened when I followed it. Temperature outside: 29CStrategy: shutter your house, spend three hours at low temperature I wake in a sweat, having managed some fitful sleep with the help of a fan during one of the hottest nights in Paris history. Now it’s time to try to keep my tiny, 100-year-old house as cool as possible. Following the advice of the health department, I close all the shutters. Then I take my fluffy dog for a quick morning walk before the pavement becomes too hot for his paws. It’s pretty hot outside now, but nothing out of the ordinary: I’m mostly cranky and tired from the high temperatures overnight. Back home, the dog gets a big bowl of cold water, and I get ready for my day. According to the Paris heatwave plan, I have a plan to spend three hours at low temperatures to avoid adverse health consequences, and I’m prepared with other recommendations of the French health department: I’ve made a personal extreme-heat pack with a spray bottle to mist myself with water, a handheld thermometer and a large bottle of water. I’m ready. Temperature outside: 34CStrategy: spend time in air conditioning The temperature outside my front door has improbably climbed by five degrees in the last hour alone. The city is already uncomfortable: the narrow pavements and heavy traffic make it feel even hotter than 34C. There’s nowhere to hide from the exhaust fumes and the already fierce sun. The official advice is to find air conditioning, so I walk to a nearby hotel. I’m already sweating when I arrive, but as soon as I step into reception my body temperature plunges uncomfortably. I’m also supposed to “eat in sufficient quantities”, which I’m interpreting to mean a buffet spread designed for hungry tourists and involving a lot of cheese. I look around at all the guests. They all passed a blissful night sleeping in 18C. They look refreshed, at ease, unflustered. One woman is wearing a scarf. I hate them. Temperature: 38CStrategy: use the Extrema app to seek out ‘cool islands’; avoid too much walking If 34C was uncomfortable, 38C is nasty. As the heat rises from the bitumen, I fire up the city’s dedicated heatwave app, Extrema, which identifies 922 “islands of cool”. The first place it recommends is a library: presumably air-conditioned, unfortunately closed. The next suggestion is a nearby church, the Église Saint-Germain-de-Charonne, which is deliciously cool – but a small mass is being held, and I feel like an intruder, so I pop out to the adjoining cemetery. Here, the heat radiates off the polished gravestones in waves: it’s worse than the street. I drink from a fountain, but the water comes out piping hot. I had heard there was a water mister nearby, so I set out to find it, but fail. Extrema confirms it was only installed for two days. Tramping around has driven my body temperature straight back up. The health department’s advice is to avoid physical exertion, such as walking long distances. I take the bus to a park. Temperature: 41CStrategy: use a heat map to find green spaces I’ve made a huge mistake. The bus is stifling, airless. My handheld thermometer has maxed out at 43C. I see pedestrians in the burning sunlight and I am jealous of them. There’s an eerie hush as small family groups take refuge in the shade Much of the transport system in Paris can be rendered unusable during heatwaves, with metro lines also regularly reaching dangerous temperatures. But 65% of Parisians do not own a car and have little option other than to endure it. I start to regret every decision I have made in life that led me to this bus. Collapsing out at the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, I expect some relief, but temperatures outside have now officially broken the previous record, from 1947, of 40.4C. The Buttes-Chaumont is one of the city’s largest parks, with waterfalls, sloping lawns and shady grottoes. Since 2015, it has been open 24 hours a day in summer. Over half of it is covered with more than 100 enormous old trees, making it one of the coolest places in Paris, according to the heat map. But 41C is 41C. There’s an eerie hush as small family groups and the odd shirtless or bikini-clad individual take refuge in the shade. Temperature: 42CStrategy: use town hall ‘refreshment rooms’; check in on loved ones After the 2003 heatwave, Paris set up the Chalex service, which allows vulnerable people to receive telephone check-ups during extreme heat. The worst sufferers can be brought to a refreshment room at their local town hall. In the 19th arrondissement, that’s an air-conditioned meeting room: it’s cool enough inside, but the portable air-conditioner is beginning to struggle against 42C. Emerging again into the blasting heat, I follow another of the health department’s rules: check in on your loved ones. In my case, that means texting my partner to ask how the dog is doing. The dog is lying in front of a fan, his fur gently ruffling. The dog is doing much better than me. I’m still radiating heat, primarily it seems from my face. But I’m also lucky that my loved ones are a young man and a resilient street dog. Elderly relatives, or people with reduced mobility who can’t necessarily make it to cooler spaces on their own, need human connection even more urgently in heat crises. Temperature: 42CAdvice: help the vulnerable In any city, heatwaves are hardest for those who lack shelter. For the hottest part of the day, I join a walking group of city officials and volunteers seeking out women who are living on the streets. The group provides hygiene kits and offers to take the women to cooler spaces. Leading the charge is Dominique Versini, one of the city’s deputy mayors. I know I will live, best case, to see these problems get much worse. I feel a kind of existential dread Versini says the heatwave presents serious problems for all homeless people, but particularly women, who are “in twice as much danger”. Exposed to high levels of violence on the streets and often dealing with trauma, she says, many are afraid to access services such as refreshment rooms and public baths where they could cool off. The temperature hits its all-time maximum: 42.6C. The 18th is one of the densest parts of the city, and the photographer and I are struggling. My body is burning up, and now my anxiety is also rising sharply. I know this heatwave has almost certainly been caused by the human-created climate crisis. Greenhouse emissions are on track to reach a record high. I know I will live, best case, to see these problems get much worse. I feel a kind of existential dread. My muscles are starting to get sore. We duck into a supermarket and I end up caressing my face with a range of chilled goods. Orange juice is pretty good but a glass jar of foie gras works best. Temperature: 42.6CAdvice: swim in the canal On a normal day, I harbour no desire to jump into the Bassin de la Villette. I have seen the bikes, shopping trolleys and electric scooters being fished out of there, coated in muck. There are rumours of a crocodile. But the outdoor pool alongside it, which is full of filtered canal water, has been in use since 2017 as part of a plan by the mayor, Anne Hidalgo, to make public waterways such as the Seine swimmable in time for the 2024 Olympics. Anyway, at this stage I would happily leap into a Siberian toxic dump-lake if I thought it would cool me down. Unfortunately there’s a monstrous queue to get in, leaving would-be bathers baking along the pavement. Some have given up and are diving into the open canal. Everyone seems fine with this. I eventually make it to the pool, and lower myself with a sound I didn’t know I was capable of: something between a whimper of fear and a groan of satisfaction. The water is a toasty 25.5C, and oddly slimy, but swimming feels incredible. I’m smiling for the first time in more than 24 hours. I try to avoid thinking about how much canal water I’m ingesting, and that E coli scare from a couple of years ago. Temperature: 41CAdvice: douse yourself in cold water The effects of the pool wear off more or less as soon as I get out of the water and cross a bridge over the canal in full sun. On the other side, Paris Plage – a sandless beach along the banks of the canal and the Seine, set out with deckchairs, bars and summer games – is a muted affair, with most activities shut down because of the heat. A few people languidly dangle their feet in the water. But at the end of the canal, sweet relief. The city authorities have set up a temporary fountain that spouts water out of the top, not just from the taps below. I drench myself through. This is proper cold water, some of the first I’ve encountered today. It is extremely refreshing. I happily drip home on the metro. Temperature: 38CAdvice: avoid alcohol I am too traumatised to cook without air conditioning, so I head back to the same restaurant. The good news is that between breakfast, dinner and the refreshment room today, I have accumulated my required three hours at low temperatures. The bad news is the health department says I shouldn’t drink alcohol during a heatwave, and I could really use a beer. I’m acutely aware that I’m healthy, and have some freedom and control over my movements. Many Parisians don’t Rules are rules, so I stick with a carafe of water. It proves to be a bad choice: a beer would have at least been cold, while this tap water is somehow hotter than room temperature. I was starving but I can now only manage half of my meal, so I wander home to flop on the couch. It’s hot in my living room, but the shutters seem to have fended off the worst. Temperature: 33CAdvice: go to a 24-hour park At midnight, it still hasn’t cooled down enough to sleep. At a mere 33C outside I reckon it’s fine to walk the dog, so off we go towards the Square Sergent Aurélie Salel, one of 13 parks open all night in summer. We pass half an hour there, with a clutch of other overheated young Parisians who are smoking half-heartedly beneath a tree, before turning back home. Jammed between two fans, I grab what sleep I can, but I don’t fully relax until 11am the next day when a thunderstorm breaks the spell. I’m also acutely aware that I’m healthy and have some freedom and control over my movements. Many Parisians don’t: they have to move around the city according to their daily schedules, no matter the temperature. Some have no choice but to be outside all day during a heatwave. With its apps, cool spots and check-in services, the City of Paris is doing a lot to help them, but if my day taught me anything it’s that reality seems to be catching up with what research has long been telling us. The effects of rapid climate change are already here – and we are not ready.

"When Senator Kamala Harris was asked about climate change during the Democratic debate in June, she did not mince words. “I don’t even call it climate change,” she said. “It’s a climate crisis.” She’s right – and we, at Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness, wish more people would call this crisis what it is.  The language we use to refer to the climate crisis has changed over time, often due to political pressures. In 1975, the geophysicist Wallace S Broecker published the first major paper on planetary heating – Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming? – and for a while the term “global warming” was the most common. But in the decades following, politicians and members of the media began to use the softer, more euphemistic term “climate change” to describe changing weather and atmospheric conditions. That wasn’t an accident. In the early years of George W Bush’s first term as presidency, scientists were actually making serious progress in establishing overwhelming evidence that we were, in fact, facing a global crisis. Public opinion on climate change was shifting; Americans were curious about how worried they should be by the damage being done to our atmosphere. Enter Frank Luntz, a renowned Republican pollster and strategist. Luntz was concerned that the Republican party was losing the communications battle. He advised Republicans to cast doubt on scientific consensus on the dangers of greenhouse gases and to publicly hammer home a message of uncertainty. In 2002, Luntz wrote a memo to Bush urging him and the rest of his party to use the term “climate change” instead of “global warming”. Climate change sounded “less frightening”, he pointed out, “like you’re going from Pittsburgh to Fort Lauderdale”. Luntz succeeded. “Climate change” began to eclipse “global warming” in the American vernacular, downplaying its menacing predecessor. Technically, the term climate change makes sense. The climate is, indeed, changing. But the term is far too mild to describe the existential threat to the planet that these changes pose. Jeffrey Sachs, former director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, agrees. “We should have a term that emphasizes the incredible cost and dangers,” he told us. “We do not need to be shy about this.” Under the administration of Donald Trump, the situation is even worse. Now, instead of re-framing language about the climate crisis, Republican officials simply remove references to it entirely and put pressure on researchers and analysts who disagree. It is time to update the language we use to better reflect the seriousness of global heating. “People do not understand the scale and pace of the climate emergency,” Jamie Henn, strategy and communications director for 350.org, an international climate campaign, told us. “This is not an issue with one future date where we will start to see effects. We may hit tipping points at any time in which we will see immediate problems.” There is no longer any doubt that climate change is an unprecedented planetary emergency. And the terms we use to describe this crisis must deliberately reflect an appropriate sense of urgency. The good news is that there is already some movement in this direction. Scientists, political leaders and the media have finally begun to abandon climate “change” in favor of “crisis” or “emergency”. This summer, The Guardian updated its style guide to designate “climate emergency, crisis, or breakdown” or “global heating” as better descriptors. We applaud that decision and we hope that more journalists, politicians, and intellectual leaders will follow suit. The question is, in the current political climate, will the upgraded terminology result in definitive action? We hope so. Caleb Redlener is an undergraduate studying public policy and communications at the Ohio State University and a summer intern at Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness Charlotte Jenkins is a master’s of public health candidate at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia and a graduate research assistant at Columbia’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness Irwin Redlener directs Columbia’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness and is a professor at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia"

Climate science is supposed to be settled, right?
We are told that there is an overwhelming agreement, or consensus, among scientists that most weather and climate changes that have occurred since the mid-20th century have been caused by human activity — our fossil fuel burning and CO2 emissions in particular.  We are told that natural mechanisms that used to dominate are no longer exerting much of any influence on weather or climate anymore.  Humans predominantly cause weather and climate changes now.
For example, we are told that extreme weather (hurricanes, droughts, floods, storms) frequencies and intensities have increased since about 1950 primarily due to the dramatic rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions since then.  Humans are now melting glaciers and ice sheets and (Arctic) sea ice at an alarmingly accelerated rate — reminiscent of an impending “death spiral“.  Humans now  heat up and acidify the oceans down to depths of thousands of meters by burning fossil fuels.   Humans are now in the process of raising sea levels so that they will catastrophically rise by 10 feet in the next 50 years.   Because of our CO2 emissions, humans are now endangering the long-term survival of 100s of thousands of animal species (especially polar bears), and climate models say we will cause a million species extinctions over the next 33 years with our CO2 emissions.   The Earth is even spinning slower, or faster, no, slower, well, faster — due to human activities.  Again, this is all settled science.  Only those who possess the temerity to deny this science (“climate deniers”) would disagree, or refuse to believe.
But what if much of what we have been told to believe is not actually true?   What if scientists do not overwhelmingly agree that humans have dominated (with ~110% attribution) weather and climate changes since about 1950, which is what we have been told by the UN IPCC?   What if scientists do not overwhelmingly agree that natural factors exert effectively no influence on weather and climate changes anymore — now that humans have taken over?

These are compelling questions.  Because in 2016 alone, 500 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in scholarly journals seriously question just how settled the “consensus” science really is that says anthropogenic or CO2 forcing now dominates weather and climate changes, and non-anthropogenic (natural) factors no longer exert much, if any, role.
Instead of supporting the “consensus” science one must believe in (to avoid the “climate denier” label), these 500 papers support the position that there are significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in climate modeling and the predictions of future climate catastrophes associated with anthropogenic forcing.  Furthermore, these scientific papers strongly suggest that natural factors (the Sun, multi-decadal oceanic oscillations [NAO, AMO/PDO, ENSO], cloud and aerosol albedo variations, etc.) have both in the past and present exerted a significant or dominant influence on weather and climate changes, which means an anthropogenic signal may be much more difficult to detect in the context of such large natural variability.  Papers questioning (and undermining) the “consensus” view on paleoclimate (Medieval) warmth, ocean acidification, glacier melt and advance, sea level rise, extreme weather events, past climate forcing mechanisms, climate sensitivity to CO2, etc., are included in this collection.
Because of the enormous volume of new papers available that support a skeptical position on anthropogenic climate change alarm, the list of 500 scientific papers with links has been divided into 3 sections, each with its own page (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3).   There are 68 graphs included in the volume, most of which are used to demonstrate that “hockey-stick” reconstructions of past temperatures and sea levels relative to today are not supported by available evidence.
Despite its size, this list will hopefully be user-friendly and easy to navigate as a bookmarkable reference volume due to its outline (below) and organized categorization.  Each paper has an embedded link under the authors’ name(s).
Finally, there are 132 papers linking solar activity to weather and climate change (in addition to another ~90 that link natural oceanic/atmospheric oscillations [ENSO, NAO, etc.], clouds, volcanic activity . . . to climate change).  This is of special note because the IPCC has, since its inception, insisted that solar factors play almost no role in modern climate change.  Apparently scientists agree less and less with that “consensus” position.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhether Hillary wins or not, things are looking grimmer and grimmer for the Democratic Party with each passing day. The Hillary organization is now taking four major blows, simultaneously, and likely will shatter the Clinton backbone to pieces.

Four of Clinton’s biggest nightmares: Jonathan Gruber (Photo: MIT); Julian Assange (Photo: Free Assange); James Comey (Photo: FBI); James O’Keefe (Photo: Project Veritas). Also add a relentless Trey Gowdy to the mix. 
The Democrats would be doing the country a huge and honorable favor in withdrawing the Clinton candidacy – or making sure she does not get elected. This would spare the nation a great crisis. Some even warn of a Constitutional crisis.
The four back-breaking body blows:
1. Skyrocketing Obamacare costs
The runaway costs of healthcare insurance are turning into a grand debacle, one that will plague and enrage Americans for months to come. Nationwide Americans are bracing for an average 25% increase in healthcare premiums starting next year. The authors of this debacle: Obama, Clinton and the Democrats. The upward spiral is only the beginning.
2. Wikileaks
The whiz hackers behind these “illegal” leaks will wear down the Clintons for many more months. The e-mail exchanges expose the inner workings and shady dealings of the Clinton circle. You can view The Top 100 most damaging Wikileaks emails – so far – hat-tip Andrew Bolt.

Wikileak dump number 25 just occurred, and very few of us know how many more are on the way and what’s potentially in store. This alone will be a slow political death by a thousand paper cuts for the Clintons. Clinton’s problems are only beginning.
3. FBI reopened investigation
Right now the 650,000 e-mails discovered on the device of sex pervert (ex-husband of Clinton top aide Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner, are likely only the tip of the iceberg.
Moreover, one senses there’s a real desperation to keep the e-mails concealed, and that the dam of corruption is about to break. This is a classic situation where when one digs deeper, the more one finds massive rot. Therefore Hillary’s troubles risk growing exponentially. And not only is the scandal reaching the very top levels of the US government, it has the potential of expanding internationally and ensnaring the UN, foreign governments and institutions. And once key players start feeling the heat, they’ll start ratting each other out and cause the dominoes to fall uncontrollably.
One thing is already clear: Clinton illegally managed confidential e-mails, lied to the FBI, and obstructed justice. The rest is just more icing. She is a lawbreaker no matter how you look at it.
4. Project Veritas revelations
The hidden cameras of James O’Keefe reveal voter fraud, intimidation and corruption within Democratic Party. The sleaze uncovered by James O’Keefe only further tarnishes whatever may be left of Clinton’s reputation.
We’re looking at many months, even years, of corruption-caused chaos and scandals. The only hope that the Democrats might overcome the tsunami may be to boldly implement a massive crackdown of the sort are now witnessing in Turkey. That’s a hugely tall order. We wish Hillary and the Democrats lots of luck with that, should they decide to go for it.

Insidious preindustrial warm phase: 4000 years ago glaciers in Norway had  almost completely melted away
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The University of Bergen in Norway reported 14 February 2017 on the climate in Norway 4000 years ago, when in the summertime it was on average two to three degrees warmer than today. Most glaciers in the country at the time had almost completely melted away and gone. Instead of examining these what for many are unexpected warm phases, the team of authors in the press release chose to focus the public’s attention on concern and fear for the future.
And this time – for sure – the glaciers are never coming back again, even though they did so after the last warm phase. Instead the scientists worry about the hydropower business. No glacier, no hydro-power. What follows is the press release:
Norwegian ice cap ‘exceptionally sensitive’ to climate change

How will future climate change affect our glaciers? By looking into the past 4000 years, a new study lead by Henning Åkesson at the Bjerknes Centre finds an ice cap in southern Norway to be ‘exceptionally sensitive’ to climate change.

The team of researchers from the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research, the Netherlands and the US took a glance into the past to understand how the ice cap Hardangerjøkulen in southern Norway responds to climate change. The authors simulated the history of the ice cap over the last 4000 years, from a period called the mid-Holocene, when summer temperature at high northern latitudes were two to three degrees warmer than today. Most if not all glaciers in Norway melted away during this period, Hardangerjøkulen included. 
Henning Åkesson, a PhD candidate at the Bjerknes Centre and University of Bergen, used a glacier computer model developed at NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory and University of California, Irvine to simulate Hardangerjøkulen’s history. To inform model simulations, he used information on past climates and glacier variations from lake sediments receiving meltwater from the ice cap.
Contest between snow and snowmelt
“Present day Hardangerjøkulen is in a very vulnerable state, and our study of its history over the last several thousand years shows that the ice cap may change drastically in response to relatively minor changes in climate conditions”, says Åkesson. Every year, snow covers a glacier in winter, and melts away to a varying extent the following summer. At a certain altitude on the glacier, the competition between snow accumulation and snowmelt is balanced; glaciologists call this the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA). “What is special with Hardangerjøkulen and other similar ice caps”, Åkesson explains, “is their flat topography. Anyone skiing up Hardangerjøkulen to celebrate Norway’s national day on May 17th can testify; first it’s steep, but once you’re higher up things get a lot easier.”
A large part of Hardangerjøkulen’s area is close to the present ELA. This means that a small change in the competition between winter snow and summer melt will affect a very large part of the ice cap. Åkesson says “the topography and present climate is such that we soon expect yearly net melt over the entire ice cap. This has already happened a few times in recent years. In the near future we expect this to occur much more often, and with this, the demise of Hardangerjøkulen will accelerate.”  “Today the ice is more than 300 m thick at places, which may sound like a lot. But the implication of our study is that if climate warming continues, this ice cap may disappear before the end of this century. I don’t think most people realize how fast glaciers can change, maybe not even us as scientists,” says Åkesson.

Hydropower from glacier meltwater
“The economic and cultural implications of disappearing glaciers in Norway are considerable for tourism, natural heritage and the hydropower industry”, Kerim Hestnes Nisancioglu at the Bjerknes Centre, co-author of the study, adds. Practically all of Norway’s electricity is generated from hydropower, of which 15 % depend on glacier meltwater. “The hydropower industry needs to plan for these changes, and we need to work together to find out how fast this transition will happen”, Nisancioglu says. What is more, “if Hardangerjøkulen melts away completely, it would not be able to grow back again given today’s climate”, Åkesson concludes. The study was published in the open-access journal The Cryosphere on January 27th. Read the full study here.

What happened on the sun 7000 years ago?
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt

(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
At the end of January 2017 a team of scientists led by Fusa Miyake described in PNAS an unexpected solar event on the sun that ended up being registered in 7000 year old tree rings. What follows is the press release from Nagoya University:
What Happened to the Sun over 7,000 Years Ago? Analysis of tree rings reveals highly abnormal solar activity in the mid-Holocene
An international team led by researchers at Nagoya University, along with US and Swiss colleagues, has identified a new type of solar event and dated it to the year 5480 BC; they did this by measuring carbon-14 levels in tree rings, which reflect the effects of cosmic radiation on the atmosphere at the time. They have also proposed causes of this event, thereby extending knowledge of how the sun behaves.
When the activity of the sun changes, it has direct effects on the earth. For example, when the sun is relatively inactive, the amount of a type of carbon called carbon-14 increases in the earth’s atmosphere. Because carbon in the air is absorbed by trees, carbon-14 levels in tree rings actually reflect solar activity and unusual solar events in the past. The team took advantage of such a phenomenon by analyzing a specimen from a bristlecone pine tree, a species that can live for thousands of years, to look back deep into the history of the sun.
“We measured the 14C levels in the pine sample at three different laboratories in Japan, the US, and Switzerland, to ensure the reliability of our results,” A. J. Timothy Jull of the University of Arizona says. “We found a change in 14C that was more abrupt than any found previously, except for cosmic ray events in AD 775 and AD 994, and our use of annual data rather than data for each decade allowed us to pinpoint exactly when this occurred.”
The team attempted to develop an explanation for the anomalous solar activity data by comparing the features of the 14C change with those of other solar events known to have occurred over the last couple of millennia. “Although this newly discovered event is more dramatic than others found to date, comparisons of the 14C data among them can help us to work out what happened to the sun at this time,” Fusa Miyake of Nagoya University says. She adds, “We think that a change in the magnetic activity of the sun along with a series of strong solar bursts, or a very weak sun, may have caused the unusual tree ring data.” Although the poor understanding of the mechanisms behind unusual solar activity has hampered efforts to definitively explain the team’s findings, they hope that additional studies, such as telescopic findings of flares given off by other sun-like stars, could lead to an accurate explanation.
The article “Large 14C excursion in 5480 BC indicates an abnormal sun in the mid-Holocene” was published in PNAS at: www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1613144114.”
Could this solar event also have left climatic traces?

Modern Rates During The Mid-Holocene

Annotated graph from Rosenthal et al. (2013) illustrating the steep amplitude of natural variations in ocean heat
It has long been acknowledged by scientists that significant changes in deep ocean heat content have occurred in the past in the absence of changes or forcing from CO2.  Stott et al. (2007), for example, conclude that deep ocean temperatures rose by 2°C within a 2,000-year time span (19,000 to 17,000 years ago) about a 1,000 years before CO2 concentrations (and surface temperatures) began to rise.
Stott et al., 2007

Deep sea temperatures warmed by ~2C between 19 and 17 ka B.P., leading the rise in atmospheric CO2 and tropical surface ocean warming by ~1000 years.

Similarly,  Demezhko and Gornostaeva (2015) found that the heat energy change in the deep oceans during the climate transition from the last ice age to this current interglacial occurred “2-3 thousands of years” before the increases in surface temperature and CO2, and that “the increase of carbon dioxide may be a consequence [rather than a cause] of temperature increasing”.  The authors then acknowledge that this suggests that there was “no significant contribution of CO2 forcing to climatically caused heat flux and thus to the temperature increase during the Pleistocene-Holocene warming”.
Demezhko and Gornostaeva, 2015

Despite the substantial dispersion of CO2 estimations, a character and a chronology of CO2 concentration changes are much closer to temperature changes rather than to heat flux variations. It may mean no significant contribution of CO2 forcing to climatically caused heat flux and thus to the temperature increase during Pleistocene–Holocene warming. About 10 kyr BP the increase of carbon dioxide concentration was replaced by its fall which ended about 8 kyr BP. This local minimum [in CO2 concentration] is not consistent with either GST [ground surface temperature] or SHF [surface heat flux] histories.  … The reconstructed surface heat flux reflects impact of all possible sources of radiative forcing. In addition to solar insolation, greenhouse gases (such as CO2) can be a source of additional forcing. On the other hand the increase of carbon dioxide may be a consequence of temperature increasing. Comparing the chronology of surface flux, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration changes, we can draw some conclusions about the causes of climate change. …  The increase of carbon dioxide concentrations occurred 2–3 thousands of years later than the heat flux increase and synchronously with temperature response. 

Scientists Ellis and Palmer (2016) get right to the point and conclude CO2 plays “little or no” role in forcing the warming during interglacial periods…

Conclusion: [I]nterglacial warming is eccentricity and polar ice regrowth regulated, Great Summer forced, and dust-ice albedo amplified. And the greenhouse-gas attributes of CO2 play little or no part in this complex feedback system.

….while scientists Douglass and Knox (2014) identify the source of modern deep ocean temperature forcing that has an “unquestionably solar origin” manifested by El Niño/La Niña phenomena.

Global ocean temperature time series from the surface to depths of 2000 m since the year 2000 are found to agree in detail with those of other diverse climate indices. It is asserted that these systems are driven by a forcing unquestionably of solar origin that has two manifestations: (1) a direct phase-locked response to what is identified as a solar forcing at a frequency of 1.0 cycle/yr for the whole time series; (2) a second phase-locked response at a period of two years or three years. With these findings it is becoming clear that the entire climate system is responding to the varying incident solar radiation… The most prominent manifestations of the pattern are found in the El Niño/La Niña phenomena.

Advocates of the assumption that CO2 variations are a primary cause of changes in deep ocean heat content (i.e., those who author government-sponsored IPCC reports and activists for the anthropogenic global warming cause) have necessarily believed that past natural variations in deep ocean heat content are very slow and gradual.  They have presumed that the forcing from Milankovitch cycles (changes in solar radiation absorbed by the Earth’s surface due to orbital variations) are the cause of deep ocean changes over time, but that these changes occur only as slowly as orbital variations occur — on millennial scales (“several thousand years“), not in decades to centuries.  In this way, they can deny that the Sun plays a role in modern climate changes…despite burgeoning evidence to the contrary.  The Stott et al. (2007) finding that deep oceans warmed at a rate of 1°C/1,000 years referenced above would be consistent with these assumptions.

Brown University geologist Samantha Bova and her colleagues reach a different conclusion, however, in a paper just published online for the prestigious journal Geophysical Research Letters.  These scientists have found that, in the absence of any significant CO2 concentration changes or human influence during the Holocene (i.e., the last ~10,000 years), the deep oceans naturally warmed by more than 2°C in a span of just 200 years, which is several times the rate in which they are alleged to have warmed in the last ~60 years of the supposedly dominant anthropogenic influence on climate.  In fact, Bova et al. (2016) conclude that deep ocean temperature changes for the last 200 years are apparently so negligible they are “below the detection limits”.
Bova et al., 2016
The observational record of deep-ocean variability is short, which makes it difficult to attribute the recent rise in deep ocean temperatures to anthropogenic forcing. Here, we test a new proxy – the oxygen isotopic signature of individual benthic foraminifera – to detect rapid (i.e. monthly to decadal) variations in deep ocean temperature and salinity in the sedimentary record. We apply this technique at 1000 m water depth in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific during seven 200-year Holocene intervals. Variability in foraminifer δ18O over the past 200 years is below the detection limit [a change in ocean heat cannot be detected in the past 200 years], but δ18O signatures from two mid-Holocene intervals indicate temperature swings >2 °C within 200 years.
According to the IPCC (2013), 93% of the heat energy in the climate system claimed to be due to anthropogenic global warming is found in the oceans (AR5, Chapter 3).  Levitus et al. (2012) estimate that the heat energy change (converted to temperature) amounted to an increase of just +0.09°C between 1955 and 2010 in the upper 2000 meters of the ocean, or less than one-tenth of one degree over 55 years.
Levitus et al., 2012

The World Ocean accounts for approximately 93% of the warming of the earth system that has occurred since 1955. … The heat content of the World Ocean for the 0–2000 m layer increased by 24.0 ± 1.9 × 1022 J (±2S.E.) [over 1955-2010] corresponding to a rate of 0.39 W m−2 (per unit area of the World Ocean) and a volume mean warming of 0.09°C.

Again, natural variation in ocean temperatures may reach amplitudes of + or – 1°C every 100 years without any external forcing from anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  So if 93% of the change forced by the alleged human climate influence  has only produced a temperature change of hundredths to tenths of a °C in the deep oceans since 1955, or since CO2 concentrations rose by about 75 parts per million (315 ppm in 1955 to 390 ppm in 2010), this would clearly indicate that it is extremely difficult if not effectively impossible to confidently attribute the practically imperceptible change in ocean temperature to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, or to CO2 in general.
More succinctly, if deep ocean temperatures can naturally rise by 1°C in 100 years without any change in CO2, then attributing changes in ocean temperature that are already “below the detection limit” for the last 200 years (or just ~0.1°C since 1955) to anthropogenic CO2 forcing is highly presumptuous at best.
And if 93% of the heat from “global warming” cannot be attributed to humans with any degree of confidence, then there is necessarily no such conceptualization of anthropogenic global warming that could be claimed to have been affirmed scientifically.  Effectively, if we cannot detect an anthropogenic signal in deep ocean heat data, anthropogenic global warming would necessarily be characterized as a belief, not a scientifically confirmed hypothesis.
