"A leading international climate change economist has urged Tony Abbott not to “wish away” the evidence for climate change or prevent it from being discussed at the upcoming G20 summit because of “local politics” and a “lack of courage” to confront the scientific evidence. His comments come as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] release the most rigorous synthesis of climate change science to date, making it clear that without urgent cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures will rise by more than 2 degrees.  In a commentary for the Guardian, Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change in the UK and a former World Bank chief economist, wrote that climate change action by politicians was now urgent, with lives and livelihoods at risk. “With each successive decade being warmer than the last globally, and this year shaping up to be the hottest ever recorded, the reality of climate change is undeniable, and cannot be simply wished away by politicians who lack the courage to confront the scientific evidence,” he wrote. “[It] should place enormous pressure on the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, to make it a major agenda item at the G20 summit later this month, instead of shunting it to the sidelines. The G20 summit would provide the most effective platform for world leaders to discuss transitioning to a low-carbon economy, he wrote. “Yet the local politics of a country of less than 25 million is being allowed to prevent essential strategic discussions of an issue that is of fundamental importance to the prosperity and well-being of the world’s population of 7 billion people.” The IPCC report provides evidence of the impact climate change is already having around the world through rising temperatures, shifts in extreme weather, disappearing glaciers and ice sheets, and advancing sea levels. Avoiding the worst impacts of climate change would mean staying below the threshold warming of 2 degrees, the report says, which will only be achieved if annual emissions will need to be reduced by about half by 2050 compared with 2010. “The IPCC report makes plain that further delays in tackling climate change would be dangerous, and ‘wait and see’ would be a profoundly irrational policy,” Stern wrote. “The report should be high on the agenda for the leaders of the world’s 20 most powerful nations, responsible for the majority of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, when they meet in Brisbane on 15 November.” In August, a group of medical scientists led by the Nobel laureate Prof. Peter Doherty published an open letter Abbott urging him to make climate change a G20 agenda item and reduce carbon emissions."
"Owen Paterson’s proposal to scrap the UK’s Climate Change Act is “bonkers”, “doesn’t stack up” and shows the former environment secretary does not understand the risks from global warming, according to politicians, economists, campaigners and scientists. In a lecture to be delivered on Wednesday for Lord Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation thinktank, Paterson is expected to say the legislation risks blackouts and holding back investment in shale gas.  The law, which was the first of its kind when it was passed in 2008, makes it a legal requirement for the UK to cut carbon emissions 80% on 1990 levels by 2050. Paterson, who has previously said significant global temperature rises of 1-2.5C would only be modest and who claimed he was sacked as minister to appease the “green blob”, is to call for a repeal of the act unless other countries adopt similar carbon-cutting laws. “Blind adhesion to the 2050 targets will not reduce emissions and will fail to keep the lights on. The current energy policy is a slave to flawed climate action,” his speech will say, according to the Sunday Telegraph. “It will cost £1,100bn, fail to meet the very emissions targets it is designed to meet, and will not provide the UK’s energy requirements. In the short and medium term, costs to consumers will rise dramatically, but there can only be one ultimate consequence of this policy: the lights will go out at some time in the future.” The Tory MP will also reportedly say that “instead of investing huge sums in wind power”, the UK should invest in shale gas, combined heat and power, small nuclear reactors and managing energy demand, but the 2050 target stands in the way of such technologies.  Lord Stern, author of the influential 2007 report on the economics of climate change and recent New Climate Economy report, said Paterson had failed to understand the risks posed by climate change. “Repealing the Climate Change Act now would be a perverse backward step by the UK, with the worst possible timing. It would create additional uncertainty about the direction of government policy, undermining the confidence of investors, and increasing the cost of capital for new energy infrastructure.  “Its perversity would be even greater because the costs of renewables have fallen by extraordinary amounts in recent years and there is growing medical understanding of the damage to human health from the pollution caused by fossil fuels. This is a further example of the former environment minister’s complete failure to understand the immense risks from unmanaged climate change, as documented by national academies of sciences around the world.” Baroness Worthington, one of the architects of the Climate Change Act and shadow minister in the lords for the Department of Energy and Climate Change, said Paterson’s proposal was “utterly bonkers”.  “He obviously hasn’t read it [the act], is my overall conclusion. There’s nothing in the act that tells you how to get to the [2050] target, it’s completely flexible.” She added that it was “ludicrous” to suggest there was enough support to repeal an act that was passed in 2008 with cross-party support that she called unprecedented.  “It would take a huge parliamentary debate. At the current time, when all the evidence is that climate change is getting worse and we need urgent action, I can’t see any desire to repeal this act. It’s the desire of a small group of fanatics who don’t even know what the act does.” Only four MPs, including three Conservatives, opposed the legislation when it was passed. Kevin Anderson, a climate scientist and deputy director of the Tyndall Centre, said the act should be strengthened and the timetable brought forward.  “In part I agree with Owen Paterson; his proposals on demand management and recovering waste heat from thermal power stations are to be welcomed. Moreover, we certainly need to revisit the Climate Change Act – but to significantly strengthen it in line with the science underpinning our prime minister’s international commitments on the 2C goal [of keeping average global temperature from rising above 2C].  “Policy informed by evidence demands both much tighter carbon budgets and an 80% target that is for 2030 – not 2050. Owen Paterson’s populist proposal to threaten to scrap the act if others don’t join in is far removed from that of a measured and scientifically informed government confronting difficult and dynamic issues.” Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said “a large number of the elements don’t stack up” in Paterson’s argument.  He said: “The Climate Change Act does not mandate use of renewable energy, the Coalition government has just opened its capacity market auction specifically to ensure that the lights don’t go out, bills will not rise ‘dramatically’ in the short term, and small-scale nuclear reactors are not taking off primarily because investors are not convinced of their viability. “On the other hand, his support for combined heat and power and demand management will find a lot of support among energy academics and – ironically – the green movement, who don’t want to see additional fossil-fuel-fired power stations being built if we don’t need them.” Paterson’s claim that the lights will go out because of current energy strategy is at odds with the regulator Ofgem, which says disruption to supply is not “imminent or likely”."
"The UK energy minister, Ed Davey, says that compromise is possible over plans for a goal of improving energy efficiency 30% by 2030 in a climate and energy package that EU leaders hope to agree next week. David Cameron’s government has led calls for a legally enforceable carbon cut of at least 40% in the package but balked at a sub-goal for energy use – even a non-binding one – for fear that a ban on high-powered vacuum cleaners could be used as campaigning ammunition by Ukip.  A third goal to ensure a renewable energy market share of at least 27% across Europe by 2030 has been endorsed by Davey as “a very clever compromise by the EU” because it is non-binding at a state level, meaning the UK can use other technologies such as nuclear and carbon capture and storage to meet the carbon target.  But Davey told the Guardian that he might have some flexibility on the efficiency target issue. “I don’t ever talk about red lines whether in coalition negotiations with other partners or in Europe,” he said. “It is important that we listen to others and find a way forward.” “We are strong supporters of energy efficiency,” he added. “The question is: what is the most appropriate way of doing it?” Most EU states view an energy efficiency target as the most cost-effective way of cutting dependence on Russian gas imports, while environmentalists see them as the most verifiable form of emissions reduction. On the other side, energy intensive industries such as steel and cement manufacturers oppose obligations to save energy on cost grounds, as do coal-producing states such as Poland. But the business sector is divided on the issue. The insulation firm, Knauf Insulation, sent David Cameron a letter last week threatening to divest from Europe unless a 35% energy efficiency target was agreed. The German company has already shut one Italian plant, while opening others in Malaysia and Turkey. “Right now the only thing that would lead us to view Europe as an attractive investment destination is a political commitment which signals that the EU is serious about energy efficiency,” Knauf’s CEO Tony Robson wrote.  Gene Murtagh, the CEO of construction manufacturer, Kingspan, which employs 2,500 workers in the UK also wrote to the prime minister last week, warning that “a binding 30% energy efficiency target is the very minimum needed to give me the confidence to expand Kingspan’s UK operations.” This week, another 11 businesses – including Ikea, Unilever and Philips – sent Cameron a letter calling for a robust energy savings target, as did the mayors of several British cities, including Bristol, Aberdeen and Leicester. The British position though remains for an non-bindingenergy saving target of just 25%, which the EU believes would represent a halving of current rates of progress over the next 16 years, at the same time that events in Ukraine have shot energy security up the political agenda. “If you look at central and east European countries, or at the Netherlands and others, they are having problems with too many targets that create inflexibilities for them,” Davey said. “They all want to lower emissions and share the UK’s position on an ambitious greenhouse gas reduction target but they want to do that in way that gives them flexibility. In some cases that will be by using energy efficiency, but not in all cases.” Davey added that a strong 2030 energy and climate agreement on 23 October would send a powerful political signal to the Russian premier Vladimir Putin about Europe’s energy security. “We’ve seen Russian aggression and Putin using energy as one of his strategic tools. It is a serious issue for the EU,” he said. “If we fail to reach agreement next week, we will be laughed at in Moscow. They will say: ‘They can’t even get their act together on energy. We can’t take them seriously. The EU is divided, weak and therefore vulnerable.” EU officials say that hopes of a deal emerging from a leaders’ summit on 23 October have risen with advances being made on Polish demands for more burden-sharing and financial solidarity – much of it from Germany – to help east European countries to meet the carbon target. Davey has garnered praise for leading work on this, but a Polish government official told the Guardian that a deal was far from done. “I don’t see any progress I’m afraid,” he said. “I hope that that there will be some in the coming days.” "
"The Climate Change Authority (CCA) will conduct another review of the renewable energy target (RET) before December, as the government struggles to win Senate support to wind back the scheme. The Coalition had intended to abolish the CCA, and despite the authority’s statutory obligation to review the RET, it handed the task to a three-person panel headed by self-professed climate change sceptic Dick Warburton.  That review recommended closing the large-scale RET to new entrants, effectively freezing new investment by bringing the current target of 41,000 gigawatt hours of renewable energy by 2020 to around 16,000GWh, or else linking any increase to a pick up in electricity demand. But after fierce resistance from industry and concerted criticism of that review, the federal cabinet has asked the environment minister, Greg Hunt, and the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, to try to reach a bipartisan agreement about the future of the program that would allow continued investment without fear of continued policy change. Another meeting is scheduled for this week between Hunt and Macfarlane and the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, Labor’s resources spokesman, Gary Gray, and its environment spokesman, Mark Butler. Labor has indicated it is prepared to support exempting the aluminium industry from the scheme, which would bring the 41,000 target down to around 39,000 gigawatt hours, but appears unwilling to move very far beyond that point. In a statement, the CCA said its review “will have regard to the role of the electricity sector in cost-effectively meeting the national emissions reductions goals that are in Australia’s interest, in the period to 2020 and beyond”. After the government’s successful abolition of the carbon tax it has not yet managed to legislate “Direct Action” – its proposed alternative policy to meet Australia’s 2020 emissions reduction target – and it has not yet set a post-2020 target. The review will also take into account the absence of other climate policies. “In the authority’s view, key considerations for reviewing the RET are the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (both now and in the longer term), and the critical role that a decarbonised electricity sector will play. “In the absence of alternative policies to decarbonise Australia’s electricity supply, severely curtailing the RET would risk stalling Australia’s progress, at a time when climate change science makes it clear that rapid reductions in emissions are required,” the statement said. The authority has previously recommended Australia’s 2020 target be trebled to 15%. It said its new review would draw on its previous work as well as the Warburton review. It is seeking submissions."
"European leaders were expected to strike a broad climate change pact obliging the EU as a whole to cut greenhouse gases by at least 40% by 2030. But key aspects of the deal that will form a bargaining position for global climate talks in Paris next year were left vague or voluntary, raising questions as to how the aims would be realised.  Draft proposals were given to national delegations on watermarked paper in sealed envelopes as the EU summit in Brussels started on Thursday, in an attempt to prevent leaks. The proposals pencilled in two 27% targets – for renewable energy market share and increase in energy efficiency improvement. The former would be binding only on the EU as a whole. The latter would be voluntary, although it could be raised to 30% by a review in 2020. The Brussels summit was dominated by arguments over energy savings and climate policy, with countries from Poland to Portugal pleading special circumstances and threatening to veto any breakthrough unless their demands were met. Acute divisions over the energy policy were reflected in the fact that summit “sherpas” were still meeting on Thursday afternoon to draft a deal for the leaders. David Cameron was keen to minimise any perceived loss of UK sovereignty over energy policy, for fear of further exposure to attacks from the Eurosceptic wing of his Conservative party and Ukip. The prime minister insisted that policies aimed at boosting renewables and saving electricity be voluntary for member states. “It’s important that you’ve got flexibility over your energy mix,” said a Downing Street spokeswoman. Cameron hoped to cut the energy efficiency figure to 25%, but was prepared to accept 27% as long as it was not binding on Britain. Poland, heavily dependent on coal-fired energy production, threatened to block the deal unless the costs to its economy and industry were discounted by €15bn-€20bn (£12bn-£16bn) between 2020 and 2030, under a complicated system of concessions from the EU’s carbon trading system. Concessions granted Poland will allow it to continue reaping hundreds of millions of euros in free allowances to modernise coal-fired power plants. Of eight EU nations eligible for the free allocations, Poland claimed 60% of the total up until 2019. A poll by TNS and YouGov for the online activist group Avaaz late last week found that 56% of Poles thought that EU financial support for energy should back clean energy rather than fossil fuels. “It’s scandalous,” said Julia Michalak, a spokeswoman for Climate Action Network Europe. “A continuation of free emission permits for Poland’s coal-reliant energy system would be a grave mistake. Leaders who came to Brussels to agree new historic climate goals, are actually discussing whether to hand out money to Europe’s dirtiest power plants.” Intense bilateral discussions between Cameron, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and other EU leaders over the last week tried to find ways of placating the Poles, who have kept open their option of vetoing the summit outcome. Portugal and Spain demanded a more substantial system of electricity interconnectors across the Pyrenees enabling them to market surplus renewable energy in France, which is heavily nuclear-dependent and reluctant to open its energy market to competition from the Iberian peninsula. The final draft said the interconnectors system should be expanded to be capable of carrying 15% of electricity generated in the EU, but this figure was merely a recommendation. Diplomats and officials said the Portuguese were deeply unhappy. It was not clear whether the leaders would reach an agreement. “It will be very hard negotiations,” said a senior German official. “This is just a first step,” said a French diplomat. “Then everything has to be turned into European legislation. It’s complicated.” The anticipated 40% greenhouse gas cut by 2030 would be measured against benchmark 1990 levels. That figure is to be binding on the EU and the minimum level achieved, with Germany and Britain happy to agree a higher figure. But the details of how the burden is spread across 28 countries have still to be settled, suggesting that the agreement would be simply a negotiating position for next year’s crunch talks in Paris on a global climate change deal. Tony Robson, the CEO of Knauf Insulation – a leading insulation firm that had threatened to divest from Europe unless firm energy saving targets were announced – said that the 27% figure for energy efficiency improvement was “no better than business as usual” in an open letter to EU leaders. A 27% target “sends a strong signal to the energy efficiency industry to ‘leave Europe and make your investments elsewhere’,” he wrote."

"Ukip is casting a shadow over Europe’s climate change policy, MEPs say, as David Cameron and EU leaders arrive in Brussels on Thursday to agree goals on carbon emissions and energy. The meeting on Thursday and Friday is a chance for leaders to set out their stall for action to tackle greenhouse gas emissions ahead of a global UN summit in Paris next year, where it is hoped nearly 200 countries will agree a climate pact.   But MEPs say the UK is “dancing to Ukip’s tune”, and undermining a strong goal on saving energy for fear of being seen to be pandering to the EU over rules on energy-guzzling devices, such as high-powered vacuum cleaners and inefficient light bulbs. Europe is on track to meet goals adopted in 2009 to cut emissions 20% by 2020 and have 20% of energy come from renewable sources such as wind power, but is lagging behind a third target to cut energy waste 20% by the end of the decade. The subsequent financial crash means a slower pace of climate action has been tabled for 2030 versions of the targets. Cameron’s government has made the running in calling for emissions cuts of at least 40% and up to 50% if other countries act, but it has also tried to block strong targets for renewable energy and for reducing energy use – which many experts say is the only verifiable way of ensuring that emissions have actually been cut. British opposition to EU oversight of national energy policy is long-standing but MEPs, EU commissioners and diplomats increasingly cite Ukip’s rise, and tabloid campaigns over EU measures to improve the efficiency of household items such as vacuum cleaners, as factors influencing Cameron’s thinking. “It seems to me that the Conservatives are dancing to Ukip’s tune,” the Labour MEP Seb Dance told the Guardian. “In opposing binding targets on renewables and energy efficiency, they are completely following Ukip’s lead and it is regrettable to say the least.” Green MEP Claude Turmes said: “Further watering down of the package is expected to come from the UK pushing for even lower ambition on [energy] efficiency. The EU is being taken hostage by Cameron’s internal party struggle with eurosceptics from Ukip.”  The Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder called on Cameron to build on the European coalition that she said the energy minister, Ed Davey, had taken a leadership role in constructing.  “David Cameron must not bow to Ukip pressure and try to sabotage Ed’s good work,” she said. “Any watering-down of targets would do irrevocable damage to the EU’s status as a leader in the fight against climate change in the build-up to global talks in Paris next year.” Dance said: “You just can’t push short-term party political interests on the basis of a few by-election results and some polls, to put the entire EU climate and energy policy on the back-burner . It is absolutely ridiculous, a complete abdication of responsibility and leadership on the PM’s part and I’ve no doubt that this is motivated by a fear of Ukip and the fact that so many of the PM’s party in the past secretly – and now increasingly openly – agree with Ukip’s position.” Roger Helmer, Ukip’s European parliament leader and energy spokesman, has controversially said climate change is a “myth” and that “fossil fuels are the future” of British energy policy. Following the furore over vacuum cleaners, his most recent intervention in EU parliamentary debate was to condemn what he said were plans by Brussels to regulate for more efficient electric kettles. He told the Guardian that Ukip would be campaigning on the doorstep in the next election over energy prices, an issue which the Daily Mail today linked to EU green energy policies, citing a report by the pro-free market Open Europe think tank. “In many areas we are leading Conservative party opinion because we are saying what many Conservative party members and MP’s actually believe,” he said. “Conservative backbenchers and activists are saying ‘we’re really embarrassed because Ukip has a sensible policy in this area and the Conservative party doesn’t’.” He continued: “The EU’s climate and energy policy is a disaster.It is damaging the economy and driving energy intensive business offshore, frequently to jurisdictions with lower standards. I primarily blame Brussels, but the current government has made climate policy worse than it needs to be under EU law.” Ukip’s positioning has already raised hackles in Brussels, with the EU’s energy commissioner Gunther Oettinger warning earlier this summer that campaigns against efficiency measures were being used as a proxy for stirring anti-European sentiment. “Political parties have fulminated against the Union’s efforts to reduce the energy consumption of, for example, light bulbs, vacuum cleaners and coffee machines,” Oettinger wrote in a letter to energy ministers. “We have seen similar attempts in the past, when national press [sic] has used these measures in a way that risks creating anti-European feelings amongst citizens. This should not be taken lightly. Attempts at undermining ecodesign and energy labelling directly undermine our energy policy.” Energy efficiency measures increased business competitiveness, cut household bills, and reduced CO2 emissions, Oettinger said.

"At the Sydney Olympics in 2000, environmental campaign group Greenpeace ran a global campaign depicting a polar bear balancing on a lonely piece of ice. The campaign’s focus was the damage to the ozone layer caused by fluorinated gases, such as HFCs. And its target was global drinks giant Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola subsequently joined with Unilever and McDonald’s to form the Refrigerants Naturally! partnership. Created in 2004, the business-led coalition has two founding aims: to promote the sale of refrigeration units free of fluorinated gases (“F gas free”); and, to push for a regulatory framework that encourages climate-friendly alternatives.  “The idea of doing this together rather than separately is mostly to provide an example of what is possible,” says Antoine Azar, chair of Refrigerants Naturally!. Another motivation for industry cooperation is strength in numbers. Over the last decade, the campaign’s members have fed into policy debates concerning fluorinated gases at a national level, as well as through international fora such as the Montreal Protocol process. “When it comes to phasing-down or phasing-out HFCs, a letter from all of us has much more impact that individual letters”, notes Azar, who also heads up Coca Cola’s internal efforts to eliminate HFCs. The campaign is a rare example of corporate competitors working in close alliance. Beverage brands PepsiCo and RedBull have both since joined forces with the initiative’s early partners (although McDonald’s withdrew two years ago). “Competitors working together to help address environmental issues is definitely a strong message to the industry. Even at Coca-Cola internally, when I say I’ve had a meeting with PepsiCo, they look at me with eyes of surprise,” Azar admits. Competitor companies obviously need to tread carefully when it comes to collaboration, even when it relates to environmental issues of joint concerns. Back in 2011, for example, Unilever and P&G were judged to have breached European anti-trust laws when they sought to move the market towards lower impact laundry detergents. To avoid such a scenario, the group’s members read out the EU’s statement on competition law every time they meet and commit to its precepts. Third parties, such as UNEP and Greenpeace, are also invited to sit in on their biannual meetings (both organisations are non-business members of the campaign). The active participation of Greenpeace adds particular credibility to the initiative given the group’s critical stance of business as well as its role in the group’s origins. “Having Greenpeace as a supporter partner sends out the right message to the industry – that things are possible and we’re moving ahead,” says Azar. To date, Coca-Cola and Unilever have installed over 1.5m and 1.2m F-gas-free refrigeration units of various sizes across their global operations. As a whole, the coalition counts around 3.5m such units. One of the main hopes of the group’s members is that developing nations such as China and India will see that F-gas-free equipment is technically feasible and will choose it above traditional options containing fluorinated gases.

"Our efforts to cut carbon emissions aren’t working and no-one else cares. Give up. It’s not a great thought to start the day, but that’s the defeatist message Britain woke up to a couple of weeks ago, when the BBC’s Today Programme interviewed newly-sacked climate-sceptic environment secretary, Owen Paterson.   This climate defeatism also swirled around the rapturous reaction to Paterson’s argument from the usual suspects in the media. Having failed to undermine public acceptance of climate science or turn us against renewable energy, the high-carbon lobby wants to ensure that people have no appetite for the journey to a low-carbon society. Hit-and-run attacks on effective policies, witnessed with the fuss over EU rules on vacuum cleaners and hairdryers, are accompanied by a drumbeat of doom and gloom designed to sap our will to act. The Committee on Climate Change responded to Paterson with a reserved and systematic rebuttal, calmly pointing to the existence of 500 climate laws in 66 countries and legally-binding emissions targets in Denmark, Finland and Mexico. These facts are important. But changing the mood music calls for another kind of intervention. As the RSA identified in a recent report, the real barrier to action on climate change is not climate scepticism but a sense that we can’t really do much to help. The biggest threat to progress is cynicism – resigning ourselves to climate change because we don’t think we’re up to the task of fixing it. 10:10’s #itshappening project offers a brighter view, showcasing positive practical climate action taken by people and communities around the world, as well as ambitious solutions being rolled out on a grand scale by government and businesses. The goal: to restore a sense of possibility to the climate debate, countering fatalism and isolation with hope and a feeling of shared endeavour. Alongside concern about the consequences of inaction must come an optimistic sense that taking a low-carbon path is not just possible but often better; and that we are part of a global community walking it together. Polling we commissioned from ComRes showed that two out of three people would be more inclined to support climate action if they heard more about the solutions. And 71% say people are less likely to take action on climate change because they’re unsure of the difference their actions will make. Similarly, when asked about what would make them personally more likely to take action on climate, they said hearing more about the solutions (41%) and benefits (39%). Less likely, though still one-third, said hearing more about the impacts (reflecting recent research from Yale that both feelings of concern and hope motivate support for carbon policies). So take a look at the Dutch-style bike lanes planned for Los Angeles, the home (for now) of the gas guzzler. How about new solar-powered hospitals in Haiti and Nepal – two of the world’s poorest countries on opposite sides of the globe. In Cornwall, a state of the art lifeboat station keeps lifesavers warm with the UK’s first marine source heat pump, there’s also community-owned river turbines in the Philippines and a rapid-recharge electric ferry in Sweden. You might even want to drop in for a trim at the Aberdeenshire hair-dressing salon that’s using nearly 90% less energy than last year, following a green makeover. Meanwhile change is happening on a global scale as China powers ahead as the world leader in wind power, and sales of electric cars are up by 77% in Europe this year. Our gallery is not a comprehensive picture of climate action, there’s no panel of august judges or an algorithm scouring the internet. It’s just a selection of things we wish more people knew about – a trove of inspirational stories that team 10:10 find during the year and squirrel away for autumn. They are there for people to share, to start conversations with friends and for when you need a reminder of what humanity is capable of. There are many more stories out there. Nothing would make us happier to see the internet full of people sharing exciting carbon cutting projects we’ve completely missed.  But #itshappening isn’t just inspiration and motivation. Next time you find yourself cornered at a party by a Paterson-admirer telling you that our actions don’t matter because other counties aren’t acting, or that the solutions aren’t mature enough to be taken seriously – show them these pictures and tell them it’s happening already. • Mal Chadwick is the creator and curator of 10:10’s #itshappening project"

"The Coalition will get its $2.5bn Direct Action climate policy through the Senate after agreeing to investigate the emissions trading policy it has vowed never to introduce, leaving analysts sceptical Australia can achieve its 2020 emission reduction target or deeper long-term cuts. Environment minister Greg Hunt agreed to an investigation of emissions trading schemes and Australia’s future greenhouse targets as a “gesture of good faith” to win the votes of the Palmer United party, even though he insisted the coalition would never, ever support an emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax.  Despite this, and despite the fact that his party voted to repeal the emissions trading scheme Australia already had in July, PUP leader Clive Palmer said his deal with Hunt had “kept alive the hope of the ETS”, releasing a press release proclaiming “Palmer Saves Emissions Trading Scheme”. Hunt said the deal was “a tremendous outcome for the government ... a fundamental success”, but Labor, the Greens and environment groups slammed the outcome. Labor’s environment spokesman Mark Butler said it was “a terrible deal for Australia’s future … leaving Australia with no meaningful way to reduce carbon pollution.” “I don’t know what Jedi mind trick Greg Hunt just played on Clive Palmer … we don’t need another inquiry. We need action,” he said. Greens leader senator Christine Milne said: “What we have here is no contribution to bringing down emissions, no modelling to backup the claims, by a government and Clive Palmer which tore down an emissions trading scheme which was bringing down emissions.” The government has also agreed to a demand by independent senator Nick Xenophon to move quickly to set up a “safeguards” scheme to stop companies increasing their greenhouse emissions – but has not committed to any detail, and Hunt insisted Xenophon had not won any concessions that were not already coalition policy. He rejected Xenophon’s push to allow the government to purchase international carbon permits, something the prime minister once described as sending “money … offshore into dodgy carbon farms in Equatorial Guinea and Kazakhstan”, even though this would have made it easier and cheaper to reach Australia’s agreed emissions reduction target. It is understood Tony Abbott remained strongly opposed to this idea, despite its strong backing from the business community. The government has also agreed to retain the Climate Change Authority – which it was once committed to abolish – to undertake the investigation into an ETS and future reduction targets, and provide reports to parliament. Under Direct Action the government will commit $2.5bn over four years to an “emissions reduction fund” for competitive grants to companies or organisations that volunteer to reduce their emissions. The “safeguards” mechanism is supposed to impose some upper limit on emissions across the board – including on companies or sectors not bidding in its auction – so that their increasing emissions do not cancel out the decreases in emissions purchased through the government fund. But Hunt insisted there would be no revenue raised as a result of the “safeguards”. As revealed by Guardian Australia in August, former Australian Conservation Foundation head Don Henry and co-chair of Greg Hunt’s own expert committee on Direct Action, Danny Price, have been involved in months of backroom talks to win the backing of PUP, Xenophon and DLP senator John Madigan during the three months since the government succeeded in repealing the former government’s carbon pricing scheme. Deep concerns about the adequacy of the policy remain. The government has not modelled whether the fund has enough money to meet Australia’s minimum 2020 target to reduce emissions by 5%, with Abbott saying during the election campaign he preferred to just “have a crack”. CCA chairman Bernie Fraser, who attended the press conference to announce the deal with Hunt and Palmer, referred to the authority’s previous work when asked whether Australia could meet its target, and what that target should be. In February, the authority reported that Australia would have to treble its 2020 target to 15% to remain internationally credible, and without a carbon price or other “effective” policies, emissions will grow to 17% above 2000 levels by 2020. That, it said, would leave an “improbably large task for future Australians to make a fair contribution to global efforts” to constrain global warming to 2C. Market analysis firm Reputex said their projections showed the emissions reduction fund would only be able to buy 20 to 30% of the greenhouse gas abatement needed to meet the 5% target. The firm says that if the “safeguards mechanism” did become a proper baseline and credit emissions trading scheme, it could help the government make up this shortfall. Separate modelling by Sinclair Knight Merz/MMA and Monash University’s Centre of Policy Studies, commissioned by the Climate Institute, which used assumptions more generous to the Coalition, found it would need at least another $4bn. Abbott has said if Direct Action falls short he will not allocate any more money. Hunt would not reveal what advice he had to substantiate his “hope, belief and expectation” that the target would be achieved, but said Australia would be helped by the fact that the decline of manufacturing was reducing electricity emissions and that abatement might be purchased more cheaply than he had originally anticipated. The government must reveal by early next year what post-2020 target it is willing to adopt, and is under strong international pressure to agree to much deeper cuts, but few observers believe the “direct action” policy could achieve them. The terms of reference for the CCA review show the report could embarrass the government just as this pressure is intensifying. Coalition frontbencher Malcolm Turnbull once warned its costs could become prohibitive when Australia has to cut its emissions even further after 2020, especially without the option of buying cheaper offshore carbon permits. In a 2010 speech after he was deposed as leader, Turnbull said direct-action style schemes were “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale” and “schemes where bureaucrats and politicians pick technologies and winners, doling out billions of taxpayers’ dollars, neither are economically efficient nor will be environmentally effective”. And the “blue book” prepared by the Treasury for a possible incoming Coalition government in 2010 said “a market mechanism can achieve the necessary abatement at a cost per tonne of emissions that is far lower than alternative direct-action policies”."
"The fast-growing campaign to persuade investors to dump fossil fuel stocks has set its sights on a twin target of the world’s biggest mining company and one of the globe’s best universities. The mining giant BHP Billiton will face protests at its AGM in London on Thursday over its £6m association with University College London (UCL) and the effects of its activities around the world.  The fossil fuel divestment campaign began in the US, where cities, churches and universities have shed their stocks, and has spread rapidly to 50 universities in the UK, with Glasgow the first breakthrough. This week has seen protests against UK banks, which have provided £66bn of funding for fossil fuel extraction. “UCL is doubly implicated in the devastation that BHP Billiton in causing in countries like Indonesia and Colombia, both through its investments, and through its funding of UCL’s Institute for Sustainable Resources,” said Pekka Piirainen from the Fossil Free UCL campaign. “Glasgow University has shown great leadership in being the first university [in Europe] to choose to stop profiting from the destruction of the climate – there’s no reason why UCL can’t do the same.” UCL’s acceptance of funding from BHP Billiton led to the resignation of vice-dean Professor Jane Rendell in 2013. A leading environmental scientist at UCL, Simon Lewis, said: “When I heard BHP Billiton is the founding funder of UCL’s Institute for Sustainable Resources, I didn’t believe it. It sounds like the environmental equivalent of a tobacco company sponsoring an Institute for Cancer Research. BHP Billiton mines enormous quantities of coal, a fossil fuel that needs to be phased out if international agreements to limit climate change are to be adhered to.” A spokeswoman for UCL said: “UCL is committed to an investment policy that is guided by ethical considerations. We are currently engaged with the Fossil Free UCL campaign, who have asked us to consider a number of investments, and this is process is ongoing.” She said: “The funding [from BHP Billiton] are used entirely at the discretion of UCL’s Institute for Sustainable Resources and are not influenced by or a reflection of the company’s business practice.” The BHP Billiton AGM will also hear protests from people affected by its operations around the world. Rogelio Ustate Arregocés, has travelled from Colombia, where his village Tabaco was destroyed by the opencast Cerrejón coal mine, one of the largest in the world and part-owned by BHP. “Where Tabaco stood is a hole, a sterile place of sadness and fear,” said Arregocés, who is being hosted by the World Development Movement. He accused BHP of breaking promises made about relocation, compensation and employment and will demand the provision of new land so the hundreds of families displaced can return to farming and fishing. “We want freedom, in our own territory.” “I want to tell all investors in BHP to withdraw their money because of the damage this multinational does,” Arregocés said. Pius Ginting, from Friends of the Earth Indonesia, will also use proxy shares to tell the BHP Billiton AGM that the company should give up its huge areas of coal mining permits in the rainforests in the heart of Borneo. UCL declined to meet Arregocés or Ginting. A spokesman for BHP Billiton said: “Cerrejón continues to engage with all the local communities to understand their individual concerns and develop tailored solutions to meet their needs whenever possible. There are a variety of challenges some of which pre-date our involvement.” On the company’s project in Borneo, called IndoMet, the spokesman said: “Any development by us is subject to detailed environmental and social impact assessments and feasibility studies, including ensuring all appropriate permits are in place. All mined areas will be rehabilitated post-mining.” The spokesman added that it had no involvement in directing research projects at UCL’s Institute for Sustainable Resources. Another critical voice at the BHP Billiton AGM will be Ian Dunlop, a long-time former Shell employee and former chair of the Australian Coal Association, who will warn the company that shareholder value is at serious risk because of climate change. “The opportunity for value destruction is enormous,” said Dunlop, who is seeking election to the BHP board. “BHP are ahead of much of the industry but that is not saying much, as the rest are all in denial.” “The phase out of coal will be much more rapid than they expect,” he said. “BHP look at it as advanced, incremental change from business as usual, but they have to look at it as a paradigm shift.” Analysts at Carbon Tracker argue that international action to combat global warming will leave at least two-thirds of known coal, oil and gas unburnable and valueless. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said earlier in October the “vast majority of reserves are unburnable.” BHP Billiton is recommending shareholders vote against Dunlop, stating he lacks the “overall skills and experience profile required”. Dunlop’s attempt to join the board on 2013 was opposed by 96% of shareholders. “We accept the IPCC assessment of climate change science, which has found that warming of the climate is unequivocal, the human influence is clear and physical impacts are unavoidable,” said the BHP spokesman, citing the company’s recent sustainability report. “Energy coal makes up 25% of the energy mix and in many regions is the source of affordable energy that offers security of supply. This is likely to remain the case for some time.”"
"The GPS showed David Morgan still on dry land – but the waves bumping beneath his boat revealed the reality of this lost Louisiana landscape. Rising seas have obliterated 30 points on the map in the last three years at Plaquemines Parish where Morgan lives. Sugarcane fields, citrus groves, backwoods – all gone. “This was all land here when I was a kid. There was no water anywhere,” said Morgan, 57, slowing the boat to pass oyster beds. “I used to hunt rabbits there with my dog,” he said. Louisiana is losing land to the sea faster than anywhere else in the world. But the authorities say they have a plan to turn back the seas – and get BP to pay a substantial share of the $50bn (£31bn) cost out of criminal penalties from the blowout of its well in the Gulf of Mexico. The plan includes proposals for more than 100 engineering projects along the coastline, diverting the Mississippi, dumping fresh sand on barrier islands, and re-planting degraded wetlands to reinforce the coast. The state’s computer forecast shows that, if all the projects come in on time, by 2060 Louisiana could start regaining land. The big question is: will it work? Officials say the ambitious plan is the best hope yet for saving the coast. Louisiana lost nearly 1,900 square miles of land between 1932 to 2010, and between 1985 and 2010 wetlands were lost at a rate of 16.57 square miles per year – a disappearing act claiming on average a football field an hour. In Plaquemines Parish, the remaining land looks moth-eaten, chewed up by oil industry canals and the incoming waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Left unchecked, the state is projected to lose an additional 1,750 sq m in the next 50 years. The land began vanishing from southern Louisiana about 80 years ago when the authorities began penning in the Mississippi after catastrophic floods. The system of levees cut off the river from the delta, choking off the sediment needed to shore up the coast. A decade later, oil drilling took off in coastal areas of Louisiana. Industry canals tore up the coastal wetlands. Rising seas under climate change accelerated the land loss, exposing New Orleans and the valuable oil, shipping and seafood industries on the coast to hurricanes and storm surge. Sea level rise is now the leading cause of land loss, said Virginia Burkett, chief scientist for climate and land use change at the US Geological Survey, leading a recent tour of the restoration projects organised by the Society of Environmental Journalists. “If sea level rise doubles as we expect over the next century, can you imagine what is going to happen to this landscape?” she asked. “Without the barrier islands and marshes to attenuate the storm surge, the people of New Orleans are basically surrounded by an earthen levee.” Even the state’s Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, who publicly downplays the dangers of climate change, has committed to the plan to hold back the seas. Local politicians have also signed on. “This is how we are going to save Louisiana. It is doable,” said Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines Parish. “I think we can realistically put back what we had 25 or 30 years ago.” However, the engineering projects are prohibitively expensive. Congress has refused to fund the $50bn and private estimates for the engineering works range up to $94bn – which is where BP comes in. The Louisiana authorities are banking heavily on BP paying a large share of the costs. Under a law passed by Congress, 80% of the penalties obtained from BP following the 2010 blowout of its oil well in the Gulf of Mexico are designated for coastal restoration. The oil company has already made a downpayment of about $1bn for coastal restoration. After a judge in New Orleans last month found BP had exercised “gross negligence” in the run-up to the disaster, the oil company could now be on the hook for as much as $18bn in penalties under the Clean Water Act. The judge will begin court proceedings on penalties in January. A separate lawsuit is trying to get oil and gas companies to pay for restoration, because of the damage done by the canals. Burkett said the plan was different from earlier – failed – restoration efforts because it aims to mimic the way sediment, debris and even trees were carried along by the Mississippi and deposited on the delta, extending land into the Gulf of Mexico. “What we have learned through time is restoring the natural process is more effective than building concrete dams and dykes,” she said. This time around, engineers are importing sand to rebuild barrier islands scoured by hurricanes. At Pelican Island, a 2.5 mile strip in the Barataria Bay, crews used 2.5m cubic yards of sand and silt mined from the Gulf of Mexico to build dunes and marshes, and rolled out protective fences around newly planted grasses. But it has cost $77m so far to restore Pelican Island, and the coastal restoration authority admits that, even after all this effort, Pelican Island has a limited life-span, just 20 years, before it too is devoured by the sea. Given the rate of land loss, it’s hard to keep pace. “Even though a couple of billion dollars sounds like a lot of money we have found it woefully inadequate to do a lot of good here on the coast that we’re looking at,” said Brad Inman, a senior project manager on the restoration project from the Army Corps of Engineers. It’s also unclear whether re-engineering the coast can ever work – no matter how massive the scale. In research published earlier this year, Richard Condrey, a retired coastal ecologist from Louisiana State University, said this approach to restoring the coast was bound to fail. It was time to start again – before it’s too late. “The data doesn’t support that putting sand on a barrier island has impacted the rate of loss,” Condrey said. “We need to recognise that what we are doing is not working. We are not protecting the citizens of Louisiana. We are not protecting the coasts and barrier islands. … We need to stop fooling ourselves.” • This article was amended on 17 October 2014. An earlier version said “Louisiana has lost nearly 1,900 square miles of land over the past 80 years – a disappearing act that claims on average a football field an hour.”"
"The clean energy industry and Labor have immediately rejected the Abbott government’s opening gambit in negotiations to find a bipartisan agreement on the future of the renewable energy target. The plan would protect household solar installers but, according to the industry, it would kill two-thirds of planned large-scale clean energy investments. Labor rejected it as a job-killing “phoney” offer before it was even announced.  The government had originally signalled it wanted even deeper cuts to the target – which requires 41,000 gigawatt hours of energy to come from renewable sources by 2020 – and commissioned businessman and self-professed climate sceptic Dick Warburton to undertake a “review”. Its main recommendation was for the target to be slashed to around 16,000 gigawatt hours. But after fierce resistance from industry and concerted criticism of that review, the federal cabinet has asked the environment minister, Greg Hunt, and the industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, to try to reach a bipartisan agreement about the future of the program that would allow continued investment without fear of policy change. With those talks set to begin on Wednesday afternoon, Macfarlane revealed he and Hunt had written to Labor setting out a “commonsense” plan as the “basis to our negotiation”. He said that would be a target representing a “real” 20% of the current energy market – probably around 26,000 gigawatt hours – with no change to the subsidies for household rooftop solar panels and a full exemption from the scheme for all energy intensive industries, like aluminium, copper, zinc and cement. The Clean Energy Council, which represents the renewables industry, said “the so-called ‘real’ 20% … would actually decimate the industry.” “Such a move would leave many projects and companies financially stressed, billions of dollars in lost investment and thousands of jobs foregone. We are already about 40% of the way to meeting the legislated 41,000 gigawatt-hours of large-scale generation. If we were to reduce this target to a ‘real’ 20%, it would actually mean a cut of almost two thirds of the additional large-scale renewable energy required to be built,” said the CEC’s acting chief executive, Kane Thornton. “Not only that, but the modelling for the RET review by [the consultants] ACIL Allen showed that any scenario where the level of the target was reduced would lead to higher power prices for consumers in the future.” And the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, had rejected the starting pitch before Macfarlane had even announced it. “Labor strongly believes we should have a bipartisan approach on a renewable energy target but it can’t be at the expense of a renewable energy target. Labor has made it clear that we will engage in discussions but we’ve got no-go zones,” he said. “The government wants a real 20%. I call it a fraud 20% a fake 20%. We have seen thousands of jobs created and billions of dollars in investment … before Tony Abbott and his crew of climate sceptics took over we were ranked fourth for renewable energy investment, now we’ve slipped to 10th.” Labor has said it would consider some reductions in the scheme but not to the extent proposed by Macfarlane. It has supported an exemption for the aluminium industry. Macfarlane and Hunt also proposed that a legislated requirement for the two yearly reviews be removed. The Climate Change Authority announced this week it was conducting its own review of the RET before December, as required under law. Macfarlane said any deal reached with Labor could not be legislated until next year and would not begin until 2015. The Australian Wind Alliance said the government’s announcement showed that its “attack on renewable energy” had entered a new phase. “The government seems to have learned nothing from the failed Warburton review,” the alliance’s national coordinator, Andrew Bray, said. The Solar Council welcomed the government’s dramatic shift in attitude towards its operations, but said Labor was right to reject out of hand the government’s starting “offer” on the target for large-scale renewables. “Just a few short months ago they wanted to abolish the small-scale renewable energy scheme,” the chief executive of the Solar Council, John Grimes, said. “Of course this is a very positive development” but he said the proposed cut to the large-scale target would amount to a 60% cut and “kill large-scale solar in its tracks”."

"Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is hoping to become the Senate Majority Leader after the forthcoming election on November 4th, although despite hailing from conservative Kentucky, McConnell is in a very tight race. The Cincinnati Enquirer editorial board recently had a long discussion with McConnell and tried to pin him down on the subject of global warming. McConnell wouldn’t directly answer whether he believes in climate change. Enquirer’s editorial board volleyed several questions about what it would take to convince him of climate change. He turned the subject every time to jobs. McConnell said he believes imposing regulations to reduce greenhouse gases blamed for climate change would only hurt America and not mitigate what other countries, such as China, are doing... “We can debate this forever,” McConnell said. “George Will had a column in the last year or so pointing out that in the 70s, we were concerned the ice age was coming. I’m not a scientist. I’m interested in protecting Kentucky’s economy.”  Leaving aside McConnell’s reference to the 1970s ice age myth, the cop-out about not being a scientist is a strange and dangerous one. Most members of Congress aren’t scientists, or doctors, or military experts, or teachers, and yet they set our country’s science, health care, defense, and education policy. Usually they do this by listening to the experts in each subject, which is the smart approach. For example, as Lee Papa has pointed out, McConnell had no hesitations in expressing his opinions about dealing with the threat of Ebola and deferring to the experts at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), I’m not an expert on this, but it strikes me that it would be a good idea to discontinue flights into the United States from that part of the world ... I think we ought to listen to what the CDC thinks they need either in terms of financing or certainly they’ll decide the procedures for travel and all the rest. I think we need to follow the advice of the experts who know how to fight scourges like this These comments stand in stark contrast to McConnell’s unwillingness to take a position on human-caused global warming, or to listen to the climate scientist experts on the subject. McConnell is far from alone – this refrain has become one of the most popular responses among Republican politicians when asked about the climate. “I’m not a scientist” is used to abdicate responsibility for mitigating the immense risks posed by climate change. This abdication would be considered unacceptable in the face of other threats like ISIS and Ebola, and the same should be true for global warming. When it comes to climate change, the expert consensus is clear. Humans are causing global warming, and the resulting climate changes (more damaging extreme weather, for example) on the whole are harmful and dangerous. There are ways to reduce carbon pollution at a lower cost than paying for the immense damages caused by unabated climate change. In fact, there are small government, free market solutions that appeal to political conservatives and would reduce carbon pollution while growing the economy. The good news is that the Democratic Party is taking climate change seriously. President Obama has shown strong leadership on the issue in his second term, Democratic Senators are drawing increasing attention to it, and many Democratic candidates running for office are speaking up about the need for climate action. Climate Hawks Vote has a good list of those candidates. Unfortunately, many Republican politicians receive substantial campaign funding from fossil fuel companies. Many also rely on the most conservative Americans as their voting base, and those voters have been misinformed about climate change by the conservative media.  Because of that media bias, climate change is treated as a political, cultural, and ideological topic in the United States instead of a scientific and risk management issue. In the rare case where Republican politicians show responsible leadership in trying to tackle global warming, their jobs are threatened. Thus rather than showing leadership to address our greatest long-term threat, Republican politicians resort to abdicating responsibility. However, as Neal deGrasse Tyson says, The good thing about science is that it’s true whether or not you believe in it. The consequences of climate change are becoming more and more undeniable. It’s only a matter of time before climate denial becomes a losing political position, and the Republican Party pays the price for its years of obstructing climate policies. The question is whether anyone in the party will step up and demonstrate responsible leadership before it’s too late for the GOP and the climate."

"For those following the rapid change in the climate change debate towards a more financial system orientation, a remarkable situation is unfolding in Australia that will act as a pointer to future developments elsewhere. In response to the fossil fuel free divestment campaign, the pride of the Australian education system, the Australian National University (ANU), finally caved to pressure and decided to engage the services of a socially responsible investment analyst firm to look at climate change issues.   As a result of this analysis, ANU declared that it was divesting in a few carbon exposed companies. Nothing new in this, many organisations have done the same, but what quickly ensued was an extraordinary series of high-powered public clashes that could be a taste of things to come in other countries’ backyards. The story exploded into a heavyweight battle between current and former prime ministers, party leaders and global notables. And the current Australian government showed that it simply doesn’t know the difference between socially responsible investment, fossil fuel divestment and financial risk management. The Australian Prime Minister himself Tony Abbott declared the ANU’s decision “stupid” and said that entities following suit were depriving members of good returns. Those members to which Abbott referred are increasingly aware that over half of their average pension portfolio is in carbon-exposed investments, so they don’t need to worry too much that they are depriving the fossil fuel based industries of capital. Quite the opposite as less than 2% of portfolios is in low carbon alternatives representing a 25-1 gamble on business as usual for high carbon investments. In a stunning misreading of the tea leaves, the Australian prime minister went further, announcing that coal was good for humanity. But with a 40% slump in coal prices since 2011, it sadly isn’t good for retirement savings and unlikely to benefit from better carbon risk management by investors. The notion that this debate could occur over a decision to divest less than 1% of a portfolio that doesn’t rank even near the 50 largest in Australia is a strong pointer to the rest of us that investment is now the main climate battleground. Globally, ANU’s investment size doesn’t even make the top 1000. To play in the climate space beforehand was easy for governments: avoid pricing carbon by sending out alarms about harming economies and losing jobs, while protecting vested interests over a stable climate for citizens. But now the debate has gone up the food chain into a dark mysterious space where long term investors – the asset owners such as pension funds, superannuation funds, insurance companies and sovereign funds – operate and look at risk with an eye increasingly on the long term.  Finally the climate debate has entered an area that is out of the control of the politicians and the corporate lobbyists. What bank of England head Mark Carney called the “tragedy of horizon” is now being addressed by people who manage more money than all governments put together.  These asset owners do not need to lobby governments over such issues. In fact they don’t care in what form the energy in the economy is provided as long as it comes at a good balance of risk and return. They have no respect for vested interests either and see transitions such as the one to a low carbon world as part of the daily routine of restructuring the world’s economies and shifting capital to where it is needed in order to make a financial return. In their world, capital moves and there are winners and losers every day big or small, powerful or not. Whinging corporates looking for someone to protect their declining industries or unions crying foul over job losses don’t matter one jot to those people sniffing out potential mispriced risk and moving their money elsewhere. ANU head, Ian Young, will go down in history as the first public figure to defend an investment decision that could have been made 100 times a day by his fund managers for a whole host of reasons. While many talk about the ethics of divestment and SRI, the real landscape has always been about risk and the language of climate risk will now come into our lives with units not in degrees centigrade or parts per million but in trillions of dollars, basis point returns and risk premiums. The new investment game proves that government’s inability to price carbon to stabilise the climate is compounded by their regulation of a financial system built to drive the very short-termism that allows the companies to hold political sway and pin governments to the status quo and away from what they know are sensible climate precautions. In an irony surely set for broadway and the west end stage one day, investors are realising that resisting governments is becoming their greatest risk given that the catch-up period will be extraordinarily expensive and damaging. The leading asset owners are acting early to get protected from the inevitable catch up where politicians go running for cover and blame someone else. As the leading asset owners grow in number and communicate their good efforts to beneficiaries, just maybe we are seeing the beginnings of a new era of risk-based capitalism – Mr Abbott, his government and those of the G20 would do well to read the tea leaves before they find themselves marginalised and with a legacy that no-one would want. Their citizens are getting an education in finance and they would do well do get the same before people realise that a world governed by pension trustees would put a strong price on carbon tomorrow morning whatever the complex politics.

"A group of Pacific Islanders joined an environmental protest blockading the Newcastle coal port on Friday, disrupting shipping traffic by paddling canoes across the harbour mouth. Members of the Pacific Climate Warriors action group traveled from nations including the Marshall Islands, Fiji, Vanuatu, Tokelau, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea to draw attention to the effects of climate change on their island nations, and to protest Australia’s continuing commitment to coal.  The Newcastle port is the world’s largest coal handling facility. An annual flotilla blockade has been held for several years, but this was the first time protesters were joined by the group from the Pacific Islands. Fijian protester George Nacewa had earlier told Guardian Australia the effects of climate change were “really evident back at home with coastal erosion and in terms of sea-level rise”. “To date there has been the relocation of two villages, they’ve moved further inland,” he said. “That’s Fiji alone, and the other Pacific islands are more affected because most of them are just atolls.” “We lose our cultural identity and we lose our land, because we identify ourselves with the land and the ocean,” he said. On Friday morning the 30 men and women were joined by a few hundred others on Horseshoe beach at Newcastle, as well as a police presence on land and water. After a procession of several canoes shipped from Vanuatu, Fiji and other islands, and a Polynesian war dance, the traditional vessels took to the water. There were laughs and cheers from the crowd and police when two men tipped and then sank their canoe almost immediately. Then the leader of an outrigger canoe with “Tai Tokelau” painted on the side, shouted for others to “bring the kayaks” and dozens went in on their plastic watercraft. “If we get to stop a coal ship, then all the better,” Nacewa told Guardian Australia after returning to shore. “But at the end of the day we are here to highlight the impact of climate change. All these islanders in their costumes – they live the realities of climate change.” Milañ Loeak, from the Marshall Islands told Guardian Australia the climate warriors were joining the protest to tell people their stories in the hope more would join them in their fight. “Just last week we had a king tide that affected some homes in the villages,” said the 26-year-old, adding that droughts and floodings were frequent. Tiny coral atolls, the Marshall Islands are “especially” vulnerable to sea level rises, she said. “It’s something very personal to me, especially seeing it first hand and seeing family members and relatives and friends and their families have to leave their homes and find new places to stay.”  Kayakers were not permitted to go beyond yellow markers just a short distance offshore, but almost immediately a large number paddled past them into the middle of the waterway.  Within half an hour, the bulk carrier, Rhine, appeared, being pulled out of the port by tugs. Protesters quickly formed a blockade, hampered on one side by police boats. Police officers used boats to push the light watercraft back, and took jetskis around canoes to create wake and spray. The 225-metre vessel was delayed for a short time until police cleared the way. One 47-year-old kayaker, Donna Bartlett, claimed a police officer on a jetski made contact with her bright orange kayak, knocking it against another and dislocating her finger. She said jetskis on either side of a group were sending protesters in opposite directions, causing chaos. “The jetskis come, trying to get us unbalanced,” she said. “I’m scared today but I know the stakes.” Zana Kobayashi, 25, from Newcastle, said she’d joined the protest because the federal government “doesn’t seem to be doing anything to address concerns [about climate change].” Kobayashi, who was in a double kayak, said police on the water confiscated their paddles and towed them out of the way of the ship. When protesters began returning to shore, another officer towed them in. She said there were “a few aggressive characters” among the police officers. Inspector Steve Laksa told Guardian Australia several people were detained and brought to shore, but none were facing charges. In going past the yellow markers, protesters “put other persons at risk and in danger”, Laksa said. He was unaware of reports about police jetskis hitting Bartlett’s kayak, but said: “Police were on the waterway to ensure the safety of the protesters and persons on the waterway illegally, and were asking them and giving certain directions to move back to shore. “The information I’ve been provided and what I’ve seen for myself is that the police have given directions to the protesters and set a line to the yellow markers. “We were concerned there were a number of protesters with children that were entering into the waterway, in the path of a large ship. We had some serious concerns and had given directions for them to move back.”"
"There have been a number of studies recently on ocean warming and sea-level rise. Collectively, they are helping scientists unite around an emerging understanding of climate change and its impact on the Earth.  Most recently, a study by scientists Sarah Purkey, Gregory Johnson, and Don Chambers was published. This team was responsible for a 2010 paper that was groundbreaking in that it quantified very deep (abyssal) sea warming. This latest paper is, in some respects, a continuation of that work.  The researchers recognised that changes to sea levels are mainly caused by thermal expansion of ocean waters as they heat, changes to the saltiness of water, and an increase in ocean waters as ice melts and flows into the sea. The total annual sea level rise is about 3mm per year – the question is, how much of that is from expansion and how much is from melting? The researchers used a few tools to answer this question. One tool was ocean bottom pressure measurements. If you can measure changes to ocean pressure, you can deduce how much water is in the ocean. Another tool is through an inventory approach. This inventory method quantifies how much glaciers retreat, polar ice melts, and changes to water storage on land. The paper reports that both methods agree with each other. They conclude that increased water in the oceans is causing between 1.5–1.8 mm per year of sea level rise, depending, in part, on which years are under consideration. The authors don’t just consider the ocean as a whole. They break the ocean regions into seven different sections because the change to ocean levels is not uniform. In some regions, waters are rising quickly, in others, the rise is much slower or zero. One reason for regional variability is that the Earth’s gravity is changing.  For instance, there is so much ice in Greenland and Antarctica that is melting and flowing into the ocean, the mass of these two regions is being reduced; therefore, the pull of gravity toward Greenland and Antarctica is changing. As a result, we expect water levels near Greenland and Antarctica may actually fall as those ice sheets melt.  But, ocean levels elsewhere, particularly UScoastlines, will rise more than average because of this same effect. I have a paper in press with Ted Scambos on this very topic that should be published in a few weeks.  Another reason sea level rise isn’t uniform is that there are local changes to heat and salt which can increase or decrease water density in certain regions, causing local changes to sea level. A third reason is that changes to wind patterns can slosh water around, causing it to build up in one area, fall in another.  In each of the seven ocean regions, the researchers collected temperature and salt measurements at carefully distributed sections. These measurements allowed them to calculate how much of the ocean rise is due to heat/salt effects. They compared the expected sea level rise to actual satellite measurements. The difference between expansion sea level rise and actual sea level rise is the contribution by melt water which flowed into the ocean. This method they call the residual measurement. Then, they collected measurements from special satellites (GRACE) which measure local fluctuations in ocean mass. They compared the GRACE results with the residual measurement. It turns out they were in near perfect agreement; 1.5 mm per year of sea level rise is from added mass to the oceans. The rest is from expansion. Not only did the two methods agree, but they agreed region by region. They showed, for instance, that the South Atlantic and the South Indian/Atlantic Oceans are rising very rapidly. The North Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian Oceans are rising modestly. The southern Pacific is falling modestly and the North Atlantic is basically constant. Next, they calculated the relative sea level rise for waters from the surface down to different depths (300, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, and 6,000 m) to determine which layers make the largest contributions to sea level rise. The authors report that the deeper we go into the ocean, the less heating has occurred (this is expected and well known). Interestingly, they find that every water layer, even the deepest waters, have contributed some to sea level rise. They also report that the sea level rise contribution from the layers 300-2,000 meters is much more than previously reported.  Dr Johnson summarised their results, We find a small but measurable contribution from deep-sea warming to the global sea level budget (and hence global energy budget) from 1996–2006. The ocean warming is estimated directly from highly accurate, full-depth, oceanographic temperature data. The magnitude of the deep warming contribution to sea level below 2,000 m is about 13% of the total contribution of the mass trend below 2,000 m for that same time period. I asked how this paper agrees or disagrees with a recent paper that reportedly showed the deepest ocean waters are not heating. He replied that the two studies actually agree with each other. They both show that the deepest ocean waters are likely contributing only a small fraction to the overall ocean energy/water rise. On the other hand, the uncertainty is largely because the deepest waters just don’t have a history of sufficient measurements to close the uncertainty range. He also stressed the importance of a proposed fleet of deep-water measuring devices (Deep Argo).  It is sometimes said that “global warming” is really “ocean warming”. Given the importance the oceans have on our past and future climate, you can be sure scientists around the world are working to better understand how much heat is going into the oceans, where the heat is going, and what will happen in the future. The recent publications are helping us close the uncertainty range and improve our knowledge. This is what progress looks like."

"The Australian government’s multimillion dollar plan to halt the worrying decline of the Great Barrier Reef does nothing to address the leading threat of climate change and is likely to prove largely ineffectual, scientists have warned. In its formal response to the Reef 2050 long-term sustainability plan, which was drawn up by the Australian and Queensland governments, the Australian Academy of Science states the strategy is “inadequate to achieve the goal of restoring or even maintaining the diminished outstanding universal value of the reef”.  Although a recent government assessment found climate change is the leading threat to a declining reef, the Australian Academy of Science states there is “no adequate recognition” in the 2050 plan of the importance of curbing greenhouse gases. The academy’s submission is also critical of what it sees as the plan’s lack of specific funded goals to restore the reef’s condition, along with a failure to properly tackle issues such as poor water quality, coastal development and illegal fishing. “The draft 2050 plan represents business-as-usual in terms of how escalating pressures on the reef are adequately regulated [or not], when much bolder action is required to restore the values of the reef and prevent further degradation,” the submission states. Professor Terry Hughes, director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and an academy fellow, said the plan was focused on the sustainable development of four “mega ports” adjacent to the reef, rather than conservation of the reef itself. “There’s no questioning in the report of whether two or three ports would be better than four,” Hughes told Guardian Australia. Ports such as Abbot Point, near the Queensland town of Bowen, are being expanded to allow for larger exports of fossil fuels. “There’s nothing in the plan on addressing climate change,” Hughes said. “The science is quite clear that you can’t keep the Great Barrier Reef in good condition if you’re going to develop huge coal reserves. We are already on our way to 2C warming and unless Australia cuts back on carbon dioxide emissions we won’t have much of a Great Barrier Reef left. “We need a plan to transition away from fossil fuels well before 2050. Australia’s emissions reduction goal is very, very weak by international standards. We have stewardship of one of the world’s premier reef systems and also stewardship of a huge reserve of fossil fuels – it’s a conflict of interest, really.” Key threats to the reef, aside from climate change, include pollution flowing onto the ecosystem from agriculture, cyclones and a plague of coral-eating starfish. The reef has lost around half its coral cover in the past 30 years. The Reef 2050 plan sets a target of a 50% reduction in nitrogen and a 60% drop in pesticides flowing onto the reef by 2018. There is also a plan to protect dugongs and turtles. However, there is no new funding mentioned beyond the $40m Reef Trust program announced in the budget. The plan includes no specific ban on the dumping of dredged seabed spoil into the reef’s waters, which scientists say can smother and badly damage coral and fish. A proposal to dump dredged spoil into the Great Barrier Reef marine park for the Abbot Point project was recently reversed, although a similar dumping plan is in place to facilitate the expansion of other areas, such as the Townsville port. “The proposed dredging is unprecedented and will swamp the reef,” Hughes said. “The government has spent around $400m on reducing by about 10% the amount of sediment flowing out onto the reef but this is completely overtaken by the amount of sediment being dumped. “There are literally hundreds of reports saying mud dumped on your head isn’t good for you. It isn’t really rocket science. The government needs to engage with scientists more than they did when putting together this draft plan.” Unesco’s world heritage committee will decide next year whether to place the Great Barrier Reef on its “in-danger” list. Unesco has called for port expansion to be limited in order to safeguard the health of the reef. “There’s no doubt the short-term goal of this report is to keep Unesco happy,” Hughes said. “I’m not sure if that will succeed or not but in terms of this being a plan for the next 35 years, there are missing targets that need to be in there. “It would be a terrible outcome if the Great Barrier Reef is placed on the in-danger list; it would be very damaging to Australia’s reputation. I haven’t met anyone who wants that to be the case but I wouldn’t be surprised if Unesco went ahead and did it.” On Monday, Greg Hunt, the federal environment minister, unveiled new guidelines to increase the number of divers able to lethally inject crown-of-thorns starfish, which are munching their way through the reef’s coral. A spokesman for Hunt said the 2050 reef plan is based on the “best available science to ensure it responds to new and emerging issues”. “We have a clear plan and a strong commitment to ensure the reef is healthy and resilient – and we are making strong progress,” he said. “The Great Barrier Reef remains an incredibly diverse and rich marine environment. We know the reef still retains the values for which it was listed as world heritage. “The Australian and Queensland governments are jointly investing approximately $180m a year in the reef’s health – that’s billions of dollars over the next decade.”"
"You know your latest public relations campaign is on to a winner when you hear your key message coming out of the mouth of a world leader. So when Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said “coal is good for humanity” I can’t help but picture a few corks liberated from the necks of expensive bottles of bubbly in coal company boardrooms.  Because over the last few years the coal industry has been trying to hijack the issue of energy poverty by telling the world that the only way the poorest nations can pull themselves out of poverty is by purchasing lots of their product. The point that those same people will likely be hit earliest and hardest from the impacts of climate change being driven by that same product, is neatly swerved or underplayed. In recent months one coal company in particular – Peabody Energy – has been pushing this line harder than most. Peabody describes itself as “the world’s largest private sector coal company” that is “fueling the world with energy essential to sustain life”. Back in February, Peabody launched a new global public relations campaign called “Advanced Energy for Life” to supposedly raise awareness of the energy poverty issue. Australian coal industry leaders have also been dropping the “energy poverty” line into interviews and op-eds at every opportunity. There are, I think, two ways to see this.  The first is that the coal industry has had a sudden onset of benevolence, altruism and empathy for the world’s poor. The second is that the coal industry is trying to hide its self-interest behind a deeply cynical campaign to get more coal burned at a time when world leaders need to be working out how to do the opposite to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Shaping Peabody’s campaign is one of the world’s biggest PR companies Burson-Marsteller – a group well practiced at defending the interests of controversial clients and known for its “crisis management” expertise. Burson-Marsteller handled the PR for one of the world’s worst industrial disasters – the 1984 Union Carbide gas leak in Bhopal, India, that killed an estimated 20,000 people and affected more than half a million others. Burson-Marsteller has also reportedly worked for governments with questionable human rights records and tried to help the tobacco industry with the bad PR you tend to get from a product that increases people’s risk of getting cancer. The firm stopped working for tobacco in 2010. In Australia, Burson-Marsteller is listed as a lobbyist for Peabody Energy, where the company has 11 coal mines and sold about 35 million tonnes of coal in 2013. As the November G20 leaders summit approaches in Brisbane, the Australian Government has already scrubbed the words “climate change” from the meeting agenda, which will focus on driving economic growth. But Peabody has been busy trying to get its own particular view of “energy poverty” in front of the G20 world leaders. On August 25, the G20’s Energy Sustainability Working Group held a meeting in Brisbane which included a day-long workshop on “energy access”. Charles Meintjes, the president of Peabody’s operations in Australia, gave a presentation at the meeting which included many of the “Advanced Energy for Life” talking points (I have a copy of the presentation slides).  Meintjes’ presentation told the workshop that 3.5 billion people live without adequate access to electricity. One slide had a picture of an ultrasound scan of baby in a womb with the words “Energy is vital” printed over the top. The presentation said almost three billion people use “primitive stoves” for cooking and heating and that this smoke exposure “is equivalent to inhaling 400 cigarettes per hour”. As the world’s urban population grows, Meintjes slides said “coal is the only affordable fuel, at scale, to meet rising energy needs”. Less dirty coal plants would help “improve emissions”, according to Meintjes’ slides. One of those who also spoke at the same meeting was Dr Matthew Dornan of the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University.  Dornan’s research looks at ways to use policy to widen access to electricity and is “technology neutral”. He told me: “I argue that electrification programs should meet the needs of consumers, and that this will sometimes involve fossil-fuel technologies, and in other cases involve renewable energy technologies. “ So what did Dr Dornan think of the Peabody Energy presentation? The short answer is, not much. Dornan said: I was not impressed. The presentation conflated the issue of energy poverty - on which the workshop was focused - with promotion of the coal industry. The presenter demonstrated a lack of understanding regarding the causes of energy poverty, falsely implying that an underlying reason for energy poverty is the cost of electricity supplied through the network which, according to the presenter, is more expensive due to investments in renewable technologies. Energy poverty involves people not having access to an electricity supply or to clean cooking technologies. In the case of electricity, it is primarily about the cost of connection, not about the price charged for ongoing supply of electricity by the utility, which is almost always cheaper than traditional fuels (such as kerosene) still used for lighting by un-electrified households. The claims by Peabody that reducing our reliance on coal in favour of low carbon technologies will cause energy poverty due to higher prices are inaccurate, without supporting evidence, and in this case, disingenuous. The primary argument made in the presentation was not robust, it was self-serving, and it was not backed by evidence. One of the slides presented to the workshop suggested there was a link between rising power prices in Spain and unemployment rates.  Dornan said this was a “textbook case of spurious correlation”, adding it was like showing rising divorce rates and falling smoking levels on the same graph and then trying to claim they were linked. Some thirteen of the slides presented to the G20 workshop are identical (with only the occasional image swap and the odd word edited) to slides presented at a meeting in Norway in June (check pages 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14, 17, 27, 29, 31, 33, 36, 37 if you’re interested). Peabody was in Norway to try and convince the Norwegian Government not to exclude coal and petroleum companies from its $893 billion pension fund. The Norwegian Government will decide later this year if “the exclusion of coal and petroleum companies is a more effective strategy for addressing climate issues and promoting future change than the exercise of ownership and exertion of influence”. But back to Brisbane (my home as it happens) where the city’s public relations arm – Brisbane Marketing – is preparing to host a series of “Global Cafe” talkfests as side-events to the G20. Peabody Energy is sole main sponsor of one of the five Global Cafe “themes” titled “Powering Future Economies – Energy”. Brisbane Marketing lists the British Broadcasting Corporation as a media partner for the coal-sponsored event. Peabody has also issued a video to promote a campaign it has dubbed “Lights On” which highlights the G20 meeting and asks for support to “urge world leaders to turn the lights on”. Almost nobody argues against the desperate need for the world’s poor to be able to access better technology to improve indoor air pollution and to be able to get access to electricity. The World Bank, the International Energy Agency and the United Nations are among those who say it’s an issue that needs to be urgently tackled. Peabody and other coal industry figures often quote those institutions in their energy poverty lobbying. They don’t quote the World Bank when it says: “Climate change is a fundamental threat to development in our lifetime. If we do not confront climate change, we will not end poverty”. The coal industry desperately wants to be part of conversations about the future – as long as those conversations don’t dwell too long on the climate change impacts of their product. In the energy poverty debate, the public needs to know where concern for the world’s poor stops and the coal industry’s profit motive starts.  That public includes Tony Abbott."
"The rise in sea levels seen over the past century is unmatched by any period in the past 6,000 years, according to a lengthy analysis of historical sea level trends. The reconstruction of 35,000 years of sea level fluctuations finds that there is no evidence that levels changed by more than 20cm in a relatively steady period that lasted between 6,000 years ago and about 150 years ago.  This makes the past century extremely unusual in the historical record, with about a 20cm rise in global sea levels since the start of the 20th century. Scientists have identified rising temperatures, which have caused polar ice to melt and thermal expansion of the sea, as a primary cause of the sea level increase. A two-decade-long collection of about 1,000 ancient sediment samples off Britain, north America, Greenland and the Seychelles formed the basis of the research, led by the Australian National University and published in PNAS. The 35,000-year span of the study was chosen as this comprises an interglacial period. Researchers could pick submerged sediments that may include tree roots, suggesting a previously lower sea level, or mollusks, which can be measured against the fossil record to determine the previous sea level. Ice started melting about 16,000 years ago, with this melting ending about 8,000 years ago. A slowdown in sea level changes didn’t occur until 6,000 years ago, however. “It’s like if you leave a big block of ice on the table, it doesn’t melt instantaneously, there’s always a delay in the system,” said Kurt Lambeck, who led the research at ANU. “We know from the last interglacial period that when temperatures were several degrees warmer than today there was a lot more water in the oceans, with levels around 4 to 5m higher than today. The question is how fast that change occurs when you increase temperatures.” Lambeck said the sea level increase of the past 100 years is “beyond dispute”, backed up by separate data from salt flats and also changes to the sea floor caused by the extra weight of water. “What we’ve seen is unusual, certainly unprecedented for these interglacial periods,” he said. “All the studies show that you can’t just switch off this process. Sea levels will continue to rise for some centuries to come even if we keep carbon emissions at present day levels. “What level that will get to, we are less sure about. But it’s clear we can’t just reverse the process overnight.”"
"There’s a new phrase in town. A growing number of governments, corporations and NGOs are using the term “climate-smart agriculture” to describe their activities. With climate change affecting farming worldwide, you might assume we should be celebrating this as a step in the right direction. But many organisations in the food movement are wary of – or even opposed to – this concept. They share growing concerns that the term is being used to green-wash practices that are, in fact, damaging for the climate and for farming. Many are worried that the promotion of “climate-smart agriculture” could end up doing more harm than good.  At the United Nations secretary general’s climate summit in New York last month, heads of state such as President Barack Obama referred to the need for “climate-smart” crops to weather the challenges ahead. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, announced the launch of the new Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture, involving governments, corporations, research institutes and NGOs. This was followed by announcements from McDonalds, which use 2% of the world’s beef, and Walmart, the world’s largest corporation, about their own “climate-smart” initiatives.  Proponents of “climate-smart agriculture” claim that their approaches aim to achieve a “triple win” of increasing food security, adaptation and mitigation. So far so good, right? Actually, no. There are no meaningful criteria for what can – or cannot – be called “climate-smart”. It may have a clever name, but there is nothing to ensure that the term climate-smart describes practices that are actually smart for the climate or for agriculture. The looseness of the term means that anyone can – and does – use it to describe their activities. No matter what the impact. Some organisations call their own agroecological (organic) approaches climate-smart. Indeed, such practices really are effective. However, other groups point out that the same agribusinesses that have done the most to cause climate change and make farmers and food systems vulnerable, are now also using the term, and re-branding their activities as climate-smart. A letter signed by more than 100 civil society organisations rejecting the newly-announced Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture, points out that industrial agriculture approaches that increase greenhouse gas emissions are all welcome to use the climate-smart label to promote their practices as solutions to climate change. “Yara (the world’s largest fertiliser manufacturer), Syngenta (GM seeds), McDonald’s, and Walmart are all at the climate-smart table,” the letter warns. “Climate-smart agriculture will serve as a new promotional space for the planet’s worst social and environmental offenders in agriculture.” The world’s largest peasant farmers’ movement, La Via Campesina, has rejected the concept as an effort to push an agribusiness agenda under a green mask. There is no doubt that food systems urgently need to adapt to changing weather patterns, and that certain parts of the food sector are major contributors to climate change. We need real solutions that replace harmful practices instead of promoting them. Above all, we need systemic change. But it is hard to envision that the corporations leading the climate-smart charge are really aiming for localised, low-input, agroecological food systems that they would no longer control. Last week, I met Gambian farmers who were excited by the immediate difference made to their crops when they stopped using synthetic fertilisers and started using agroecological strategies such as compost, manure and increased crop diversity. Their soils were visibly better, and the crops clearly healthier. This year the rains in The Gambia arrived nearly two months late. But these farmers feel confident that even if the rainy season ends early, the soils – now full of organic matter from the compost – will hold enough water to help the crops reach maturity. They say that if they had continued using fertilisers this year, their sandy soils would have dried out far more quickly. Such approaches, when combined with early warning systems that provide effective forecasting information and other risk reduction measures such as seed banks and water harvesting, can make a world of difference to farmers on the ground at a time when the climate is changing so unpredictably. We must avoid opening the door to false solutions under vague “climate-smart” rhetoric. Instead, we must be specific about investing in real resilience through agroecological adaptation solutions to climate change.

"In the economically flush days of 2007 as states prepared poker stances for an anticipated Kyoto II deal in Copenhagen, the EU’s climate and energy targets for 2020 were seen as a ‘me first!’ moment.  Six years later, the bloc’s sequel is already being denounced by the clean energy industry and environmentalists as a ‘why me?’ package that barely rises above the EU’s own ‘business as usual’ forecasts, and comes with caveats that could render it toothless.   The 20-20-20 benchmarks for 2020 – of 20% CO2 cuts, renewable energy share and efficiency gains – had appeared to offer global leadership. Reciprocal pledges were expected to allow a dynamic new US president to galvanise a coherent response to climate change.  The 40-27-27 goals for 2030 slow the EU’s pace of change and extend to renewable energy the one clear failure of the 2008 package – a ‘non-binding’ energy efficiency goal that the bloc looks set to miss. The one binding emissions cut in the package is a formula that negotiators hope to apply at the Paris climate summit in 2015, now talked of as a last chance to save the whole business of international climate talks under the auspices of the UN.   But some negotiators from the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group are privately despairing of the package, viewing it as a shift away from the EU’s ultimate commitment of an 80-95% cut in emissions by 2050. According to scientific projections, this is Europe’s minimum contribution to preventing catastrophic global warming. “This pledge is 10 years later than needed and does not meet our expectations of leadership nor what is required by the science to stay below a 2C increase,” said Dr Gary Theseira, of the Environmental Management and Climate Change Division of Malaysia’s climate ministry.  “It seems that the EU is not even aiming for a two degrees target anymore and that is incomprehensible for us in terms of the impacts it will have,” one LDC negotiator said, off the record.  Without explicit, binding pledges on energy efficiency and renewable energy, the EU’s end goals can seem wan and abstract abroad. The emissions trading system is now the bloc’s most meaningful market driver, but it would need to rise - perhaps by a factor of 10 - to spur significant fuel-switching. Senior commission sources freely admit that there is a political limit on how high the carbon price may go.  A surplus of 2.6bn allowances on the world’s carbon market will anyway whittle away the EU’s actual emissions cut from its headline figure to as little as 31%, according to NGOs like Carbon Market Watch. But even this may not be fully implemented if a clause in the 2030 package is activated, as environmentalists fear.  The first bullet point in the 2030 package document says that “the European Council calls on all countries to come forward with ambitious targets and policies well in advance of the Conference of Parties (COP21) in Paris. It will revert to this issue after the Paris conference. The European Council will keep all the elements of the framework under review.”  At a press conference last night, the European Council president Herman Van Rompuy insisted that this did not imply a watering down of EU commitments. “You can be sure that what was decided now will be maintained and will not go below what was agreed,” he said. But scepticism is rife.  Industry groups in Brussels have invested heavily in promoting the argument that Europe has a population more than twice the size of the US, but represents only 11% of the world’s emissions. It cannot save the planet on its own, and its industries could be driven out of business if they try to do so – by cheaper and dirtier competitors. Action should thus be postponed until everyone moves at a similar pace. The EU’s relative deceleration accommodates this argument.  One practical problem with this is that decarbonisation requires an enormous impetus to restructure homes, travel, agriculture, jobs and ways of life, which becomes cheaper as the energy chain is transformed. Postponing action makes it more jolting and expensive – as new fossil fuel plants are built and locked into future energy supplies. The EU’s 40% target has already been dismissed as “too little, too late” to meet the 2C target by the vice-chair of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Prof Jim Skea, who says that it will involve a superhuman effort between 2030-2050 that defies models of cost-effective decarbonisation.  But another problem is that emerging economies such as China – now the world’s biggest CO2 emitter – are unlikely to make these kinds of efforts in the absence of proof that nations more responsible for historic emissions, are doing their fair share – and helping to create an economic opportunity for others as they go.  The sad logic of the package agreed in Brussels on Thursday night is that Europe may not be the only COP party today looking at the short-term costs of decarbonisation and asking ‘why me?’."
"Australia has been fighting about climate policy for almost 10 years. Most people wish the argument would go away. Investors just wish they knew the outcome. After repealing the carbon “tax” and winning parliamentary backing for its “Direct Action” scheme this week, the Coalition says we have an answer to last 20 years. But that’s not true. The Abbott government has deferred the most controversial element of its own policy – the bit likely to determine whether it can succeed, and the bit that the government would prefer not to talk about.   The government likes to discuss its $2.55bn emissions reduction fund, insisting this is sufficient to meet our immediate international pledge to cut greenhouse emissions by 5% by 2020. (Actually, in a sensible debate the question should be can Direct Action cut our emissions and set us up for the far, far deeper cuts we will have to make after 2020, but the Australian climate debate long ago parted company with sense.) Environment minister Greg Hunt says he is sure the fund can meet the 5% target, for three reasons: 1. His feelings. Pressed about how he could be sure the target would be reached he spoke about his “confidence” and his “commitment”. He strongly suggested the government had not done any modelling to counter the conclusions of previous modelling exercises which found Direct Action - with its spending capped at $2.5bn over five years – would fall far short. 2. The fact that he will soon reveal the job has become far easier, before his policy has even started. In 2012 the promise to reduce emissions by 5% of 2000 levels by 2020 was calculated to require the cumulative reduction of 755m tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Last year new government calculations reduced that figure to 431m tonnes. Now calculations by Frontier Economics say the figure could be as low as 225m tonnes, if the renewable energy target (RET) stays in place to drive investment into clean generation, or somewhere around 300m tonnes if the government succeeds in paring back the RET. Official figures are soon likely to confirm this drop. 3. The fact that he has information suggesting that when he calls for tenders, lots of companies and projects will bid to reduce their emissions far more cheaply than he originally calculated. His original calculation was that he could buy emission reductions for about $15 a tonne. Maths would suggest that if Hunt needs to find 300m tones of abatement and it costs him $15 per tonne, he’s going to need a few more billion dollars than he has. Even at $10 a tonne he could fall short – if the emissions reduction fund is the only thing driving down Australia’s output of greenhouse gases. But Hunt’s press release hailing his success in getting Direct Action through the Senate says the emissions reduction fund will “help” Australia meet its target. It doesn’t say what else might be “helping”, since the government wants to dramatically reduce the RET and abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.  But hidden in the mountain of detail rushed through parliament on Thursday night are some largely unnoticed provisions that suggest the emissions reduction fund might not have to do the job on its own, depending on yet another climate policy argument that the Coalition has effectively deferred. The legislation requires Hunt to develop “safeguards” to make sure businesses not seeking money from the fund don’t increase their emissions and undo all the reductions the government is buying. He will set baselines that emitters are not allowed to exceed. But the government’s white paper says that “in the unlikely event of baselines being exceeded” he could allow the offending companies to make up for it by “purchasing credits created by other accredited emissions reduction projects”. And an amendment passed on Thursday at the behest of Senator Xenophon said that in this situation, the companies could also buy permits from overseas – despite all the government’s rhetoric about how offshore permits are akin to sinking money into dodgy deals in Kazakhstan. The white paper also says that companies that promise a certain quantity of reductions in return for money from the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund, but then don’t manage to live up to their promises, could buy credits from companies that reduce emissions by more than they had envisaged. Hunt fobs off questions about how this is obviously a potential basis for a type of emissions trading scheme by saying the government will get “zero revenue” from its policy. But the scenarios are all about businesses buying permits from other businesses, so the government would never expect to get money, and it would still be a carbon market. It could also amount to nothing at all if Hunt sets the “baselines’ to allow Australian industry to continue with business as usual. And this is an internal fight he is yet to have. Guardian Australia understands that when cabinet originally considered the detail of Direct Action there were some around the table not keen on having “safeguards” at all. In the end the issue was put off, the fine print to be decided later. On Wednesday, the Reputex analytical firm calculated that “on its own” the emissions reduction fund would achieve about one third of the emissions reduction needed to meet Australia’s target. But if the “safeguards” were allowed to operate like a baseline and credit scheme, the target could be achieved. Danny Price, who runs Frontier Economics and is co-chair of an expert panel advising Hunt on Direct Action, says Reputex is overly pessimistic about what the emissions reduction fund can do. But he agrees that if the government sets lax baselines for big carbon emitters, the fund might struggle. “There is no certainty around where the baselines will be set,” he says. “But it makes no sense to leave them at a level where existing emitters don’t have to do anything at all. And we could be far more certain we would reach the target if existing emitters were forced to invest in emission reductions.”  In their submissions to government, the big emitters, not surprisingly, see things differently. But the decisions about the baselines are going to be made at the same time as the government is learning exactly what abatement can be bought with Direct Action, and at the same time as it will be coming under strong pressure to do more about Australia’s emissions internationally. And that means even after the carbon tax repeal, and the establishment of Greg Hunt’s new fund, and all the bitterness and shouting, the climate policy fight is still not done."
"A UN proposal that would see small island states offered debt relief to pay for climate change contains a “fundamentally unjust” blind spot, according to development groups.  But advocates see the idea as an innovative way to increase the money available for climate change adaptation in the most vulnerable states.  The UN Development Programme (UNDP) is working on an initiative that would see rich countries write off debt owed to them by Small Island Developing States (Sids) in exchange for the money being spent on climate change adaptation. But development agencies are concerned the proposal conflates legitimate and illegitimate debt. Tim Gore, Oxfam’s global head of policy for food and climate change says: “They are two separate issues and just merging the two, you could argue, is one way to let developed countries off the hook.” “It’s definitely an interesting proposal, but I think it’s fundamentally unjust,” says Alex Scrivener, a policy officer for the World Development Movement. “There’s a big difference between the climate debt accrued by rich countries as a result of their emitting CO2 over a long period of time and the often unjust debt which has been accrued by poorer countries,” he says.  Unjust debt, says Scrivener, is often “dictator debt” – money lent by rich countries to poor countries ruled by strongmen, who commonly used it to finance military ventures or vast follies. It is estimated at US$735bn and makes up almost one fifth of the total debt owed by the developing world. But the only Sids with dictator debt is Haiti, says Gail Hurley, a UNDP development finance specialist. According to a UNDP briefing paper seen by the Guardian, average debt in Sids is 64.3% of GDP, compared to a developing world average of 34.4%. Only five (Comoros, Haiti, Sao Tome and Principe, Guinea-Bissau and Guyana) out of 39 Sids qualify for debt relief, not including the three Pacific nations considered most vulnerable – Kiribati, Tonga and Tuvalu. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned earlier this year that even if global temperatures rise to the agreed “safe” boundary of 2C, small island states would still need costly adaptation measures to avoid losing homes and livelihoods.  But Hurley says these expenses are prohibitive for small island economies regardless of their debt or income level: “Small economies just do not have the resources because the upfront costs [of adaptation] are too great.”  Due to their disproportionate contribution to climate change, industrialised countries agreed to provide $100bn per year to the Green Climate Fund by 2020. However, donor pledges have so far fallen pitifully short. After the recent climate summit in New York, where the fund more than doubled, the pledged total is still only $2.3bn. Where is the Green Climate Fund after today? Source: Oxfam pic.twitter.com/qi166lwUUN According to Hurley, nature debt swaps in Central America and the Caribbean “have worked well and have helped increase expenditures in key environmental and conservation programmes”. In 2006, the US wrote off $24m of Guatemalan debt. In return, the Guatemalan government created the Maya Biosphere Reserve, which at 2.4m hectares is the largest protected area in the Maya rainforest. However, rich countries could try to count debt swaps as part of their Official Development Assistance (ODA). “This means that unless donors increase their overall aid envelope (which typically they don’t) other developing countries can lose out in the form of less aid,” says Hurley. Debt swaps are also highly technical and generally involve small amounts of money, often making them more trouble than they are worth. “It’s probably safer to reject this scheme,” says Scrivener. “In its current form, it’s a distraction. In fact, it’s worse than that; it’s a way for rich countries to claim: ‘Oh look, we’re doing something about this’ in the run up to COP21, without actually putting any money where their mouths are.” Gore is more open to the idea. “We have to be cautious about setting a precedent of allowing debt relief to be counted as climate finance,” he says. “We are in this space where developed countries are trying to broaden evermore the definition of what they can and can’t count as climate finance. [Swaps] should be separate from and in addition to the public climate finance that developed countries are responsible for providing under the UNFCCC [Green Climate Fund]. If those two things were met then I think it’s a really strong proposal and the kind of innovative thinking that is really required.”  Ronald Jumeau, the Seychelles UN representative, says his country broadly agrees with the concept of debt swaps – the Seychelles is pursuing an $80m swap to finance the creation of a marine protected area, covering 30% of the country’s seas. “Seychelles believes that climate adaption for debt swaps is more than debt relief – it’s a way of taking the narrative of victimhood and replacing it with one of dynamism, fighting for a solution for islands,” he says. But he agreed that debt swaps should not be used to dilute the developed world’s commitment to climate finance.  “While some may suspect that developed countries are using alternative sources of funding as a way out of their commitments, they serve as a testament that even the commitment of $100bn is not enough.” This article was corrected on 23/10/14 to reflect that almost all small island states are not subject to “dictator debt” and that this type of debt is not a part of the UNDP proposal.

"Direct Action is the brand name of the freshly minted Australian Government policy to try and reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. But with a name that sounds more like a dodgy box of laundry powder, Australia’s “Direct Action” is unlikely to leave the country looking any cleaner or smelling any fresher in the climate change stakes.  That’s because instead of removing the many stubborn stains that fossil fuel use leaves on the planet’s climate systems, Australia’s box of Direct Action comes with added coal dust. How can it be seen otherwise when in the same week that Australia’s Senate passed the Direct Action legislation, the finance minister Mathias Cormann told parliament “coal is good”? Cormann was responding to a question from Greens senator Larissa Waters who had pointed out that in India, coal burned in power plants was so good it was responsible for killing an estimated 80,000 to 115,000 people a year. Cormann’s immediate response to this grim statistic was to smile and say “coal is good” before going on to tout the industry’s new public relations line that their product will bring prosperity to the world.  This just a couple of weeks after prime minister Tony Abbott told us “coal is good for humanity” and the treasurer Joe Hockey similarly spruiked the coal industry’s sudden concern for the world’s poor. The now passed Direct Action legislation will create a $2.5bn pool (actually, only $1.15bn is so far allocated in forward budget estimates for this emissions reduction fund to 2017/18) to pay for projects that will lower emissions. Companies will make bids into the cash pool for projects (examples might be soil carbon projects, efficiency measures at power stations or indigenous land management projects) and in a reverse-auction, the government will buy the cheapest emissions cuts. The government insists this will be enough to meet the promised target of a five percent cut in emissions by 2020 based on their levels in 2000. Except almost every analysis carried out into the Direct Action approach to meeting the target has said it will fall well short.  The latest from analysts Reputex said for the plan to meet the target, you would need between $3.3bn and $6bn extra per year. In any case, the Climate Change Authority has already said this target – regardless of the policy used to get there – is “inadequate” in an international context and should be roughly tripled. Tripled. Remembering too that while the repealed carbon price legislation was based on the “polluter pays” principle, Direct Action asks taxpayers to pay for companies to cut their emissions.  If major polluting companies don’t want to take part in the scheme, they can just ignore it. Was there ever a climate change policy more symbolic in its likely failure than one that could only be passed with the help of a minor political party led by a man who wants to dig 40 million tonnes of coal a year for about 30 years out of Queensland’s Galilee Basin (emitting an estimated 3,291 million tonnes of CO2-e into the atmosphere in the process)? In short, Direct Action is a climate change policy that fails to have any impact on the key drivers of climate change – coal and other fossil fuels. A policy that really did act directly on the issue would look to drive the growth of renewable energy, raise ambition on targets to cut emissions and cut the amount of coal and other fossil fuels being burned (it would also cut emissions from the transport sector – Australia is a virtual policy wasteland in this area). While the Abbott government is delivering a policy that leaves the fossil fuel industry untouched, it carries out free advertising for coal and approves projects to expand coal extraction and exports. Rather than rejoicing at the steady growth of renewables in the electricity sector, the government looks to castrate the policy driving the change. The government’s policy response to climate change is like trying to reduce lung cancer rates while neglecting to ask people to smoke less cigarettes. Or, if you like, Direct Action expects you to get your washing clean with a laundry powder made from crushed up lumps of coal. "

"Political inertia, financial short-termism and vested fossil fuel interests have formed a “toxic triangle” that threatens to push up global temperatures, putting 400 million people at risk of hunger and drought by 2060, Oxfam said on Friday, a week before an EU summit to finalise a new climate and energy policy framework. In its Food, Fossil Fuels and Filthy Finance report, Oxfam warned that EU leaders must resist pressure from the fossil fuel industry, which spends at least €44m (£35m) a year on lobbying the European bloc. The report also urged leaders to commit to cuts of at least 55% in carbon dioxide emissions, energy savings of at least 40%, and an increase in the use of sustainable renewable energy to at least 45% of the energy mix.  EU leaders meet in Brussels on 23-24 October to agree targets for emissions cuts by 2030, deployment of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. The meeting comes ahead of the UN climate change conference in Paris next year. The leaders are expected to agree an emissions cut target of 40% from 1990 levels, but Oxfam said this would not be enough for Europe to make a fair contribution to tackling climate change. The EU emits about 10% of global carbon dioxide. “The fossil fuel industry has conjured a toxic triangle that is trapping us into a warming world. Governments and investors are helping the industry to recklessly protect its own profits at the expense of us all. The world’s poorest are already being hit hardest and millions more will be made hungry by climate change,” the Oxfam chief executive, Mark Goldring, said. Oxfam says the “toxic triangle” supported spending of more than $674bn (£423bn) on fossil fuels in 2012. Investment in the industry was propped up by tax breaks, government incentives and an estimated $1.9tn of subsidies a year. More than $500,000 a day was being spent on lobbying US and EU governments, it says. Progress has been made, the report says, citing the proposal of the US president, Barack Obama, to cut carbon emissions in the power sector by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030, and discussions in China on “an absolute carbon cap” after 2016. “These commitments and proposals all demonstrate that the international community is beginning to wake up to the reality of climate change and adopt the necessary rhetoric. Yet carbon emission reduction offers on the table so far are not significant enough to advance the necessary transition, and thereby shift private and public finance accordingly,” the report says. Stephen Tindale, an associate fellow at the Centre for European Reform, argued in a September report that “inefficient fossil fuel subsidies” needed to be stopped in Europe, in line with a G20 commitment made in 2009. “Ending them will save or raise substantial sums for governments. Spending on energy efficiency is economically efficient as well as socially beneficial. And investment in new energy technologies will enable European companies to compete in export markets. European governments should give much of the revenue from the phasing out of direct and indirect subsidies for hydrocarbons to the Green Climate Fund,” he wrote. The UN’s Green Climate Fund aims to help developing nations tackle the consequences of climate change, such as increased flooding, and invest in cleaner energy. Oxfam says fossil fuel companies would spend about $6tn to develop the industry over the next decade, despite fossil fuels being responsible for 80% of carbon dioxide emissions and the main contributor to climate change, which threatens health, property, food, businesses and economic growth. It says this investment is flawed, because regulation limiting warming to 2C could leave $300bn of fossil fuel assets stranded, bursting the “carbon bubble” and leaving savers and long-term investors out of pocket. Oxfam urges governments to phase out fossil fuel emissions and introduce sustainable renewable energy for all by early in the second half of the century. It also wants governments to shift investment to renewables, energy efficiency and policies to make sure the poorest people are able to access energy. It argues for more transparency around lobbying and urges governments to “climate proof” the global financial system by reviewing risk, improving transparency and providing capital for low-carbon investment. Fossil fuel and energy-intensive companies in the private sector must diversify their business models to embrace a low-carbon future, and investors should put money into low-carbon development and challenge firms that pursue high-carbon strategies, it says. “If fossil fuel use globally continues unabated, severe climate change impacts on the poorest people will be unavoidable. Despite apparent global aspirations to keep global warming below 2C – and associated commitments from a range of countries – so far this has not been sufficient to achieve the necessary financial shift away from fossil fuels and into clean energy alternatives,” the report says. “This ‘toxic triangle’ of political inertia, financial short-termism and vested fossil fuel interests must be broken if the world is to seize the multiple opportunities – in rich and poor countries alike – for a low-carbon transition.”"
"The Amazon rainforest has degraded to the point where it is losing its ability to benignly regulate weather systems, according to a stark new warning from one of Brazil’s leading scientists. In a new report, Antonio Nobre, researcher in the government’s space institute, Earth System Science Centre, says the logging and burning of the world’s greatest forest might be connected to worsening droughts – such as the one currently plaguing São Paulo – and is likely to lead eventually to more extreme weather events.  The study, which is a summary drawing from more than 200 existing papers on Amazonian climate and forest science, is intended as a wake-up call. “I realised the problem is much more serious than we realised, even in academia and the reason is that science has become so fragmented. Atmospheric scientists don’t look at forests as much as they should and vice versa,” said Nobre, who wrote the report for a lay audience. “It’s not written in academic language. I don’t need to preach to the converted. Our community is already very alarmed at what is going on.” A draft seen by the Guardian warns that the “vegetation-climate equilibrium is teetering on the brink of the abyss.” If it tips, the Amazon will start to become a much drier savanna, which calamitous consequences. The Amazon works as a giant pump, channeling moisture inland via aerial rivers and rainclouds that form over the forest more dramatically than over the sea, the author says. It also provides a buffer against extreme weather events, such as tornados and hurricanes. In the past 20 years, the author notes that the Amazon has lost 763,000 sq km, an area the size of two Germanys. In addition another 1.2m sq km has been estimated as degraded by cutting below the canopy and fire. As a result, the report notes, the deterioration of the rainforest – through logging, fires and land clearance – has resulted in a decrease in forest transpiration and a lengthening of dry seasons. This might be one of the factors of the severe drought affecting south-east Brazil. São Paulo – the biggest city in South America – is facing its worst water shortages in almost a century. October, which is usually the start of the rainy season, was drier than at any time since 1930, leaving the volume of the Cantareira reservoir system down to 5% of capacity. “Studies more than 20 years ago predicted what is happening with lowering rainfall. Amazon deforestation is altering climate. It is no longer about models. It is about observation,” said Nobre. “The connection with the event in São Paulo is important because finally people are paying attention.” Nobre calls for a “war effort” to reverse the damage and secure the global climate and security of future generations. This would involve a ramped-up effort to immediately halt existing deforestation and a major new project to replant trees. Whether the government listens, however, is another matter. Forest clearance has accelerated under Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff, after efforts to protect the Amazon were weakened. Last month, satellite data indicated a 190% surge in deforestation in August and September. The influence of the “ruralista” agribusiness lobby in Congress has also grown in recent years, making it harder for the authorities to push through new legislation to demarcate reserves. “They have taken good action in the past,” says Nobre. ““I hope they will listen now”."

"Greg Hunt vows emissions trading is dead and won’t be revived for 20 years or more. But he has quietly given himself the power to bring back a form of carbon trading, and he has advice that if he doesn’t use it, Australia cannot meet the climate promises it has made to the world. The seeds of an emissions trading scheme are buried in the deal Hunt did with crossbench senators. And the power for them to bloom into a new form of carbon trading also rests with him.  The catch is, if he doesn’t allow this to happen, Australia is very unlikely to meet its 2020 emissions reduction targets, and has almost no chance of meeting the deeper targets it will have to commit to after that. In a few years the minister is very likely to face a choice – break the Coalition’s promise never to introduce any form of carbon price, or break Australia’s promise to the world about how much we would reduce greenhouse emissions. Despite the minister’s denials, his own scheme and amendments he developed with independent senator Nick Xenophon clearly leave the way open for him to develop a baseline and credit-style emissions trading scheme in two ways. The first is through the “safeguards” he will develop to make sure businesses not seeking money from his “direct action” fund don’t increase their emissions and undo all the reductions the government is buying. The idea is to set baselines that emitters are not allowed to exceed. But Hunt’s own white paper says that “in the unlikely event of baselines being exceeded” he could allow the offending companies to make up for it by “purchasing credits created by other accredited emissions reduction projects”. The white paper also says that companies that promise a certain quantity of reductions in return for money from the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund, but then don’t manage to live up to their promises, could buy credits from companies that reduce emissions by more than they had envisaged. Whenever he is asked whether this means Direct Action could morph into a baseline and credit scheme, Hunt always fobs off the question with the same answer – that the government will get “zero revenue” from its policy. But neither of the trading scenarios envisaged in the white paper – a business that exceeds its baseline buying a credit from another business, or a business that fails to achieve all the emission reductions it has promised buying a credit from another business – would result in the government receiving money. And it would still be a carbon market. The “zero revenue” line is true, but it avoids the real question. Obviously, Hunt could squash this market before it ever started by setting the baselines so high that no company would ever exceed them and find itself in need of buying a credit. But there a few reasons this may prove difficult. First, there are established ways of setting the baselines and scrutinising them, and under the Xenophon amendments the rules governing them can be disallowed by parliament. Second, analysts agree that without some real limit on total emissions, Australia stands little chance of meeting its target of reducing emissions by 5% by 2020, let alone the deeper post-2020 target we will have to announce next year. This is especially true after Tony Abbott rejected Xenophon’s suggestion that some of the emissions reduction fund be set aside to buy cheaper international carbon permits if the target was starting to look difficult to achieve. It is understood Hunt was in favour of this idea, as are large sections of the business community and the environment movement, but it was vetoed by the prime minister (who once described buying international permits as being like sending “money … offshore into dodgy carbon farms in Equatorial Guinea and Kazakhstan”..). It was also rejected by the Palmer United Party. Xenophon says the rejection of international permits is a “bizarre, ideological decision”. He also says the Direct Action scheme could easily become a “springboard’ to a baseline and credit scheme, “depending on the emission baselines”. And he says that if Hunt made the baselines too easy to comply with, “there’s no way Australia can meet its target”. On Wednesday, the Reputex analytical firm said it calculated that “on its own” the emissions reduction fund would achieve about one third of the emissions reduction needed to meet Australia’s target. But the firm, which has been close to the negotiating process – its press release about the deal came before Hunt and Palmer had announced it – added that “while the ERF alone will fall short of Australia’s 5% emissions target”, the “ongoing design of the safeguards mechanism will buy the government time to address any emissions shortfall”. “The safeguard mechanism is likely to operate akin to a baseline and credit scheme,” the company said. Hunt says he’s “confident” Australia will meet its target because the decline of manufacturing means emissions are falling without the government doing anything, and because he thinks he’ll be able to buy emission reductions cheaper than he first thought. But most observers – and all available modelling exercises (the government hasn’t done any) – are confident he’s wrong. If he is, the government is going to face some difficult choices. And one of them will involve emissions trading."

"Last week Owen Paterson gave a predictable speech. He was careful to avoid complete denial of climate-change science, his analysis was laced with some fair points, but his unspoken conclusion was dangerous. He would like to believe that climate change is not as bad as “the green blob” makes it out to be. And I would really like to be able to agree with him. It would just be easier. Because for most people including me, the heart of the climate debate is not scientific, it’s psychological. We don’t want to face up to a seemingly overwhelming truth if it’s not right in front of us. If there’s no solution, or the solutions take time to get right, then we’d rather not hear about the problem. Or the crucial climate talks coming up this week, this year and next.  Last Thursday I chose not to avoid it – I was sitting in my office with a man who experiences climate change every day. Yet it wasn’t depressing. I count myself lucky to know Voltaire Alferez, a Christian Aid partner from the Philippines. Voltaire is surprisingly upbeat for someone whose job it is to coordinate 43 organisations in a country being swallowed by the sea to persuade the Patersons of the world that climate change really is the problem of this century. He jokes, he thanks the British government for the action we’ve taken to help his country deal with climate change. He has a young baby who he is looking forward to returning home to. He is clearly proud of the beauty of his country: “We have over 7,000 islands – you should visit before they all disappear!” For Voltaire, the heart of the climate change debate is not political or psychological – it’s practical. How do we help people adapt to a lifestyle that has already been disrupted by environmental change? It’s a practical issue in this country too. Farmers in my own constituency know that the seasons are changing. Harvest is creeping backwards. This is mild. In the Philippines there used to be around 25 typhoons a year. There are now more than 40 – and they are getting stronger. In Kenya, Christian Aid partners are sending texts to farmers to help them cope with increasingly unpredictable weather. When you are a subsistence farmer, this practical intervention is life or death. Despite the compromises the Liberal Democrats have had to make in government, our action has made a tangible difference. All new homes will be green, zero carbon homes from 2016. We’ve created the world’s first Green Investment Bank. Ed Davey has led internationally, as world leaders prepare to choose whether to limit their carbon emissions as much as we honestly need to. The immediate practical action we need to take is clear. One: politicians need to keep our climate change targets reflecting the scale of the challenge we face. This Wednesday and Thursday, EU leaders will get together to agree the carbon reduction that the EU should achieve by 2030. NGOs tell me that 55% is a fair amount, and the UK government position is strong at 50%. But the deal is not even yet at 40%. The prime minister must push for an EU target of at least 40% so we still have some hope of an honest ambition. Two: we need to help people like Voltaire and the organisations that really do reduce the health risk of climate change. The government is providing more than £3.8bn of funding to the developing world. At least £1bn of this needs to go to the international Green Climate Fund, which will open in November. We need to make sure the latest science is linked up to the latest campaigning. But that will not mean inaction. I will be encouraging my colleagues (of all parties) to put climate change back on their to-do lists. Individually we can all take action – in more positive and effective ways than ever before. With organisations and campaigns such as For the Love of exploiting the best that the internet has to offer, we’ve got an unprecedented opportunity to speak publicly, and collectively, to turn the tide. We’ve seen the biggest climate marches this year, worldwide. Businesses are shouting loudly about the threat to profit that climate poses. The economic and social case is clear. But the third choice, between despair and denial is overwhelmingly clear: add your voice and find the organisation that will speak it the loudest."
"Climate change activists will aim to give the big banks a $200m bloody nose on Saturday, in the latest round of what has been an increasingly bitter campaign to force the divestment of companies with fossil fuel interests. A “national day of divestment” will see more than 1,000 bank customers switch their accounts away from the “big four” banks: ANZ, Westpac, Commonwealth Bank and NAB.  Campaign organisers Market Forces and 350.org claim that the major banks have already lost $250m worth of business from customers in the past year due to their continued financing of fossil fuel projects. They estimate a further $200m will be stripped away on Saturday, deriving the figure from total assets including loans and insurance. The day of action follows the rancour that greeted the Australian National University’s decision to divest from seven resource companies for ethical reasons. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, called the move “stupid”, while Christopher Pyne, the education minister, labelled it “bizarre”. Jamie Briggs, the assistant infrastructure minister, has written to Ian Young, vice-chancellor of ANU, to urge him to reconsider the divestment, claiming that it damages the reputation of Santos, one of the blacklisted companies. Divestment activists claim the furious reaction to ANU’s divestment shows that the campaign to financially undermine the fossil fuel industry is being taken seriously. Last year an academic and climate activist, Bill McKibben, who has led a forerunner divestment campaign in the US, visited Australia and called for similar action. McKibben argued that the majority of Australian coal must stay in the ground if the world is to keep to its goal of a 2 degrees Celsius temperature rise, adding that if you invest in fossil fuels “you’re betting that we’re going to tank the Earth”. A year on and a flurry of organisations have recently divested or distanced themselves from fossil fuels, including Bendigo Bank, Local Government Super, the Perth Anglican Diocese, the Canberra Anglican Diocese, the Australian National University, Moreland City Council and Anglican National Super. The University of Sydney is reviewing its involvement with coal mining projects, while campaigners are confident other institutions are set to follow suit. Australia’s union movement has indicated to Guardian Australia that it, too, supports change in energy investment. “Investment in the clean energy industry is vital if Australia is to create and capitalise on the high skilled, innovative, clean tech jobs of the future,” said Ged Kearney, the ACTU president. “The ACTU would encourage all superannuation funds to consider investment choices in light of their social and responsible investment policies.” Julien Vincent, lead campaigner for Market Forces, said: “This campaign is most definitely gathering pace. I’ve been unable to keep up with all the divestment announcements. Fund managers were talking about climate change for a while and now we are starting to see the results. “I know there are institutions talking about divesting, they are concerned from a climate and financial standpoint. We had no idea we’d be in this position a year ago, when it was just a couple of dozen of us in front of ANZ in Bourke Street in Melbourne. “Tony Abbott is already on the wrong side of history when it comes to climate change. ANU is a sign that the campaign is gathering momentum and that it has the government scared.” While the campaign has got activists and some students energised, the financial fortunes of the energy industry are tied to several competing market factors. The depressed price of coal and China’s new 6% tariff on imported coal are probably more likely to concern the industry, and the banks, than a few people shifting their accounts. “Climate risk is becoming well understood in mainstream capital markets but divestment is just one response investors will make,” said Nathan Fabian, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change. “Energy markets are in transition globally, climate regulation is changing rapidly and the level of risk is very high for investors. Tony Abbott saying coal is good for humanity is an unfortunate simplification of what’s a tectonic shift in energy markets. “Coal company equity values are down by more than 50% in the last two years and a lot of them have a lot of debt. There are serious issues for the market. “There are many different levers moving at the same time and no individual lever gets the outcome. But consumer action sends a signal. People moving their accounts or pension funds because of climate change is significant.” The divestment campaign has been most noticeable when targeted at individual projects, such as the Maules Creek mine in NSW and the Abbot Point coal terminal, which will sit alongside the Great Barrier Reef. But beyond the placards and fury, the mining industry insists that the hard-nosed investment decisions will continue to be made in favour of Australia’s abundant coal and the world’s growing energy needs. “The minerals industry will always take seriously any effort that is explicitly designed to stigmatise or demonise the industry,” said Brendan Pearson, chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia. “The divestment campaign certainly has all the features of a stunt but we will respond to it with characteristic vigour. “Publicity does not equal impact. To date, all the empirical evidence suggests that the campaign has been more effective in securing coverage than it has in convincing the vast majority of investors and fund managers to divest from the resources sector.” Pearson said investment managers were “smarter than the activists give them credit for”. “They will focus on the medium to long term and the outlook for the resources sector, including coal, is very positive,” he said. “All authoritative commodity forecasting agencies agree on that.” "
"The Great Barrier Reef is not a museum piece that can be preserved or maintained in any kind of constant state. To talk about keeping it as it is or protecting it in a particular form is a total absurdity. Having dived almost every major section of the reef from the top of Cape York to reefs more than 200 kilometres off Bundaberg, with scientists on various expeditions, I can vouch for the fact that it is never the same from one hour to the next, let alone across years or decades. A popular tourist reef can go from sublime to smashed in the blink of a cyclone. Crown of Thorns starfish have always munched through vast swathes of coral and flood plumes loaded with sediment from big wet seasons have been smothering inshore reefs for millennia.  Destruction and regeneration are the reef’s two great constants. But before industry, cities, fishing, sugar cane, land clearing for grazing, pesticides, fertilisers, coal ports and tourism, the reef had the capacity to recover after a natural disaster. Now that resilience is threatened.  The Academy of Science is right to call foul on the management of governments at all levels to cover up the reef’s problems and ignore solutions. The Reef 2050 long term sustainability plan fails to tackle the real action needed to allow the Great Barrier Reef to be the global marvel that it still is, and always should be.  If the federal and Queensland governments are serious about managing the reef instead of producing a greenwash report that does not have the backing of the nation’s leading reef experts, here are some critical actions they need to take. Empower the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) to be a fierce advocate for the reef’s wellbeing. For too many years, critics have said GBRMPA plays a dead bat when dealing with governments, industry and other stakeholders. The authority has felt a blowtorch of dismay from environmentalists and scientists over the process of approval for the Abbot Point coal terminal, and the impact of dredging. The authority’s culture needs a complete reboot to make it fearlessly independent again. Of all the things that can be done to ensure the reef’s good health, the most important is to unleash a powerful body with a mandate to better manage the marine park. Do not allow massive and controversial compromises to the marine ecosystem, such as dredging and mismanagement of spoil. This is especially the case for industries, such as coal, that at a global level pose an existential threat to the reef. The Australian Coral Reef Society is also likely to make its submission to the commonwealth’s sustainability report this week. It will emphasise its wish to prevent dumping of dredge spoils on or near the reef rather than having protection zones as per the current plan. It will also call for all environmental impact processes to do with the reef to be completely impartial.  Drive Australia towards a stronger future of renewable energy and use the Great Barrier Reef as a flagship for reducing our reliance on coal at home and as an export. A senior scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, Janice Lough, was unequivocal when she spoke at the recent Australian Coral Reef Society conference in Brisbane: “The human influence on global climate is now clear. Between 1950 and the first six months of 2014, the atmospheric concentration of the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, increased by 100 parts per million.” By exporting so much of the world’s coal we are inevitably importing the destruction of our most precious ecosystems. Introduce tighter controls on agriculture for all catchments that flow into the Great Barrier Reef. The powerful sugarcane and beef cattle grazing industries need to do more to stop pesticides and nutrients reaching the reef. As a marine park authority water quality report says:  “Beef cattle grazing on the large, dry catchments adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (in particular the Burdekin and Fitzroy) have involved extensive land clearing and over-grazing during drought conditions. Widespread soil erosion occurred, and associated nutrients have drained into the Great Barrier Reef. Cropping, particularly sugarcane, involves intensive fertiliser use and has created substantial soil erosion. As a result, large quantities of nutrients and sediment have been discharged into the Great Barrier Reef. Pesticide residues from cotton and sugarcane cultivation may pose a threat in some inshore waters.” Fast track the establishment of management plans for the Coral Sea Marine Reserve. At just over 1m square kilometres, this is the biggest single gazetted marine park in the world, but the Abbott government has suspended its operation pending a review of federal marine parks. It is vital to the health of the Great Barrier Reef because the two are oceanic next-door neighbours and their ecosystems depend on each other as species move from one park to the other. Huge populations of pelagic fish such as shark and tuna live and travel between the Coral Sea and the Great Barrier Reef and are at risk of over-exploitation by commercial fishers.  Introduce stricter fishing controls to stop the Great Barrier Reef’s food chain being disturbed. This is critically important not just for commercial but also recreational fishers. The removal of big predatory fish by commercial and recreational fishers has a massive flow-on effect for the reef ecosystem. Ensure standards for managing ships passing through the marine park are maintained and improved. The marine park authority says shipping traffic in the park includes more than 7,000 voyages made by more than 2,000 ships. And this is expected to increase as Queensland’s mining boom continues. Since 1987 there have been more than 700 incidents of shipping or marine pollution and numerous close calls. A huge oil spill in the Great Barrier Reef has the potential to be a globally significant catastrophe. Restore and increase marine science research budgets as a matter of high priority. Too many intelligent and capable young scientists have come out of master’s and doctoral programs with vast knowledge of the Great Barrier Reef, but are now unemployed. These researchers need to be deployed across the marine park to make sure we have the best available science to manage the reef and mitigate human impacts. Managing crown-of-thorns starfish. One school of thought is that extra nutrients lead to an explosion in the populations of the starfish larvae. The animals have always been present on the reef but it is possible that outbreaks are now more severe and more frequent. These outbreaks are one of the single greatest causes of coral mortality and so need to be managed, perhaps through greater use of divers on specific reefs from which outbreaks are known to spread, given the job of killing them. This is particularly important to the tourism industry. Boost research into possible actions to assist environments threatened by climate change. Although this is a controversial point, if the effects of climate change are as severe as predicted then it is possible that researchers may need to intervene to ensure the survival of corals. Right now a massive research effort is underway into the science of translocating heat-resistant corals from, say, the much warmer northern waters of the Great Barrier Reef to more southern areas. It is possible these corals from closer to the equator will have a greater chance of survival in warmer world. James Woodford is Guardian Australia’s ocean correspondent.

"The scope of epidemiology has expanded dramatically over the past 150 years, from its origins seeking to understand the causes of epidemic diseases, through the role of specific risk factors in non-communicable diseases, to the really big, and complex, questions facing humanity, and in some cases threatening its very survival. Tony McMichael, who has died aged 71, after complications of pneumonia, pioneered this third strand, showing how epidemiological techniques could be applied to global environmental change. Although, by the 1980s, he had long been concerned about what he termed ""planetary overload"" (later the title of one of his bestselling books), whereby the Earth is no longer able to sustain its expanding population with its increasing desire to consume natural resources and degrade the environment, it was not obvious how the debate could be shifted from speculation to empirical evidence.  Tony developed conceptual models of the global ecosystem, refined the methods needed to understand it and analysed an array of data to quantify the effects on human health of climate change that many suspected but that could not yet be measured. These included the impact of changes in the seasonal variation of deaths among older people in temperate climates and the distribution of insect vectors of diseases, such as Ross River virus in his native Australia. Although this emerging understanding of the complex links between global ecology and human health involved various academic and research institutions, Tony was the most senior health expert in the team and, by virtue of his personality, powers of persuasion and, especially, his highly respected status in epidemiology, he was able to legitimise this topic as a field of research. He was an obvious choice to chair the committee assessing health risks for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change between 1993 and 1996, during which time he moved to the UK, becoming professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994. In 2001 he returned to Australia to take over as head of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University in Canberra. There, he added greatly to understanding of the complex interaction between climate and infectious disease, researching topics such as the association between the El Niño phenomenon and the pattern of dengue fever in Thailand. This research subsequently informed the 2013 report of the World Health Organisation's tropical diseases research programme on the combined climatic, environmental, agricultural and nutritional influences on the emergence of infectious disease, which he chaired after stepping down as director of the centre in Canberra in 2007. Although Tony's arguments were based on solid research, he also recognised that publications in peer-reviewed journals, of which he published more than 300, would not in themselves lead to action. He was on the board of several NGOs, was a tireless advocate for action on climate and health and, just before his death, was a lead author of an open letter to the Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, calling for climate change and health to be placed on the G20 agenda. Given the hostility to such a move among the few people who, for whatever reason, still refuse to accept the international consensus on the causes of climate change, he was amused when one accused him of being a scurrilous fascist, and another, a socialist lackey. Born in Adelaide, South Australia, son of David McMichael, an architect, and Catherine Padman, Tony excelled at St Peter's college, an Anglican boys' school. Although there was no tradition of medicine in the family, he moved seamlessly to the medical school of the University of Adelaide. Even at that stage, his curiosity about the world was apparent and, in those days before low-cost international flights, he took slow boats to India – where his time in a leper colony exposed him to the unequal distribution of resources on this planet and the discrimination experienced by some of its most vulnerable inhabitants – and, later, to Papua New Guinea, where he met Judith Healy, whom he would marry in 1967, the year he graduated. He then took a year away from medicine to become president of the National Union of Australian University Students. This was an exciting time to be a student leader and he made many valuable political connections that he was able to draw on later. After a brief period in general practice, Tony enrolled as the first PhD student in epidemiology at Monash University, Melbourne, graduating in 1972. Correspondence with the microbiologist turned global health ecologist René Dubos led Tony to postdoctoral work at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he demonstrated the importance of the ""healthy worker effect"", whereby those who are exposed to hazards at work may, paradoxically, have better outcomes than the general population, either because they are selected for employment, or because they self-select into certain occupations, on account of their better initial health. Both there, and after his return to Australia, at the division of human nutrition at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and later as the first holder of the foundation chair of occupational and environmental health at the University of Adelaide in 1986, Tony established his reputation as a first-class epidemiologist, generating knowledge on a diverse range of topics. For years, the question of whether exposure to lead, then widespread in paints and water pipes, affected children's neurological development, remained unanswered. Tony led a study in Port Pirie, South Australia, home to the largest lead smelter in the southern hemisphere. He showed that exposure to lead varied greatly within the community, depending not only on the proximity of the child's home to the smelter but the concentration of lead in house dust and soil. The children were followed up with detailed developmental assessments until the age of 12. The results provided definitive evidence of the dangers of lead and were widely cited in the campaign to remove it from petrol. Tony also chaired a working party for the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council that produced a seminal report on passive smoking, frequently cited in the campaign to ban smoking in public places. These achievements alone would have guaranteed him a place in the epidemiological hall of fame. However, it was his achievements from the late 1980s onwards for which he will be best remembered. Tony received many awards, among them appointment as an officer of the Order of Australia and election to the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the US National Academy of Sciences. He is survived by Judith, a health policy researcher at the Australian National University, their two daughters, Anna and Celia, and his brothers, Philip and Robert. A sister, Alison, predeceased him. • Anthony John McMichael, epidemiologist, born 3 October 1942; died 26 September 2014"

"Swedish state energy company Vattenfall plans to sell off its German lignite operations because it says they are incompatible with the company’s climate change goals. But Greenpeace said the sale of the coal mines and power plants, which includes the fourth largest CO2 emitting power station in Europe, would be an abdication of responsibility and would simply allow Vattenfall to meet its emissions targets without actually reducing pollution.  Vattenfall’s annual German emissions are 72.2m tonnes of CO2, more than the whole of Sweden. Much of this is accounted for by its three massive plants and five open-cut mines in the country’s south east. On Thursday, the company released a statement that said: “The board of directors has decided that Vattenfall will explore options for creating a sustainable, new ownership structure for the lignite operations.”  A spokesman acknowledged that the sale would have no overall effect on emissions, but would help Vattenfall achieve its own carbon reduction targets. “This wouldn’t solve any CO2 problems in the whole, but it would for Vattenfall,” he said. The spokesmansaid shutting down the operations was “not an option” because Germany’s large renewable energy sector was underpinned by coal power when wind and solar production slackened. Greenpeace Sweden’s programme manager Annika Jacobson said: “We are not suggesting that they should stop the mines from one day to the next. But it would be much more economically positive if they phased out the lignite operations and invested in renewables in Germany instead.” She said the sale was a “panic solution” in order to reach Vattenfall’s emissions targets. Jacobson said the government, which owns Vattenfall and can broadly direct company policy, should not allow the company to shift responsibility for the emissions elsewhere. “Vattenfall is the most powerful tool that they have in their toolbox to show climate leadership,” said Jacobson.  She said the Green Party, which formed a coalition government with other left wing parties after the election in September, was now in an uncomfortable position because it had campaigned against coal. Prior to the election, the Greens told the Guardian: “Any government taking responsibility for the climate must stop these operations [rather than sell them].” Lignite is the most polluting form of coal and Vattenfall is one of Europe’s largest lignite burners. It is an uncomfortable image problem for a company which is trying to sell itself at home and abroad as a leader in clean energy. Regardless of the sale, in order to maintain supply to its plants the company says three of its German mines need to be expanded and local villages will be destroyed to make way. In August, thousands of protesters created a human chain between villages mooted for relocation."
"The risk of severe winters in Europe and northern Asia has been doubled by global warming, according to new research. The counter-intuitive finding is the result of climate change melting the Arctic ice cap and causing new wind patterns that push freezing air and snow southwards. Severe winters over the last decade have been associated with those years in which the melting of Arctic sea ice was greatest. But the new work is the most comprehensive computer modelling study to date and indicates the frozen winters are being caused by climate change, not simply by natural variations in weather. “The origin of frequent Eurasian severe winters is global warming,” said Prof Masato Mori, at the University of Tokyo, who led the new research. Climate change is heating the Arctic much faster than lower latitudes and the discovery that the chances of severe winters has already doubled shows that the impacts of global warming are not only a future threat. Melting Arctic ice has also been implicated in recent wet summers in the UK. The new research, published in Nature Geoscience, shows that the increased risk of icy winters will persist for the next few decades. But beyond that continued global warming overwhelms the colder winter weather. The Arctic is expected to be ice-free in late summer by the 2030s, halting the changes to wind patterns, while climate change will continue to increase average temperatures. “The agreement between observations in the real world and these computer models is very important in giving us more confidence that this [doubled risk of severe winters] is a real effect,” said Prof Adam Scaife, a climate change expert at the UK Met Office and not part of the research team. “The balance of evidence suggests this is real.” Dr Colin Summerhayes, at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, UK, said: “This counterintuitive effect of the global warming that led to the sea ice decline in the first place makes some people think that global warming has stopped. It has not. Although average surface warming has been slower since 2000, the Arctic has gone on warming rapidly throughout this time.” The melting of sea ice influences Eurasian winters because the open ocean is darker than ice and absorbs more heat. This in turn warms the air above and weakens the high-level winds called the polar vortex. This causes meanders in the jet stream to become stuck in place. This “blocking” pattern pulls freezing air southwards out of the Arctic and, because it is stuck, the resulting severe weather can last for long periods. Climate scientists have warned for many years that global warming is not simply leading to a slow, gradual rise in temperature. Instead, it is putting more energy into the climate system which drives more frequent extreme events. Deadly heatwaves in Europe and Australia have already been shown to be many times more likely because of global warming, while some floods were made twice as likely by climate change as long ago as 2000. “Annual average global temperatures continue to rise, but the distribution of temperature through the year is giving us more extremes, which is highly damaging to food production,” said Prof Peter Wadhams at the University of Cambridge. “As ice continues to retreat, we can expect these weather extremes to continue to occur and maybe worsen.”"
"On Sunday the world’s top climate scientists are expected to reiterate their warning that humanity’s influence on the climate is unequivocal, with wide-ranging impacts across the planet, from rising seas to melting ice. The UN’s climate science panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is currently meeting in Copenhagen to thrash out the final wording of its so-called ‘synthesis’ report, the most comprehensive account of the state on climate science in seven years.  If that sounds familiar, it’s because it is a megamix of three major reports that have already been published over the course of the last 13 months – one on the physical science of climate change, one on its impacts on ecosystems, our food supply and how we adapt, and one on the solutions, i.e. cutting emissions from our power plants, factories, cars and farms. A draft of the synthesis report, seen by the Guardian, shows it will repeat the message that there’s no doubt over our role in global warming: “Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history,” it says. It doesn’t mince words on the repercussions: “The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.” But there is cause for hope if governments take action, it will suggest: “Measures exist to achieve the substantial emissions reductions over the next few decades necessary to limit likely warming to 2C”. A rise of 2C is the ‘safe’ level governments have agreed to hold temperatures to. Here are the six graphs that are at the core of the evidence collected by the IPCC on climate change and its effects: This map, from the report, shows how much hotter we’ve already made the world since 1901. It’s a handy reminder that the warming we’ve had so far isn’t evenly spread – the tropics and higher latitudes have got hotter faster than other regions: Here’s the same thing, seen another way – it shows how much temperatures have been above or below the late 20th-century average. The top one is for each year, and the bottom for each decade. Records show 13 of the 14 warmest years on record occurred this century. And here’s how much hotter the scientists say the planet is projected to get. The map on the left shows most places will get another degree or so of warming on top of the 0.7C we’ve already experienced globally since pre-industrial times. Unfortunately, that map assumes we’re going to dramatically cut our greenhouse gas emissions, and the map on the right is what we’re on track for given the record-breaking rate at which we’re all pumping out emissions now.  If you’re thinking a 5C rise by 2100 doesn’t sound like much, it’s worth considering that the global average temperature in the last ice age was only 4-5C colder than today: Here’s what the temperature rises we’ve seen have already done to sea level rise (as glaciers melts and water expands as it gets warmer). A few millimetres globally might not look like much but it is if you take the long view. The draft report says: “The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia.” And here’s what a warming world is doing to sea ice in the Arctic, which some scientists are now linking to the more severe winters Europe and northern Asia has experienced in recent years: And here’s why this is all happening. We’re spitting out more emissions that ever before, and it’s getting worse. Over the past decade emissions grew at twice the rate of the previous 30 years."
"What does climate change taste like? It’s an odd question, but an increasingly pertinent one. After all, as temperatures rise and extreme weather becomes the norm, many food production systems are becoming threatened. As that trend increases, it’s worth asking which foods consumers will have to cut back on – or abandon entirely.   According to David Lobell, deputy director of the Center on Food Security and the Environment at Stanford University, “The general story is that agriculture is sensitive. It’s not the end of the world; but it will be a big enough deal to be worth our concern.”  One major issue is carbon dioxide, or CO2. Plants use the gas to fuel photosynthesis, a fact that has led some analysts to argue that an increase CO2 is a good thing for farming. Lobell disagrees, noting that CO2 is only one of many factors in agriculture. “There’s a point at which adding more and more CO2 doesn’t help,” he says. Other factors – like the availability of water, the increasing occurrence of high and low temperature swings and the impact of stress on plant health – may outweigh the benefits of a CO2 boost. Lobell has already noticed the effect of climate change on some crops. For example, he says, yield data from corn and wheat production suggests that these two staples are already being negatively affected by the changing climate. Similarly, fruit and nuts are also showing the impact of climate change. Fruit trees require “chilling hours”, or time in cold, wintry environments, for optimum production. If they don’t hit their required number of cold, wintery days, their production – and quality – drop. These reduced yields, Lobell explains, lead to more frequent price spikes in many foods.  Here’s a list of the foods to enjoy now – while they’re comparatively plentiful.  Water shortages and warmer temperatures are bad news for corn: in fact, a global rise in temperatures of just 1C (1.8F) would slow the rate of growth by 7%. The impact of a disruption in corn production would extend far beyond the produce section at the supermarket. A great deal of US corn goes to feed livestock, so lower corn yields could mean higher meat prices, and fewer servings of meat per capita.  This isn’t merely speculation: Lobell claims that changes to this $1.7tn industry have already begun. According to a recent study (subscription required) that he co-authored, the world’s farmers have been much less productive in recent years than they would have were it not for climate change. Global corn production, in particular, has already been nearly 4% lower than it would have been if the climate were not warming.  Higher-than-average temperatures and shifting weather patterns in the tropics have made “coffee rust” fungus and invasive species the new norm on coffee plantations. And, to make things worse, a severe drought in Brazil this spring caused prices to skyrocket. Some analysts are predicting that, if the current trends continue, Latin American coffee production could relocate to Asia. Latin America isn’t the only coffee-producing region facing the impacts of shifting weather patterns. In Africa, the number of regions suitable for growing coffee is predicted to fall anywhere from 65% to 100% as the climate warms. In this case, higher temperatures would produce lower yields and plant. According to a widely cited 2011 study (pdf) from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), cacao beans – the raw ingredient in chocolate – will become much less plentiful over the next few decades. The main problem is rising temperatures and falling water supplies: in the African nations of Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire, temperatures are predicted to rise by at least 2C by 2050. This, in turn, will increase “evapotranspiration” in the cocoa trees, causing them to lose more water to the air and reducing their yield. Andrew Jarvis, Leader of the Decision and Policy Analysis Program at CIAT, says that, while chocolate and coffee are not crucial to our survival, studying the impact of climate change on them makes sense, because they can help raise awareness about climate change by “hitting people’s soft spots.” “Imagine waking up and not having coffee to get you through the morning, or not having a bar of chocolate readily available when you get a craving,” he says. “It’s not that there won’t be any, but the prices will likely be much higher. Both these crops are very sensitive to climate change, and increases in demand are outstripping our capacity to supply.” In addition to its impacts on land, climate change can also contribute to rising levels of CO2 in the ocean. This, in turn, leads to ocean acidification, which could threaten a whole range of edible ocean creatures. For example, the shells of young oysters and other calcifying organisms are likely to grow less and less sturdy over time, as the oceans’ acidity increases. The UK’s chief scientist, Sir Mark Walport, recently announced that, thanks to man-made CO2, the acidity of the oceans has increased by about 25% since the start of the industrial revolution. Another problem is that, according to a recent study, most fish are slow to adapt to acidification, leading to a risk of species collapse. Some animals, like tropical fish and lobsters, are moving north in search of cooler habitats, but this migration causes other problems. Tropical fish, for example, are more susceptible to parasites in warmer water, further weakening their species. Meanwhile, lobsters tend to eat everything in sight, so their move puts the native habitats of a host of other species at risk.  Wetter winters and drier summers are putting more stress on sugar maples, the trees whose sap is needed to produce maple syrup. In the winter, the trees need freezing temperatures to fuel the expansion and contraction process that they use to produce the necessary sap. Rising temperatures are already causing sap to flow earlier: according to some estimates, this may push up maple production by up to a month by the end of the next century.  The US Department of Agriculture also predicts that the industry will move north, as the trees in cooler areas fair better, and maple trees in states such as Pennsylvania are less likely to survive the shift. The USDA Forest Service has developed the Climate Change Tree Atlas, which shows that sugar maples will likely loose some habitat. “While maple trees won’t necessarily vanish from the landscape,” says the federal agency, but “there could be fewer trees that are more stressed, further reducing maple syrup availability.”  Beans feed the majority of the population in Latin America and much of Africa, but the hearty legumes might be quailing in the face of climate change. According to a report from CIAT, higher temperatures affect flowering and seed production in bean vines, reducing yields by as much as 25%. And in bean-growing regions, too much rain – in the form of storms and floods – will likely destroy some crops as well. “Beans are very sensitive to climate,” says CIAT’s Jarvis, noting that their need for low temperatures helps explain why they do well in the mountainous regions of East Africa. “High temperatures, especially at night, can significantly affect the productivity of the crop.” Stone fruits, particularly cherries, require chill hours to bear fruit; too few cold nights, and the trees are less likely to achieve successful pollination. On the west coast, where the bulk of sweet cherries are grown, rising temperatures mean that trees might flower later and produce fewer fruits.  Unusually timed cold weather can be just as disastrous. In 2012, the Michigan cherry industry lost 90% of its tart cherry crop after a late freeze. Thanks to warmer temperatures, wine grapes will likely soon be in higher demand – making wine more expensive. A 2013 study predicted that “major global geographic shifts” among wine growers – as well as fluctuations in temperature and moisture levels in Europe, Australia, North American, and South Africa – will essentially make the perfect wine grape a moving target. Australia will probably be hit the hardest, as 73% of the land there could be unsuitable for growing grapes by 2050. California’s loss is nearly as high at 70%.  Then there’s the question of “terroir”, or flavor based on geographical location. Wine grapes like heat, but not too much. In extreme temperatures, they can even go into a kind of thermal shock that can severely alter flavor. On the bright side, the grapes also retain more sugar in these circumstances, making the final product higher in alcohol, so the casual sipper won’t need to drink as much to feel the effects.

"The Australian government has been urged to scale up its ambitions for greenhouse gas cuts after European Union leaders struck a deal to reduce emissions by at least 40% by 2030. Talks in Brussels overnight culminated in one of the first major commitments to post-2020 emissions cuts before a crunch United Nations gathering in Paris next year. The Paris talks are expected to involve nations thrashing out long-term emissions goals.  Australia has a target of a 5% cut in emissions by 2020, based on 2000 levels. The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, told a recent UN summit in New York that Australia’s goal was ambitious but the independent Climate Change Authority has labelled it inadequate, calling for a reduction of at least 15%. The new EU target, measured against 1990 levels, came with two additional 27% targets – for renewable energy market share and increase in energy efficiency improvement by 2030. Australia’s renewable energy target mandates that 41,000 gigawatt hours of the country’s energy must come from renewable sources by 2020. The Coalition is seeking to cut this to a “real” 20% of overall energy use, a position opposed by Labor and the Greens. Asked about the EU deal, a spokesman for Greg Hunt, the environment minister, told Guardian Australia: “We welcome all progress on reducing emissions around the world. The problem with Labor’s carbon tax is that Australia’s emissions were going up not down by 2020. “We will meet our targets for 2020 and we’ve always said that we will consider progress beyond that in the lead-up to Paris.” The Greens said Australia’s current emissions target is “disastrously inadequate” and that the Coalition needed to show ambition for deeper cuts. “Europe has committed to post-2020 cuts of 40%, while in Australia we’re struggling to reach five,” said Christine Milne, the Greens leader. “Tony Abbott is tearing up every piece of clean energy policy he can. “The Abbott government needs to end its protection racket for the dirty fossil fuel industry and realise we are in the midst of a global energy revolution.” Erwin Jackson, deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute, said the EU deal was a “stark contrast” to Australia’s efforts. “The EU’s announcement yet again underscores how much the rest of the world, and our major trading partners like the EU, China and the US, are leaping ahead of Australia, while we are going backwards,” he said. “It is critical that our renewable energy target contributes to long-term decarbonisation of the energy sector as a key objective, rather than basing the target around short-term industry interests. “Australia’s power sector needs to continue decarbonising over this and coming decades. This requires a return to bipartisan support for a robust and growing RET, complemented by a measure – regulatory or otherwise – to close down ageing, inefficient coal stations.” A spokeswoman for Mark Butler, Labor’s environment spokesman, said: “This is further evidence the world is going ahead in leaps and bounds while Australia is in reverse gear. “Tony Abbott repeatedly said he’ll wait for the world to act before he does. Well, the world has been taking meaningful action like this for many months and still Tony Abbott is still refusing to do anything about climate change.”"
"In an increasingly resource-constrained world, business needs to account for its natural capital dependencies and impacts in the same way it does for financial capital. The key question is: how? A new game Evaluate, produced by the Cambridge-hosted Natural Capital Leaders Platform, introduces natural capital valuation and shows how it can inform commercial decisions that mitigate risk, reduce negative environmental impacts, and create value.  According to the recently published Living Planet Report, we are already consuming 50% more natural capital resources per year than the Earth can replenish, and the rate of depletion is accelerating. Translating this into financial terms - we are no longer living off the dividends of natural capital, but off the capital itself. This creates significant risks in supply chains.  Businesses are heavily dependent on natural capital. Food and agri-businesses, for example, rely on healthy soils, water availability and pollinators. By negatively affecting just one of these elements, the risk of both productivity losses and price volatility rises.  It is in the interest of businesses to begin factoring their impacts and dependencies upon natural capital into their decision-making processes; they can start off by properly valuing them. The problem is that current economic systems do not value things like soil quality and water properly.  There are many ways of placing a value on impacts and improvements, but these are often criticised for not being consistent or comparable, and for producing numbers that are difficult for business to relate to.  A Trucost report highlighted that the world’s 100 biggest risks are costing the economy around $4.7tn per year. This is a huge number which, although illustrating the severity of the problem, is so large it makes it intangible for business to know how to deal with it, let alone understand where the figure came from.  It is time to demystify the intricacies of valuation. Business can value its impacts on the environment by considering the effect it has on human wellbeing. For example, operational impacts on water quality have major implications for drinking water. Those who do not have access to clean drinking water place enormous value on water as a critical resource; such worth can be evaluated. It is through these relationships that business can assess the scale and impact of their decisions.  Valuation has the benefit of using a single, common metric, which enables businesses to compare their impacts upon different elements such as the availability of water and the fertility of soil. All of these underpin, albeit often indirectly, their own productivity and revenue streams. The Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership has just released an online game that deciphers the complexity of valuation. Evaluate: the Game challenges players to manage their business risks by making strategic decisions around a limited budget and bank the value created by reducing environmental impact. Those who play the game can not only increase their understanding of how valuation can help make better business decisions but it can also give them confidence to explore the business trade-offs that can be informed by valuation.

"Mining companies are campaigning for the G20 leaders’ meeting to support continued use of coal as a solution to the global “energy poverty” crisis, as Australia resists the inclusion of climate change on the formal agenda. Peabody – the world’s largest private coal miner – has launched an online campaign titled the “Lights On” project to convince G20 leaders meeting in Brisbane next month that access to coal-fired power is crucial for “empowering” developing countries. The G20 push, using social media and video, is part of an international campaign the company commissioned with PR firm Burson-Marsteller targeting China, America and Australia, called “Advanced Energy for Life”. While the prime minister has resisted pressure from the United States and Europe for climate change to be included in the G20 agenda on the grounds that it does not fit the meeting’s economic focus, Peabody’s Australian president Charles Meintjes was invited to make a presentation to a workshop for the G20’s energy program in Brisbane in August. In the presentation Meintjes argued that “coal is the only affordable fuel, at scale, to meet rising energy needs” of the world’s poor, including graphs claiming a clear correlation between rising coal consumption and rising life expectancy and global GDP. Dr Simon Bradshaw, of Oxfam Australia, said the mining industry was “very active” in the lead up to the G20, but contrary to its arguments, renewable energy “offers a far better prospect for increasing access to electricity in most countries and most markets”. “Climate change is a major threat in the fight against hunger and poverty and coal burning is the single biggest contributor to climate change,” Bradshaw said, adding that it would be “very unfortunate” if G20 leaders accepted the coal industry’s “self serving arguments.” He said in his opinion the presentation, made to industry and non-government representatives and international energy officials, drew some “very dubious correlations and mounted some pretty unsophisticated arguments.” The participants were not told to keep the slideshow confidential or secret. Guardian Australia has obtained a copy of the presentation, which can be seen here (pdf). “It would be highly inappropriate if the G20 was to be captured by the vested interests of companies spruiking last century’s dirty energy sources”, said Dermot O’Gorman, the chief executive of WWF Australia. “Poor people in developing countries deserve access to clean, safe and affordable energy sources and this should be the primary motivation for the G20, rather than protecting the coal industry and running the risk of creating stranded assets.” Abbott has played down the chances of climate change being discussed by the world leaders who will gather in Brisbane because its primary focus was “economic security, our financial stabilisation, the importance of private sector-led growth.’’ But despite Australia’s reluctance, Barack Obama’s international adviser, Caroline Atkinson, told the Australian Financial Review this week that since G20 economies generated 80% of the world’s carbon emissions the meeting should give political impetus to “specific steps” to reduce global ­warming. Opening a new coal mine on Monday, Abbott said: “let’s have no demonisation of coal. Coal is good for humanity.” Abbott did not attend the special UN climate summit in New York in October, where both Obama and British prime minister David Cameron urged decisive action to contain global warming. The government has said it will include energy efficiency in the G20 discussions, and during those talks other leaders are likely to raise climate change."
"Islanders from the Tulun Atoll where forced relocation is presently underway are reporting what some believe is the beginning of the end. Breadfruit trees have been destroyed, the soil isn’t good enough to grow crops. The sea water is eating away at the land. Tulun Atoll is not alone. Across the Pacific islanders are reporting similar changes as the sea is creeping up. Given that sea level rise is not uniform across the world (forget the bathtub that fills evenly!) it’s not surprising that in some island communities the impacts are becoming more quickly apparent.   And it won’t get better anytime soon. Previous sea level rise projections of around 1m by the end of the 21st century have recently been revised upward as new scientific studies published earlier this year found a doubling of Antarctic ice loss, and satellite based data revealed that the collapse of a large part of Antarctica is now considered unstoppable. The studies suggest that, over time, ice losses in East and West Antarctica “will change the coastline of the world” and may even amount to “global coastal destruction”. It’s hardly surprising that leaders of some of the most low-lying island nations in the world, including Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands, are more and more desperate to raise the plight of their islands. Tuvalu prime minister Enele Sopoaga even likened climate change to “a weapon of mass destruction”. The desperation of islanders is understandable. Countless low-lying islands around the world protrude only a metre or two above sea level and are acutely vulnerable to even very small rises in sea level. Their very existence is threatened by human-induced sea level rises and other climate change impacts such as coral bleaching, ocean acidification, storm surges, coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion and freshwater contamination. And yet small island developing states have contributed less than 1% to the global stock of greenhouse gasses now in the atmosphere.  What this means is that island communities are overwhelmingly not responsible for the rises in temperatures and sea levels which are increasingly threatening their survival. Some Pacific atolls are already relocating their island communities, and Kiribati has reportedly already bought tracts of land in Fiji to prepare for such a future relocation scenario. The Maldives - where none of the coral islands protrude over 1.8m above seal level - has also talked about doing this. It’s heartening that New Zealand has recently granted residency to a family from Tuvalu, accepting their landmark claim that climate change effectively thwarted their return home. While it’s the first successful application of this type, it certainly won’t be the last time that climate change will force islanders to seek safer shores elsewhere. New Zealand’s decision is commendable for a number of reasons, including recognition by the immigration and protection tribunal of climate change as an important causal factor in long-term displacement and human wellbeing. It’s also a tacit acceptance that the international refugee convention is not the appropriate or only instrument for offering protection, justice and a lifeline of hope to Pacific climate change refugees. Indeed, the refugee convention has already been determined to be irrelevant for climate change refugee situations by New Zealand’s court of appeal which earlier this year refused to recognise climate change refugee status to a family from Kiribati, arguing that in the absence of persecution Ioana Teitiota did not meet the legal definition of a conventional refugee. There are growing calls for action to help these island nations. A few weeks ago the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program Achim Steiner called on the world to help small island states win their battle against climate change. He said that island states are “microcosms of our larger society ... the rest of the world should not let them drown”. This call was echoed by Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi, prime minister of Samoa, who demanded world leaders “rise above the rhetoric and forge binding agreements on climate change” at the climate change summit in New York. Given Australia’s number one position as the worst carbon emitter per capita among major western nations it seems hardly surprising that islanders from Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu and other small island developing states have been turning to Australia with growing exasperation demanding the country demonstrate an appropriate response and responsibility. Being a multicultural nation of migrants and migrant descendants, and a major per capita contributor to the climate migration issue, Australia already seems ideally positioned to become a world leader in the area of climate migration both morally and practically. Australia is neither single-handedly responsible for the problems nor for the solutions, but “first-mover advantage”can matter as much in policy framework design as in business or chess.  PhD research has shown that preparedness in climate migration is about learning the lessons early and preparing a meaningful, measured, positive and proactive policy response for the benefit of affected individuals and communities in countries of origin and destination. New Zealand’s decision to recognise climate change as a factor in forced migration marks a moral and ethical precedent that Australia and other countries have yet to emulate. In the long run a new type of migration category for climate migrants from Pacific islands seems inevitable. With this in mind three key questions remain. First, is the history of humanity not primarily a story of migration; and is the human narrative not replete with forced and voluntary human movement? Second, is it not befitting to empathise with the plight of fellow human sojourners and accept new climate migrants within our borders and communities? And third, when will other nations follow New Zealand’s example and recognise that climate change migration is a growing reality?"
"This weekend 12 enormous blocks of ice weighing 100 tonnes will be left to melt in Copenhagen’s City Hall Square as a striking visual representation of the reality of climate change. The ice, collected from a fjord outside Nuuk, Greenland and displayed in clock formation, is intended to be a physical wake-up call to encourage people to transform climate knowledge into climate action. Later this month, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will present its Fifth Assessment Report, the most comprehensive assessment of scientific knowledge on climate change since 2007. But it may not lead to action. The information presented by the IPCC is overwhelming and scary and most of it, too complex to be able to translate into effective actions.  The Ice Watch installation is intended to make the climate challenges we are facing tangible. Perception and physical experience are cornerstones of art, and they may also function as tools for creating social change. The problem is that all too often citizens of the developed world feel disconnected from – or may be fortunate to be unaffected by – the major problems in the world. We do not see ourselves as active agents in the global community. Climate change, poverty, war, disease – these are challenges that compete for our attention. The information age in general, and public awareness campaigns in particular, have succeeded in making most of us know that these challenges must be addressed. But there is a tremendous disconnect between what we know and what we feel, and, consequently, what we do about them. Being touched by a book, by music, or a work of art gives you a jolt. It shifts you into a new place. This profound experience is not necessarily about getting to know something new. Often when we are touched, we become aware of what is already within us, something we recognise and maybe even identify with, but have not yet verbalised or felt, deep down. This is why looking at a great painting can be liberating and why theatre can connect our heads to our hearts. When we embody knowledge through experience, we turn it into a force that can guide and shape our actions, in global as well as local contexts. Society and action are not external to art; they are a vital part of it, and there is a long tradition of making thoughts, feelings, and ideas not just perceived and felt, but also relevant in and for societal contexts. The positive stories of transitioning to a sustainable world are out there and should accompany and temper the doomsday scenarios, because they show the way forward. Certainly, it is important to present the data behind key challenges facing the world today, but action does not necessarily grow from here. Linking knowledge with an embodied sense of who we are and want to be, of responsibility for our children and grandchildren and of commitment to the future, is necessary to mobilise action. Culture is a strong ally in this endeavour. Where conventional methods of display and communication deployed in, for instance, commercial spaces target people as consumers, cultural spaces invite people inside and hold their attention and presence in a different way. These spaces are bottom up; they tend to create trust and a feeling of empowerment for the individual. Culture helps us, as individuals and groups to experience our interconnectivity, our interdependence, and may move us to do something together, to act with each other, to become conscious, active members of the ‘global we’. By using art, architecture, storytelling, and other cultural activities and by illustrating the correlation between a sustainable lifestyle and a happier and healthier life, we can achieve the shift needed for real climate change action to happen. Therefore, we need to accompany strategy plans, position papers, and limits for CO2 omissions with cultural work. We call on novelists, playwrights, architects, sculptures, painters, photographers, and other cultural activists to create and make tangible, the option of a sustainable world. We need to understand that life-enhancing measures can be undertaken on behalf of the Earth, its climate, all of us, and our individual and collective future. It’s time to realise that we are not going to solve the climate crisis through our rational mind alone. Action on climate change requires more than information provided by IPCC reports and other sources. It requires inspiration. We need to be inspired and motivated to change our lifestyles, building codes, travel habits, food choices, energy sources, economic and social indicators, political processes, and much more.

"America’s energy-related carbon pollution rose 2.5% last year despite President Barack Obama’s efforts to fight climate change, according to new federal data. The rise in emissions from burning coal, oil, natural gas and other fossil fuels was one of the steepest on record in the last 25 years, according to the Energy Information Administration’s Monthly Energy Review.  The increase in carbon pollution is a setback for Obama, who has been heavily promoting his progress in cutting America’s greenhouse gas emissions. Obama told 120 world leaders at the United Nations climate summit last month that America had done more under his watch to fight climate change than any other country. But the EIA figures show that America’s greenhouse gas emissions are now rising again after several years of decline during the recession. The chill Arctic temperatures of last year’s polar vortex can shoulder much of the blame. The EIA said the rise in emissions was largely due to home heating because of the cold weather. The data also showed a 4.8% increase in the use of energy from coal, and a 10% fall in energy from natural gas. Emissions were still 10% below 2005 levels. But the latest figures deepen doubts about whether America will meet its existing commitments for a 17% cut in emissions by 2020 without additional actions, or make the cuts required in the coming decades even deeper.  Until last year, America was on track to meeting that goal, with emissions falling by more than 13% from 2005 to 2012. But that has shrunk to just 10% over the last year or so. Meanwhile, the pressure is on to do more. World leaders have agreed they need to keep global average temperature from rising two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to prevent the worst consequences of climate change. America, along with other countries, is expected to pledge further actions on climate change early next year."
"There are deep connections between the prosperity of companies, the vitality of cities and the health of our environment. The more vulnerable cities are to climate change, the greater the risks to the businesses located within them. The greater the locally specific climate-related risks to business operations and capital investment, the less likely a city will attract, retain and support the commerce it requires to employ its people and maintain its tax base. As far as climate risk is concerned, therefore, cities and companies are tightly linked. In 2013, the Carbon Disclosure Project and C40, the network of cities sharing best practices in both forestalling and adapting to climate change, produced a report titled Wealthier, Healthier Cities. In it, they catalogued the ways in which the actions of cities ought to result in increased economic activity and growth.   For example, research shows that positive economic outcomes often stem from investments in public transit, increasing green space, and building infrastructure for walking and cycling, among other initiatives. The study claimed that 62% of all reported emissions reduction activities being undertaken by cities have the potential to make cities more attractive to businesses. Although encouraging, this type of analysis doesn’t say much about the role of business in the process of decarbonisation or increasing resilience. It focuses on the advantages associated with business locating in cities addressing climate change. This year, the same organisations teamed up with Bloomberg Philanthropies to produce a new report, Protecting our Capital. This time, it’s based on the replies of nearly double the number of cities as 2013. It includes data about the concerns of companies, closing the circle with reports such as Risky Business, which examine the business risks due to climate change. In 2014, it’s clearer that the interests of cities and of companies are much more closely aligned than one might expect.  This report is not as sunny as 2013. It’s about the preservation of capital that can be destroyed by extreme weather. It’s about the risks to property and operations that need to be mitigated, and about who’s working to mitigate them. Cities, which have long been on the front lines of the battle against climate change, are businesses’ best allies. By rebuilding infrastructure that reduces the risks of flooding, windstorms, drought or famine, cities allow companies to operate in a lower risk environment. Because they are more likely than national governments to recognise the real and present dangers, cities are best positioned to listen to the concerns of companies  The report reaches three conclusions: cities get it, cities are closely aligned with business priorities, and cities’ adaptation to climate change benefits business. “Cities are providing information, incentives and regulations that assist businesses to be more resilient to climate change.” The common sense of risk and their mutual need for resilience is the basis for a high degree of collaboration. The report identifies the alignment of the shipping industry and port cities, of the food and agriculture industry with many centres such as Bologna, and of the financial industry with urban banking and financial centres. Rising sea levels, water scarcity, and extreme weather have the ability to devastate industries together with their industrial centres.  We have known for a long time that business and location are inextricably linked. Decades ago, Michael Porter devised the notion of competitive cluster, showing us how industries related to place, in his Competitive Advantage of Nations. Paul Krugman published Geography and Trade in 1991. This report is a reminder that cities and companies share the same risks as the earth inexorably warms. Perhaps it is this inexorability which prevents closer collaboration between city governments and companies. Together they are already responsible for much of the progress we have made in decarbonisation. Together, they are beginning to forge alliances to prevent catastrophic global warming and mitigate its risks.

"They say all politics is local so this week when scientist John Church published a report in the world’s most prestigious science journal, Nature, about sea level rise, it made me look out my kitchen window.  I live in a town where sea level rise is not just academic. My life is spent surrounded by salt water. My home is a very modest south coast fibro cottage on a promontory at Moruya Heads, four hours drive south of Sydney.  Writing about his new paper, Time of Emergence for Regional Sea-Level Change, Church said: Our new analysis of sea-level projections ... indicates that regional sea-level rise will be generally noticeable before 2030. By then the average sea-level rise globally will be about 13 centimetres higher than the average sea level calculated between 1986 and 2005. As soon as I had read Church’s report I went and scrabbled through my files for a letter that had arrived in my letterbox a couple of months ago from the Eurobodalla Shire Council. Across the road from me is the main channel of the Moruya River and my back boundary is a tributary of the estuary, known as Gilmours Creek. At the end of my road are two spectacular beaches that are part of the Batemans Marine Park. I don’t need to consult charts to see whether it is high tide or low – I just look across the water. It’s the kind of sleepy little place where the postman is the same guy nearly every day, and he waves when he delivers the mail. In August he dropped off an envelope from the council.  I am writing to advise you of a draft report relating to sea level rise that is currently on public exhibition … As the owner of a property that is currently identified as ‘potentially at risk from future sea level rise’ we invite you to comment and give feedback during the exhibition period. If the report is adopted, it will provide the basis for consideration of sea level rise in future plans and policies including the preparation of the Coastal Zone Management Plan for Eurobodalla which will include public consultation. Like most people, I have been concerned about climate change as an esoteric issue. I have worried about how it will impact on my children and grandchildren. But here was climate change in my actual letter box – formal correspondence about how climate change was going to impact on me. The impact would be real and probably financial as well as practical. Who wants to buy property that is labeled “potentially at risk from future sea level rise”?  Still, I am very fortunate. While my property drops down to sea level at the rear, my actual home is probably a good 13 metres above a high tide. That is a long way above Church’s 13 centimetres. But down the road from my house the terrain drops to a long low flat area with houses at current sea level. The road itself is already almost lapped by seawater when there is a summer king tide. The biggest town in the Eurobodalla, Batemans Bay, is one of the nation’s most vulnerable communities to sea level rise. Once you start looking around even a relatively undeveloped community like mine you start to see that there is a lot of critical infrastructure that already sits on the very edge of being submerged. And planning mayhem will not just be a problem for the Eurobodalla. This will be a story played out in every local government area around Australia, in every captial city and in every multi-billion dollar port facility and seaside airport – especially Sydney’s Kingsford Smith.  I have always reassured myself that this coast where I live has looked the same ever since I first started coming to this area as a toddler. There are individual rocks on beaches that I have forever known to watch out for when I am catching a wave, sand spits and bays that have, for decades, seemed immutable. But if Church and his colleagues are right the coastline itself and the first law of Australian real estate – an ocean view is gold - is about to be re-written.  • James Woodford is writing on marine science through a non-profit journalism project funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts"
"Last winter, the UK was hit by a number of major storms, resulting in severe flooding for many communities. Thousands of properties were flooded, some areas remained under water for weeks and transport infrastructure was badly affected. As we face winter again, and climate change continues to create major challenges, are cities and towns across the UK better prepared for the threat of flooding? How can we improve our resilience? On Friday 17 October 2014, we held a live discussion with a panel of experts to tackle the question. The participants included:  This live discussion is in association with The Landscape Institute. The live Q&A is now closed, many thanks to all those who were involved. The full discussion can be found in the comments at the bottom of the page but here is a selection of some of the issues addressed: Hi all, I'm John Curtin and I'm the Director of Incident Management at the Environment Agency. My role is to improve & develop our ability to respond to floods & environmental incidents - this includes our flood warning, forecasting & mapping work. Looking forward to answering your questions! JC Hello From the Bronx, NY ! Hi Sue here I'm a landscape architect working in this area, and we specialise in masterplanning SuDS within development schemes to maximise the benefit for people and the environment, whilst dealing with effectively with the issue of managing surface water.  I look forward to your questions hi, I'm a participant in HighWaterLine Bristol and I'd like to share our experiences of involvement in this project and how we're hoping to develop resilient solutions for Bristol as members of a community at flood risk. Please feel free to ask about this project. Hi, You may have noticed me all over the TV last winter taking about the floods. That's because I have almost 50 years of professional drainage experience. As well as co-authoring the 2000, 2004 Foresight future (UK) flooding reports, I helped revisit them in 2008 for Sir Michael Pitt and again in June 2014 for the cabinet office. Steve Brammer asks: What role might volunteers play in supporting resilience? How might voluntary contributions best be trained, equipped, managed and organised? I find most often ""you get what you pay for"". With regard to managing water, the costs of not doing it well are real, and the people who mitigate those costs should be paid. From our experience in Bristol, those living at flood risk are keen to volunteer to work together in 1. Understanding that risk2. Sharing experiences3. Being involved in the solutions/creating their own resilience Hi Steve, This is a really interesting area and we already have around 1000 Flood Wardens out there helping get flood warnings out - and communities tend to respond well to someone in their community keeping them updated.  As Majora says though these are just part of the overall picture and we do invest a lot of time in helping become local champions - so not quite free! JC ID696292 asks: I have been flooded myself and I am often baffled as to why we can’t ‘normalise’ Property Level Flood Protection and why despite many regular floods we still shout out for the humble and inefficient sand bag when a flood is coming? How do we change mindset to encourage individuals and communities to think about protecting their homes using tested flood protection products?  Hi Mary, Changing mindsets is always a long game - and I have to say the way you champion the issue - many times with our staff - has been fantastic - we just need more of you! Interestingly, folk checking whether their property is at risk of flooding - the first important step - is up by 10% this year to 56% Our flood awareness campaign starting at the end of this month will play another important part. JC PIPEKIT says: Do the Panel consider the Sustainable Drainage requirements for new build to be sufficient in mitigating flood risk for the immediate new build site or just passing on the problem to another area? Martyn,as you know this government has kicked SuDS into the long grass and is not going to implement Sch.3 of the FWMA 2010. It is going to be left to individual local authorities under some watered-down planning arrangements. Yes, I know they are consulting (they also did that with fracking). The DCLG planning guidance does not specify SuDS only that onsite and offsite events need to be managed. England is the only screwed up country in the UK regarding SuDS and the housebuilders have won by ensuring it is going to stay that way. Paullincoln asks: I saw the film Water Blues Green Solutions last night. It showed a high level of community action in creating local schemes to combat flooding as well as individual projects to divert rainwater into allotments. How important is community activism in achieving change in this area? Hi Paul If we can to get a comprehensive response to dealing with the problem of flooding, then its absolutely essential. We need the public to engage with the issue, and be involved in the solutions that are needed for their communities. The film is excellent, so will be pleased to hear what Majora has to say. Sue ""Activism"" tends to turn a lot of people off. In the NYC and among my clients, it comes down to costs, and quality of life, and being able to demonstrate reductions and increases respectively.One advantage to both is that there is money to be saved/made along the way.Finding the union of those interests, and building positive working relationships with people in positions to help push the ball fwd is crucial. MajoraCarter I could not agree more, especially as we need now to have multifunctional, multivalue infrastructure like the highline in NYC. That is why green based systems are preferable, they hit more than two birds qwith one stone, as being demonstarted in CIRIA's SuDS (BMP) multiple benefits project - look at the SusDrain website I think we are all agreed on that. Our problem is that the process needs to be initiated or funded by a government or authority that has the ability to lead and fund the project. Your film showed how effective that can be, but the city and water company worked together to deal with the flooding and CSO problem in Philadelphia through SuDS and Green Infrastructure, because the engineering solution was unaffordable.  Our government seems determined to go down the route of complete grey engineering in London, despite its astronomic cost, and the consideration of using multi-functional approaches has been dismissed, almost out of hand.  It may well be that the answer is both, but we seem a million miles away from where you guys have been. Small, and really good projects are happening locally, but we need to scale up, and funding is really difficult. Hayley Hannan asks: I also saw the film last night and thought it was great. The final example of the necklace of projects along the river in the Bronx, NY, was fantastic. But how do you get people involved like that here in the UK? It takes a lot to move people from just being concerned about something, to actively doing something about flooding resilience. How do you suggest we could get people involved? Hi HayleyWe've achieved a lot in a short time with Bristol HighWaterLine and are working on further projects to spread the knowledge we gained.We talked to 100's of people as we chalked the line and many were instantly engaged. The idea of being prepared for disaster, in this case flooding, rather than responding to it once it had happened, had a wide appeal.We are working to identify resilient solutions in each of our communitiesThe solution for my home lies in a relationship with the local authority, who next week are exploring our sewerage system- sexy subject, I know- which is vital to defending our street.Anna Hi Hayley Like you, I am cudgelling my brains about it, and have been doing so for quite a long time! There are good works happening all around the UK, despite Thames Water's reluctance to address the situation in London. One of our problems is the multiple ownerships, and split in responsibility for dealing with water between organisations and agencies, so that even good plans can be thwarted, as everything needs to happen by consensus. There is definitely a role that could be played by the Lead Local Flood Authorities in dealing with localised flooding problems, which if they took the multi-functional, multi-benefit approach could then encompass all the other issues of providing attractive waterways, that add accessible riverwalks and water for people, and attract wildlife back into our towns and cities, whilst also dealing with flood risk. We also need to bear in mind, that any form of flood alleviation/management scheme will be in place 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, but may only really be needed very occasionally. We can often address flood alleviation by straightforward grey engineering (ignoring cost), but that doesn't necessarily add anything to the quality of the environment for the people who live there. We need the engineering, but by taking the mutil-functional approach we get so much more, and we invariably reduce cost. So, the film is 60 minutes and the Bronx segment is only about 15 of those - but what you see on screen has taken nearly 20 years. Seems like a long time, but i have to say it really flew by!To the extent i was successful in my part of the puzzle, it involved developing jobs for local people. A financial stake in the situation (especially in underprivileged areas) gets people talking to each other in different ways --- and word-of-mouth is always a powerful force (both for and against you sometimes) Green Infrastructure has a distinct advantage over many other 'sustainable' practices in that it improves quality of life, and saves money long term.  Our early victories were very very small. But we built on them very intentionally, and after a couple years were able to demonstrate a bit of 'trend', bring on new and bigger allies, divert more money to our projects, form stronger relationships with everyone. The important part to remember is it is a long game for a person, but nothing compared to life of our cities/culture - and that end of 20 years, there are children who think it has always been this way, and they will surpass all our efforts if we set them up right. Ginny Howells asks: What role does education have to play in increasing resilience in the UK? There’s lots of research to show the benefits of including emergency preparedness/ risk reduction in children’s education but are we applying that learning in the UK? Hi Ginny, I think education (of both the young & not so young) is really important and actually there is quite a lot in the national curriculum already on flooding. But education doesn't stop at school and I think we all have a role to learn about the risk we face from flooding and what we can do to protect ourselves & our families - first step check your flood risk here http://apps.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood/31618.aspx And if the number of Geography teachers who follow me on Twitter is anything to go by our kids are in good hands! JC Hi Ginny I agree that education is vital. I would also like to suggest that community activism is an aspect of education. We had a flood barrier installed in our street in January, February & March 2014. We live next to the tidal Avon, we talk to the harbour master and other experts regularly and my partner works in flood risk for the EA. In spite of all this 'awareness' myself and my neighbours felt confused about precise risk. It took a community-led art project to inspire confidence to keep asking questions of Bristol City Council and we finally have a really good relationship with the flood risk team and better understanding of our precise risks.Meeting others throughout Bristol and sharing experience and knowledge about the history and future possibilities of flooding is a powerful resource.A letter through the door saying 'you're at risk, grab a torch and some blankets and move valuables from the basement' doesn't mean much without proper understanding and dialogue.Flood risk authrities have some great resources, but we need to find ways of getting them out to communities at riskAnna Education can come in many forms, and a large number of the students we need on board are not in school in anymore.Adding 'flooding components' to computer games like Civilization, along with mitigating measures players can deploy is one avenue.Computer/phone games in general are a good way to get a lot of things across imo.Contests like an X-Prize for a flood resistant community design is another way of 'educating' the public about what is possible, and at a fairly low cost becuase the media will do most of your outreach when prize money is involved. Over on Twitter, @aandoroo asks: Why are local planning authorities still allowing development on current (and future) floodplains!? Simples as they say.... they need economic growth. Oh and the sandbag Pickles has got his inspetors to reject loads of local development plans (eg Kirklees) because it then leaves a loophole for developers to do what they like in the interim. This is happening on my village on green field sites. However, I work in the Netherlands and it is perfectly feasible to build safely on a flood plain if done appropriately - did you see grand designs the night before last, where Baca architects copied the Dutch with a floating house. Of course Eric and DCLG don't like floating houses, they don't fit into the building reg system. Richard I know we can do things such as floating houses, but really, in the UK is that the answer? Baca really do understand these things, but that is not necessarily true everywhere. The Dutch obviously have to do this, and have some really innovative ways of looking at these problems, but I remain unconvinced that this is, as yet, where we need to be generally. On Twitter, @guyshrubsole asks: Is the UK prepared for 4 degrees of global warming, and will the EA model what this would cost? Is the EA pushing for govt to close the £500m shortfall in flood defence investment to keep pace with climate change? We already building climate change predications into the design of our flood risk schemes to make sure they are fit for the future. And not all this money needs to be spent up front - a good example is the recently completed scheme for Nottingham which protects 16000 properties. Its foundations are built so we can increase the size of the scheme as we need rather than completely rebuilding. JC From what I've seen in the reply that was given in the House of Commons Library Standard note SN/SC/5755 on Flood defence spending in England on 12 February 2014 , the government is hoping that the acknowledged shortfall in both actual and real terms will be made up by 'partnership' funding. However, where this partnership funding comes from is not explained. I presume they mean in part from water companies, as there are significant benefits to them if they can reduce combined sewer overflows, as it improved the quality of the effluent in their works, it increases capacity in their systems, it enables them to delay their investment in upgrading their facilities or in building new ones, and clearly it also reduces flooding. Hi The reality is there will never be enough money to completely eradicate the risk of flooding. Our priority is to do as much as we can with every pound of funding, and the new partnership funding approach is bringing in new money for flood defences that would have not otherwise been built. We now expect to exceed our goal to better protect 145,000 homes from flooding and coastal erosion by 2015. JC @apoi_landscape asks: How does the Thames basin compare to other areas in the country for flood risk? And are there affordable and effective measures that home owners can implement to -prevent- localised flooding? The draft River Basin Management Plans are now available on the EA website for comment. Although their focus is on water quality and the water framework directive they are very important for flooding. Thames Basin has the largest economic value in terms of property and industry/commerce. There are some very important risks to e.g. Chertsey etc. and a lack of funds for implemneting schemes drawn up by EA. The 8:1 benefit to cost ratio is a hard one even with the high property values and as Sue says, communities are now faced with raising a lot of funds themselves. There is also a lot of groundwater flood risk in the Basin and this is a risk we are not well clued up about. The Thames is a fascinating & challenging river - it tends to have significant flows going through the flood plain gravels as well as the river which makes traditional schemes difficult. Property Level Protection - where an individual house can have simple items fitted to protect their home can be very effective - just make sure you go for a Kitemarked one. And I gather a new resident in the Thames - a Mr George Clooney has just invested in this very thing for his new home. Another cost effective action is, of course, to sign up to our free warnings. JC @2B_Landscape asks: Waterblues film talks of US policy to encourage #WSUD, e.g. runoff tax - what policies can we ask for here? To be precise the Americans don;t have WSUD (water sensitive urban design), they have low impact development (LID) and green infrastructure (GI) for handling stormwater. WSUD is Autralian. The Water Act 2014 positively discourages integrated approaches to water management. It is precisely the integrated approaches that we need. Flooding and the water stress we have every other year are 2 sides to the same issue; but Govt (and Sir Michael Pitt even, when I told him) don't wish to know this. There is some glimmer of hope: CIRIA undertook a WSUD scoping study 2 years ago and are now looking for funding to take this to the next level - delivery in UK. So please contact Paul Shaffer and pledge funds (crowd sourcing?)"
" European leaders have struck a broad climate change pact obliging the EU as a whole to cut greenhouse gases by at least 40% by 2030.   But key aspects of the deal that will form a bargaining position for global climate talks in Paris next year were left vague or voluntary, raising questions as to how the aims would be realised.  As well as the greenhouse gas, two 27% targets were agreed – for renewable energy market share and increase in energy efficiency improvement. The former would be binding only on the EU as a whole. The latter would be optional, although it could be raised to 30% by a review in 2020.  “It was not easy, not at all, but we managed to reach a fair decision that sets the EU on an ambitious but cost-effective climate path,” Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council told a press conference in Brussels.   “This package is very good news for our fight against climate change,” the European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, added. “No player in the world is as ambitious as the EU.”  With an eye on the haggling expected ahead of a global climate summit in Paris next year, the EU’s climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, said the agreement was an important step for the whole world. She said: “We have sent a strong signal to other big economies and all other countries: we have done our homework, now we urge you to follow Europe’s example.”  But a clause was inserted into the text that could trigger a review of the EU’s new targets if other countries do not come forward with comparable commitments in Paris.   The Brussels summit was dominated by arguments over energy savings and climate policy, with countries from Poland to Portugal pleading special circumstances and threatening to veto any breakthrough unless their demands were met.  David Cameron was keen to minimise any perceived loss of UK sovereignty over energy policy, for fear of further exposure to attacks from the Eurosceptic wing of his Conservative party and Ukip. The prime minister won a battle to keep policies aimed at boosting renewables and saving electricity voluntary for member states.  “It’s important that you’ve got flexibility over your energy mix,” said a Downing Street spokeswoman. Cameron had hoped to cut the energy efficiency figure to 25%, but was prepared to accept 27% as long as it was not binding on Britain.  Portugal attained a non-binding objective that 15% of the bloc’s energy be transportable via cross-border connections by 2030, with an invitation to the European Commission to make concrete proposals for project financing from the EU budget.   Danish concerns were addressed with the introduction of a “cap and trade approach” to sectors previously considered outside the bloc’s carbon market such as agriculture, buildings and transport – which alone represents 31% of the bloc’s emissions.   Poland, heavily dependent on coal-fired energy production, threatened to block the deal unless the costs to its economy and industry were discounted by €15bn-€20bn (£12bn-£16bn) between 2020 and 2030, under a complicated system of concessions from the EU’s carbon trading system.  Concessions granted to Poland will allow it to continue reaping hundreds of millions of euros in free allowances to modernise coal-fired power plants. Of eight EU nations eligible for the free allocations, Poland claimed 60% of the total up until 2019.  A poll by TNS and YouGov for the online activist group Avaaz late last week found that 56% of Poles thought that EU financial support for energy should back clean energy rather than fossil fuels. “It’s scandalous,” said Julia Michalak, a spokeswoman for Climate Action Network Europe. “A continuation of free emission permits for Poland’s coal-reliant energy system would be a grave mistake. Leaders who came to Brussels to agree new historic climate goals, are actually discussing whether to hand out money to Europe’s dirtiest power plants.”  Intense bilateral discussions between Cameron, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and other EU leaders over the last week tried to find ways of placating the Poles, who kept open their option of vetoing the summit outcome until the end.  The anticipated 40% greenhouse gas cut by 2030 would be measured against benchmark 1990 levels. That figure is to be binding on the EU and the minimum level achieved, with Germany and Britain happy to agree a higher figure.   Tony Robson, the CEO of Knauf Insulation – a leading insulation firm that had threatened to divest from Europe unless firm energy saving targets were announced – said that the 27% figure for energy efficiency improvement was “no better than business as usual” in an open letter to EU leaders.  A 27% target “sends a strong signal to the energy efficiency industry to ‘leave Europe and make your investments elsewhere’”, he wrote."
"The Antarctic ozone hole, which was expected to reduce in size swiftly when manmade chlorine emissions were outlawed 27 years ago, is stubbornly remaining the size of North America, new data from Nasa suggests.  The hole in the thin layer of gas, which helps shield life on Earth from potentially harmful ultraviolet solar radiation that can cause skin cancers, grows and contracts throughout the year but reached its maximum extent on 9 September when monitors at the south pole showed it to cover 24.1m square km (9.3m sq miles). This is about 9% below the record maximum in 2000 but almost the same as in 2010, 2012 and 2013.  But scientists remain unsure why the hole has not reduced more since the Montreal Protocol agreement was signed by countries in 1987.  This global treaty is considered one of the world’s most successful, having been pushed through in record time. It bans the use of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), substances that were widely-used in household and industrial products such as refrigerators, spray cans, insulation foam and fire suppressants.  “The ozone hole area is smaller than what we saw in the late-1990s and early 2000s, and we know that chlorine levels are decreasing. However, we are still uncertain about whether a long-term Antarctic stratospheric temperature warming might be reducing this ozone depletion,” said Paul A Newman, chief scientist for atmospheres at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “It’s broadly on track [to reduce in size],” said Dr Jonathan Shanklin, emeritus professor at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, one of the three scientists who discovered the hole in the 1980s. “We knew it was always going to take a long time to recover because the CFCs were long-lived.” He said the reason why it was not healing more quickly was because the interaction between climate change and the ozone hole was complex. “The ozone hole itself is affecting the climate of Antarctica and Australia, and is being affected by it. It is changing the wind systems.  “As the ozone hole [gradually] fills in, so we can expect, over the next 50 or so years, the effects of climate change to increase. We will see different patterns of climate change”.  Last month the UN Environment Programme (Unep) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) said there were “positive indications” that the ozone layer was on track to recovery, but warned it might take a further 35 years or more to recover to 1980 levels. They said that without the Montreal Protocol atmospheric levels of ozone depleting substances could have increased tenfold by 2050.   According to Unep, by 2030 the treaty will have prevented two million cases of skin cancer annually, averted damage to human eyes and immune systems, and protected wildlife and agriculture."
"As an economic researcher, most of my work focuses on uncertainty. In particular, I study the problem of unforeseen contingencies, or, in ordinary language, surprises.  As a researcher on climate change and member of the Climate Change Authority, easily the biggest surprise of this year for me was the appearance of Clive Palmer and Al Gore, jointly discussing the problem of climate change.  After that shock, yesterday’s press conference seemed like part of the “new normal”. Featuring Palmer, environment minister Greg Hunt and Bernie Fraser, chairman of the CCA, the government’s Direct Action plan was agreed to and yet another study into the possibility of an Emissions Trading Scheme announced.  To understand what is going on here, it is necessary to observe that there are really two separate debates about climate policy.  The first, substantive, debate is whether we should be acting to stabilise the global climate in line with our shared global commitment to limit warming to 2 degrees celsius. Any serious action along these lines must involve an implicit or explicit price on carbon dioxide emissions. The opponents of action fit into two groups, both strongly represented in the government’s support base. The first are interest groups associated with fossil fuels, and particularly coal, for whom effective mitigation (in the absence of a so-far nonexistent technology for carbon capture and storage on a large scale) represents an existential threat far more immediate than the destruction of most planetary ecosystems over the next century.  The other group are rightwing tribalists who oppose climate mitigation because groups they hate (environmentalists and scientists) support it. These tribalists claim to be “sceptics” about the science of climate change. In reality, their position bears no relationship to scepticism or to any kind of evidence-based belief. Rather it is the dogmatic restatement of a tribal shibboleth, similar to creationism, trutherism and birtherism. These groups saw the election of the Abbott government as a vindication, but it has become clear that they represent a minority viewpoint. The coincidental (though predictable in the long term) occurrence of record-breaking heatwaves has further undermined them. The second dispute, entirely semantic but nonetheless bitter and politically consequential is about the words used to describe the carbon price and the design of policies that can be made to fit these words.  Because of its history, tangled with the prime ministerial career of Julia Gillard, the term “carbon tax” is politically toxic, particularly to the LNP. On the other hand, subsidy schemes like Labor’s carbon farming initiative, which provides the model for the government’s emission reduction fund (aka direct action) are seen as acceptable.  Yet in economic terms, a subsidy for not doing something has the same effects as a tax on doing it. The main difference is that it is much easier to determine that someone is emitting CO2 and tax them, than to determine that they are emitting less than they would otherwise do, and paying a subsidy. An emissions trading scheme also places a price on carbon emissions. In this case, however, the government determines the volume of emissions that will be allowed, and market trade determines the price. The main advantage of an ETS over other ways of implementing a carbon price is that it facilitates international trade, meaning that Australia can take advantage of low-cost emissions opportunities overseas, to allow more time for the difficult task of decarbonising our own economy. Hopefully, having ended the carbon tax, and having been forced to accept the idea of an ETS, at least as a subject of study, the Abbott government will be in a position to move on both from the doomed denialism of the rightwing tribalists and the semantics of the carbon price, and return Australia to the mainstream of global policy on climate change. The upcoming G20 meeting would be a great opportunity."
"Global warming is changing the way the US trains for and goes to war – affecting war games, weapons systems, training exercises, and military installations – according to the Pentagon. The defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, will tell a high-level meeting of military leaders on Monday that the Pentagon is undertaking sweeping changes to operation systems and installations to keep up with a growing threat of rising seas, droughts, and natural disasters caused by climate change.  “A changing climate will have real impacts on our military and the way it executes its missions,” Hagel wrote in his introduction to a Pentagon report out today. “We are considering the impacts of climate change in our war games and defence planning scenarios.” The Pentagon’s strategic planners have for years viewed climate change as a “threat multiplier”– worsening old conflicts and potentially provoking new clashes over migration and shortages of food and water in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, and opening up new military challenges in a melting Arctic. But with Monday’s report, climate change moved from potential threat to an immediate factor in a wide range of operational and budgeting decisions. “It makes it a reality that climate change indeed is a risk today, and we need to plan, programme and budget for it now and into the future,” said Sherri Goodman, chief executive of the military advisory board, a group of former generals and other high-ranking officers that studies US national security. The report – unveiled at a meeting of more than 30 defence ministers from the Americas and Europe – also signalled US intention to take a lead role at international climate negotiations in Lima in December. From now on, the military will factor climate change into a host of day-to-day decisions, a senior defence official told a conference call with reporters. “It’s about being baked into things we are already doing, and incorporated into all the other things we are doing,” he said. Those decisions could include war games, training exercises, and purchasing decisions – which could all be affected by conditions such as sea-level rise, heat waves, and drought. War games scenarios would now factor in floods or storms instead of assuming optimal conditions, said Goodman. “You could make the game more complex with sea-level rise, and extreme weather events.” She said the navy would have to test sonar and other systems under the changing ocean chemistry. The military will have to adapt to hotter temperatures. One of the biggest and most costly decisions ahead is the location of some 7,000 US military sites. As the report acknowledged, US military installations and personnel are already exposed to climate change. The Hampton Roads area in Virginia – which houses the biggest concentration of US forces – already floods during high tides and severe storms, and could see an additional 1.5 feet of sea level rise in the next 20 years. Meanwhile, military bases in the south-west are coping with water and electricity shortages, under recurring droughts. Arctic land-based installations are shifting because of melting permafrost, while retreating sea ice is changing naval requirements. The Pentagon is not planning a wholesale relocation of bases, the officials told the call. But they said the military was already bringing in sandbags and moving generators out of basements in low-lying areas. It was also shelving ideas for new construction on flood plains. Other potential changes include cuts to outdoor training exercises – because of heat waves, or increased weapons maintenance costs and repairs because of heat and dust. “As we think about changing weather patterns we have to think hard about where operations might be conducted and whether we need to change the assumptions about what kind of air breathing conditions ... what kind of sea state we might expect in an operating environment, and what impact they might have.” The report said troops could also be at greater risk of infectious diseases, which spread more rapidly in hotter temperatures. Hagel in comments to reporters at the weekend said the Pentagon anticipated an increase in humanitarian missions, because of natural disasters and recurring famines. He also said the Arctic presented a growing military challenge. “We see an Arctic that is melting, meaning that most likely a new sea lane will emerge,” he said. “We know that there are significant minerals and natural deposits of oil and natural gas there. That means that nations will compete for those natural resources. That’s never been an issue before. You couldn’t get up there and get anything out of there. We have to manage through what those conditions and new realities are going to bring in the way of potential threats.” The Pentagon was first instructed by Congress in 2007 to incorporate climate change into its long-term security planning. But Republicans in Congress have gone on to block the military from preparing for a warmer future, cutting funds for intelligence gathering or testing low-carbon jet fuels. Officials told the call that planning for the future would help bring down climate-related costs. “There is a lot you can do to mitigate risk and lower the cost of risks if you acknowledge the risk exists,” the officials said."
" Fifteen years years ago the villages around Abrha Weatsbha in northern Ethiopia were on the point of being abandoned. The hillsides were barren, the communities, plagued by floods and droughts, needed constant food aid, and the soil was being washed away.   Today, Abrha Weatsbha in the Tigray region is unrecognisable and an environmental catastrophe has been averted following the planting of many millions of tree and bush seedlings. Wells that were dry have been recharged, the soil is in better shape, fruit trees grow in the valleys and the hillsides are green again.    The “regreening” of the area, achieved in just a few years for little cost by farming communities working together to close off large areas to animals, save water and replant trees, is now to be replicated across one sixth of Ethiopia – an area the size of England and Wales. The most ambitious attempt yet to reduce soil erosion, increase food security and adapt to climate change is expected to vastly increase the amount of food grown in one of the most drought- and famine-prone areas of the world.   “Large areas of Ethiopia and the Sahel were devastated by successive droughts and overgrazing by animals in the 1960s and 1970s,” says Chris Reij, a researcher with the World Resources Institute in Washington.   “There was a significant drop in rainfall, people had to extend the land they cultivated and this led to massive destruction and an environmental crisis across the Sahel. But the experience of Tigray, where over 224,000 hectares of land has now been restored shows that recovery of vegetation in dryland areas can be very fast. Tigray is now much more food secure than it was 10 years ago. You really see the changes there,” he says.   Rather than just plant trees, which is notoriously unreliable and expensive in dry land areas, the farmers have turned to “agro-ecology”, a way to combine crops and trees on the same pieces of land.  In Tigray it has involved communities building miles of terraces and low walls, or bunds, to hold back rainwater from slopes, the closure of large areas of bare land to allow natural regeneration of trees and vegetation, and the widespread planting of seedlings.   “The scale of restoration of degraded land in Tigray is possibly unmatched anywhere else in the world. The people ... may have moved more earth and stone [in recent years] to reshape the surface of their land than the Egyptians during thousands of years to build the pyramids,” says Reij.   “In the early 1990s every able-bodied villager in Tigray had to contribute three months of labour to dig pits to save water, or to construct terraces and bunds to stop water rushing off the hills. This was reduced later to 40 days a year and currently it is 20 days a year.  “Several hundred thousand hectares are now under ‘exclosures’ - degraded areas in which no cutting and grazing is permitted. This allows the natural regeneration of vegetation. Tens of thousands of kilometres of rock bunds and terraces have been constructed, often on steep slopes,” he added.  Ethiopia’s pledge to restore a further 15m hectares of degraded land was the largest of many made at the end of UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon’s New York climate summit last month, where governments, companies and civil society groups together agreed to try to restore 350m hectares of deforested landscapes - an area the size of India - by 2030.  Commitments have now come from Uganda (2.5m hectares), Democratic Republic of the Congo (8m hectares), Colombia (1m hectares), Guatemala (1.2m hectares), and Chile (100,000 hectares). Many others are expected to follow in the run-up to the Paris climate talks in December 2015 because the restoration of degraded land is expected to qualify for carbon credits.   Africa, with help from the World Bank, the UK government and development groups like Oxfam and World Vision, has emerged as the leader in restoring the world’s estimated 2bn hectares of degraded lands.  According to Reij, a quiet revolution has seen over 200m trees planted and 5m hectares of degraded land regreened in Niger. The result, says a report by the International Food policy research institute, has been extra 500,000 tonnes of food grown in the country with the fastest growing population in the world, as well as an increase in biodiversity and incomes.  In Burkina Faso where 2-300,000 hectares of land has been regreened, food production has grown about 80,000 tons a year – enough to feed an extra 500,000 people.  “There are a lot of inspirational examples in Africa. In Tanzania 500,000 hectares of land has been restored. What this shows is that well-managed ecosystems are good for biodiversity as well as for food security, water supplies and climate change,” said Stewart Maginnis, director of International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) nature-based solutions group in Geneva.  Increasing the rate of restoration of degraded lands will be vital both for feeding fast-growing populations and adapting to climate change, says Green Belt Movement (GBM) international director, Pauline Kamau. “Africa is already experiencing some of the most dramatic extreme temperature events ever seen. Without action to reduce emissions, average annual temperatures on the continent are likely to rise 3-4C by the end of the century and [there could be] a 30% reduction in rainfall in sub Saharan Africa.  “We know that regreening could be a key part of the solution to these problems. Agriculture, forestry and other land use changes accounts for nearly 25% of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Restoring degraded lands can both help rein in warming and adapt to higher temperatures,” she said."
"A minimum 40% plunge in Europe’s CO2 emissions by 2030 agreed by EU leaders last week was a “historic moment” on the road to a global climate deal, enabled by a new British relationship with Poland, the energy minister Ed Davey has told the Guardian. The bloc’s proposed greenhouse gas curb will be studied closely by China, the US and other major emitters ahead of a global climate summit in Paris next year that aims to agree on the first new emissions-cutting treaty since the Kyoto protocol in 1997. “I really think this package is quite a historic moment on the pathway to that elusive global deal,” Davey said in an exclusive interview. “It is probably the most significant environmental agreement that a British government has ever been involved in.” Coal-dependent Poland had threatened to veto any agreement that raised its energy prices – adding to the country’s ‘renegade’ image in Brussels. But in lengthy talks, the Polish environment minister, Marcin Korolec, was persuaded by the UK’s agenda of an energy transition that was cost-effective, flexible, technology-neutral and secure. “We spent more time with Polish ministers, officials and their energy sector than any other country – just to understand where they’re coming from because you have to respect other member states and find a way forward,” Davey said. “It was painstaking and took a protracted amount of time but it was worth it in the end.” The agreement allows the EU to continue pursuing a roadmap that is intended to arrive at a reduction of carbon output of 80-95% by 2050, in line with IPCC recommendations for keeping within a 2C trajectory of global warming.  Asked whether Poland was committed to that end goal, Davey said: “I think they are. I think they see it as in their interests for energy security reasons.”  Polish government sources though, hedged when asked the same question. “There is no 2050 goal,” one said. “There is only 2030.” The 2030 package has been criticised for granting Poland concessions including an estimated 200 million free carbon allowances (emissions credits) – worth about €4bn (£3bn) at a carbon price of €20 per tonne – and a new modernisation fund for poorer EU countries to upgrade their energy sector, which may be worth €6bn in the decade to 2030. Environmentalists fear that some of the fund could be spent on Polish coal-fired plants. From the Polish perspective, indigenous coal supplies offer immediate energy security in the face of an often hostile neighbour to the east.  Davey said that the final deal had a “greater environmental integrity” than the 2020 climate package negotiated by Tony Blair, because it would give fewer free allowances to Polish coal plants. “Of course we were never going to get a deal with Poland if they weren’t able to burn more coal than possibly we were comfortable with,” he added. “We had the UK on our side in many issues,” a Polish official confirmed. “The [Paris 2015] review clause was one of these. That helped. Apart from that, good working relations between Poland and the UK also helped when closing the deal.” The review clause is an ambiguously worded text, promising to “revert” to the EU’s package after the Paris summit. EU leaders insist that the preceding passage in the text calling for ambitious counter-pledges from other states indicates that the 40% greenhouse gas cut may only get added to. “The package is clear that it is ‘at least 40%’ – so the review is upwards only,” Davey said. “If we get a really good deal and America and China step forward, it means that we can go further. But the EU is saying that we are going to do 40% regardless of the rest of world.” Warsaw attaches a different emphasis to the clause, related to the way that increased ambition may be imposed outside the bloc’s carbon market, but touching on the fractious arguments over qualified majority voting and, potentially, the national veto.  “The review clause and embedded ‘consensus’ are there to make sure the spirit of the conclusions is reflected when implementing the package,” a government source said, “so there is no ‘upwards-downwards’ discussion but [rather] how to make sure everyone feels safe with us further moving forward.” This may set alarm bells ringing for environmental NGOs and clean energy industries, which have already condemned the package for a lack of legally-binding targets.  Friends of the Earth say that even the aspirational 27% improvement in efficiency by 2030 will be based on a projection made in 2007 before the economic crisis, when expected growth rates – and thus energy consumption – were far higher. Ingrid Holmes, the associate director of the E3G thinktank told the Guardian that 2007 was the “worst possible” starting point for energy use reductions. “It’s before the slowdown so overestimates energy use compared to what we are doing,” she said. “It equals 12% energy savings in today’s economy.”"

"In northern Minnesota, there’s a near-mythic expanse of lakes and boreal forests known as the North Woods, packed with spruces, firs, red and bur oaks, and other trees. It’s in danger of vanishing forever.  The North Woods joins the ever-lengthening list of regions threatened by climate change. Temperatures in Minnesota have increased by more than 1.5F since record keeping began, according to a 2013 report by the state’s interagency climate adaptation team. Temperatures have risen even more in the northern portion of the state, and the growth is picking up speed, with more than 80% of the recorded increase happening since 1980.  These increases are expected to continue through the next 50 years, joined by more days of extreme heat, heavier precipitation and other changes to the region’s climate. As rainfall and other conditions shift because of climate change, once iconic species like spruce and fir may move northward, either leaving the forests replaced by unproductive grasslands or given over to the hardwoods more common further south. Climate change, the state report says, will “likely exacerbate and intensify the effects of invasive plant species, insect pests, and tree diseases”. In other words, the forest – like others across the northern United States and southern Canada – could disappear. Now the conservationists most driven to save the forest may do so only by changing its nature for good.  In the hope that it may be able to save the North Woods, the Nature Conservancy’s North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota chapter has begun experimenting with a controversial technique that – if proven to be successful – could lead to trees being moved from distant reaches of the state’s forests to those most threatened by climate change. Led by Meredith Cornett, the chapter’s science director, the conservancy wants to test “assisted migration”, a lightning-rod conservation practice that broadly means moving species from one region to another either to help that species or the target region adapt to changing conditions.  In actuality, assisted migration is a nuanced concept. The Nature Conservancy study, called the Iron Range Experiment, is a small test meant to compare how specific tree species – and genotypes, or variations – within those species fare under different climate conditions and forestry practices.  Here’s how it will work: Nature Conservancy will plant seeds for 100,000 red oak, bur oak and white pine trees on 2,000 acres of federal, state and local forests in Minnesota’s Iron Range. Seeds from each species will come from two zones: one from within the test range, and another from distant parts of the species’ historic range (mostly from southern Minnesota, and, in some cases, a portion of Michigan where the trees exist).  Researchers from the University of Minnesota Duluth will then manage these test forests in different ways to find out whether varying how the trees are planted and managed affect how each species fares; how different climate conditions affect their viability; and whether seeds originating from other parts of the forest – where different conditions exist – impact how two seemingly identical trees withstand the same conditions.  If the trees moved from distant zones prove to adapt well, this kind of assisted migration could be adopted as a way to maintain the health of forests that might otherwise be decimated by climate change.  Some critics argue that this type of intervention would change the essential character of the forest. Indeed, some of the species being moved are the hardwoods that may one day replace the North Woods’ conifers in any case as a result of climate change.  But Meredith Cornett, the science director of the Nature Conservancy chapter conducting the experiment, compares managing forests to restoring historic buildings. In both cases, she says, sacrifices are controversial – and, perhaps, necessary.  For example, she asks, is it better to restore a historic home to an exact copy of its original construction, or to use modern knowledge and new technologies to protect the structure? When should such a home’s conservationists hew to historic building techniques and finishes, and when should they install new wiring, place well-insulated storm windows and avoid lead-based paint?  “We’re still trying to maintain the character of the home and keep [it] there in the neighborhood, but the world has changed, and we’ve got new tools available to us,” Cornett says. The term “assisted migration” was coined after proposals to transplant Torreya Pines from Florida to North Carolina in 2007 sparked heated debate. But Julie Etterson, the University of Minnesota biologist conducting the study with the Nature Conservancy, says the definition of the practice isn’t completely clear. Critics often seem to judge assisted migration projects using a double standard: traditional forestry practices are far more disruptive than the movement of small samples of distant genotypes that are part of the same species, she claims. “I think that’s a little bit ridiculous given what foresters do, which is wholesale movement of genotypes across the landscape,” Etterson says. “It seems like in the context of the lumber industry that’s fine. In the context of climate change, you’re breaching some sort of conservation barrier that’s inappropriate.” What’s more, Etterson says, the impact of assisted migration is unclear. In fact, clarifying the process and its effects is a large part of the Iron Range experiment. “My general feeling is we just don’t know enough about the consequences of genetic mixing to go full force into widespread assisted migration, so I’ve been working with the Nature Conservancy in the design of experiments that we might do,” she says. Christopher Preston, an environmental ethicist at the University of Montana, says many ecologists would consider Etterson’s form of assisted forestry as different from migration for agriculture or timber because of the intention behind each practice. “A lot of environmentalists in the environmental ethics community are a little leery of assisted migration because it is [a little] like nature plus the human hand,” Preston explains. “Is it better I have these species here through the help of my hand or to not have this species at all? Is it better to leave some landscapes untouched and let things unfold?” Many ecologists believe that moving a species, even a tree, from its native ecosystem to put it somewhere else transforms it into something else. “It’s a little bit like a polar bear in a zoo,” Preston says. “Some people think that’s no longer a polar bear.” For Cornett of the Nature Conservancy, Minnesota’s natural and cultural identity is intricately linked, and – she argues – the state needs novel approaches to preserve its North Woods. “It is a wild place and it has tremendous recreational and cultural value, to say nothing of the jobs it supports and so on,” she says. It’s not hard to see the economic impact of forestry in Minnesota. According to a data sheet provided by the Nature Conservancy, the state’s forests are responsible for 20,000 jobs and more than $2bn in annual wages, as well as $7bn in timber harvest values. The forests are also responsible for hundreds of millions of tourism dollars. The state’s woodlands also provide considerable quality of life benefits for people in the region. “When it comes to protecting water quality, healthy forests may be as close as we get to a silver bullet,” the Conservancy explains in its data sheet. “They are nature’s own water purification system, absorbing pollutants and trapping sediment before they damage lakes, rivers and groundwater.” But while there’s no question that Minnesota’s forests benefit its citizens, Preston says that environmentalism isn’t only about ensuring that nature serves human needs.  “It’s about letting the earth be,” he says. “The ecosystem services language is one you have to use carefully. If it’s about restoring the ecosystem function, then there are arguments to think that that’s probably a good idea. Preserving function with a little bit of help from humans might be something that humanity can do.” While some ecologists believe that humans have meddled enough with the wilderness, others take a more pragmatic perspective. Cornett argues that there is an urgent need to do something to help Minnesota’s forests survive. “We could argue that we should just let nature take its course, but nature has never really faced this situation before,” she says. “We’ve just never seen things changing at this pace.” Besides, she points out, northern Minnesota’s 6m acres of forests have been managed for more than a century. “My sense is we’re choosing to actively manage a landscape that has already been actively managed,” she says. Etterson goes even further, saying that, rather than tinkering with nature, the experiment may contribute to re-establishing connections that can no longer happen naturally. “It is a little interventionist, but I don’t think it’s unnatural,” she says. While management is an ongoing process, it’s becoming more controversial – particularly in light of climate change. In recent weeks, publications ranging from Ensia to the New York Times have covered the topic, which is growing increasingly hot in scholarly circles. One scholar discussing this is John Pedlar, a Natural Resources Canada forest landscape biologist (pdf). Although he still worries about “designer ecosystems”, he says, he’s abandoned long-held beliefs about conservation over the last five to 10 years because of climate change.  “I was someone who was a real believer of keeping things in their own ranges,” he says. “The quote that hits home for me is that ‘climate change changes everything.’ It’s true. It’s just a game changer.”  Bill Lascher is a freelance journalist based in Portland, Oregon, currently working on a book about World War II-era foreign correspondent Melville Jacoby.

"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has corrected a controversial claim that small amounts of global warming could have overall positive economic impacts, after I pointed out that it was based on inaccurate information. The final version of the IPCC’s report on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability was published without fanfare on the web this week, including a chapter on Key Economic Sectors and Services.  The final draft of the chapter, which was published in April, featured a section on the aggregate economic impacts of climate change, containing the statement: “Climate change may be beneficial for moderate climate change but turn negative for greater warming.” But the version published this week omits the statement because it was based on faulty data. The statement had been inserted into the draft report at a late stage in the preparation process, and after it had been sent to independent reviewers, including me, for comment. It was based on a paper by Richard Tol, a professor of economics at the University of Sussex, who was also a coordinating lead author on the economics chapter of the IPCC report. The paper was one in a series by Prof Tol which had reviewed studies by a number of researchers on the potential economic impacts of climate change. However, the first paper in the series, published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2009, had contained a number of errors, including a claim that some other studies had found net positive impacts for warming of less than 3C. Unfortunately, Tol had not used the correct figures from these studies. I discovered the errors after a draft of the IPCC chapter was leaked online in January, and I alerted Tol and the other authors of the report. The IPCC acknowledged the mistakes in the draft and agreed that the final version should not include them. In May, the Journal of Economic Perspectives published an update and correction to Tol’s paper, in which he admitted the errors. However, Tol’s 2009 paper had already been heavily promoted by climate change sceptics. In October 2013, The Spectator magazine published a front–page article under the headline ‘Why climate change is good for the world’. It was written by Viscount Ridley who, likeTol, is a member of the Academic Advisory Council of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which was set up by Lord Lawson to campaign against the UK Government’s climate change policies. Viscount Ridley’s article stated: “Prof Tol calculated that climate change would be beneficial up to 2.2C of warming from 2009 (when he wrote his paper).” Tol caused controversy in April when he announced that he had withdrawn from the team preparing a summary of the IPCC report on the grounds that he did not agree with the other authors. The summary points out: “Economic impact estimates completed over the past 20 years vary in their coverage of subsets of economic sectors and depend on a large number of assumptions, many of which are disputable, and many estimates do not account for catastrophic changes, tipping points, and many other factors.” It concludes: “With these recognised limitations, the incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for additional temperature increases of ~2C are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income.” A number of economists have criticised the models used to estimate future losses due to climate change, and an official journal of the American Economic Association published a collection of papers last year which examined their usefulness. Robert Pindyck, professor of economics and finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), declared: “These models have crucial flaws that make them close to useless as tools for policy analysis.” Lord Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at London School of Economics and Political Science and president of the British Academy, pointed out: “Scientific models, because they omit key factors that are hard to capture precisely, appear to substantially underestimate these risks.” He added: “Many economic models add further gross underassessment of risk because the assumptions built into the economic modelling on growth, damages and risks, come close to assuming directly that the impacts and costs will be modest and close to excluding the possibility of catastrophic outcomes.” In a new paper due to appear in the The Economic Journal, published by the Royal Economic Society, Stern and Dr Simon Dietz show that if models are amended so that climate change impacts can affect the drivers of economic growth, they find that rising global temperatures could lead to a collapse in living standards.

"Tim Birkhead has been monitoring guillemots for 42 years – with intriguing results. His surveys, carried out on Skomer island in Wales, have provided key information about the wellbeing of the sea birds’ population around the British Isles and has also produced important insights into the health of our seas. However, the zoologist’s four-decade-long project is now threatened with closure. The newly formed quango Natural Resources Wales has said it will not continue to fund the £12,000-a-year survey, as part of a cost-cutting exercise. Unless cash can be raised as a matter of urgency, this year’s survey will be the last.  The news has dismayed the 64-year-old professor of zoology at Sheffield University. “This is an incredibly short-sighted decision,” Birkhead said. “We have built an extremely important database of guillemot population parameters and breeding rates, which tells a great deal about variations in numbers of these birds, about the health of their populations and about the health of our seas in general. But that entire database is now under threat merely to save a modest amount of money.” Among the data gleaned from the Skomer study has been the discovery that guillemots are now breeding, on average, two-and-a-half weeks earlier than they did 42 years ago. “That is a clear signal that climate change is having a direct impact on the behaviour of these sea birds,” added Birkhead. Birkhead first visited Skomer in 1972 to begin his PhD on the guillemot population there. “It was a ridiculously ambitious task, I realised later. Guillemots do not start breeding until they are seven years old, so you cannot hope to get an accurate picture of their reproductive success until you have amassed many years of data. That is why I decided to maintain the survey every year since then and so have been involved in studying Skomer guillemots for all these decades.” In the 1930s there were around 100,000 pairs on Skomer. By 1972, when Birkhead first began work there, that had fallen to 2,000 pairs, probably because of oil spills from ships sunk during the second world war. Since then, numbers have rebounded, so that there are now around 25,000 pairs of guillemots on the island. “Guillemots are doing well there, but they are doing very badly in other parts of Britain. In Shetland they have virtually stopped breeding because their favourite food, the sand eel, is now being fished by humans. We need to keep a very careful eye on the guillemots of Skomer because fluctuations in populations can tell so much about the changes humans are making to the natural world,” said Birkhead. However, a spokesman for Natural Resources Wales denied that the decision to block funds for the Skomer guillemot project would jeopardise future understanding of the bird’s behaviour. “Public spending is very tight at present and we have to prioritise the projects we support. The decision to cut the funding for this study was taken more than a year ago by our predecessor body, the Countryside Council for Wales,” he said. “Sheffield University was given plenty of warning that funds would no longer be available for the survey. In any case, we continue to fund important monitoring of birds – including guillemots – on Skomer. Although it is not as detailed as the work by Sheffield University, it provides us with the information we need to properly protect the reserve.” However, Birkhead said these other surveys had produced misleading results and would not provide the breadth of information that has been generated by the Sheffield study about the population changes in the guillemot. “These birds are excellent indicators of the health of the ocean,” said Birkhead, who has launched a crowdsourcing appeal to raise money for the project. “I have had a very good response to that appeal, but it is a shame that research of such importance has to be funded in this hand-to-mouth manner.”"
"MPs should follow in the footsteps of the Rockeller family, Glasgow University and churches around the world by pulling their pension fund investments out of fossil fuels, according to Caroline Lucas. The Green party MP says the £487m Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund should join the movement of hundreds of institutions worldwide who have already divested $50bn (£31bn) from gas, coal and oil investments as a way of tackling climate change. A University of Oxford study says the campaign has grown faster than any previous divestment movements, including those on apartheid and tobacco.  Lucas has written to Brian Donohoe, the chairman of the fund’s trustees board, telling him that she is particularly concerned that the fund is contributing to global warming and of the economic risk to such assets if governments put in place “effective climate regulation”. “MPs, parliament, should be demonstrating a positive way forward, it’s incumbent to make sure our house is in order. It’s not helpful if parliament is setting an example whereby we’re not shifting our pension funds to sustainable sources and inadvertently potentially accelerating climate change,” Lucas told the Guardian. Last month, Glasgow became the first university in Europe to vote to pull its endowment out of fossil fuels. Students across the UK are lobbying universities to follow suit, including King’s College London where campaigners met the vice-principal last week and the School of Oriental and African Studies where a decision is expected later this year. Lucas said the divestment campaign had benefited from comments by the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who said earlier this month that the “vast majority of reserves are unburnable.” “There’s a strong economic reason [to divest] ... That these pension funds might not be performing as well as they might appear, once you factor in the fact that the investment in fossil fuels could well be unrealisable if we take seriously the fact we need to be weaning ourselves off fossil fuels and stay below 2C warming,” Lucas said, adding that she expected the call to attract cross-party support. Donohoe, a Labour MP for Central Ayrshire, said he did not think fossil fuels were an investment the fund should avoid, or pull out of. “We’ve got to balance what individuals like she [Lucas] will say about certain investments... [with] the good of the fund. Now that doesn’t mean to say we go down an amoral road, with tobacco or whatever else, clearly we don’t. But fossil fuels is something else completely. I just don’t think that’s an issue in itself that we would want to avoid any form of investment [in].” He added that his personal view was that Lucas was a lone voice on the issue. “I don’t know what she’s talking about frankly. If she’s talking about stopping taking coal out of the earth, that would have to be universally applied, there’d be a closure to all coal-fired power stations. That would have quite a significant impact on Soctland and perhaps elsewhere. I don’t know where she’s coming from on this one.” The fund does not disclose how much of its value is invested in fossil fuels."
"Imagine an infinitely recyclable product that performs as well as the alternative, costs less to make, and is unquestionably better for the environment. You would bet on its success, wouldn’t you? Novelis, the world’s largest recycler of aluminum, has made that bet. Since 2012 the Atlanta, Georgia-based company has invested half a billion dollars in recycling by building, among other things, the world’s biggest aluminum recycling plant. This $260m high-tech marvel officially opened earlier this month in Nachterstedt, Germany. Novelis uses the facility to produce materials for its “evercan”, a beverage container made of 90% recycled aluminum.  As an infinitely recyclable metal, aluminum is a poster child for shifting from a linear take-make-waste model of industrial production to a circular model in which everything, at the end of its useful life, is made into something else.  On its website Novelis endorses the circular economy, stating that it is moving its “whole business model” toward a closed loop. “We are embracing an entirely new way of thinking and operating, in order to radically transform our company – and, in the process, lead the way in our industry.”  But Novelis is having trouble finding followers. None of the world’s major beverage companies have adopted the evercan. So far, the product has just one customer: Red Hare Brewing Co., a small craft brewer based in Marietta, Georgia. Conrad McKerron, a senior vice president at the nonprofit As You Sow, who has worked on beverage packaging issues for years, says recycled packaging is “absolutely where we need to be going, in terms of resource efficiency.” About Novelis, he says: “They’ve made public commitments, and they’ve staked out a leadership position … [I]t’s now up to Coke and Pepsi”. Why the beverage companies aren’t buying is unclear, especially given their rhetoric about recycling. Coca-Cola, for example, touts its intention to “leverage our significant scale and resources to contribute meaningfully to the ‘circular economy’, in which materials are used and reused to constantly rebuild natural and social capital”. PepsiCo, meanwhile, proclaims that it strives for what it calls “the five Rs”: “reduce, recycle, use renewable sources, remove environmentally sensitive materials and promote the reuse of packaging in the entire process of packaging selection, design and procurement”. AB InBev, producer of Budweiser beers, is similarly effusive, stating that “we continuously raise the bar by reducing the amount of material we use, recycling everything we can, integrating the use of recycled inputs into our packaging and ensuring that our packaging is recyclable whenever possible”.  Recently, I traveled to Germany to tour the Novelis recycling plant and lead a forum with experts on the circular economy. [Disclosure: Novelis paid my travel expenses and a moderating fee.]  At the Nachterstedt plant, bales of crushed cans trucked in from all over Central and Eastern Europe, dirtied with paints and coatings, go into one end. The scrap is then shredded into little pieces, purified, melted down and cast into 25-ton ingots.  These ingots are then shipped to a nearby plant and rolled into sheets. Some are sold to big global packaging companies, such as Rexam and Ball, which manufacture cans to meet the specifications set by the beverage brands. Others go to the auto and electronics industries. (Here’s a video about the evercan, with an endorsement from Jonathan Porritt, a respected environmentalist and advisor to Novelis.) It turns out that Novelis, which booked $9.8bn in revenue last year, is selling plenty of recycled aluminum to the auto industry. Driven largely by fuel-efficiency regulations, automakers including Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, Audi and BMW are all substituting lighter-weight aluminum for steel. By opting for recycled aluminum they can reduce not only the greenhouse gas emissions they cause directly, but also the “embedded carbon” in their vehicles: the amount of heat-trapping gas pollution created by production of the materials used in each new truck or car. Many aluminum customers – notably Ford – are also becoming suppliers, selling the scrap left over from manufacturing back to Novelis for reprocessing. You can see the circular economy taking hold. “It’s interesting to watch our customers,” Phil Martens, CEO of Novelis, told me. “In some areas, we are a bit ahead of them and in some others they are pulling us.” In the car industry, he says, “The tipping point has happened”.  But the automotive sector will only account for 9% of his firm’s revenues in FY2014. 62% of its business is aluminum cans.  Why, I wondered, aren’t the big beverage companies buying? The beer companies were no help. AB InBev declined to talk about aluminum recycling for this article. So did MillerCoors. The soft drink giants were a bit more forthcoming. Tim Carey, senior director of sustainability at PepsiCo, said: “I love that Novelis is pushing the envelope. 90% is a nice improvement”. But decisions about packaging are ultimately up to his procurement executives, , Carey said, who tell him Novelis is charging a premium for its aluminum. Novelis says that’s not so. Coca-Cola provided a bit more insight, saying through a spokesperson that “We source our aluminum can sheet from various suppliers, many of whom offer can sheet that includes recycled content. Use of the Novelis ‘Evercan’ requires the Company to restrict our supply to only Novelis material”. In other words, committing to more recycled aluminum would mean committing to Novelis – and no company wants to be dependent on a single supplier, even if that supplier is willing to sign long-term agreements, as Novelis says it is.  No one I spoke with disputed the economic and environmental benefits of aluminum recycling. Processing used aluminum requires about 90% less energy and generates 90% fewer carbon emissions than making new aluminum out of bauxite. It also costs a lot less (although Novelis wouldn’t say how much). Nor does anyone disagree that the evercan, with its minimum of 90% recycled content, is an environmentally superior package to the typical aluminum can. Further, unlike PET plastic bottles, aluminum cans can be recycled again and again with no loss of quality. So not surprisingly, aluminum is recycled at much higher rates than PET. In North America beverage cans contain an average of about 68% recycled aluminum, according to the Aluminum Association. PET bottles contain much less recycled material – 10% or so for the big beverage companies – partly because the textile industry buys large quantities of used PET. It seems, then, that for the circular economy to take hold, a good product isn’t enough. Several other things need to change as well, including business models and relationships with suppliers and customers. No one should shed any tears for Novelis. Unlike its rival Alcoa, Novelis no longer owns bauxite mines or primary processing facilities. So strictly in business terms, Novelis should be able to recoup its investment in recycling facilities by lowering its costs. But Novelis needs to increase the supply of recycled cans to feed plants like the one in Nachterstedt. That means consumers have to recycle more. The influence and marketing clout of a big beverage company would surely help.  Indeed, a few years ago Alcoa tried to get the aluminum industry, beverage companies and waste haulers behind a marketing campaign to drive up all kinds of recycling. But only a handful of companies – Novelis and New Belgium among them – agreed to provide financial support. The effort fell flat. At first glance Coca-Cola would seem like the most obvious major evercan customer, since the firm has pledged to increase recycling of bottles and cans and use more recycled and renewable content in packaging. But the company and its bottlers focus on PET, not aluminum. The Coca-Cola system (which includes the Atlanta-based drinks company and bottlers around the world) has made major investments in bottle-to-bottle recycling technology for PET, as well as introducing “plantbottle”, a PET container made from sugar cane and sugar cane waste. Drinks in PET plastic account for about 60% of its global sales.  Scott Vitters, who leads Coke’s sustainable packaging efforts, told me by phone that PET bottles have one obvious advantage over cans: they are resealable and thus extremely convenient for on-the-go customers. “Glass, metal, fountain and PET all meet different consumers’ needs”, Vitters said. Of course, some aluminum bottles are resealable as well. Where does this leave Novelis with its big investments in recycling? John Gardner, the company’s chief sustainability officer, said by email: “We will shortly announce a second US craft beer customer. We are also in advanced talks with a major global brand”. As things currently stand, however, lots of aluminum cans – as much as $2bn worth a year – continue to wind up in landfills. That’s an obvious waste. It means that energy and carbon emissions are needlessly generated to make more cans out of primary aluminum. The problem is simple. The solution, not so much.

"Nearly a million potential jobs will be lost if EU leaders fail to agree strong climate and energy targets at a summit starting on Thursday, according to the head of Europe’s trade union movement. Europe’s heads of state are set to sign a deal which, the Guardian understands, proposes a binding 40% greenhouse gas cut by 2030 and two goals which will not be binding on member states, one for a share of 27% of energy coming from renewable sources and another for a 27% improvement in energy efficiency.  Disagreements with eastern European states on ‘burden sharing’ to meet the targets and energy security issues in the final package are said to be narrowing.  But Bernadette Ségol, the leader of the European Trade Union Confederation which represents around 60 million workers, warned that the proposed targets were too low to reap the benefits of a new clean energy economy. “Energy efficiency and renewable energy targets create jobs,” she told the Guardian. “The lower the target, the fewer the jobs that are created. Governments opposing ambitious and binding targets are wasting an opportunity to reduce Europe’s shameful levels of unemployment. Politicians risk throwing away up to 823,000 new jobs that could be created by more ambitious targets.” The 823,000 jobs number is the result of ETUC analysis, which confirms an EU study into the employment effect of a 40% greenhouse gas cut, coupled with a 30% renewable energy target and strong energy efficiency goal. Ségol called for a “just transition” to a low-carbon economy that treated workers and communities affected by energy intensive job losses fairly, while noting that climate change posed an “existential challenge to humanity.” “There are no jobs on a dead planet,” she said. Germany and Denmark favour most robust renewables and energy efficiency goals as do the European commission’s incoming president, Jean Claude-Juncker, as well as the outgoing climate and energy commissioners. ETUC would prefer a more robust binding target of 40% for energy efficiency improvements, as opposed to 27% and non-binding, and a binding target to improve renewables by 30%. But such aspirations have been opposed by the UK. With one eye on the rise of Ukip, David Cameron has let it be known that he prefers a single greenhouse gas target that would prevent Brussels from interfering with plans for the expansion of nuclear energy and shale gas. That position received backing today from Markus Beyrer, the head of BusinessEurope, the confederation of European employers’ organisations, which includes the UK’s Confederation of British Industry (CBI). “We think that a [single] 40% target for greenhouse gas emissions is very ambitious,” Beyrer told journalists at a press briefing in Brussels. “But the EU cannot afford to do it unilaterally. We see this as a negotiating position for the COP21 [UN climate] summit in Paris.  “We must not repeat the mistakes we made before Copenhagen [the UN climate summit in 2009] when we set a position in stone and then no-one followed us. There needs to be a review after COP21 and our position will have to be adapted to what the rest of the world does.” Reacting to divestment threats from home insulation companies such as Knauf and Kingspan, if the EU fails to agree a high and binding energy efficiency target, Beyrer said: “We are in favour of energy efficiency and coordinate with those companies, and they are on board with our position that we have to do a lot on efficiency, but we say that a binding target is not the best way to do this as it can be a heavy cost driver.” A spokesman for Knauf described Beyrer’s statement as “rubbish”. Barry Lynham, Knauf Insulation’s director for strategy said: “We absolutely do not share BusinessEurope’s view on this issue. Energy efficiency is the only thing that can drive down costs and ensure significant growth in the coming years. It’s time that BusinessEurope started supporting the businesses of tomorrow and not just the ones of yesterday.” Yesterday, several major business brands in the Prince of Wales Corporate Leaders Group – including Acciona, Coca-Cola and Philips – signed a letter to EU heads of state calling for three robust binding targets. The fossil fuel company Shell, which signed the letter, now has a more ambitious climate position on paper than a clutch of EU states, including the UK. "

"Only 128 of the 4,609 largest companies listed on the world’s stock exchanges disclose the most basic information on how they meet their responsibilities to society, according to a new report. The study by Canadian investment advisory firm Corporate Knights Capital says 97% of companies are failing to provide data on the full set of “first-generation” sustainability indicators - employee turnover, energy, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), injury rate, pay equity, waste and water.  While the number of companies disclosing individual metrics has risen in recent years, the study says it remains “disconcertingly low” and the improvement is starting to tail off. More than 60% of the world’s largest listed companies currently fail to disclose their GHGs, three quarters are not transparent about their water consumption and 88% do not divulge their employee turnover rate. The slowing down of disclosure is illustrated by the fact that while the number of large listed companies disclosing their energy use increased by 88% from 2008 to 2012, there was only a 5% rise from 2011 to 2012. A similar reporting slowdown is occurring on the other first-generation indicators. The reason these figures are so important is because there is a direct correlation between transparency and companies taking substantive action to improve their performance. Paul Druckman, who heads up the International Integrated Reporting Council, said: “We know that reporting influences behaviour, so corporate reporting reform should encourage behaviour that focuses on longer-term value creation in order to achieve financial stability and sustainability.” The report, which rates disclosure levels of companies listed on individual stock exchanges, puts Helsinki at the top of the league table, followed by Amsterdam’s Euronext and Johannesburg. London scores ninth with the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq were close to the bottom of the global rankings, in 34th and 39th place respectively. The worst performers were Saudi Arabia, Warsaw, Qatar, Kuwait and Lima, which came bottom in 46th place. The lack of transparency highlighted in the report prompted the CEO of multinational insurance group Aviva, who co-sponsored the report, to call on securities regulators to take urgent action. Mark Wilson said: “There is a clear need for a global mandate and a globally co-ordinated approach to corporate sustainability reporting, which is clearly understood and consistently applied. “A proliferation of national approaches, as well as overlapping and competing voluntary international standards and guidance, has led to difficulties in interpretation and implementation for companies operating in different countries and markets.” He called on the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the body that brings together the world’s securities regulators, to co-ordinate more effective reporting. IOSCO sets global disclosure standards and has focused in recent years on financial transparency. But over the coming months it will start looking at the responsibilities of companies around non-financial reporting. “IOSCO has intervened fruitfully in similar areas in the past,” Wilson said. “An IOSCO intervention on narrative reporting might therefore be the spur to a global solution to this challenge.” Beyond the action of regulators, the report by Corporate Knights Capital says there is an urgent need to minimise the time gap between companies’ financial and sustainability reporting cycles and calls on stock exchanges to link the pay of their senior executives to the sustainability disclosure practices of their listed companies. It also says it is vital that the world’s three major sustainability standard-setters – the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) - harmonise their competing reporting methodologies and guidelines. According to Druckman, while progress has been slow, the report does show there is cause for optimism, given progress being made particularly by stock exchanges in emerging markets. Companies trading in China, Colombia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Thailand and Turkey were found to be quickly closing the disclosure gap between themselves and listed companies trading in developed markets. Druckman also pointed to the birth of the concept of “stewardship” embedded in investor codes in countries such as South Africa, Malaysia, Japan, Australia and the Netherlands, and highlighted Brazil’s BM&F Bovespa which recently announced that it would be encouraging businesses listed on its platform to produce an integrated or sustainability report on a “report-or-explain” basis. Within the developed markets, the recent EU Parliament’s directive on non-financial and diversity information will almost certainly lead to an increase in reporting on the seven first-generation indicators. The EU estimates that only 10% of the 6,000 companies that are expected to be affected currently report information that will be required. “For capitalism to take a new direction, institutions, businesses and investors must think about value creation in a holistic sense when formulating strategy and allocating dwindling resources, particularly as they seek to build long-term value,” Druckman said. “The businesses leading the way are those that are anticipating and responding to the changing needs of their stakeholder community, society and the external environment.” The report points out that the paucity of corporate reporting on the first-generation indicators stands in stark contrast to investors’ growing interest in building sustainable investment strategies. Only recently a global investor coalition announced it is seeking to carbon footprint $500bn of institutional investments by next December’s UN Climate Summit in Paris. The report also warns companies of increasing risks if major businesses fail to become more transparent in their performance: “While companies can face barriers in setting up systems to measure and publicly disclose their performance on the seven first-generation indicators, the opportunity cost of opaqueness is rising.”  Read more stories like this: The finance hub is funded by EY.

"Climate change is making both droughts and flood more frequent and severe. Whether your area is suffering from too much water or too little, here are things you can do to adapt.  In the face of relentless droughts such as the historic one underway in California, we all want to help conserve. But with water utilities increasingly introducing tiered pricing – in which people who use more water pay an increasingly higher price for it – cutting back can reap monetary savings as well. Replace lawns with native plants Outdoor water use accounts for 30% of residential demand across the US, and 80% in the arid West, according to Mary Ann Dickinson, president of the Alliance for Water Efficiency. Nixing grass for drought-tolerant native plants can save as much as 10,000 gallons of water a year. Or reduce your lawn’s size and replace standard grass with low-water varieties that make do with two-thirds less water. Local native plant societies often know which plants made your lot home before you did. In the West, where most rain comes during the winter, plant natives in the fall. Natives also provide habitat for local butterflies and birds, and can be more resistant to wildfire than ornamentals. Cut the flush  Toilets use the most water of all indoor fixtures, nearly 30% of home water use, according to the EPA. Drop-A-Brick offers an easy way to cut back. The flattened brick is filled with a powder that turns solid when it gets wet, giving it the weight needed to sink. One $15 Drop-A-Brick in a toilet’s tank will displace almost half a gallon of water per flush, saving around $25 a year on water bills. Why use a manufactured, $15 brick instead of a Lifehacker-style solution like a milk jug filled with water? It “actually improves flushing performance in most [toilets] because it causes water to accelerate more quickly through the flush valve, according to engineers,” said Ali Hart, director of toilet relations for “Project: Drop-A-Brick.” No more flushing twice to clear low-flow toilets! “The real goal of this campaign,” she added, “is to raise awareness about urban water conservation.” Get savvy People tend to dramatically underestimate personal water use. One study found that Americans lowballed their water use by a factor of two. One reason is that we typically get one water bill every two months – a huge gap between use habits and measurement. Tech companies like WaterSmart and Dropcountr are trying to reverse this trend.  Dropcountr’s mobile app allows you to track how you use water, set conservation goals, access rebates for low-flow appliances and more. It also alerts you to usage trends that may land you in a higher-priced billing tier and adds a competitive factor by tracking how well you’re keeping up (or rather down) with the Joneses.  Use rain barrels and graywater systems  Plants don’t need drinking-quality water. Connecting rain barrels to downspouts is an inexpensive way to harvest rain to supply your garden. Such on-site water supplies increase your water security, independence, and efficiency. Overachieving water conservers have long put a bucket in the shower or kitchen sink to collect “greywater” for plants outside. But an installed system delivering greywater from, say, your washing machine in the garage into your garden would be much easier. Such systems have long been illegal in many jurisdictions, but that’s beginning to change thanks in part to groups like Greywater Action. Opt for dual plumbing Your toilet doesn’t require drinking water, either. A dual plumbing system allows you to reroute greywater or rainwater back into your house for flushing (or use utility-delivered treated wastewater in some districts). Pipes that route non-potable water are colored purple so that everyone knows not to connect them to sinks. A diverter valve allows people to choose potable water for some needs and alternative water for the rest. If you’re buying a new house in an area where purple pipes are now in the building code, such as San Francisco, you could be on the cutting-edge of water conservation. Otherwise, save this strategy for a major remodel. Worldwide, increasing development in floodplains is paving over soil that would otherwise soak up water. Coastal plain development is also booming, creating infrastructure that’s more vulnerable than ever as sea levels rise with climate change. A World Bank report last year found that flood damage to coastal cities worldwide could reach $1tn annually. To avoid paying your share of that, consider the following adaptations. Location, location, location This may be obvious, but think before you move. Whether buying or renting, consult flood maps to see if that lovely home is at high risk. If you simply must live near a coast or river, choose or build a home elevated to a height above your area’s predicted flood level rise. Raise the mechanicals and valuables Move vulnerable elements like furnaces, water heaters and electric panels to higher ground when building or remodeling. If you have a basement, don’t keep a giant plasma TV, gaming center or collection of antiquarian books down there. Relocate If flooded, put government emergency grants or insurance payouts toward moving to higher ground, not rebuilding. Some cities that flood regularly have used such funds to buy out willing homeowners and transform floodplains into open space. If your city doesn’t offer this option, introduce it at planning meetings. After Tulsa, Oklahoma, bought and removed more than 800 flood-damaged homes and vulnerable buildings and turned the floodplain into a park, flood insurance rates dropped 25%. Plan for soft failure If you’re already living in a flood zone, you can make your home resilient via renovations that minimize the effect of floodwater. Choose flood damage-resistant materials such as glazed brick, concrete, stone, steel or recycled plastic lumber. Anchor the foundation to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Create “flow-through” features on the lower levels to prevent water pressure damage. Use rain gardens and low-impact development Permeable surfaces are your friends. Rather than paving your driveway, choose materials such as pavers that allow water to seep through them into the ground, or gravel. Consider your lot’s slope. Water should flow away from your home, not toward it. Creating a rain garden will slow runoff and allow more absorption into the ground. Add slopes that funnel water into a bioswale (a fancy name for a ditch covered in stones or native grasses), toward planting spaces or a nearby creek, or even into an underground storage catchment that can hold water for drier times, or allow water to seep slowly into the aquifer. If you’re a city-dweller with pavement right up to your house, investigate a permit to dig up part of the sidewalk and plant a small garden that will convey water underground. Stay informed Apps are not just for the drought-afflicted. Using real-time data from the US Geological Survey and National Weather Service, FloodWatch gives both recent and historical river heights, precipitation totals, and flood stage data throughout the United States. The app allows you to monitor nearby rivers and streams and keep an eye on potential flooding issues, giving you time to move valuables to safety. For worldwide information check out the Flood App from Swiss Re, the leading global reinsurer. With a focus on climate change adaptation, the app offers reliable if general information on flood risks and how to manage and insure these risks. Get flood insurance Floods are the most common natural disaster. But flood losses are often not covered under standard renter or homeowner’s insurance policies. The good news is that often you can purchase flood-specific insurance. However, some firms are leaving flood-prone areas, reasoning it’s bad business to continue insuring such risky properties. If that’s the case where you live, consider it a sign that you should move. In the United States, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), administered by Fema, provides federally subsidized plans in locales that agree to implement its floodplain management ordinances.

"In his campaign to stamp out onshore wind power, communities and local government secretary Eric Pickles has just halted his 50th onshore wind project. Accused by Labour and Lib Dems of exceeding his powers, he overrides local planning systems and inspectors, pulling 85% of wind energy capacity out of the standard process for purely political purposes. Just as onshore wind becomes the cheapest renewable energy source, the Conservatives have committed to effectively abolishing it: their manifesto will pledge to remove subsidies, jeopardising future investment and rural jobs. Small local nimby groups find Pickles ever-eager to block windfarms in their back yards. That’s despite overwhelming public support, where poll after poll finds two thirds are in favour of onshore windfarms, including in their own districts, surprisingly resistant to the vigorous climate-change denial and anti-windfarm campaign by the Conservatives and their press.  You might think people living somewhere that has suffered extreme flooding, almost certainly climate-change related, would welcome wind turbines in their district. But no, not in the Somerset levels. Remember last winter, when reporters in waders filled the nightly news for weeks as the river Parrett burst its banks and flooded hundreds of homes. Prince Charles arrived in green wellies and pronounced it “a tragedy” that more had not been done. That brought David Cameron hurrying along in his wellies too, calling it a “biblical” flood. He promised that “everything than can be done will be done” – except, it seems, clean energy. Local Tory MP Ian Liddell-Grainger blamed Chris Smith, chair of the Environment Agency – conveniently a former Labour minister – calling him “a little git” and a “coward” and said that he’d “stick his head down the loo and flush”. That’s perhaps the sort of thing a public school, ex-army, great-great-great-grandson of Queen Victoria does: he’s chair of the Commons energy committee and an anti-wind campaigner too. In all of Somerset there is just one wind turbine, so you might think the proposal by Ecotricity to put up a modest four in the Parrett valley would have had a fair wind. It would power 6,769 homes. But no, it was opposed by a small local group – and Pickles “recovered” the application and turned it down. I went to look at the aptly named Black Ditch site, and this is no beauty spot: in fact it would be hard to find a duller patch of England. It sits beside the busy M5 motorway, by a demolished Royal Ordnance factory and a man-made river channel that used to service wartime munitions-making. This dreary strip of flat lands is crisscrossed in all directions by enormous pylons bestriding the countryside, carrying electricity from the nearby Hinkley Point nuclear power station across fields where shrink-wrapped black plastic hay bales litter the landscape. But pylons and plastic stir none of the deep politics of wind turbines which have become symbols in the warfare between climate preservers (left) and climate-change deniers (right). Beauty is in the eye of the beholder – so to the Ukip/Mail/Telegraph/Tory MP faction they are monstrosities. To many others, the sight of those great slow-turning white sails raises their spirits as a symbol of hope. But this is an unbridgeable divide, in politics and in aesthetics, the two closely allied. Not long ago Cameron was the man fixing a wind turbine to his roof, promising “the greenest government ever”. He knew then that wind power was popular – and it still is. So what’s changed? Two things: a hefty slice of his party has taken leave of its senses and is now speeding on high-octane ideology, regardless of all road signs pointing to public opinion, let alone national interest. Climate-change denial is a symptom of the frenzy – 101 Tory MPs signed up to it with Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, and Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary, stirring up windfarm aversion. But the great game-changer has been the arrival of Ukip, with its three main aims – out of Europe, end immigration and, oddly, a ban onshore turbines, which put the wind up Cameron. However, 40% of Ukip voters support onshore wind and I doubt many votes in the recent Clacton byelection were moved by turbine phobia. On the contrary, you would expect their voters to rally to the cause of home-grown energy, freeing us from dependency on risky foreign potentates or pesky French neighbours. Comres, polling for RenewableUK finds parties opposing onshore wind lose twice as many votes as they gain. In the 40 most marginal Labour and Conservative seats, opposing onshore wind loses four times votes as many as it gains, and more voters for all three main parties are turned off by anti-wind attitudes. Pickles’s blocking of windfarms in the last year has lost over £500m in income and 2,000 scarce rural jobs, killing off investment in an industry providing the cheapest renewables. The EU has just reported that onshore wind is cheaper than coal, gas and nuclear energy when the cost of pollution is factored in, especially the high cost of climate change. Both Tory and Lib Dems promised that nuclear would get no extra subsidy: but EDF building at Hinkley C has been guaranteed a 10% profit for 30 years – and no one adds in the vast insurance bill they would bear if the state didn’t underwrite nuclear disaster. This isn’t an argument against nuclear, which is needed in the mix, but a reminder of how cheap onshore wind has become – the price would fall ever faster if only Pickles were stopped. Once he called himself a champion of localism, but now he removes decisions from the local planning process, unless he agrees with them. When it comes to fracking – highly unpopular, especially in marginals – the government legislates to ride roughshod over huge local objections. Labour has been vociferous, and so has the wind industry, but they say it’s impossible to get this story into anywhere but the Guardian, the Financial Times and the Independent: the rest are climate-change deniers and onshore wind refusers. The Tory retreat from the cheapest clean energy is another sign of their retreat from reality, on climate change as on the EU. • This article was amended on 28 October 2014 to correct a reference to the blocking of windfarms resulting in the loss of more than £500bn in income. That figure has been corrected to £500m."
"A Danish bid to expand carbon offsetting to the transport sector has triggered uproar among NGOs and academics, with one new analysis saying it would devastate efforts to reign in fuel emissions. Transport is responsible for a quarter of Europe’s CO2 pollution and, unlike most sectors, its contribution is rising fast – up 36% since 1990. About half of Europe’s transport emissions come from cars and the EU has ordered car-makers to slash their fuel emissions by 2021.  But the latest draft of the EU’s 2030 climate and energy package, due to be agreed later this week, suggests counting transport emissions within the EU’s emissions trading system (ETS). The document, seen by the Guardian, calls for concrete proposals allowing states to achieve their climate goals with “a new flexibility”. “We want that flexibility,” said Martin Lidegaard, the foreign minister of Denmark, which has championed the proposal. “All countries of Europe could benefit from this flexible approach. That’s why we’re pressing for it as a solution.” Denmark is implementing some of Europe’s most ambitious greenhouse gas-cutting plans and aims to meet the EU’s likely 2030 goal of a 40% emissions cut by the end of this decade. But environmentalists say that Copenhagen has also fallen foul of EU obligations which measure emissions cuts in sectors outside the ETS, such as transport and agriculture. Greg Archer, the clean vehicles manager for the Transport and Environment thinktank told the Guardian that Denmark was now trying to bend the rules in a way that would hurt the rest of the continents carbon-cutting plans. “The effect of this proposal would be to undermine progress in improving the efficiency of vehicles and cutting transport emissions,” he said. “It would be more expensive for drivers, and it would mean that transport doesn’t have to substantially reduce its emissions, just buy allowances from other sectors as that will be the cheaper way of offsetting their emissions. The net effect would be to put back the point at which transport has to bring down its emissions and decarbonise.”  A new report by Cambridge Econometrics, which the Guardian has seen, backs these concerns, finding that it would take a carbon price of €271 between 2020-2030 to achieve the same fuel economy standards as with a legally-binding target like the 2021 one. The carbon price is currently around €6 a tonne.  Without the 2021 target for new cars, the ETS alone would deliver a mere 1% efficiency improvement by 2030, it says. “This would be insufficient for the road transport sector to contribute proportionately to the EU’s stated goals for decarbonisation,” it says. German car-makers such as BMW and Daimler, which lobbied hard against the 2021 target, have long preferred a looser regulatory framework, and a €6 per tonne price on emissions levied against fuel suppliers would offer that. At a panel meeting in Stuttgart last year, Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of Daimler reportedly described the development of CO2 fuel standards as “carpet trading” and suggested moving transport emissions into the ETS instead. Compared to fuel regulations, a BMW briefing paper describes emissions trading as “the more suitable instrument.” The document says: “Emissions trading enables economically efficient attainment of a given emissions budget,” specifying that any regulations should be aimed at upstream fuel refineries, rather than car manufacturers. “The beauty of the [emission trading] system is that it is cost-effective for society,” a car manufacturers’ representative told a recent EU stakeholders meeting. Lidegaard though insists that the counting of transport in the ETS is already permitted under current market rules, and need not give rise to complaints from the car industry that they are being ‘double-taxed’ for their emissions. “I don’t think we should give up binding targets for the car industry,” Lidegaard told the Guardian. “More flexibility in my book doesn’t amount to no efficiency targets for vehicles. This is a very important point. It doesn’t make sense to have country-based targets for the car industry. It only makes sense to have one binding EU-level target.” Archer though called the minister’s position “naive”. He said: “There is a reason why certain members of the German car industry are lobbying very hard for this proposal. It is because they see an opportunity to either stop, delay or weaken a future efficiency standards for vehicles.”  "
"Shareholders in BHP Billiton risk seeing the value of their investment destroyed by climate change, a former chairman of the Australian Coal Association will warn on Thursday. As Australia’s biggest mining company faces a slew of protests at its annual general meeting in London, Ian Dunlop will tell shareholders that the value of coal assets in particular could drop very quickly.   “The opportunity for value destruction is enormous,” Dunlop said before the meeting. “BHP are ahead of much of the industry but that is not saying much as the rest are all in denial. The phase out of coal will be much more rapid than they expect.”  Dunlop is seeking election to the BHP board. “BHP look at it as advanced, incremental change from business as usual, but they have to look at it as a paradigm shift.” Analysts at Carbon Tracker argue that international action to combat global warming will leave at least two-thirds of known coal, oil and gas unburnable and valueless. It was reported on Thursday that the amount of coal being burned by China – the world’s biggest user of coal – had fallen for the first time this century, according to a Greenpeace analysis of official statistics. BHP Billiton is recommending shareholders vote against Dunlop, stating he lacks the “overall skills and experience profile required”. Dunlop’s attempt to join the board in 2013 was opposed by 96% of shareholders. “We accept the IPCC assessment of climate change science, which has found that warming of the climate is unequivocal, the human influence is clear and physical impacts are unavoidable,” said the BHP spokesman, citing the company’s recent sustainability report.  “Energy coal makes up 25% of the energy mix and in many regions is the source of affordable energy that offers security of supply. This is likely to remain the case for some time.” Last week Australia’s prime minister, Tony Abbott, tried to bolster the case for coal, saying it was “good for humanity” and should not be “demonised”.  BHP’s AGM will also be targeted by the fast-growing campaign to persuade investors to dump fossil fuel stocks with protests expected on Thursday over the company’s $10m association with University College London (UCL) and the effects of its activities around the world. The fossil fuel divestment campaign began in the US, where cities, churches and universities have shed their stocks, and has spread rapidly to 50 universities in Britain, with Glasgow the first breakthrough. This week protesters have targeted UK banks, which have provided £66bn ($120bn) of funding for fossil fuel extraction. Protesters designated last Saturday as “national day of divestment” in an effort to persuade investors to drop fossil fuel stocks and also shares in banks that invest in such companies."
"The Arctic is warming at an alarming rate – and if anyone was in any doubt, there was a milestone event last month that attracted surprisingly little attention. For the first time, a cargo ship sailed without an icecutter escort through the treacherous waters of the Northwest Passage, from north-eastern Canada to Alaska. This was the route that Sir John Franklin’s expedition failed to navigate in 1845, when his ships became trapped in ice and the crew members perished.  So much ice is now melting that it is opening up a commercial shipping route from the Atlantic to Pacific that cuts out the Panama Canal, shaving thousands of miles off the journey, allowing heavier cargoes to be carried and slashing fuel costs. A series of bizarre events sounded another warning of the warming Arctic, when three giant holes opened up in the ground in northern Siberia this summer. The blame was put on melting permafrost, and the bottom of one crater was found to have unusually high levels of methane gas, suggesting that methane had been released from the thawing ground and blasted open the holes. Siberia has large deposits of methane gas trapped in the permafrost, but rising air temperatures have led to permafrost 20 metres deep warming by 2C over the past 20 years, allowing the methane to be released. And to illustrate the point further, record high temperatures in Siberia this summer led to states of emergency as forest fires raged in the dry heat."
"What would you do if your neighbour demolished your home, and then sold your land to the highest bidder? You would likely call the police, the property ombudsman, or whoever had the power to stop it. Unfortunately for those of us in the Pacific, the people with the power to stop this happening don’t see our rights as a priority.  We’ve spent the last 20 years arguing for international action on climate change with very little effect and now we’re down to our last line of defence. This is why we’ve been compelled to take action and block Australia’s largest coal port in Newcastle today. Some will call us eco-terrorists and claim that we are just here causing trouble, but wouldn’t you do the same if it was your country was under threat?  The Marshall Islands, where I was born and call home, is one of the most remote places in the world. We are a collection of 24 tiny atoll islands located halfway between Papua New Guinea and Hawaii. As island people, we’ve traditionally enjoyed a close relationship with the sea. But lately the sea has become a source of fear. We have suffered through droughts and continue to be threatened by sea level rise. Earlier this year over 1,000 people were forced to be evacuated after king tides rose across our homes. Just last week king tides hit the islands again, destroying homes, businesses and infrastructure across the country. Despite what some may say, it’s been scientifically proven that these extreme weather events are happening with increased frequency and severity because of climate change. Every few years scientists and world leaders come together to mourn what is happening on the islands and to discuss potential actions which may be taken to mitigate climate change, knowing full well that by the time these actions are taken it will already be too late to save our homes. In the most recent conference in New York, discussion moved beyond talk of salvaging our islands and our culture to the financial measures required to assist with relocation. The question is no longer if, but when. Yet we won’t give up our homes so easily. We have chosen to fight and not to drown. This is why I’ve chosen to come to Australia, along with several of my brothers and sisters from 11 other Pacific island nations, to confront the neighbour that is profiting from the destruction of our homes. We’re blockading the world’s largest coal port in Newcastle to show that elsewhere in the world, whole nations are paying the price for Australia’s coal and gas wealth. It’s common knowledge that the burning of fossil fuels is the greatest man-made contributor to climate change. Australia is the world’s second largest coal exporter, with plans to triple those exports in the coming years. It is also one of the world’s largest gas exporters, with plans underway to make Australia the largest exporter in the world. In defending these plans Tony Abbott said “coal is good for humanity”. I have to ask, are we not part of humanity? These plans do nothing to help the Pacific islands and yet we are the ones who will lose everything because of them. Blocking the Newcastle port may not, in the end, make even the slightest bit of difference to the mining companies of the world, but our aim is to send a message to the organisations that profit from the extraction of fossil fuels: they can no longer distance themselves from the impacts of their actions. We’re calling on the Australian public to come and join us in saying no to the building of new coal and gas infrastructure. We’re imploring you to stand with us, canoe against coal ship, and help us defend our homes against those who would seek to destroy it. Climate change is an issue which will eventually affect every individual on this planet and some day, you may need someone else’s help to defend your home too. "
"Like a sleepwalker roused from his dream, the world is slowly waking up to the full nightmare of the Ebola outbreak decimating west Africa. With small numbers of cases turning up in western countries, governments here are belatedly pledging action to fight the disease, which has already claimed almost 5,000 lives. Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – all countries struggling to recover from wars still fresh in the memory – have buckled under the onslaught of this horrific virus. Inadequate, creaking health services have been no match for a ruthless killer. But while the shocking poverty of these countries provides the fertile ground for the disease to spread, there are bigger issues at play that ought to cause us to think about the macroeconomic conditions that brought us to this point.  Ebola – like HIV, anthrax, Sars, avian flu and other pandemics of recent years – is a zoonotic virus, one that has crossed from animals to humans. It was first identified in 1976 during near-simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The strain of Ebola implicated in the current outbreak is thought to have originated from a mutant pathogen found in fruit bats. This is where we see a direct connection with economic development. The conflicts which have done so much damage to the affected countries have also attracted a range of activities – both legal and illicit – including logging and extractive industries like bauxite mining, which have deforested large swathes of the region. This massacre of the natural environment has reduced biodiversity and pushed the remaining fauna into closer contact with humans. So the fruit bats forced out of former rainforest are now seeking food from human settlements – and becoming food themselves, with the disastrous consequences we are now seeing. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is thought that Ebola is “introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals…” And we already know that the risk doesn’t only come from so-called “bushmeat” – intensive animal husbandry and battery farming can produce the same results, as we have seen with the avian and swine flus of recent years. These diseases not only kill people, they also devastate the productive bases of economies. The World Bank has already estimated that the economic cost of Ebola to the countries of west Africa could be as high as $32.6bn (£20.2bn) by the end of 2015. But for fragile economies already teetering on the brink, this represents an incalculable human catastrophe. We have to face up to the fact that as we are making increasing demands on habitats and exploiting animals more intensively for foodstuffs, the risk of zoonotic infections will increase. These outbreaks can become global pandemics very quickly, so there is a case for early intervention. In the case of Ebola, the international community failed to act quickly enough and we are now paying the price. The fact that the global north is only now responding in earnest serves only to highlight the general indifference with which it regards the spread of infectious diseases in Africa. In fact, however, we have a lot to learn from those countries – the DRC, Nigeria and Senegal – which have already succeeded in containing the virus, despite their limited healthcare and sanitary infrastructure. But now should also be a time for some soul-searching. If we choose to acknowledge it, we can discern that Ebola and diseases like it are the product of a global economic model that is destructive and exploitative to the point of creating serious risks to human health – from possible pandemics, but also the ongoing effects of man-made climate change. At University College London, our new Institute for Global Prosperity is taking a “whole university” approach to examining the world’s greatest challenges and thinking about ways we could do things differently. It’s about recognising the context of global interconnectivity and thinking hard about the impact on prosperity for all of us. For example, companies that are involved in natural resources extraction need to think about the long-term impact of activities like timber logging and mining because they cut down the buffer between humans and animals and thereby increase the chance of pathogenic mutation. So as well as direct harm to the natural environment, there’s a potential knock-on effect on human societies and economies. We need to think of alternative development paths and this means a reassessment of the notion of profit. Suppose our business models were not just calculated in monetary terms, or return to shareholders, but were based on what the business contributed to the creation of social value and the long-term sustainability of the environment, on which the future of both business and communities depend? There needs to be recognition of the consequences of not doing so, which are very deleterious not just for individual countries but potentially for others around the world. That doesn’t absolve governments of their responsibilities for setting the regulatory framework and enforcement regimes. But as the engine of the global economy, businesses have a vital role to play in creating social and environmental value.

"Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica, has urged the government to reconsider its support for offshore wind and other costly low-carbon technologies because it will raise the cost for energy consumers at a time of lower wholesale power prices. The energy boss and former government adviser also attacked ministers for allowing energy companies to propose coal-fired power stations for a new subsidy scheme when Britain was trying to cut carbon emissions.  Laidlaw said he did not know whether the recent collapse in oil and gas prices would last long, but pointed out that the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has revised down its own estimate of electricity prices over the rest of this decade by up to 20%. “Energy consumers will be puzzled to learn that they are unlikely to enjoy the benefit of those lower power prices. That’s because of the choices made by successive UK governments about which renewable and low-carbon technologies to prioritise and how to incentivise them.” He argued that householders effectively will pay £140 per MW hour by 2018 to pay for offshore wind when the expected wholesale price for power is now expected to be a little more than £50. “By the end of this decade, under current plans, we’ll be spending £7.6bn a year through the levy control [subsidy] framework, much of it to support wind turbines that have not come down in cost,” the Centrica boss told an FT gas conference in London on the same day German utility RWE blamed timing problems for scrapping plans to develop the huge Galloper windfarm off East Anglia. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, has already stopped building new offshore windfarms. The questioning of offshore wind costs follows the Conservative party pledge to end future onshore wind subsidies. However, both have been championed by Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat DECC secretary of state. Davey believes the subsidies offer a vital hedge against rising power prices long into the next decade but that coal, gas and nuclear all need to be incentivised to keep the lights on in the meantime. Laidlaw, a former member of the prime minister’s Business Advisory Group, said it was “paradoxical” to give subsidies to carbon-intensive coal plants on one hand and operate a carbon price floor designed to drive out this kind of fossil fuel. The so-called Capacity Mechanism auction planned for December was aimed at providing back-up generation for intermittent renewable sources such as wind, said the Centrica boss. “The expectation was that this would incentivise the building of new gas-fired power stations. But look through the pre-qualification lists published a few weeks ago and it is clear that old, dirty coal stations will be paid extra to stay online for longer. “The cost of this will be levied on customers’ bills, alongside the cost of the carbon price floor, which is designed to encourage switching away from coal. There’s an inherent paradox here.” The DECC denied being contradictory. “There is no paradox. The carbon price floor and the capacity market [subsidy scheme] work together to ensure we move to low-carbon generation in a way that keeps the lights on at peak demand at lowest cost to the consumer. “The carbon price floor [CPF] is designed to provide greater support and certainty to the price of carbon in the UK’s electricity generation market. Effective carbon pricing, including the CPF, remains an important part of the government’s energy policy. Establishing a minimum carbon price sends a credible signal to help drive billions of pounds of investment in low-carbon technology.” The concerns about coal-fired power stations were seized upon by Greenpeace which estimated that coal plant operators could receive up to £2.2bn in the Capacity Market auction scheduled for December. The environmental group described Laidlaw’s analysis as a “naked-emperor moment” for government coal policy. Lawrence Carter, a Greenpeace energy campaigner, added: “The most influential energy boss in the country is now confirming what Greenpeace and others have been warning all along. A big chunk of these new energy handouts will be pocketed by coal plant operators and used to extend the lifespan of some of Europe’s most polluting power stations.” Laidlaw, who retires from the company at the end of the year, also called on government to be more honest with the public about the challenges as the UK tried to maintain energy capacity while also trying to fight climate change. “So how do we get to a sustainable energy policy? Above all we must be straight with the public and honest about the costs. There is no magic bullet.”"

"The green billionaire Tom Steyer this week solidified his status as the leading patron of environmental causes in American politics, with the announcement that he had given nearly $56m to make climate change a top-tier issue in the midterm elections. With just days to go until the elections, it was revealed that Steyer had poured an additional $15m of his personal fortune into his NextGen Climate Action Fund, raising his contributions to $55.9m, according to Federal Election Commission filings on Monday night.   The former hedge fund executive has now emerged as the biggest single donor of this election cycle – at least as far as publicly disclosed donations are concerned – and a favorite new punching bag for Republican opponents, a role previously reserved for Al Gore. The ready cash could make Steyer the kingmaker of these elections – if his bets on candidates in seven key Senate and gubernatorial races come in. It has already re-cast climate change as an election issue both now and in the 2016 presidential contest, argued Chris Lehane, a Democratic operative who is now NextGen’s chief strategist. “We call 2014 a pivotal year for climate,” he said. “If you look around it’s clear that climate has emerged as a top -tier issue.” Steyer is still nowhere near reaching the $100m he promised to inject into races in this election cycle, half of it from outside donors. But he has already assembled a campaign organisation that includes some of the country’s top operatives – and gained near-heroic status among environmental activists for his free-spending ways. And he is apparently enough of a threat to Republicans to merit his own attack website, which labels Steyer a “man of too many contradictions” and comes adorned with a photo of a champagne-swilling Leonardo DiCaprio. Steyer has also been accused of worsening the influence of money over politics – a Democratic equivalent of the conservative oil billionaire Koch brothers. And there have been reports he is using NextGen as a dry run for his own future political campaign, perhaps for senator or governor of California. As Steyer himself has admitted, “climate change has not always been on my radar”. After a privileged upbringing on New York’s Upper East Side, Steyer spent 25 years building his own hedge fund, Farallon Capital Management, and amassing a personal fortune estimated at $2.6bn. Much of that wealth came from investments in coal and other fossil fuels, the New York Times reported.   But in 2010 he bankrolled a campaign to defeat a ballot initiative in California that would have blocked the state’s ambitious programme to cut carbon dioxide emissions. In 2012, he sold his ownership stake in Farallon in order to campaign full-time on climate change, and instructed his employees to screen out holdings of tar sands, coal, oil and gas. When Steyer jumped into the 2014 race, he was immediately adopted as something of a saviour by Democrats and environmental groups. Gore called him “Mr Tipping Point” in the fight against climate change. With two weeks to go, that remains to be seen. The $56m in Next Gen contributions – though record-breaking – are only for disclosed funds, a pivotal distinction in an election which is believed to be awash in so-called “dark money”, or anonymous donations. The Koch brothers’ network of groups is believed to be spending up to $300m this election cycle, $125m or more of which could be coming through their main political organisation, Americans for Prosperity. Steyer’s contributions have been focused on a handful of tight races for senate and governor where the extra cash could help tip the balance towards Democratic candidates. Those seven races include senate contests in Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire and Michigan and gubernatorial elections in Florida, Pennsylvania and Maine. (In Maine, Steyer is backing an Independent party candidate.) The strategy is broadly similar. NextGen Climate – as well as other environmental groups such as League of Conservation Voters and the Natural Resources Defence Council Action Fund – has run ads ridiculing Republican candidates for denying climate science and accusing them of cozying up to oil and coal companies.  In Florida, NextGen spent $8.6m on 20 offices and hundreds of staffers and volunteers to try to defeat the Republican governor, Rick Scott. The group also began hauling around a wooden ark festooned with blue life buoys – accusing Scott of only making room for wealthy donors, while leaving ordinary Floridians at the mercy of rising seas. In Michigan, NextGen has spent $3m on TV, radio, and digital ads attacking the Republican candidate for the Senate, Terri Lynn Land, for being too close to the Kochs. Steyer visited Iowa earlier this month, where NextGen is backing Bruce Braley, the Democratic candidate for the Senate. With two weeks to go, candidates backed by Steyer are ahead or holding their own in New Hampshire and Michigan and all three of the gubernatorial races. Outside those key races, however, it’s uncertain whether Steyer has got Americans to focus on climate change. Although the number of Americans who agree human-caused climate change is occurring is on the rise, according to polls, the environment is still crowded out as an election issue, generally ranking towards the bottom of voters’ concerns. Lehane, while presenting internal polling data showing strong concern for climate in Steyer’s seven targeted states, acknowledged that the issue is important in trying to define what he called the “Republican troglodyte narrative”. “Climate really for the first time in a long time is being used as an offensive issue – a wedge issue and an offensive issue – for Democrats,” he said. Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, said the true test of Steyer’s political acumen would be whether he could help Democrats retain control of the Senate. That’s a high bar, Sabato admitted.  “If the Democrats shock us and say hold on to the Senate 50-50, I am sure he will have contributed to Democratic victories in some of those states,” he said. At the very least, Sabato said Steyer would deserve some credit for elevating the climate issue this time around, and preparing the ground for future races. “It’s moved some voted. It’s created voter education,” he said. “It’s a slow educational process and its not like its his last dollar.”"
"In Christopher Nolan’s new movie, humanity’s hope for survival is pinned on one man: Matthew McConaughey, pilot of a last-ditch mission to find humans a new home as Earth becomes uninhabitable. And in turn, Interstellar, which opens worldwide on 7 November, heads towards cinemas heavy with expectations. In a year strikingly light on both critical and commercial hits, it’s down to this three-hour Imax epic to save cinema as the clock ticks on the last quarter. Nolan has millions of devoted fans from his Batman trilogy, plus the rare clout to get studio backing for adult blockbusters which don’t feature superheroes. Early screenings have attracted very warm reviews, Oscar buzz and comparisons to Kubrick’s 2001, whose extended deep space sequences Nolan appears to ape.  Yet at a press conference in London on Wednesday, Nolan said his key inspiration was films such as Close Encounters of a Third Kind, which sought to speculate about a moment when humans would need to reassess their place in the cosmos. Interstellar does so from a post-climate change perspective. It shows a world decimated by a man-made agricultural blight that forces other options to be scoped out. Rather than being a call to arms to preserve the planet, it fast-forwards to a time when any such battle has been lost. “It has as a jumping-off point not that we’re meant to save the earth, we’re meant to leave it,” said Nolan. “Obviously, if that’s taken literally it would not be particularly positive. The film feeds off certain concerns that are very valid in the world today. But really it’s about saying what is mankind’s place in the universe? I think it’s very exciting to deal with that dramatically and I think it’s important we have to deal with that out of necessity. In real life, it would be far better if we dealt with that issue out of choice.” McConaughey’s character is mentored by a man played by Michael Caine and loosely based on the astrophysicist Kip Thorne. Thorne’s work both inspired and informed the film, but Caine, 81, said that until he spoke with the scientist, the only wormholes he’d been familiar with were those in his garden. Caine, who has now worked with Nolan six times, said his own re-evaluation of the reality of climate change coincided with his making the film. “When I went to do this movie in LA two years ago I left on 2 October. It was 86 degrees here and when I got to Los Angeles it was pouring with rain. That is the exact opposite of what it’s supposed to be. That worried me. I’d never believed in global warming and I went: ‘Whoops. Maybe there is something in it.’” Asked if he was taking measures to try reduce his own ecological footprint, Caine jokingly protested that he was still making up for a frugal youth. “I was so poor for so long. I didn’t use anything or eat very much so I figured the world owed me a debt. Now I’ve been eating very well and have had a big car for a long time.” His fellow cast-members banged the ecological drum a little harder, with vegan Jessica Chastain championing “meat-free Mondays” and Anne Hathaway saying she timed her showers and tried to support small, ethical businesses. Nolan, meanwhile, expressed enthusiasm for pooling resources, “gathering people in one place, like a movie theatre – you can save an enormous amount of electricity”. Interstellar suggests the survival of the species may depend on enough people extending a sense of empathy beyond their immediate family. It acts as a tribute to those adventurers of the past who were able to sideline short-termism in the service of exploration. But the cast agreed what would be needed to prevent such action from becoming necessary in the first place was a rapid and concerted effort. “I think mother nature’s gonna be just fine,” said McConaughey. “But we might not. The masses have to have a personal stake in things to take action.” Hathaway pointed to societal structures as a cause of such inertia. “I don’t think we’ve learned how to broach with the topic with your average person that your life is being controlled by a small group of people who are themselves controlled by greed.” Both actors, as well as Chastain and Nolan, reported that they nonetheless remained optimistic, and had faith in the sentiment of the film’s tagline: “The end of Earth will not be the end of us.” Caine, however, remained sceptical. “If Earth screws up, I think we all go,” he said. “How many people can go through a black hole in a rocket? It’s not a bus.” • Review: A night out with Michael Caine"
"The 2014 Sustainia Awards, chaired by Arnold Schwarzenegger, attracted more than 900 submissions for projects and technologies representing 10 different sectors from food, fashion and, city development to transportation and healthcare. Collectively, these projects are deployed in more than 84 countries.  The runners up for the award are showcased here and the winner will be announced in Copenhagen on Thursday 30 October. The ceremony will celebrate these innovations ahead of the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) anticipated report on climate change, due to be finalised 31 October.  Netafim is behind a low-tech irrigation system for smallholder farmers in developing countries which increases and secures yields while saving water and cutting costs. It drips precise quantities of water and nutrients right at the root zone of crops while an elevated tank distributes the water using gravity.  This minimises the need for electricity and investments in infrastructure. The UN estimates that 500 million smallholder farmers provide over 80% of the food consumed in the developing world. Irrigation systems are vital to sustain agriculture as it addresses water scarcity and soil erosion. The solution is commercially viable with a payback-time of about a year, making it fit for microfinance projects.  As a mode of transport, the bicycle is one of the lowest emitter of greenhouse gases - even with the CO2 emissions of the food you need to power a bike. This helps explain why bike-sharing systems are being adopted increasingly by cities. The Spotcycle app from 8D technologies aims to make bike-sharing more convenient and smartphone-friendly. The app locates nearby bike stations and communicates availability, maps out bike paths and helps with navigation. The app is already in sync with cities in North America, Australia and Europe. Air conditioners use about 5% of all electricity produced in the US. As a result, 100m tons of carbon dioxide are released each year. Advantix’s air conditioning system uses saltwater which means it needs 40% less energy than normal systems. Whereas air-conditioning systems normally chill the air to remove humidity and then reheat it in a highly energy-intensive process, Advantix’s air-conditioners funnel the air through non-toxic fluid saltwater instead. The process dehumidifies the air without the need for re-heating.  Clothes are often discarded after the first or second life cycle, and apparel accounts for up to 10% of a western consumer’s environmental impacts. Through an advanced take-back system, I:CO works to keep apparel, footwear and other textiles in a continuous closed-loop cycle. Used shoes and clothing are collected in stores and retail outlets, where customers are financially rewarded for depositing their used items. Once collected, the textiles are sorted according to more than 350 criteria for designation. Used clothes can be labeled suitable for: second-hand sale, recycling into fibres and paddings for new products, or upcycling. Through development, design and production, social enterprise Fairphone works to create positive social impact in the consumer electronics supply chain - from responsible mining, decent wages and working conditions to reuse and recycling. Fairphone began by redesigning the processes behind the production, making phones that use conflict- free minerals and are assembled in a factory with a worker-controlled welfare fund. To date, Fairphone has sold nearly 50,000 phones from its first two production runs. Preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth claim 800 lives daily and 99% of cases happen in developing countries. We Care Solar has created a sustainable solution. The Solar Suitcase provides solar electricity for medical lighting, mobile communication and essential medical devices for rural areas and humanitarian settings. This enables safe and timely obstetric care, which ultimately improves maternal and neonatal outcomes. Additionally, the innovation allows emergency surgeries to be conducted around-the-clock in rural hospitals. The Solar Suitcase has been introduced to more than 600 healthcare facilities in 20 countries.  In Lagos, Nigeria, Wecyclers is fuelling social and environmental change by enabling people in low-income communities to make money from unmanaged waste piling up in their streets.  It is a response to the local waste crisis; the municipal government collects only 40% of city garbage. The Wecyclers initiative has deployed a fleet of cargo bicycles to pick-up, collect and recycle garbage in low-income neighbourhoods. Families are encouraged to recycle their bottles, cans and plastics through an SMS-based programme. For every kilogram of material recycled, the family receives Wecyclers points on their cell phone. Families can then redeem points for goods such as cell phone minutes, basic food items or household goods. The initiative adds to the local economy by hiring personnel locally.  With its novel technology that converts greenhouse gases into plastic material, AirCarbon has disrupted the market by replacing oil-based plastics with a sustainable product that is competitive in both price and performance. It is made from a process where carbon in the air is captured and used in manufacturing. AirCarbon uses pollutants as resources to make products otherwise made from oil. Products made from AirCarbon are carbon-negative even after calculating the emissions from the energy used in production. AirCarbon is currently used to make chairs, bags and cell phone cases.  More than one million Bangladeshis could be displaced by rising sea levels by 2050. One consequence is that children cannot attend school for long periods of time, making it harder for them to escape poverty. By building a fleet of solar-powered school boats, the Bangladeshi initiative Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha has secured year-round education in flood-prone regions of Bangladesh. Each floating school boat collects students from different riverside villages, ultimately docking at the last destination where on-board classes begin. Solar lighting makes the schedule flexible, which provides for additional educational programs in the evening. Shidhulai’s floating schools model has been replicated in Nigeria, Cambodia, Philippines, Vietnam and Zambia.  Through use of big data, Opower has given energy utilities a new way of engaging with customers in order to improve energy efficiency. The software solution combines cloud technology, big data and behavioural science to produce data analyses and personalised information on how to save energy. To motivate reductions in energy consumption, utilities use Opower to share money-saving insights with custumers. Opower can also show households their energy usage compared to neighbours; an effective method in motivating people to save energy. Opower has enabled savings of over 4TWh of energy, which is equivalent to $458m (£283.1) in bill savings.

"When the call came in that the University of Glasgow had voted to divest its £128m endowment from fossil fuel companies, I happened to be in a room filled with climate activists in Oxford. They immediately broke into cheers. There were lots of hugs and a few tears. This was big – the first university in Europe to make such a move. The next day there were more celebrations in climate circles: Lego announced it would not be renewing a relationship with Shell Oil, a longtime co-branding deal that saw toddlers filling up their plastic vehicles at toy Shell petrol stations. “Shell is polluting our kids’ imaginations,” a Greenpeace video that went viral declared, attracting more than 6m views. Pressure is building, meanwhile, on the Tate to sever the museum’s longtime relationship with BP.  What is happening? Are fossil fuel companies – long toxic to our natural environment – becoming toxic in the public relations environment as well? It seems so. Galvanised by the “carbon tracker” research showing that these firms have several times more carbon in their reserves than our atmosphere can safely absorb, Oxford city council has voted to divest; so has the British Medical Association. Internationally, there are hundreds of active fossil fuel divestment campaigns on university and college campuses, as well as ones targeting local city governments, non-profit foundations and religious organisations. And the victories keep getting bigger. In May, for instance, California’s Stanford University announced it would divest its $18.7bn endowment from coal. And on the eve of September’s UN climate summit in New York, a portion of the Rockefeller family – a name synonymous with oil – announced that it would be divesting its foundation’s holdings from fossil fuels and expanding its investments in renewable energy. Some are sceptical. They point out that none of this will hurt oil or coal companies – different investors will snap up their stocks and most of us will keep buying their products. Our economies, after all, remain hooked on fossil fuels, and affordable renewable options are too often out of reach. So are these battles over fossil fuel investments and sponsorships just a charade? A way to clean our consciences but not the atmosphere? The criticism overlooks the deeper power and potential of these campaigns. At their core, all are taking aim at the moral legitimacy of fossil fuel companies and the profits that flow from them. This movement is saying that it is unethical to be associated with an industry whose business model is based on knowingly destabilising the planet’s life support systems. Every time a new institution or brand decides to cut its ties, every time the divestment argument is publicly made, it reinforces the idea that fossil fuel profits are illegitimate – that “these are now rogue industries”, in the words of author Bill McKibben. And it is this illegitimacy that has the potential to break the stalemate in meaningful climate action. Because if those profits are illegitimate, and this industry is rogue, it brings us a step closer to the principle that has been sorely missing from the collective climate response so far: the polluter pays. Take the Rockefellers. When Valerie Rockefeller Wayne explained her decision to divest, she said that it was precisely because her family’s wealth was made through oil that they were “under greater moral obligation” to use that wealth to stop climate change. That, in a nutshell, is the rationale behind polluter pays. It holds that when commercial activity creates hefty public health and environmental damage, the polluters must shoulder a significant share of the costs of repair. But it can’t stop with individuals and foundations, nor can the principle be enforced voluntarily. As I explore in my book This Changes Everything, fossil fuel-based companies have been pledging for more than a decade to use their profits to transition us away from dirty energy. BP has rebranded itself as “Beyond Petroleum” – only to back off renewables and double down on the dirtiest fossil fuels. Richard Branson pledged to spend $3bn of Virgin’s profits finding a miracle green fuel and fighting global warming – only to systematically lower expectations while sharply increasing his fleet of aeroplanes. Clearly, polluters aren’t going to pay for this transition unless they are forced to do so by law. Up until the early 1980s, that was still a guiding principle of environmental law-making in North America. And the principle hasn’t totally disappeared – it’s the reason why Exxon and BP were forced to pick up large portions of the bills after the Valdez and Deepwater Horizon disasters. But since the era of market fundamentalism took hold in the 1990s, direct regulations and penalties on polluters have been superseded by the drive to create complex market mechanisms and voluntary initiatives designed to minimise the impact of environmental action on corporations. When it comes to climate change, the result of these so-called win-win solutions has been a double loss: greenhouse emissions are up and support for many forms of climate action is down, in large part because policies are perceived – quite rightly – as passing costs on to already overburdened consumers while letting big corporate polluters off the hook. It is this culture of lopsided sacrifice that has to stop – and the Rockefellers, oddly, are showing the way. Large parts of the Standard Oil trust, the empire John D Rockefeller co-founded in 1870, evolved into Exxon Mobil. In 2008 and 2012, Exxon earned about $45bn in profits, which remains the highest yearly profit ever reported in the US by a single company. Other Standard Oil spin-offs include Chevron and Amoco, which would later merge with BP. The astronomical profits these companies and their cohorts continue to earn from digging up and burning fossil fuels cannot continue to haemorrhage into private coffers. They must, instead, be harnessed to help roll out the clean technologies and infrastructure that will allow us to move beyond these dangerous energy sources, as well as to help us adapt to the heavy weather we have already locked in. A minimal carbon tax whose price tag can be passed on to consumers is no substitute for a real polluter-pays framework – not after decades of inaction has made the problem immeasurably worse (inaction secured, in part, by a climate denial movement funded by some of these same corporations). And that’s where these seemingly symbolic victories come in, from Glasgow to Lego. The profits of the fossil fuel sector, made by knowingly treating our atmosphere like a sewage dump, should not just be seen as toxic – something from which publicly minded institutions will naturally distance themselves. If we accept that those profits are morally illegitimate, they should also be seen as odious – something to which the public itself can make a claim, in order to clean up the mess these companies have left, and continue to leave, behind. When that happens, the pervasive sense of hopelessness in the face of a crisis as vast and costly as climate change will finally begin to lift."

"The theme of the first World Cities Day is ‘leading urban transformations’. It is particularly apt for the inhabitants of the Brazilian slum city of Vila Brasilândia, who have shown resilience and ingenuity in the face of urbanisation, resource scarcity and climate change. In many countries, including my native Brazil, urbanisation has been accompanied by growing numbers of urban poor converging in overcrowded slums that offer few basic services. Around 12 million Brazilians live in slums (favelas) and one of the largest is Vila Brasilândia on the edge of Brazil’s largest city, São Paulo. The growth of Vila Brasilândia, fed by a constant influx of rural and coastal migrants, has been putting overwhelming pressure on the over-stretched infrastructure, and on the local environment. The local population has been under pressure to find ways to reconcile deficient housing and the sustainable use of scarce natural resources. Bordering one of the remaining green belts of São Paulo, it has been encroaching into the urban forest of Cantareira for decades. In response, Brasilândia recently launched a city-wide campaign called The Forest Invades the City, designed to redirect the trend of predatory human occupation by planting native trees, installing green roofs, and growing edible plants in abandoned public squares. The sense of urgency has been heightened by this year’s drought – the worst in 80 years - which has left São Paulo reservoirs nearly dry and the Cantareira water system operating at 3% of its capacity. In the long term, climate change could exacerbate São Paulo’s drought problem. Quinitino Jose Viama, a local elder who for decades has been conserving Brasilândia wells and streams, believes the work they do is a basis for conservation but also the prelude of an urban revolution. “We are asking every woman, child and man to keep the seeds of the fruits we eat to support the creation of thousands of seedlings necessary for this forest occupation,” he says. Somehow Brasilândia is challenging the notion that only after achieving a certain level of prosperity can one enjoy a quality of life. Its annual sustainable health fair, based on the South American concept of Bem Viver (the right to a good life) has proven hugely popular, attracting around 3000 people at each event. Bem Viver is not about the individual; it reflects the rights we enjoy as a community, living and sharing life together. Since 2009, eight community gardens have been created and over 160 community health agents tour around the community on a regular basis, promoting local produce and giving demonstrations on how to cook nutritious and unusual meals, using a wide range of vegetables, seeds, flowers, grains, weeds and fruit. This is just one of many innovative projects taking root around the world as part of the transition movement. “Brasilândia has established an institute for the acceleration of our social enterprises,” says Mônica Picavea from Transition Brasilândia, part of the transition towns movement which aims to help community projects build more resilient towns. “We are taking a different route from the traditional concepts of growth and progress. In our strategy, community and environment drive the economy, not the other way round.” The institute began by developing a deeper understanding of their economy and mapping the existing business, working with dozens of artisan businesses led by community members – bakers, shoemakers, electricians and seamstresses – to create livelihoods and help drive Brasilândia’s growing local economy. The process of urbanisation has multiplied the capacity of the people of Brasilândia to find their own solutions. By unleashing their creativity, they are blurring the distinction between urban forest and city, water authorities and conservationists, health system and community gardens, local development and social enterprise. And for all their evident problems, they are living the good life.

"The amount of coal being burned by China has fallen for the first time this century, according to an analysis of official statistics. China’s booming coal in the last decade has been the major contributor to the fast-rising carbon emissions that drive climate change, making the first fall a significant moment. The amount of coal burned in the first three-quarters of 2014 was 1-2% lower than a year earlier, according to Greenpeace energy analysts in China. The drop contrasts sharply with the 5-10% annual growth rates seen since the early years of the century.  “The significance is that if the coal consumption growth we have seen in China in the last 10 years went on, we would lose any hope of bringing climate change under control,” said Lauri Myllyvirta at Greenpeace East Asia. “The turnaround now gives a window of opportunity.” Such a turnaround would potentially have a large impact on the biggest coal exporting countries such as Indonesia and Australia, which have profited from China’s demand for the fuel.  At the UN climate change summit in New York in September, China said it would start to reduce the nation’s huge carbon emissions “as early as possible”. Myllyvirta warned that year-to-year fluctuations in energy use and industrial prediction could see coal burning grow again in future. “It may not be the peak yet, but it is a sign that China is moving away from coal.” Climate scientists say that global carbon emissions need to peak by 2020 and rapidly decline to avoid dangerous climate change. Myllyvirta said the greatest significance of the current drop in coal use was that economic growth had continued at 7.4% at the same time, although that is a lower rate than in recent years. “The Chinese economy is divorcing coal,” he said. By contrast, the tripling of the Chinese economy since 2002 was accompanied by a doubling of coal use. Official Chinese data has been unreliable in the past but Myllyvirta said cross-checking the current data for industrial production with energy consumption showed a consistent picture.  Coal consumption for electricity is coming down, there is very slow growth of steel and cement and a drop in both coal imports and domestic coal production, he said. “We are seeing so many different data showing a consistent pattern that we have much more confidence this is really happening.” The cause of the reduced coal-burning was reduced demand, with China’s statistical agency noting that economic growth was increasingly coming from the service sector instead of heavy industry, as well as new renewable energy such as hydropower and wind power.  On Wednesday, the consultancy Make said 2014 would be a record year for wind in China with 20.4GW of new installations. A further factor was action to cut the severe air pollution affecting many Chinese cities and which recently led to many of the 30,000 runners in the Beijing marathon wearing face masks. After China, the US is the world’s biggest carbon polluter. But President Barack Obama’s efforts to fight climate change were dealt a blow on Tuesday when the US Energy Information Administration’s Monthly Energy Review revealed that US energy-related carbon pollution rose 2.5% in 2013.  The rise was one of the steepest on record in the last 25 years and resulted in part from the freezing Arctic temperatures of 2103’s polar vortex increasing the energy used to heat homes. The data also showed a 4.8% increase in the use of energy from coal and a 10% fall in energy from natural gas."
" The UN’s climate chief urged country negotiators on Monday to “build bridges” at talks in Bonn towards a new, global pact that received fresh endorsement from world leaders last month. The six-day forum in Germany must lay the foundations for the annual round of ministerial-level UN talks to be held in Lima [Peru] in December, Christiana Figueres told delegates as the meeting opened.  Lima, in turn, must pave the way to a historic pact in Paris in December 2015 that will for the first time apply to 195 nations, rich and poor alike. Figueres said a September climate summit called by UN chief Ban Ki-moon had “shifted the ground on what is possible in climate change”. “Collectively, your heads of state have reassured the world that we will address climate change,” she said via webcast. “Today, dear delegates, the world’s eyes turn to you. It is up to you to chart the path of that solution.” Negotiators face a tough task ironing out long-standing differences over how to share responsibility for curbing Earth-warming greenhouse gas emissions. These cuts seek to limit global warming to 2C over pre-Industrial Revolution levels, and save the planet from potentially catastrophic climate damage. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that on current trends, the planet could be up to 4.8C warmer by 2100 and sea levels up to 82 centimetres (32 inches) higher. Conflict, hunger, floods and homelessness would be the likely result, it warns. Figueres stressed the new climate pact, due to enter into force in 2020, “must irreversibly bend the curb of emissions”, which have continued rising. But many technicalities have to be resolved, including the legal nature of the pact and how it will be monitored and enforced.  The talks in Germany will be the first chance for negotiators to discuss a rough 22-page outline for the deal that has been drawn up by working group leaders and distributed for scrutiny in July.  The meeting must also start narrowing down what data countries must provide when they submit their pledges for emissions curbs in the first quarter of next year. This topic will likely see negotiators return to a sore point – whether rich countries should have tougher targets because of their longer history of burning fossil fuels.  Developed nations reject the notion, and point the finger in turn at fast-growing emerging giants like China and India. Attending the Bonn talks, environment minister Manuel Pulgar-Vidal of Peru, host of the December talks, said there were only 13 months to the deadline for signing a new, global pact.  “Lima must be successful if we want to pave the road to Paris,” he said, and urged negotiators to “work constructively this week to prepare the substantive outcomes we expect from Lima.”"
