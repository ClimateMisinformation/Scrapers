"Worldwide CO2 emissions from commercial flights are rising up to 70% faster than predicted by the UN, according to an analysis. Carbon dioxide emitted by airlines increased by 32% from 2013 to 2018, according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation.  The US-based ICCT, which exposed the Volkswagen dieselgate scandal, estimated global air travel for passengers and freight emitted 918m tonnes of CO2 last year. Researchers said the rate of growth far exceeded that used to develop projections for CO2 emissions by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization. The ICCT report says: “The implied annual compound growth rate of emissions, 5.7%, is 70% higher than those used to develop ICAO’s projections that CO2 emissions from international aviation will triple under business as usual by 2050.” The total increase over the past five years was equivalent to building about 50 coal-fired power plants, the ICCT calculated. The study shows the UK is responsible for 4% of global aviation CO2 emissions, behind only the US (24%) and China (13%). Domestic flights in the US and China account for a quarter of all aviation emissions. The US, China and EU account for 55% of all emissions. Airlines in the 36-member countries of the ICAO have signed up to a carbon reduction scheme known as Corsia and will start recording their emissions this year. The scheme is framed to allow aviation to continue to grow but reduce its net footprint by purchasing carbon emission offsets – or funding a carbon dioxide saving elsewhere. Although aviation accounts for just over 2% of all global emissions, that proportion is expected to expand significantly as other sectors such as energy make more rapid progress to decarbonise. A forecast released by Airbus on Wednesday said the number of commercial aircraft in operation would double to 48,000 planes worldwide by 2038. It predicted urbanisation and an emerging middle class would fuel rapid growth, particularly in the Asia-Pacific. The growth in total emissions comes in spite of more fuel-efficient planes, as passenger numbers have grown. Emissions per passenger kilometre have been reduced by more than 50% since 1990. According to the airline trade body Iata, carriers have improved fuel efficiency by more than 2% per year over the past decade. An Iata spokesman said: “It is true that because of demand from people in developing economies to enjoy the same benefits of flying as those in rich countries, aviation emissions growth is currently faster than our efficiency gains. “That is why from 2020 all growth in international aviation CO2 will be offset, reducing carbon by millions of tonnes a year. And by 2050 we aim to cut total emissions to half the 2005 level, using a combination of sustainable fuels and radical new technologies.” The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, called on the UK aviation industry to take the lead in introducing electric flight. In a speech at Cranfield University in Bedford on Thursday, he said: “We need to get to grips with commercial aviation greenhouse gas emissions for the sake of our children and our fragile environment.” He said aviation “supercharges our economy, drives prosperity, jobs and tourism and helps promote Britain’s interests globally … But with aviation set to grow significantly over the next three decades, largely driven by rising demand from emerging markets, particularly Asia, the Middle East and India, I want to pave the way for the transition towards commercial use of cleaner electric planes.”"
"A majority of the public recognise the climate crisis as an “emergency” and say politicians are failing to tackle the problem, backing the interests of big oil over the wellbeing of ordinary people, according to an eight-country poll. The survey, which comes before what is expected to be the world’s biggest climate demonstrations on Friday, found that climate breakdown is viewed as the most important issue facing the world, ahead of migration, terrorism and the global economy, in seven out of the eight countries surveyed. In the US it comes third behind terrorism and affordable healthcare. Nick Lowles, from UK-based anti-racism group Hope not Hate, which commissioned the survey, said the findings showed that the public were “way ahead” of politicians in recognising the scale of the climate crisis. “They understand the scale of the problem and want governments to take the strong and decisive action that this emergency requires.” Hundreds of newsrooms around the world are banding together this week to commit their pages and air time to what may be the most consequential story of our time. As world leaders descend on New York for the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September  – and millions of activists prepare for a global climate strike on 20 September – the media partnership Covering Climate Now is launching its first large-scale collaboration to increase climate coverage in the global media and focus public attention on this emergency. The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, which was founded earlier this year by the Columbia Journalism Review  and the Nation. The partnership currently includes 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people. The network represents every corner of the media including TV networks (CBS News, Al Jazeera), newspapers (El País, the Toronto Star), digital players (BuzzFeed, HuffPost, Vox), wire services (Getty Images, Bloomberg), magazines (Nature, Science), and dozens of podcasts, local publishers, radio and TV stations. You can learn more about the initiative here. He said the crisis would have a huge impact on racism, division and conflict in future years unless it was tackled now. “As an organisation dedicated to bringing communities together and challenging the politics of division, we believe that our leaders must take swift action on climate change so that environmental pressures do not become a source of hostility, anger and competition in our societies.” The poll surveyed more than 1,000 people in the UK, Canada, Germany, Italy, Brazil, France, Poland and the US. It found that at least three-quarters of the public think the world is facing a “climate emergency”, with climate breakdown at risk of becoming “extremely dangerous”. The overwhelming majority in each country – 74% in Britain – said they were already seeing the influence of the climate crisis in extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, and around two-thirds describe it as a direct threat to ordinary people in their country. The poll reveals widespread alarm that the crisis is on the brink of spinning out of control, with 64% in the UK agreeing with the statement “time is running out to save the planet” – the figure was 70% in Germany, 74% in Brazil and 57% in the US. It also found that few people believe their governments are doing enough – only 23% in the UK, 20% in Germany, 23% in Brazil and 26% in the US agree that ministers are taking sufficient action. The results will put pressure on world leaders gathering for the climate action summit in New York next week. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for heads of government to bring plans – not words – to address the climate emergency ahead of a 2020 deadline for countries to raise their national targets under the Paris agreement. The treaty signed in 2015 obliged governments to keep temperatures well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C The poll found that most people called for radical measures to cut emissions – including building more wind turbines and solar panels, providing more charging points for electric cars, and investing to create jobs in clean industries. They also wanted governments to be tougher on big polluters and to force them to pay for the damage they caused, although the public are sceptical this would happen, with at least two-thirds suggesting politicians put the interests of big oil and gas corporations before those of local communities. The poll also found support for tougher measures to cut emissions, including a halt to coal mining and an end to oil and gas drilling, as well as increased taxes on frequent fliers. The findings come just a day before millions of people are expected to take to the streets for the global climate strike. Walkouts and demonstrations are expected in cities on every continent except Antarctica and adults, businesses and trade unions have been urged to join. Laurence Tubiana, the CEO of the European Climate Foundation, said the findings in the poll underlined the growing support for immediate radical action. “This poll reconfirms what the growing numbers of people striking for climate action are saying: We’re worried, we know we can do more, leaders, we need you to step up and unite behind the science.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week, I think it was, I remember reading something about Al Gore’s The Climate Project having slumped to an all-time low with the number of Climate Crisis presentations delivered.
The French sceptic climate website Changement Climatique has compiled a graphic showing the number of presentations given each month. I’ve posted it below.
Using complex Mannian statistical techniques, I’ve fitted a curve (red line) to the chart (sorry, code is not available). Conclusion: Al Gore’s TCP is headed for a crisis. He really needs to dramatically cut back his hot air emissions.

Probably the only 2 things performing worse are the all-but-defunct Chicago Climate Exchange and Obama’s Economy.
Changement Climatique describes Gore’s project situation as follows:
 The number of presentations reached a peak of 193 in October 2009, just before Copenhagen, but then went on an “unprecedented” and “irreversible” decline to a total collapse in the last few months.  At the moment, not a single presentation is scheduled for 2011, which bodes ill for future of the project. It’s a sure sign that “climatic fatigue” has struck the warmist movement.
Quelle misere.

Hachijojima is a volcanic Japanese island some 287 kilometers south of Tokyo, to which it belongs. 7,522 people live on its 63 km2 of area.

Image cropped from Google Maps.
What makes Hachijojima interesting climatically is its rural, non-urban features – in the middle of the ocean –  making station siting there less prone to factors that could corrupt the data, such as airports, asphalt, concrete, steel and other heat-sink-acting infrastructure.
Today we look at data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) going back almost 80 years. Hearing all the claims about a rapidly warming world from the media, many readers would think that there must be warming happening there as well. The data have a surprise in store.
Summer
Now that summer has ended, we plot the latest data to see if summers have indeed been warming at this island.

Data source: JMA
As the above data show, there has been virtually no trend at all over the past 80 years. Warming? Still no sign of it at all.

Winter
Next we look at the mean winter temperatures at this location since 1947:

Data source: JMA
Like summer, also winter has shown no long-term trend one way or the other. Where’s the bad climate change news here?
Annual
To round out the analysis and to summarize, we plot the annual mean temperature data recorded for Hachjojima:

Data source: JMA
Interestingly, the annual temperature behavior appears to follow a cyclic behavior that very much resemble some ocean surface temperature cycles we see from around the globe, like the PDO or AMO. Climate indeed changes, but what we see above it cannot be due to anything anthropogenic.

"About a fifth of the fresh food the UK imports comes from areas threatened with climate chaos, putting people’s health and diets at risk, MPs have found. The environmental audit committee called on ministers to set out a clear plan for how the UK’s food supplies could be protected from the climate emergency and to publish information on how food may be affected by Brexit.  Currently, 40% of the UK’s food is imported, according to the report published on Tuesday. In the very near future, people would be at risk from sudden lurches in food prices if a no-deal Brexit resulted in trouble with imports, including higher costs, delays and shortages. Mary Creagh, the chair of the committee, said: “We are facing a food security crisis, exacerbated by uncertainty over the UK’s future trading position with the EU and the rest of the world. Ministers must now publish all the information they hold from Operation Yellowhammer on food security and likely costs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.” Beyond the immediate effects of Brexit, the climate emergency and changing trade relationships may put the British diet in jeopardy. The MPs called for a national food council that would cover food production, nutrition and public health issues, and for stringent annual targets to reduce the UK’s high levels of food waste. Water consumption across the UK should be set at 100 litres (22 gallons) per person per day, the MPs found. This would require changes to water availability and potentially to metering. Sustainable cities should also be made more resilient to the effects of the climate crisis, and town planners should be more involved in improving the design of cities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for instance through more efficient transport networks. The MPs also called for Public Health England to take on responsibility for adapting to the effects of the climate emergency – particularly through examining any measures needed to counter the spread, made easier by global heating, of emerging diseases such as Lyme disease, the incidence of which is rising. Already, “unprecedented” damage has been done to natural systems around the world, from water and clean air to a stable climate and flourishing nature, the MPs said. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has unveiled plans for a new Treasury study on the economics of biodiversity, to be led by Sir Partha Dasgupta and Sir David Attenborough. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We recognise the threat climate change poses to many facets of our national life, including our food production and supply, which is why the UK is the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions by 2050. “We already have a highly resilient food supply chain in the UK, and our national food strategy review is considering how we can further address the challenges of a changing climate and continue to deliver safe, healthy, affordable food now and for generations to come.” Vicki Hird, a farming campaigner at the Sustain civil society organisation, said: “The MPs are spot on with this report, given the climate emergency and size of the challenge. “For far too long we’ve left our vital food supply to be dominated by complex global supply chains and the junk food industry. We now have a highly vulnerable, unsustainable and inefficient food system that needs to be repaired using all the tools available. A [government] champion putting this all together coherently would be handy.” She called for the government’s agriculture bill and environment bill to be brought back before parliament as a matter of urgency. “[We need] good farmers to be paid to produce more diverse and better food and to reduce reliance on vulnerable overseas suppliers,” Hird said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen the temperature sinks far below normal and people freeze to death, you hardly hear a peep from the media anymore.But as soon as the temperature rises a few degrees over normal for a day or more, the media explodes with headlines of “HEAT WAVE!” and “SCORCHING HEAT!”.
Thanks to the internet and a few media outlets, few and far in between, the inconvenient news of a devastating, protracted cold snap gripping much of south America is coming out. Read news24.com/World/News.
Here are some grisly statistics:
1. 175 dead in 6 countries
2. 112 people had died of hypothermia and flu in Peru.
3. 16 people froze to death and 11 died of carbon monoxide poisoning due to faulty heaters.
4. Thousands of cattle also froze to death on their pastures in Paraguay and Brazil.
5. In Bolivia, 18 people died, in Paraguay five and two each in Chile and Uruguay. Nine people died of the cold in southern Brazil.
How cold is it? Take a look at this post I put up three days ago. return-to-1970s-cold/, showing the 7 day outlook.
You’d think when they’re not too busy covering Zsa Zsa Gabor, the media would cover this.
In Germany, it seems the major news magazines are finding space and time to report the cold – along with the reports of the warm weather we’re having here, which will end in about 36 hours.
But Germany’s ARD Teklevsion has NOTHING. Same goes for ZDF television. Hmmm.
I couldn’t find much at the major US news services either. CBS – nothing. At CNN there’s a report that’s a day old with 17 deaths. Nothing at the right wing Fox either. Maybe others are better at finding big news.

"In the past three weeks, we took the pulse of citizens in eight countries in the Americas and western Europe whose governments will prove critically important to global efforts to tackle the climate emergency. Our findings were unambiguous – tackling climate breakdown was deemed the most important priority for government, ahead of terrorism, the economy and migration. In all the countries except the US, the majority of those surveyed said that the climate emergency was the number one issue, and that governments had to do more.  Ahead of the global day of strikes tomorrow and the UN climate summit on Monday, Hope Not Hate is calling on governments worldwide to take urgent action on the climate emergency – otherwise we risk not just extreme weather but extreme politics. Although we think about climate breakdown as an environmental issue, for many people around the world its consequences will be felt as primarily social and political. If governments don’t take urgent action to tackle the climate emergency, rising sea levels, desertification and increasingly frequent extreme weather events will have potentially devastating effects on both the world’s poorest people and its wealthy nations. Globally, millions of people face a bleak future: being displaced from their homes and losing their livelihoods. It’s unimaginable that in such circumstances, resourceful, determined and sometimes desperate people won’t try to find better, safer places to work and raise their families. Climate breakdown will create volatile social situations. Large numbers of people could be forced to move within their countries and across borders – both near and far. Extreme environmental events and rapid change could also destabilise economies, leading to unemployment, pressure on resources, spiralling living costs and political and social unrest. Hope not Hate’s work in communities across the country over 15 years has taught us that this type of scenario threatens peaceful coexistence, and opens the door to those who seek to capitalise on the politics of hate. Societies faced with economic insecurity, real or perceived competition for resources, pressured public services and rapid social and cultural change can quickly grow disaffected if faced with unresponsive politicians and no hope of change. In these situations, diversity can become division, a situation that provides fertile ground for those who wish to break apart shared identities and common cause, and create a “them and us” mentality. Our investigations have found that these groups are already exploiting the issue – with climate denial and climate conspiracies finding a welcome home in the ideology of both the populist right and the far right. It’s paradoxical that the very people who would seek to capitalise on the social dislocation caused by the climate crisis are one of the biggest groups driving climate scepticism in Europe. It’s for this reason that we believe citizens and governments should be taking radical action against the climate emergency. The war-driven migrant crisis in 2015 showed how quickly and powerfully anti-immigrant feeling can distort and destabilise politics as we know it, surging far beyond any initial racial, religious and cultural friction. Keeping our societies united and tolerant in the face of the pressures created by the climate crisis is an integral part of the global fight for climate justice, but governments, policymakers and NGOs are not yet ready for this challenge. We must plan ahead so we can resist and repel any backlash to people fleeing the consequences of the climate crisis, and build coalitions between the environmental and social justice movements. Unless we take action now on climate breakdown, and begin preparing for its political consequences, I fear we could be heading for serious trouble. • Nick Lowles is chief executive of Hope Not Hate, the UK’s largest anti-racism and anti-extremism movement"
"Former vice-president Joe Biden and the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, will miss an MSNBC forum on the climate crisis to be held in Washington later this week. The livestreamed event at Georgetown University, which will include hourlong interviews with presidential contenders on Thursday and Friday, is aimed at students and timed to align with global climate strikes inspired by young people. The California senator Kamala Harris, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar will also miss the event. The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders will be interviewed on Thursday. One Republican challenger to Donald Trump, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, will also appear. Organizers said most candidates who declined cited scheduling conflicts in the early voting state of Iowa, including for an LGBTQ forum in Cedar Rapids on Friday. Warren had prior commitments for that forum and a town hall, a spokeswoman said, adding that the senator plans to talk about the climate crisis at an Iowa campaign stop. None of the other campaigns responded to requests for comment. The MSNBC event is the second climate-focused discussion with presidential candidates this month, following a seven-hour CNN town hall. It will not be aired on the network in full, a factor which may have contributed to candidates declining. One person familiar with the MSNBC event said it seemed candidates felt they had “checked the box on climate” by appearing at the CNN event. The Democratic National Committee has refused to allow an official climate crisis debate. The debate in Houston last week included just one question on climate. Stephen O’Hanlon, a spokesman for the Sunrise Movement, said the youth-led activist group understands why some candidates could not attend the MSNBC event. “The CNN Climate Crisis Town Hall forced all the candidates to put forward serious plans to tackle the climate crisis and answer questions from voters on them,” O’Hanlon said. “That was historic.” But Sierra Club’s national policy director, Ariel Hayes, said: “If tackling the climate crisis is truly the priority for these candidates that it needs to be, they should be taking advantage of this opportunity to share their vision with the world.” Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, will appear on MSNBC and in Iowa. He will be interviewed at the climate forum on Friday morning before appearing at the LGBTQ forum that evening. Democrats running for president have laid out multifaceted plans for slashing the 15% of heat-trapping pollution the US contributes to the atmosphere, as scientists warn time is running short and Trump guts efforts to help. Miro Korenha, a co-founder of the newsletter Our Daily Planet and a planner of the MSNBC event, said she was disappointed candidates would miss an opportunity to talk with students. Polls show young Americans are more engaged on global warming than older adults. The MSNBC anchors Chris Hayes and Ali Velshi will question the candidates on how they would act to drastically reduce emissions from cars, power plants, industry and agriculture. Korenha said the CNN town hall was criticized for focusing on narrow questions about how candidates would change how Americans live, “from plastics … to cheeseburgers”. “We really hope to bring a lot of substance to this,” she said."
"The Coalition’s “big stick” energy legislation to break up power companies is a “backdoor to privatisation” of electricity assets in states that have kept them in public hands, Mark Butler has warned. On Sunday Labor’s shadow climate change spokesman gave a clear signal it will continue to oppose the legislation in an interview renewing his calls for an “unsparing” election review and refusing to recommit to a 45% emissions reduction target by 2030.  On Saturday the Australian Financial Review reported the Morrison government is set to reintroduce legislation to give the treasurer power to compel companies to supply electricity on certain terms and for courts to force energy companies engaging in anti-competitive conduct to sell off assets. The bill was shelved before the election due to lack of Senate support and the risk of amendments hostile to coal, but Labor’s leader Anthony Albanese has so far refused to state a position on the bill after the surprise May election defeat. Butler told ABC’s Insiders that Labor would look to see if any changes had been made to the legislation but noted that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission had “explicitly rejected” the idea, suggesting it is not in consumers’ interests. “The Energy Users Association representing the biggest users of electricity in this country also said they were concerned this bill would simply smash investor confidence and force power prices up,” he said. “There’s also the added concern that we pointed to that this appears to be a backdoor to privatising electricity assets in Queensland and [Western Australia] and Tasmania where their communities have time and time again rejected the idea that their publicly owned assets should be put in private hands. “We have some very serious concerns about this.” Butler responded to a report that Labor may have to ditch its interim target of 45% emissions reduction by 2030 by noting that “all our policies are up for review” since the election defeat. Butler said setting medium-term targets is still best practice but noted the 45% target was set in 2015, suggesting he could not put a precise number or year on a new target. “What our position will be at 2022 at the election, obviously I’m not in a position to announce four months out from the last election.” He said Labor wanted to keep global warming below 1.5C and is committed to “net zero emissions by the middle of the century and medium-term targets consistent with those principles informed by the best scientific and economic advice”. Butler criticised the Coalition for the drought minister David Littleproud denying knowledge of a link between climate change and bushfires – a position he later retracted – and Australia’s record of steadily rising emissions. He said Scott Morrison would not attend the UN climate summit because Australia’s 26% emissions reduction target is “unanimously regarded as grossly inadequate, [and is] consistent instead with more like 3C or 3.5C of global warming which would be utterly catastrophic”. Australia is set to miss the “inadequate” 2030 target “by a mile”, Butler said. Asked about ALP president Wayne Swan’s view that Labor should stick to its tax-and-spend agenda to fix inequality, Butler replied that Swan was “very experienced” and entitled to put the view but even he “accepts … that this was a very deep election loss”. Butler said Labor needed “some deep reflection and that includes over our taxation policies, the spending commitments they were intended to fund, climate and energy and every other policy area” because it lost its third election in a row, with the lowest primary vote in 100 years to an outfit “Morrison himself described as the Muppet Show”. Butler also rejected allegations of racism in Labor questioning the government about Liberal MP Gladys Liu’s links to Chinese-government associations, noting it is pursuing the same questions as the national media. He attacked the Coalition’s record, including former attorney general George Brandis’s declaration people have “the right to be a bigot” in the context of attempting to water down race hate speech laws, and Morrison’s decision to label Sam Dastyari “Shanghai Sam” when he was embroiled in a donations scandal."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe consensus was that global erosion of mountains and the Earth’s surface had been accelerating over the last 5 million years. Well, guess what? This once long accepted hypothesis has just been smashed by researchers at the GeoForschungsZentrum in Potsdam Germany. They present their results in the May 13 issue of Nature.  GFZ Potsdam (click English top right). They write:
The globally observed four-fold acceleration of sedimentation is an artifact of the observations. Important geological hypotheses that are based on this observation now require revision.
Artifact of observation? Gee, where can one see that today? Hansen, are you reading?
Erosion of rocks and the Earth’s surface over the last 5 million years could be found as sediment. Measurements of the sediment layers suggested that erosion had increased over the last 5 million years. The question was why? What caused the acceleration?
Hypotheses for the cause included the increased global growth of mountains by movement of tectonic plates which resulted in accelerated erosion, or the onset of the ice ages 3 million years ago – which accelerated erosion. But neither of these hypotheses was satisfactory. Another wrench in the the machine was CO2 –  it just didn’t pan out.
GFZ-scientists Jane Willenbring and Friedhelm von Blanckenburg appear to have solved the riddle.
They found that the increase in sedimentation rates is a so-called “artifact” of the observations: the more detail geologists observe, the more sediment they discover. In younger geologic time the observations get better than those made on sediment millions of years in age. This is so because not all sediment, once deposited, survives the passage of geologic time. The increase in sedimentation therefore is not real – it merely mirrors the better preservation of younger sediment.
Read the GFZ Potsdam report to see how they used isotope Beryllium-10 to solve the riddle.
Of course other scientists could claim that the consensus supports the old view, and that the GFZ researchers are just a couple of fringe scientists that can’t be taken seriously.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEIKE has a piece today called Super Expensive Energy. It perhaps could serve as a reminder for President Obama, who thinks passing cap & trade and stopping reliance on fossil fuels will somehow plug the hole. My feeling is that Obama is using the oil disaster as a political instrument to drive through a dangerous cap & trade law.
Cap & trade means subsidising industries. Governments can do this as long as they can afford it. But that’s rarely the case. Most often they cannot. Europe is a prime example for Obama to look at.
Take a look at socialist Spain, for example. Driven by a green ideology, and all the promises it brings, Spain went ahead and subsidised wind and solar energy with unbridled abandon, thinking it could create thousands of new green jobs and usher in the next economic wonder.
Well, it has. But not the kind of wonder a sane person welcomes. Today Spain is bankrupt and unemployment is at (twenty) 20%. Spain has since been forced to drastically cut its subsidies, and the solar bubble has popped. Spain is now begging other countries for a bailout.
Even in a country that has abundant sunshine, like Spain, solar energy still cannot compete on the free market without generous subsidies. Consumers prefer reliable and inexpensive energy.
You’d think that with solar energy being completely uncompetitive in a country where sunshine is plentiful, leaders in other countries with gray, rainy climates would avoid such a source of energy. Not Germany. Even with its gray dismal climate, leaders went full throttle ahead in subsidising solar panels and energy. They simply forced the power companies to buy up green power from people who have solar panels on their roofs at exorbitant prices.

The power companies of course simply pass the higher costs on to the consumers. Industry is among the consumers of power. Companies that have energy-intensive processes are moving operations, and the jobs that go with them, out to countries that have much lower pollution standards.
Cooking your own goose
State-guaranteed price for solar power in Germany is far above the actual sales price to the market. Such a method was used in former communist East Germany (the country that built a wall to keep its people from running away). For example, a person there could sell a goose they had raised in his backyard to the local markets at the state-guaranteed price of 30 East German Marks. A few hours later the same seller could go back to the market and buy the same goose for only 15 Marks, slaughtered and ready to cook. Today it’s the same with green power producers. They sell their power for 43 cents/kwh, and then buy it back for 22 cents. Does that make sense?
Only if you want to send the economy to hell in a handbasket, and quickly.
In Germany green laws have been passed that will cost hundreds of billions of euros over the next 15 years, all based on the bogus claim they protect the climate. According to EIKE:
These billions burden the economy in 2 ways: 1) They lead to higher electricity rates for producers, meaning their products become more expensive, and 2) lead higher energy bills for consumers, and thus less buying power. Eventually this will choke the German economy and its growth, which eventually will hit already strapped governments fiscally. Absolute foolery.

"It has been a painted lady summer. Nearly half a million of the migratory creatures were counted in British parks and gardens as part of the biggest butterfly survey in the world. The painted lady topped the charts of the annual Big Butterfly Count with 420,841 recorded during high summer after their first big influx on British shores in a decade.  This year too there were greater numbers of common species than last year – 1.1 million of the most common five species combined were seen, compared with 660,000 in 2018.  There were big increases for peacocks (207,814), gatekeepers (161,987) and red admirals (91,146), while the number of marbled whites increased by 264% as global heating helped the butterfly move north through Britain. The count also revealed that global heating could be the cause of the mysterious decline of the once ubiquitous small tortoiseshell butterfly, whose numbers have fallen by 78% since the 1970s. Last summer was the worst for the species since the count began but this year it bounced back: 70,000 were spotted, up 167% and bringing its highest number for five years. Richard Fox, of Butterfly Conservation, which organised the survey, said the small tortoiseshell showed up well in Scotland and Northern Ireland, where it was the second most seen species, but struggled to make the top 10 in England and Wales. On average, count participants in Scotland and Northern Ireland saw more than twice as many small tortoiseshells as people in England. “We’re still trying to establish what is behind the long-term decline of the small tortoiseshell and while it is good news that the butterfly fared better this summer, the poor results in southern England in particular suggest that climate change may be having more of an impact on this species than we have previously realised,” Fox said. A record 113,500 people took part in this year’s count, spotting nearly 1.6m butterflies during the three-week recording period from the end of July. Numbers of common white species and blue butterflies slumped compared with last summer. The large white, small white, and green-veined white, fell by a combined 42%, the common blue was down 59% and the holly blue fell 54%.  1. Painted lady (420,841)2. Peacock (207,814)3.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier this year in spring, the WMO and others warned of another record hot summer and drought. The German media went bonkers in response warning that 2020 could even be hotter and drier than the 2018 and 2019 summers.
But now that the meteorological summer (June 1 – August 31) has ended, the data show that these earlier predictions were WRONG.
Germany’s DWD national weather service, having tabulated data from some 2000 stations nationwide, has issued its preliminary report for the summer of 2020. The results: a near normal summer.
Only 1°C warmer than normal
According to the DWD,  the summer of 2020 was often variable, seeing only short periods of heat and that it was not until August that the midsummer “turned up the heat” for a spell of about 10 days.
With a mean of 18.2 °C, the summer of 2020 across Germany was was 1.1 C above the mean of the 1981 to 2010 period. In July, many locations did not see the thermometer reach even 30°C.
Only in August did a heat wave lasting several days see temperatures over 35°C.

Overall near normal rainfall
With an average of around 230 liters per square meter (l/m²) of precipitation nationwide, summer 2020 fell only slightly short of its long term mean of 239 l/m², the DWD reports. Thus the projection of a continued extreme drought such as seen in 2018 and 2019 failed to appear.
Some regions, such as the Uckermark, the Leipzig lowland bay, Saarland and along the Rhine, saw less than half of the typical rainfall. At the same time, there were continuous rainfalls, such as in early August in Upper Bavaria with up to 150 l/m² in 24 hours, which also brought flooding. In total, over 700 l/m² were measured in the Alps over the summer.
10% more sunshine (hence a bit warmer)
At around 675 hours, the sunshine duration in summer exceeded its long-term mean of 614 hours by around 10 percent. The coastal regions recorded over 700 hours of sunshine. In the western low mountain ranges, however, the DWD measured only 500 hours.
“Summer 2020 was completely normal”
Die kalte Sonne here summarizes Germany’s summer of 2020: “Summer 2020 was completely normal in terms of precipitation, including regional differences. One could have wished for an abnormally humid one after the dry years 2018 and 2019, but weather is not about wishful thinking. When it comes to precipitation (which is first and foremost decisive for drought), there has been no remarkable trend. Everything else you hear is not based on facts.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterI know the other uptown climate sceptic blogs don’t want to get anywhere near this red-hot potato of a topic, as the details are explosive, too sketchy and the sources are to some extent dubious. Caution has to be exercised  in drawing conclusions. It’s far too early for that.
But where there’s smoke, there’s fire.  I committed myself to keep people posted on the story. I’m not just going to sit here and “suck it up”. My hunch tells me it’s going to boil over. I may be wrong, but two more big puffs of smoke have just billowed up.
The National Enquirer, yes, a yellow journal, has reported that two more lady masseurs have come forward, claiming Al Gore behaved very inappropriately, read NY Post report.
In the first case that came to light late June, masseur Molly Hagerty said in a 2009 police report that she felt Gore had done this many times before, meaning other women had probably endured the same. If Hagerty was just a fraud, then no other women would come forward.
Now 2 more women are reported coming forward and claiming abuse by Gore.
One incident took place at a Beverly Hills luxury hotel when Gore attended the Oscars in 2007. The second allegedly occurred a year later at a Tokyo hotel. This would confirm Hagerty’s suspicions.
I read the entire police report made by Hagerty, and it seemed to me implausible that someone would make up such an elaborate story.

And although tabloids like the National Enquirer are known for untrustworthy stories, would they go after someone like Gore without having real substance? You can screw up a story on a Hollywood diva, but wouldn’t you make damn sure you have your facts straight if you go after the former VP of the United States, Nobel Peace Prize,  Oscar winner, a figure with that kind of influential muscle?
The New York Post writes:
The probe threatens to engulf Gore deeper into a sex scandal once thought unthinkable for the Nobel prize winner who built up an image as a doting husband and family man who fell in love with his wife at the high school prom and lived happily ever after.
Another reason I think the story has substance is because of what Gore has said and done in the past. AIT was carefully crafted to deceive, and so it says a lot. His words say a lot. This is not a man playing with a full deck, in my view.
Who really betrayed the country?
Eventually these things have a way of getting out of control. Global warming is already having enough trouble surviving Climate-gate. This Gore story could put the whole damn thing away for good.
Will more women step forward?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe array of strategies the green-outside, red-brown-inside activists keep plotting never ceases to amaze me.
The latest comments come from Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer in an interview with George Stephanopoulus, and provide a window to another page of the enviro-Mein-Kampf playbook.
In the interview, Stephanopoulos asks Breyer, on burning the Koran, if the First Amendment ought to be rethought: Breyer replies:
Holmes said it doesn’t mean you can shout ‘fire’ in a crowded theater. Well, what is it?  Why?  Because people will be trampled to death.  And what is the crowded theater today?  What is the being trampled to death? It will be answered over time in a series of cases which force people to think carefully.  That’s the virtue of cases.
So if Breyer had his way, the government would decide what a crowded theater is, and what gets trampled. Folks that would be a dangerous threat to free speech.

Keep in mind that the Supreme Court has already declared CO2 a pollutant that needs to be regulated. And now at least one Justice wants to declare certain types of speech as “pollutants”, and subject them  to regulation.
So what’s the next step? Skeptics is a crowded theater?
Next they’ll be calling the planet a “crowded theater”and its inhabitants “the trampled”, and that certain kinds of speech lead to trampling in the crowded theater, earth.  For example,  those of us who express skepticism, or produce inappropriate science, could be deemed making speech that leads to death in the crowded theater earth.
Without our speech, the planet could be saved, after all.
Sound crazy?
Well, we’ve already been called “deniers”, the scourge of the planet, even bastards that ought to face Nuremberg-type trials for climate crimes. Be warned.

"On one level it appeared just another week in Australian climate politics. A ridiculous statement by a government minister made headlines; the crossbench pushed for stronger action; the prime minister’s office quietly suggested he may not fulfil the next step of the Paris agreement, a deal he has repeatedly promised voters he would honour. Meanwhile, much of the media coverage of climate policy focused on what the opposition might do if it wins power in three years’ time. But the repercussions from decisions made public this week may reverberate longer than was immediately obvious. First, the ridiculous. David Littleproud, the minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, made international news after telling Guardian Australia he did not know if climate change was manmade. By Thursday, he was saying he had always accepted the science on the role humans play in the climate changing. He blamed his initial statement on a TV interview being cut short, neglecting to acknowledge it first appeared in an email responding to questions from this publication. The minister’s position was backed to varying degrees by cabinet colleagues who played down the need to focus on the link between the climate crisis and bushfires ravaging Queensland and New South Wales or, in the case of the resources minister, Matt Canavan, volunteered that the government supported “sensible responses” to the issue that included supporting coal and gas developments. If this all sounds wearyingly familiar and anti-science, it is worth noting Littleproud’s past comments back his claim that he more or less accepts mainstream science and the need to respond, if not the urgency scientists say is necessary. Beyond reinforcing Australia’s reputation as a global laggard on the climate emergency, his misstep was extraordinary mostly for illustrating the extent to which relative centrists within the Coalition are tying themselves in knots to avoid the wrath of the hard right. But put Littleproud’s gaffe aside. Confirmation by my colleague Katharine Murphy that Scott Morrison will not attend a climate summit convened by the UN secretary general later this month, despite landing in the US that week to meet Donald Trump, is more significant – and not just for surface-level appearance reasons. Morrison was not offered a speaking slot at the summit because he turned down António Guterres’ call for leaders to come to New York armed with concrete plans to boost national climate commitments next year. The foreign minister, Marise Payne, will attend in his place. While it has received relatively little attention beyond the Guardian, international observers are interpreting it as a sign Australia is backing away from its pledge under the Paris agreement. It’s worth looking at what Australia signed up to in France in 2015. The overarching goal agreement is to limit global heating to well below 2C and as close to 1.5C as possible. To get there, countries included a “ratchet-up” mechanism. Every five years, they would update their commitments (known, in the UN’s typically alienating language, as “nationally determined contributions”) informed by the latest science. Everyone in Paris knew the initial targets set for 2030 were nothing like enough. Everyone knew the success of the pact would depend on countries lifting their commitments sooner rather than later. The point was reinforced last year when the world’s climate scientists, under the banner of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, released a major report examining what would be necessary to limit heating to 1.5C. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report, which was requested by leaders in Paris, was stark. As Guterres has noted, it suggests a global 45% cut in emissions is needed by 2030 to keep the 1.5C goal within reach – a significant ask, but one in which analysts have found Australia could play its part. Armed with that information, leaders are now supposed to be doing their part: ramping up what they will do as we approach the first five-yearly update of the Paris agreement next year. As one of the world’s 15 biggest emitters and a wealthy developed country, what Australia does is noticed. But in a comment to the Guardian this week, Morrison’s office offered nothing to suggest a change was on the cards as promised. “Australia has already outlined our policies to tackle climate change including cutting our emissions by 26-28% and investing directly into climate resilience projects through our regional partners,” a spokesman said. Australia has an infamous history of fudging on its climate targets, dating back to the first stage of the Kyoto Protocol, when it demanded a target that allowed it to increase pollution by 8%. It also pushed for the inclusion of land-use changes in its baseline year of 1990, an historically high year for Australian carbon pollution from rampant land clearing in Queensland. As land clearing had already reduced in the years that followed, it meant Australia could meet its goal while it continued to dramatically expand fossil fuel operations. It set up a situation where it could claim to be playing its part while doing no such thing. That approach has continued. Australia has changed baseline years to make cuts appear deeper than they are and set targets that ignore scientific advice. Its has set low emissions reduction targets and then wants to claim extra credit towards its next target for beating the first goal. The credits go to Australia, not the atmosphere. As has been well documented, Australia’s national emissions have risen four years straight. Multiple analyses have found existing climate change policies are not enough to meet the current 2030 target. It would be foolish to be Pollyannaish about the state of international action to combat climate change. Global emissions increased last year after plateauing for a couple of years in the middle of the decade. The national governments of the biggest emitters, China and the US, either give mixed messages or are actively opposed to taking action. But most major players, China included, remain committed to the Paris process in a way Australia is not. High-level discussions between China and the European Union about increasing their emissions commitments are ongoing. India is watching those talks closely ahead of announcing its position next year. More than 60 countries have signed up to give a presentation at the NYC climate summit, according to an early list seen by the Guardian. Amid this, Australia’s plans are unclear at best. It has committed to develop a long-term strategy, but not explained what this will mean. It is possible it could still take an increased 2030 target to the UN climate conference in Glasgow next year. But it has said nothing to indicate this is likely. Why does this matter? Beyond it going against Australia’s pledge in 2015, it makes deeper cuts in the future that much harder. Bill Hare, the chief executive and senior scientist with Climate Analytics, says it is well established scientifically that inadequate emissions reductions by 2030 leaves little to no chance of reaching zero emissions by 2050, the underlying goal implied by the Paris deal. Visiting bushfire-damaged Queensland on Friday, Morrison followed a familiar formula. He accepted that climate change was a factor in what he was witnessing and claimed Australia was acting. “We have already responded and we will continue to respond, to take action on climate change. I do not accept any suggestion that we do not,” he said. It is a proven technique: straight denial despite all the evidence running the other way. But talk to international observers of climate efforts and the view is different. Australia is seen as a roadblock, more focused on expanding its coal and gas exports than supporting a global solution. As efforts build ahead of Glasgow next year, Morrison may find it is not just the Pacific pushing back."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve been following Joe’s forecasts here in Europe for about 2 years. At first I thought he was just another weatherman and didn’t put too much stock in what he said. Then I noticed his 3 to 6-month general forecasts were pretty darn accurate.
Back in 2008 he predicted a cold winter for Europe – and it panned out. Last fall 2009 he predicted a harsh winter for central Europe, and Germany got its worst winter in 46 years. Late last winter he predicted a hot summer – and bam! Hello hot summer.
Meanwhile, the Met Office, equipped with its monster-size, mega-million dollar super-computers, was not even able to do better than flipping a penny.
They’ve since given up issuing seasonal forecasts, yet still insist their 50 and 100-year forecasts will be correct because of the dubious “undisputed CO2-temperature correlation”. (If that’s so, why waste your money on a super-computer?)

"Behind the remote research huts of Sermilik ice station, a vast sheet of ice stretches north for 1,480 miles, spanning an area three times the size of France. It is holding 10% of the world’s freshwater, water that has been frozen solid for millions of years. It’s glacier calving season in the south-eastern reaches of Greenland, and the adjacent channel is full of the thunderous roars and cracks of a flotilla of icebergs breaking apart. Across a narrow granite ravine separating the visitors’ hut from the main living quarters of the 40-year-old international scientists’ base, lab machines click and whirr through the night. The day’s samples – water, air, carbon, algae – spin frantically around curious-looking aluminium discs. Melting ice drips slowly into assorted beakers. Struggling to adjust to the midnight sun, a team of international research scientists from Aarhus University and Germany’s national research centre for solid earth sciences peer into microscopes at clues to the planet’s future. These are samples of glacial past and present, retrieved from the belly of the Mittivakkat glacier, which is in mortal retreat on the plateau above. To understand our origins, scientists look to the stars. To understand our eventual demise, the glacier is ground zero. Far from being barren places, glaciers represent more than 10% of our landmass and are teeming with biodiversity. They are spawning and breeding places not just for the familiar species like whales, arctic hares and foxes, polar bears, seals and muskoxen but also for bacteria, fungi and algae that have a vital role in the planet’s biodiversity. This team of microbiologists is attempting to decode the lives of these hidden creatures and their links to the ice melts across the polar caps. Algae blooms, these scientists say, are turning sun-reflecting glaciers into sun-absorbing hotspots. Long hours are spent on the glacier and even more in the makeshift labs set up in a decrepit series of huts built in the late 1960s on the edge of this lonely archipelago some 40 miles away from the nearest settlement. Archive photographs in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, show that the Mittivakkat glacier’s vast icy mouth opened out to the Arctic Ocean as recently as the 1950s. But to reach its heart in 2019 is a hike many miles inland, crossing rocky terrain in entirely unexpected 23-degree heat. Lichen and unseasonal arctic flowers line the route, as do thirsty mosquitoes, who feast on the moisture of human eyeballs, relenting only at the ice line. Flying over a glacier by helicopter it’s easy to dismiss the landscape as devoid of life, but for the seven scientists at Sermilik hiking over the ice, it is a source of constant fascination for animal and plant life. Alexandre Anesio is a professor in Arctic biogeochemistry from Aarhus University. A charismatic Brazilian, he has a rifle slung over his shoulders – one of four armed researchers, all on constant vigil for the polar bears who stalk the coastline here. He is also probably the worst shot. His young doctoral students, Eva Doting and Laura Halbach, look more keen-eyed, having spent the last month preparing by shooting polar bear targets at a rifle range in Copenhagen. On the Guardian’s first evening, over supper, Anesio explains with earnest patience that snow isn’t universally white. Some of the last snow to lie on the surface of the earth, long after the human race is gone, might even be red. Not blood-red – more a watermelon hue. He also talks about how, in the end, the fate of our glaciers, sea-level rises and biodiversity loss, will not only come down to the excesses of the industrial age and our unbridled consumer life, but also to the influence of algae. The sticky green residue familiar from childhood tadpole ponds, as it turns out, could be a microscopic bellwether for this age of extinction. Each year, high on Greenland’s glaciers, algae perform a remarkable migration. After spending winter deep in the snowpack as dormant cysts, they awake in spring and swim through snowmelt, dividing and photosynthesising along the route. When they reach the surface, the algae turn black, dark green and crimson – colours that come from astaxanthin, a molecular cousin of the chemical that makes sweet potato orange. The algae produce it as a sunscreen, as it absorbs UV light. As a consequence the humble algae dramatically reduce the amount of sunlight reflected by Greenland’s glaciers and increase the sunlight they absorb, darkening the snow and ice. Most concerning for the researchers out on the glacier is the fact the algae that live on the ice surface in summer are increasingly dark brown, leading them to absorb more sunlight and exacerbate melting. Along with his colleague Professor Liane Benning, Anesio leads a team responsible for this breakthrough discovery. The team is now aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the algal growth, and how the organisms have adapted to live on the ice. The key question is whether the algae will grow and darken other areas of the ice sheet as the climate gets warmer. If this happens, which is what the team here in Sermilik suspect, it will mean up to 30% faster melting of the ice sheet than existing models are predicting. “In 2019 our glaciers and ice sheets [are] already being darkened by dust, soot, and ash from our industrial world, which provides the perfect home for algae to flourish,” Anesio says. “As the organisms reproduce, they melt even more snow, which in turn allows them to proliferate again. So it’s like a cycle. A very bad one.” As algae spread, the effect will be compounded, leading to even more melting.  Benning, of the German Research Centre for Geosciences or GFZ in Potsdam, was previously part of the Black and Bloom project to understand how and why the Greenland ice sheet is melting. She says algae-discoloured snow isn’t just an Arctic phenomenon. “It’s a global occurrence,” she says. “This is increasingly a problem in the Arctic, Alpine and Himalayan glaciers. Blooms of red snow and brown ice are turning up in Antarctica also. What we hope to do is spread our research out further because we believe this is a significant factor in ice melt. This is why we are back here in Greenland but we believe the work also needs to be done elsewhere.” The sound of a city block-sized portion of ice as it separates from Greenland’s ice shelf is unique. A violent sonic boom is followed by an echoing machine-gun style “ak-ak-ak-ak” as the iceberg turns on its axis, before surrendering to the ocean with an eerie silence. There is a sadness to it.  On one single day last month, Nasa’s Oceans Melting Greenland project announced that Greenland’s ice sheet had suffered its most substantial single-day volume loss on record, sending an estimated 12.5bn tonnes of ice pouring into the Arctic Ocean – a body of water that could cover the whole of England in five inches of water. If the Greenland ice sheet disappeared tomorrow, sea levels around the world would rise by seven metres and life, as we know it, would come to an end. Glaciers matter. And they are in universal retreat. By 2100 Alpine summits may have lost around nine-tenths of the ice that covered them in 2003. In western Canada, somewhere between 60% and 80% of the ice measured in 2005 will have disappeared and flowed into the sea. In South America, the glaciers of Bolivia have lost almost half their mass in the last 50 years. Sermilik’s scientists argue for serious thinking and funding to understand glacier loss. For Anesio, who left his job at Bristol University, transferring to Denmark because of the potential impact of Brexit on his research, science has to be “something collaborative”. “There is no question that the data we are seeing is concerning,” he says. “One of the latest predictions is that there is a 10% chance for sea levels to rise by two metres in 2100. So maybe some people think 10% is not a great chance – but I don’t think I would cross the street if I had a 10% chance [of being] hit by a truck. “Our job as scientists is to create more accurate models and add to our global understanding of the climate crisis so that it can be used for politicians to take action – we hope, a little bit faster than is happening now.” As glaciers retreat from India to Greenland, biodiversity is being lost. According to the UN one million species face extinction due to human influence. Such a collapse in biodiversity would wreak havoc on the interconnected ecosystems of the planet, putting humans at risk by compromising food sources, fouling clean water and air, and eroding defences against extreme weather such as hurricanes and floods. As Greenland’s ice melt has been adopted by the world as a global bellwether for climate crisis, less focus is being placed on the impact on biodiversity. This ice sheet is not just being melted by algae bloom and from above by warmer air temperatures. Arctic waters are reaching record high temperatures and warmer water is lapping against these great glaciers. For Greenland, one of the least densely populated countries in the world, the impact will be felt on land by the nation’s flowers, plants, bushes and heather, its polar bears, caribous, arctic hares, foxes and wolves and at sea by narwhals, seals, bowhead whales and the large variety of unique sea birds. This is biodiversity that actually faces few direct pressures from human activities – the major threat is glacial melt and climate crisis. The shrinking of the sea ice area is already having a significant impact on marine ecosystems. It’s an essential habitat and breeding ground for many species, ranging from micro-algae to marine mammals. This is now a hungry time for polar bears struggling to access the sea ice to hunt for seals. An estimated 3,500 of the bears stalk the coastline of Greenland and at Sermilik, stories are swapped of close encounters with the animals. Scientific labours in the chill winds and high seas of the Arctic summer seem wrapped in an unusual sense of urgency this year. The scientists working in Greenland are keen to communicate their new, emerging understanding of the dynamics of the declining ice sheet to the broader world. According to Christopher Trivedi, a US member of the scientific team, communicating the work of the many scientists active across Greenland to local people is a vital and often overlooked part of the job. “I think science communication matters. We need to include the local community here with the work we are doing, and we also have a responsibility to explain the work we are doing here. What we are finding impacts the immediate environment more than anywhere else.” For the younger members of the Sermilik team, the bleakest conversation held at the ice station is around the plastic being discovered. “We are finding plastics in the atmosphere at the centre of Greenland’s ice sheet,” says Dr James Bradley, assistant professor at the Queen Mary University of London. “Millions of tonnes of plastic are discarded into the environment every year and are broken down into small particles and fibres that do not biodegrade. These particles, known as microplastics, have now been found everywhere from high mountains to deep oceans and can carry toxic chemicals and harmful microbes. Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic waste. Their presence in oceans and waterways has received a great deal of scientific and media attention in recent years, but our growing concern is their presence in the atmosphere.” It is evident that all the scientists feel a growing responsibility on their shoulders to answer questions that have been ignored for too long. This summer, in the face of record ice melt, there is a deeper purpose and an urgency to their work. They want more resources and new technologies to map the details of ice loss with greater precision. They want better global monitoring of nutrients and contaminants that are now trickling at ever higher rates from glaciers into downstream waterways. They want to expand their work to Antarctica and other parts of the glacial world. “To be honest, I’m massively worried,” says Anesio. “I just hope that we are not crossing that tipping point because I don’t think humans can adapt to the rates of changing climates at the moment.” He says that he also has hope, “because I can see a new movement in the young generation that cares. I think that everyone individually can contribute, by pressing politicians, but also by making their contribution in terms of the reduction of CO2.” Leaving the ice station by boat, negotiating the same narrow channel of icebergs that brought us here, we pass over the shattered remnants of a glacier and stop to scoop a 1,000-year-old chunk of ice from the water. These lumps of ice can only meet one path, drifting out into the Arctic sea at the mercy of winds and warm currents until they break apart into the ocean. Days later, further north of the island, a local ship’s captain summed things up with his Greenlandic dark humour. “That noise you hear out there. The fizzing and cracking,” he tells me, cupping his ear to the wind for dramatic effect as his old wooden ship passes through a fjord filled with decaying mountains of ice. “That noise is the end of the world.”"

"Firefighters in New South Wales are taking advantage of cooler conditions to undertake backburning operations, with hotter and windier conditions expected next week. Fire conditions eased again over the weekend in northern NSW, where residents had been told it was too late to leave after a bushfire jumped a highway.  An emergency warning had been issued for the bushfire near the town of Drake on Saturday afternoon as it headed straight for homes in the Rover Park and Red Rock areas. A change in wind lowered the fire’s threat by the evening, prompting the Rural Fire Service to downgrade its warning to an advice level. Another out-of-control fire at Glen Innes Severn was also downgraded from an emergency warning level to watch-and-act, although the RFS continued to warn of spot fires ahead of the main fire. Residents of the Wytaliba area had been told to seek shelter as the fire approached, and those in the Newton Boyd and Wytaliba areas were told to be aware of embers. Overall, the number of out-of-control fires fell from 14 uncontained bushfires at midday on Friday to two late Saturday afternoon, with firefighters making the most of favourable weather conditions. Does climate change cause bushfires? The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  What is the evidence on rising temperatures?  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. What other effects do carbon emissions have? Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  So is climate change making everything dryer?  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. What do recent weather patterns show? The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Is arson a factor in this year's extreme bushfires? Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. The RFS said firefighters also took advantage of cooler conditions to undertake backburning around the state, with warmer and windier conditions expected again next week. The federal government has activated the disaster recovery allowance in Armidale, Bellingen, Clarence Valley, Glen Innes, Inverell, Tenterfield, Uralla and Walcha in NSW. The allowance provides an additional support payment for up to 13 weeks to those who have lost income as a result of the bushfires. It is equivalent to the maximum rate of the Newstart allowance. Meanwhile, conditions have eased for firefighters battling Queensland’s bushfires but the fire danger was set to increase in coming days. On Sunday firefighters continued to battle about 50 bushfires in tinderbox conditions across Queensland. Crews from Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and New Zealand were lending a hand to fight blazes that have razed homes, businesses and an estimated 55,000 hectares of land. But the relief brought on by eased weather conditions was not expected to last as forecasts showed the fire danger was set to increase in coming days. Moist winds could continue to cool the south-east of the state on Sunday. The most serious fires across the state, near Rockhampton, Monduran, Peregian on the Sunshine Coast and at Applethorpe, were sitting at an advice level warning. Of concern to authorities was the Sarabah fire in the Gold Coast hinterland, because it was the biggest. However, the fire danger remained high ahead of deteriorating firefighting conditions forecast to arrive early next week, the Bureau of Meteorology said. “It’s going to be very warm through southern Queensland on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday,” meteorologist Sam Campbell said late on Saturday. “Unfortunately, the hot dry weather is set to continue.” The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, visited burned-out properties in the Gold Coast hinterland community of Beachmont on Sunday. “Some people here have lost their worldly possessions but they haven’t lost their lives,” she said. “They’ll be able to rebuild, and we’ll help them rebuild.” She asked Queenslanders to give generously to a bushfire appeal to support those who lost everything. The 10-day emergency has seen some 1,200 bushfires burning across the state, with more than 600 community warnings issued in the past two weeks. Officials have warned some fires could burn for months because the ground was bone-dry and there was no significant rain in sight. Fires continued to burn in the Lamington national Park, near Binna Burra, in Sarabah and Lower Beechmont. The Ballandean blaze, south of Stanthorpe, continued to burn within containment lines and on Sunday morning there was no threat to property."

"Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg – who has inspired young people around the world to strike in protest of inadequate government action on the crisis – accompanied her American counterparts in the youth climate movement at a rally near Donald Trump’s White House on Friday. Thunberg quietly joined near the edge of the group, whispering along with chants and shaking her head when thanked by other advocates.  The protesters were so surrounded by reporters and TV cameras that they had difficulty beginning a planned march toward the White House. Thunberg fell back in the crowd. “We love you, Greta,” fans yelled. Trump, who has repeatedly denied climate science, has opposed major US efforts to stem greenhouse gases from fossil fuels that are heating the globe, as well as rolling back or attempting to dilute other environmental protections related to air and water quality and wildlife protection. He recently feuded with his own government scientists about the expected path of a the deadly Hurricane Dorian that hit the Bahamas catastrophically before grazing the US east coast last week, with the president appearing in front of a map at the White House altered by a permanent marker. “No more Sharpies, lies and censorship,” one protest sign read. Most other nations are off track to meet the goals needed to keep temperatures from rising to dangerous levels. They are already 1C higher than before industrialization. The gathering of a few hundred preteens, teenagers and their supporters chanted: “Protect our future.” On Wednesday, Thunberg will testify before the US Congress and then join young Americans who are suing the government over the crisis, speaking from the steps of the US supreme court. Thunberg, who sailed to the US last month instead of flying, will participate in a global strike next Friday. It is partly inspired by her decision to spend Fridays protesting outside the Swedish parliament, a campaign that has become known as Fridays for Future. The annual UN general assembly will meet in New York to discuss the climate crisis later this month, and activists will target the global fossil fuel chief executives’ conference taking place in the city the same day. Thunberg briefly took the megaphone at the gathering, to enthusiastic cheers. She had seemed to deliberately keep to the fringes of the event, chanting rather shyly. She said she wouldn’t give a speech because previous speakers “have already said everything”. But she added: “I just want to say I’m so incredibly grateful for every single one of you, I’m so proud of you, who have come here and I, it’s a lot of people … this is overwhelming. Just never give up, we will continue and see you next week on 20 September” - for the planned global climate strike. There appeared to be several hundred people at the event. “We’re striking today to save tomorrow, not to save life in 50 years but to save tomorrow,” said Nadia Nazar, a 17-year-old organizer with the youth group Zero Hour. The world’s leading climate scientists warned last year that humanity only has until 2030 for global heating to be kept to a maximum of 1.5C, beyond which even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people."
"The climate crisis is making people sicker – worsening illnesses ranging from seasonal allergies to heart and lung disease. Children, pregnant people and the elderly are the most at risk from extreme weather and rising heat. But the impact of the climate crisis – for patients, doctors and researchers – is already being felt across every specialty of medicine, with worse feared to come. “There’s research suggesting that our prescription medications may be causing harm because of changing heat patterns,” said Aaron Bernstein, a pediatric hospitalist who is the co-director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at Harvard University. “There’s evidence that extreme weather events are affecting critical medical supplies so we can’t do things as we normally would do because IV fluids aren’t available. “And there’s evidence that extreme weather events are knocking out power more and more, and that is a huge issue for providing care in healthcare facilities.” In a recent example, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Associationfound that lung cancer patients undergoing radiation were less likely to survive when hurricane disasters disrupted their treatments. An August article in the New England Journal of Medicine lays out dozens of similar studies to show how the climate crisis affects each practice of medicine. Renee Salas, a co-author of the report, who teaches emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School said: “The climate crisis is impacting not only health for our patients but the way we deliver care and our ability to do our jobs. And that’s happening today.” Climate change makes allergies worse. As temperatures increase, plants produce more pollen for longer periods of time, intensifying the allergy seasons. Increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can make plants grow more and cause more grass pollen, which causes allergies in about 20% of people. Carbon dioxide can also increase the allergy-causing effects of pollen. Neelu Tummala, an ear, nose and throat specialist at the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates in Washington DC, said she sees many patients with allergic rhinitis, or inflammation of the nasal cavity, congestion and post-nasal drip. “It used to be that tree pollens were only in spring, grasses were just in summer, ragweed was just in fall,” Tummala said. “But the timing of those is starting to overlap more.” One of Tummala’s patients, Kelly Kenney, had minor seasonal allergies as a child but now suffers from year-round from sinus pains, ear pressure and congestion. “The last four years, my symptoms have gotten increasingly worse,” Kenney said. Pregnant people are more vulnerable to heat and the air pollution that is being made worse by climate change. Bruce Bekkar, a San Diego-based obstetrician gynecologist who stopped practicing six years ago to spend more time as a climate activist, has compiled 68 studies from the continental US on the association between heat, smog and the tiny particles of pollution that come from fossil fuels and how they are connected with premature birth, low birth weight and stillbirth. More smog forms when it is hot, and some research suggests particulate matter also increases with the climate crisis, although the data is less robust. Bekkar said he and his co-authors found a significant association in 58 of the 68 studies. The body of research covers 30m births in the US. Bekkar said doctors should talk to their patients about how heat waves could lead to premature births and how staying away from air pollution can help them keep their children healthy. “We’re finding that we have increasing numbers of children born already in a weakened state from heat and air pollution. That’s a totally different story than thinking about climate change as the cause of hurricanes over Florida … It’s a much more pervasive and ongoing impact.” In the developing world pregnant people can also suffer from food and water scarcity. Insect-borne illnesses – such as the Zika virus, which was spread by mosquitoes – are also a hazard to developing fetuses. Air pollution gets worse as temperatures rise, stressing both the heart and lungs. The fossil fuel pollution that causes the climate crisis also is linked with increased hospitalizations and deaths from cardiovascular disease, and it is connected with more asthma attacks and other breathing problems. More intense wildfires spew dangerous smoke into the air, as documented in the western US this year. And hotter days make more smog, which the American Lung Association describes as acting “like a sunburn on your lungs which may trigger an asthma attack”. Children under the age of five experience the majority of the health burden from climate change, according to Salas’ report. Samantha Ahdoot, a pediatrician in Alexandria, Virginia, treated an 11-year-old and a 13-year-old who moved from Florida after a hurricane destroyed their community and their medical records at their doctor’s office. One needed surgery for a heart condition and had to start from scratch with a new cardiologist. Both had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that was harder to treat amid the major life disruption and without records on adjustments to medication dosages. Ahdoot, who also founded the group Virginia Clinicians for Climate Action, said she has seen an influx of families moving because of weather disasters. Much hotter days make it harder to stay hydrated. They are linked with electrolyte imbalances, kidney stones and kidney failure. Patients who need dialysis as their kidneys fail can have trouble getting treatment during extreme weather events. Higher temperatures and the depletion of the ozone layer increase the risk of skin cancer. The same refrigerants and gases that damage the ozone layer contribute to climate change. Heat is linked with higher risks for salmonella and campylobacter outbreaks. Extreme rains can contaminate drinking water. Harmful algae blooms that thrive in higher temperatures can cause gastrointestinal problems, too. Changing temperature and rainfall patterns allow some insects spread farther and transmit malaria, dengue, Lyme disease and West Nile virus. Waterborne cholera and cryptosporidiosis increase with drought and flooding. The American Psychological Association created a 69-page guide on how climate change can induce stress, depression and anxiety. The group says “the connections with mental health are often not part” of the climate-health discussion. People exposed to or displaced by extreme weather or violent conflict are at higher risk for mental health challenges. Extreme heat can also make some mental illnesses worse. The University of Maryland’s Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found emergency calls relating to psychiatric conditions increased about 40% in Baltimore in summer 2018, when the heat index surged above 103F, as reported on NPR. And some psychotropic medications interfere with the body’s ability to regulate temperature – increasing vulnerability to heat. Fossil fuel pollution can increase the risk of stroke. Coal combustion also produces mercury – a neurotoxin for fetuses. Diseases spread by mosquitoes and ticks increase the chance of neurological problems. Extreme heat is also linked with cerebrovascular disease, a disorder that affects blood supply to the brain. Carbon dioxide emissions are lowering the nutritional density of food crops, reducing plant levels of protein, zinc and iron and leading to more nutritional deficiencies. Food supplies are also disrupted by drought, societal instability and inequity linked with climate change. Extreme weather events, including hurricanes, floods and wildfires, often cause physical injuries. Doctors see minor fractures, crush injuries and smoke inhalation. Extreme heat is also linked with aggression and violence, and the climate crisis globally is connected with violent conflict and forced migration."
"The police are planning to impose restrictions on the global climate strike in London on Friday, warning that anyone who does not comply risks arrest. The event in London is part of what is expected to be the biggest mobilisation around the climate crisis the world has seen, with millions taking to the streets in demonstrations and strikes in cities on every continent.  The conditions outlined under a so-called section 14 restrict the demonstration in London to an area around Westminster and Millbank and say the action must finish by 3.30pm. A succession of youth climate strikes on Fridays this year has drawn hundreds of thousands of young people to the streets to demand action over the unfolding ecological crisis. But the Met claimed the “cumulative impact of these protests had been very significant” adding it had evidence that this Friday’s protest “may result in serious disruption to communities in London”. Met commander Dave Musker said: “We respect the right to protest. However, what we will not tolerate are protesters committing criminal offences and disproportionately stopping people going about their lawful business in London.” He added: “Anyone who knowingly fails to comply with these conditions or incites others to fail to comply will be committing an offence and will be liable to arrest. I will not allow the actions of a few to seriously hinder the day-to-day activities of the vast majority of Londoners, or visitors.” Amnesty International UK called the police restrictions “heavy-handed”. “People have the right to protest in sight and sound of their target audience, and we would hope the police bear that in mind when dealing with assemblies in other parts of London such as in the vicinity of town halls,” said Tim Gee, campaign manager. “Tomorrow is expected to be the largest ever day of action on climate change, as young people and adults take to the streets together to demand action on tackling the climate crisis and the human rights violations caused by it. It is vital that their voices are heard and not silenced.”"
"In September 2007, as credit was “crunched” and the financial crisis began to unfold, a group of economists and environmentalists, including the future Green party MP Caroline Lucas, met regularly in my small London flat. Supping on comfort food and wine, we argued furiously while drafting a plan we hoped would transform the economy and protect the ecosystem. We called it the Green New Deal. Little did we know that the ideas we seeded then would be adopted by a shooting star of the Democratic party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as part of her bid for a New York congressional seat in 2018.  Fast forward to 2019 and the Green New Deal is now at the centre of the 2020 US presidential campaign. Bernie Sanders last week declared the climate crisis a national emergency and launched his version of the deal – a $16.3 trillion plan that includes massive investment in renewable energy, green infrastructure for climate resilience and money for research.  Sanders is vague about his financing plans. He suggests that cuts in military spending could generate cash, but also proposes a rise in tax for big corporations. These are welcome proposals, but our group has one quibble. Big transformational projects are not financed from taxation. Kennedy’s moonshot wasn’t, nor is Britain’s HS2 rail project. Suggesting that the deal can be paid for through tax (even from big corporations) will rightly raise suspicions. Ordinary taxpayers will assume – as they did during the US debate about inheritance tax (reframed by the right as “death taxes”) – that the burden of such a carbon levy will fall instead on their shoulders. So where should the money come from? There are fundamentally only two sources of financing. The first is borrowing (credit). This is achieved by applying for a loan, or issuing a bond. The second is existing savings. To raise the money for a green deal, governments would have to draw on their equivalent of a giant credit card, but would also be able to take advantage of investment by savers. Thankfully, the creation of millions of jobs will generate the income and tax revenues needed to repay any borrowing. As Sanders argues, the whole thing will pay for itself. First, the borrowing: credit issued by a commercial bank, as we all know from spending on our credit cards, does not draw on our existing deposits or savings. Instead it is a promise to pay in the future. OECD governments (backed by millions of taxpayers) are the most trusted borrowers, which is why their promises (bonds) are in such demand. Savings, by contrast, already exist – in bank deposits and savings accounts. When a government borrows, as it has for financing HS2, that leads to investment and the creation of paid jobs in public and private sectors, and to private sector profits. Both employment income and profits generate tax revenues. Tax revenues are, therefore, a consequence of spending or investment – and can be used to pay back the borrowing. They need not be used directly to finance that investment. During the second world war commercial banks provided credit to the government in the form of Treasury deposit receipts. They could do so again. But the government also has its own bank, the Bank of England, which issues credit, too (currently known as quantitative easing, or QE), and could use this to purchase government bonds. To appeal to savers, the government could issue bonds to be repaid over different time periods – short, medium or long-term. These would attract pension funds and insurance companies, but also different kinds of individual savers. They would be able to invest their money in transforming the economy away from fossil fuels, while receiving a regular income in the form of interest. For this to happen, governments would have to be “in the driving seat” when it comes to issuing bonds. Currently they’re more passive – relying almost entirely on demand from private capital markets. As you can see, this system of financing is entirely doable. However, to succeed, our plan demands a decisive rupture from the neoliberal consensus of pairing expansionary monetary policy (QE) with contractionary fiscal policy (austerity). The original Green New Deal group continues to meet, to argue, to indulge in good food and wine, and to plot the defeat of that consensus. Later this week, Caroline Lucas, together with Clive Lewis MP, will launch a bill embracing key principles of the plan. From small beginnings, a great change could soon be on its way. • Ann Pettifor is the author of The Case for the Green New Deal, published by Verso "

"The Australian Capital Territory plans to phase out natural gas, electrify its bus fleets and public school buildings, and introduce incentives for drivers who buy electric cars. The ACT government announced its climate strategy for 2019-25 on Monday, with several nation-first policies it said would further the territory’s “global leading climate efforts”.  The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, said the plan had significant environmental objectives as the territory moved to cut emissions by 50-60% on 1990 levels by 2025, and transition to net zero emissions by 2045. But he said the territory also wanted to make sure the transition was “a just one for our community” that capitalised on the economic development opportunities of shifting to a carbon-neutral economy. “At a high level I think it demonstrates national leadership, international leadership in certain areas, and provides us with a very clear, considered pathway forward as we respond to the challenges of climate change,” Barr said. Barr said there was public appetite for change and “a lot of distress at the lack of action at a national level” as the impacts of the climate crisis became more visible. “Rightly there is a focus on state and territory and local governments to show some leadership here and to work with their local communities, and that’s what we’re doing,” he said. The government said a number of its proposals were firsts for an Australian jurisdiction. They include the development of a plan to achieve net zero emissions from gas by 2045, applying a social cost of carbon in government procurement and capital works, and meeting the ACT’s emissions reduction targets without the purchase of offsets. Under the plan, all new ACT public schools and government buildings would be 100% powered by renewable electricity and the territory’s bus fleet will be entirely electric by 2040. The ACT is due to achieve its target of 100% renewable-generated electricity on 1 October. The next wave of policy is focused on transport and gas because those sectors make up 61% and 22% of the territory’s emissions respectively. But the government acknowledged that drastically reducing emissions from those sectors would require behavioural change from the community. In the case of transport, 95% of the territory’s emissions come from privately owned vehicles. The new strategy says the uptake of electric vehicles will naturally increase as they move closer to cost parity with petrol and diesel in coming years, but also notes it will require incentives for drivers to speed up that transition. The government said it would also have to invest more in infrastructure that will “Copenhagenise” the city by encouraging walking and cycling. The ACT’s climate change and sustainability minister, Shane Rattenbury, said the plan was aimed at preparing the national capital for “a hotter and drier future”. In January the ACT recorded four consecutive days above 40C – a record for the capital – and its mean maximum was a record breaking 34.5C (6.3C above average). The new climate strategy includes a 30% tree canopy target to reduce the impacts of urban heat and a 30% surface permeability target – that is, surfaces made from materials that retain more moisture. It also proposes assistance for low-income residents and retraining of workers in affected industries. “We will need to work with the community,” Rattenbury said. But he said it was “imperative we make these changes” because without action “people’s lives will change for the worse whether they like it or not”. "
"There is a debate in Florida whether it is any longer sensible for banks to offer 30-year mortgages, because by 2050 sea level rise will have overwhelmed many properties. So far, despite the scientific evidence to the contrary, everyone’s nerve is holding; property prices are not affected and mortgages are still being granted. This is a region where a single hurricane-induced storm surge could flatten billions of dollars’ worth of properties.  It is not surprising then that in England, despite the fact that 520,000 properties (including 370,000 homes) are in areas with a 0.5% or greater annual risk from coastal flooding, that the 30-year mortgage debate has not started. After all, Florida is statistically 10 times more likely to get a devastating flood than parts of Norfolk, Cornwall or Hull. Looking at the standard searches that solicitors undertake for buyers it is clear that environmental matters such as drains and contaminated land are carefully examined, along with the dangers of local flooding from overflowing rivers or flash flooding from rainfall. Wider searches to see whether many square miles at or below sea level might be in danger from being overwhelmed by a storm surge are not considered. With sea levels rising each year much faster than previously estimated this might soon be a costly oversight. "
"This story originally appeared in the Nation. It is republished here as part of the Guardian’s partnership with Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story. As world leaders converge on New York City for the United Nations climate action Summit on 23 September, they enter what may be the most consequential week in climate politics since Donald Trump’s surprise election as president of the United States in 2016. Trump, of course, announced soon after taking office that he was withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, the landmark treaty signed at the last big UN climate summit in 2015. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, convened this week’s summit precisely because the US and most other countries remain far from honoring their Paris pledges to reduce heat-trapping emissions enough to prevent catastrophic climate disruption. The events of the coming days – including a global climate strike on 20 September by the activists whose protests in the past year have pushed the term “climate emergency” into news reports around the world – may help answer a question that has loomed over humanity since Trump’s election: can the rest of the world save itself from climate breakdown if the richest, most powerful nation on earth is pulling in the opposite direction? Adopted in December 2015, the Paris agreement stands as the strongest achievement of climate diplomacy since governments first debated the issue at the UN Earth Summit in 1992. In a shock to climate insiders, the agreement not only committed signatory governments to limit temperature rise to the relatively less dangerous level of 2C. It also obliged governments to keep temperature rise “well below” 2C and, in a major victory for the most vulnerable countries, to strive for 1.5C. That half-degree may not sound like much, but it spells the difference between life and death for low-lying coastal nations such as Bangladesh and island states such as the Maldives – two of many places that, science says, would literally disappear beneath the waves with more than 1.5C of warming. The announced US withdrawal from the Paris agreement was big news but also widely misunderstood news. Despite Trump’s bluster, the US withdrawal still has not happened. Precisely to guard against such capriciousness, the negotiators in Paris stipulated that every signatory was legally bound to remain in the agreement until four years after the treaty took effect, which would only happen after countries responsible for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions ratified it. Thus, the Paris agreement did not take effect until 4 November 2016. That means the US cannot leave until 4 November 2020 – which, not by accident, is one day after the US 2020 presidential election. If Trump loses that election, his successor almost certainly would move to keep the US in the Paris agreement. “Don’t bring a speech, bring a plan!” For months now, that’s what Guterres has been telling heads of state and government. Instead of the endless blah-blah-blah heard at most UN meetings, Guterres wants this summit to be more like “show-and-tell”, a meeting where governments share concrete and replicable examples of how they are cutting emissions and boosting resilience to the climate impacts already unfolding. As such, the summit aims to address a glaring deficiency of the Paris agreement. In part, because the agreement made emissions cuts voluntary, global emissions have continued to increase since 2015. On current trends, the earth is heading towards 3-5C of temperature rise – enough, scientists warn, to destroy civilization as we know it. “The secretary general has very clearly demanded that all participants identify very concrete measures that can be implemented immediately,” Luis Alfonso de Alba, Guterres’s special envoy for the summit, said in an interview with Covering Climate Now, a collaboration of 250 news outlets around the world to strengthen coverage of the climate story. “What we need is for all actors to put in practice their commitments [and to] recognize that whatever they had in mind before, they need to do much more – because climate change is running faster than we are, the situation is much more serious than we thought.” Asked how the world can meet the “well below 2C” target when the current US government is doing all it can to increase global warming, Alba, a career diplomat from Mexico, steered clear of criticizing the Trump administration. “We need higher political will not only in one country but in a number of them,” he said, before adding: “We’re very much impressed by what states, cities and businesses are doing in the US to move into renewables … We are quite confident that the US will contribute to solutions, even if the decision to withdraw by the current administration is maintained.” Indeed, then governor Jerry Brown announced at a climate summit last September that he signed an executive order committing California, the world’s fifth-biggest economy, to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2045. This summer, New York state, whose economic output is roughly equivalent to Russia’s, passed a law requiring the state to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. The Under2 Coalition, a group of more than 220 state and local governments around the world representing 43% of the global economy, is likewise committed to keeping temperature rise well below 2C. The climb remains very steep, however. Scientists with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared last October in their landmark Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C that humanity had to slash emissions by 45% by 2030, on the way to net-zero by 2050, to hit the 1.5C target. Failure to do so would condemn many millions of people, particularly in poor and vulnerable countries, to destitution and death and make irreversible global warming more likely. Such dramatic emissions reductions, the scientists added, would require the transformation of the global energy, agricultural, transportation and other sectors at a speed and scale without precedent in human history. China, the other climate superpower along with the US, will therefore have to do better as well. China won plaudits in the lead-up to the Paris summit in 2015 by closing many of its coal-fired power plants. But coal burning in China has recently crept back up, and Beijing has also financed construction of coal plants in other countries, particularly in support of its massive “Belt and Road” initiative to construct ports, railways and other infrastructure across Asia to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Alba commends China for promising to go beyond the emissions reductions it pledged in Paris, but he adds, “We are asking them to do much more and in particular to green the Belt and Road initiative. It’s quite important because of the scale of that initiative that they do not support coal plants but instead renewable energy.” When Guterres gavels the summit’s plenary session to order next Monday, the 12-year deadline outlined by the IPCC scientists will have shrunk closer to 11. Meanwhile, the burning of the Amazon, Hurricane Dorian’s devastation of the Bahamas, this summer’s heatwaves across much of the northern hemisphere, and countless less-heralded disasters illustrate that climate disruption is no longer a worrisome future specter but a punishing current reality. Alba nevertheless draws hope from the heightened public concern and activism against the climate threat. “Compared to 10 years ago, the level of public involvement is very different,” Alba said, “and that’s to a large extent because the news media is talking about it more and young activists are demanding action.” In the United States, activists with the Sunrise Movement and other groups have protested against Democratic and Republican politicians alike and demanded that the government implement a Green New Deal. Championed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman from New York, and modeled on the New Deal jobs and investment programs President Franklin Roosevelt implemented to pull the US out of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Green New Deal calls for the government to kickstart the transformations of energy and other sectors the IPCC says are needed. Such a massive investment program will also, the activists say, create millions of jobs and reduce economic inequality. Central to the plan is “climate justice”, the notion that poor and non-white individuals and communities have suffered worst from climate change and therefore should get precedence for the jobs and opportunities flowing from a Green New Deal. Activist pressure has helped make the Green New Deal the de facto position of the Democratic party in the US, while also spreading the idea overseas. Each of the leading Democratic candidates in the race to replace Trump has endorsed one version or another of a Green New Deal. Bernie Sanders proposes a particularly robust program that will, he promises, “end unemployment” by creating 20m new jobs and also help developing nations dump fossil fuels in favor of renewables. Guterres has gone out of his way to boost the visibility of the climate youth, most notably Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who is the best-known face of the climate movement. Thunberg’s “School Strike For Climate”, begun a year ago in her home town of Stockholm, spread like wildfire around the world, inspiring hundreds of thousands of students to skip classes and take to the streets to demand that governments, in Thunberg’s words, “act like the house is on fire – because it is”. Guterres has invited Thunberg to keynote a special one-day youth climate summit on 21 September and also to address world leaders at the plenary session on 23 September. Alba recognizes that the public is sometimes skeptical of UN conferences, and he acknowledges that the UN “does not have the means to enforce” the commitments made by governments in the Paris agreement. Instead, he puts his faith, again, in the ability of public pressure to compel governments to do the right thing. “As in many other parts of international law,” he says, “the enforcement rests in the follow-up and the ‘name and shame’ role of civil society – to expose that a country is not complying with what they’ve committed to. The media plays an important role there, and so do activists.” Meanwhile, Alba’s own teenage son has given him advice on how to make the case for action: don’t talk so much about the future that youth will inherit but rather about the climate disasters happening now. “He had a point,” says Alba. “This is an emergency we need to deal with today, not tomorrow. Talking about 2030 and 2050 is important because science gives us those dates for achieving certain objectives, but there’s the danger that it tells people that we have time to make these changes. And that is a mistake.” This article was amended on 20 September 2019 after originally reporting that EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler would lead the US delegation to the UN Climate Action Summit. In fact, the delegation will be led by Marcia Bernicat, the principal deputy assistant secretary of state in the state department."
"Thousands of Australian school students are again preparing to walk out of classrooms across the country to demand action on the climate crisis. The global mass day of action will take place on Friday 20 September, three days before the United Nations climate summit in New York. It follows strikes in March this year in which 150,000 people marched in Australia and 1.5 million took part worldwide. Organisers expect next week’s global strikes will be bigger and, this time there will be a much stronger presence from unions, workers and companies that have signed up to strike in solidarity with the young activists. Here’s a guide to what’s happening. Strikes are planned in 120 countries across the world including almost 100 locations across Australia, from the major centres of Sydney and Melbourne to the small rural town of Wollar in New South Wales. There will be strikes in all capital cities and in regional centres such as Albury, Orange and Bendigo. Organisers are anticipating the largest crowds this time will be in Melbourne, where the strikes coincide with the last day of the Victorian public school term. “This massive day of action is going to be fundamental towards advocating for more efficient action on climate change,” Evan Meneses, a 17-year-old organiser for the Adelaide strike, said. He said this was especially the case for Australia “given there is very little concrete evidence to suggest we’re achieving what was laid out in the Paris agreement”. “There’s something that really connects with people when people as young as eight or 13 are advocating for action on the climate crisis because people that young are not the ones who should be having to [do so].” The details for capital cities are as follows (all times are local). • Sydney 12 noon – The Domain • Melbourne 2pm – Treasury Gardens • Brisbane 1pm – Queens Gardens • Canberra 12 noon –Glebe Park • Adelaide 12 noon – Victoria Square • Darwin 1pm – Parliament • Perth 11am – Forrest Place • Hobart 12 pm – Parliament The full list of strike locations is here. Organisers expect hundreds of thousands of people, including students and their parents, to take part. The strikes will also have a strong presence from workers and unions. So far, 30 unions have signed up including the Australian Education Union, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation and the CPSU. Faith groups, including the Anglican and Uniting churches, have pledged their support for students. And hundreds of companies are giving staff time off to strike or finding other ways to express solidarity. Last week companies including Atlassian, Future Super and KeepCup formed an alliance called Not Business as Usual that is urging businesses to support employees who want to strike. What began as an alliance of about 20 businesses has grown to almost 1,000 as of Friday afternoon. Intrepid Travel is one of the companies giving employees a chance to participate in the strike. Its chief executive, James Thornton, said: “We stand in solidarity to support the next generation as they demand climate action. It is real, it is happening and it’s time for global business leaders to do their part.” The students have been inspired by the Swedish school student Greta Thunberg, whose strikes outside the Swedish parliament sparked a global movement. In November 2018, thousands of Australian school students went on strike and that was followed by the mass global day of action in March. Thunberg is in New York for the UN climate summit after making a transatlantic trip on a zero emissions sailboat. A youth summit, featuring some of the school strikers, including young Australian organisers, will take place in the lead-up to the UN conference. The Australia students have three demands for governments. 1. No new coal, oil and gas projects, including the Adani mine. 2. 100% renewable energy generation and exports by 2030. 3. Fund a just transition and job creation for all fossil-fuel workers and communities. The third point is a new feature for the Australian movement and particularly important for these strikes. The strong presence of workers at these strikes is about trying to end the pitting of climate action and the needs of the economy against each other. Instead, the young activists want constructive action to support workers in carbon-intensive industries as economies transition to net zero emissions. Alexa Stuart, a 15-year-old organiser of the Newcastle strike, said: “While it’s really important that we recognise that students are feeling scared about the impact of the climate crisis on our future, it’s also very important to recognise that, in Newcastle especially, there are a lot of jobs in the coalmining industry. “Those jobs are the livelihoods of many people. “It’s why it’s especially important that we’re starting to have conversations in the Hunter region about a just transition so no one is left behind and we can still have a positive impact on climate change.” Varsha Yajman, 17, is a student at Gosford high school and an organiser of the Sydney strike. She said the federal election, at which the Coalition government was returned despite its lack of effective climate policy, had made the movement realise “we had to reach out to people beyond the student community”. “With the election result, it became quite evident that a lot of people think our movement has just created instability for workers in the coal industry,” she said. “A just transition for all workers is really, really important to us. “We think a lot of teenagers are already aware of the impact of the climate crisis. We realised we need to reach out to adults and workers and demand their attention.” Young people are anxious about what their future looks like in a world that is failing to stall the climate crisis. In the last week alone in Australia, bushfires have torn through Queensland and New South Wales in the first week of spring. They have been described as unprecedented. The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. Last summer brought a wave of natural disasters and record-breaking heat. For the first eight months of the year, the country’s mean temperature was the second warmest on record. Mean maximums were the warmest on record over the same period and mean minimums the equal-sixth warmest. Authorities are warning of a grim outlook into the coming summer if current dry conditions and above average temperatures persist across much of the country. Aoibhinn Crimmins, a 17-year-old student at Dickson College and an organiser of the Canberra strike, said the March strikes were designed as a “wake-up call” on climate ahead of the federal election. “This strike is going to be much more about standing up in the face of adversity because the election result was not what we were expecting,” she said. “We are going to the streets again showing we are not going to back down and we are going to keep fighting for climate justice.”"
"Torres Strait islanders “embarrassed” by Scott Morrison’s appearance at last month’s Pacific Islands Forum will request he visit their region to view the impacts of climate change. Warraber man Kabay Tamu, representing a group of islanders who have complained to the United Nations about climate-based human rights breaches, will deliver the invitation to Australia’s delegation at the UN climate summit in New York next week.  “We’re urging the prime minister to visit our islands, meet our communities and see the climate crisis for himself,” Tamu said. Tamu told the Guardian in May: “We’re currently seeing the effects of climate change on our islands daily, with rising seas, tidal surges, coastal erosion and inundation of our communities.” “When erosion happens, and the lands get taken away by the seas, it’s like a piece of us that gets taken with it – a piece of our heart, a piece of our body. That’s why it has an effect on us. Not only the islands but us, as people. “We have a sacred site here, which we are connected to spiritually. And disconnecting people from the land, and from the spirits of the land, is devastating. “It’s devastating to even imagine that my grandchildren or my great-grandchildren being forced to leave because of the effects that are out of our hands.” In May the group, drawn from four islands, went to the UN Human Rights Committee in Switzerland to accuse the Morrison government of breaching their human rights because of inaction on climate change. Tamu took issue with the Australian position at the recent Pacific Islands Forum, when Morrison rejected smaller nations’ calls for an immediate global ban on new coal-fired power plants and coal mines. “As fellow islanders, we were embarrassed by Australia’s showing,” Tamu said. Tamu also criticised the prime minister’s decision not to attend the UN summit despite being in the US to meet Donald Trump, sending Australia’s foreign minister instead. Sea levels around the world are expected to rise between 75cm and 1.5m by the end of the century, depending on greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Australian Department of Environment and Energy, a rise of just 50cm would increase the risk of flooding around Australia by 300 times – making a once a century flood likely to occur several times a year. In some areas of Australia, flooding risk would rise much more – up to 10,000 times. The precise sea level rise around the Torres Strait, and the projected inundation, has not been calculated but low-lying islands are expected to experience a much greater flooding risk than mainland Australia. The department identifies the remote islands of the Torres Strait as some of the most vulnerable, as does the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), which warns communities they may be forced to relocate.

"The number of commercial aircraft in operation will more than double in the next 20 years to 48,000 planes worldwide, Airbus has forecast. The European aerospace company said that despite mounting concerns about the effects of aviation and the climate crisis, it believes air travel will continue to grow rapidly.  Urbanisation and development will mean the emerging global middle class of air passengers could rise 50% by 2038 to almost 6 billion people. Most of the expected 4.3% annual growth in air traffic will occur in the Asia-Pacific region, where demand for new planes is set to surpass that of Europe and North America combined. Airbus executives said aviation growth had proved resilient in the face of economic and geopolitical shocks, such as war and oil price rises, and they expected it to continue. Last year, the growth in flying exceeded predictions, with the number of flights per year up by 280m. Christian Scherer, the chief commercial officer of Airbus, said: “It is as if every single inhabitant of the US took another trip.” The manufacturer expects about 60% of the global fleet of 22,680 passenger jets and freight aircraft to be replaced with new planes in the next two decades, which it said would “contribute to progressive decarbonisation of the air transport industry”. Asked if “flight-shaming” could affect Airbus’s forecasts, Scherer said: “It’s not a concern. We’d rather see it fundamentally as an opportunity. Airbus sees itself as a champion of bringing global emissions down and lowering fuel burn.” While newer models of plane are far lighter and consume much less fuel, aviation’s overall carbon emissions have grown due to the huge rise in passenger numbers. Airbus said that on average, fuel consumption by distance per passenger is 47% of what it was in 1990. However, the number of annual passenger flights worldwide has quadrupled to 4 billion during that period. The average aircraft has more seats and spends 2.3 more hours per day flying than 20 years ago - a trend that suggests even more air journeys could come from the 39,000 planes Airbus forecasts to be delivered by 2038. Bob Lange, the senior vice-president for business analysis at Airbus, said its forecast had not been tempered for potential flying restrictions, whether through government action or public pressure. He said: “Greta Thunberg says, listen to the scientists and be equitable. The growth we see is from routes that are developing.” Chinese domestic flights are due to triple and overtake US domestic flights as the biggest source of air traffic within the next two decades, according to the Airbus forecast. Indian people are expected to take five times as many flights as they do now by 2038. Lange said: “As we become more globalised there are more reasons to travel. The growth is largely coming from people who haven’t accessed air travel in the past. If the US decide to halve their travel, it’s not going to make a dent in people travelling for the first time. “In the notion of what we’re going to do to protect our planet there has to be a notion of equity.” He argued that it would be wrong to say other people shouldn’t aspire to travel as we do today. Scherer said the goal of halving aviation’s emissions by 2050 was “not talk”, but targets Airbus uses as anchors. As yet, no technology appears to exist that is compatible with continued growth in flying.  Airbus is exploring sustainable fuels and alternative propulsion. It hopes to fly a test plane, the E-Fan X, in 2021, which could mean short-range hybrid-electric flights are feasible by the mid-2030s, Lange said. “We need to do more, it’s not enough but we can’t do it purely on our own.”"

Last Friday the German edition RIA NOVOSTI Russian news agency reported that there were five clusters of sunspots on the sun, leading some scientists to believe that the sun’s unusual lull may be over for good.
Scientists have been observing sunspots for hundreds of years. Many believe solar activity has a major impact on the earth’s climate on a decadal scale.
As a rule, the number of sunspots is considered to be the main criteria for solar activity: the higher the number of sunspots, the higher the activity.
But Sergei Bogatchov of the Lebedev Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences says that this correlation is not exact. Over the last 10 years, the highest number of sunspots occurred on January 24, 2002 – 19 clusters of spots were registered. Yet these sunspots led to only three weak solar eruptions. The most powerful solar eruption in recent history occurred on November 4, 2003 when only 4 clusters were present on the sun, reports Ria Novosti.
Last February there were 22 eruptions – 4 were powerful. Since then the sun has been in a stupor. According to Bogatchov the current sunspots show very little energy.  Today’s sun image, see above, is again relatively inactive.
When will this solar cycle reach it’s maximum?

Ria Novosti writes that according to Bogatchov, this cycle’s maximum was already pushed back to mid 2013 earlier this year, meaning the cycle is extended from 11 to 12 years. Bogatchov says:
If nothing happens in the next months ahead, then the expected maximum will have to be pushed back once again.

Source: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SolarCycle/
Judging NOAA’s latest sunspot tracking chart above, pushing back the date of the expected peak will likely happen sooner than later, and the length of the current cycle will be thus extended well beyond 12 years. Compare it to their original prediction back in 2007:

Now that’s quite a difference. We were projected to be at about 100 by now. But we’re only at about 20, well below their low projection! Scientists and policymakers really ought to start taking notice, as the chances that they are planning for the completely wrong scenario are becoming inescapable.
Recent studies have shown that Europe’s winters are especially harsh when solar activity is low. If that holds, get ready for some tough winters ahead. Last winter may have been just a preview of what’s coming. Stay tuned for more details on this elsewhere!

Share this...FacebookTwitterI noticed Google today had a graphic up, as it often does, that you can click on. What’s the occasion today? Oh! It’s Earth Day!
Earth Day was started by Gaylord Nelson, the Democratic senator from Wisconsin. It was the single largest national demonstration in American history. 20 million Americans participated in the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970.
What did Earth day preach back in 1970? Here are some examples from washingtonpolicy.org:
• By 1995, “…somewhere between 75 and 85 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.” Sen. Gaylord Nelson, quoting Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, Look magazine, April 1970.
• Because of increased dust, cloud cover and water vapor “…the planet will cool, the water vapor will fall and freeze, and a new Ice Age will be born,” Newsweek magazine, January 26, 1970.
• The world will be “…eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age,” Kenneth Watt, speaking at Swarthmore University, April 19, 1970.
• “We are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,” biologist Barry Commoner, University of Washington, writing in the journal Environment, April 1970.

• “By 1985, air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half…” Life magazine, January 1970.
• Paul Ehrlich predicted that in 1973, 200,000 Americans would die from air pollution, and that by 1980 the life expectancy of Americans would be 42 years.
• “It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,” wrote Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes, The Living Wilderness, Spring 1970.
• “By the year 2000…the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America and Australia, will be in famine,” Peter Gunter, North Texas State University, The Living Wilderness, Spring 1970.
Sound familiar? Of course these prophets of doom were wrong – spectacularly wrong. Today things are much better by almost every measure. Four decades later the apocalypse has been pushed back 50 or 100 years, and this time it will be caused by manmade global warming.  This time, they insist, they are certainly right. You see, now they’ve got computer models!
The circus continues.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn yesterday’s post I wrote about Deutsche Welle’s  letter to European Institute for Climate Energy (EIKE). where it denies being one-sided in holding an alarmist conference for journalists called: The Heat Is On – Climate Change and the Media, which has workshops like: How to professionally deal with climate scepticism. The conference’s own stated objective:
This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures. 
And the panelists at the conference warn: 
Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics at the expense of the basis of life. 
Despite the obvious one-sidedness of the conference, Deutsche Welle’s Intendant Erik Bettermann sent a letter to EIKE denying it completely. Remember that Deutsche Welle is a publicly funded broadcaster that is required by law to remain fair and balanced.
Now here’s a translation of EIKE’s response to Deutsche Welle’s denial:
Dear Herr Bettermann
Thank you for your reply dated 9 June 2010. You state at the start of your letter concerning the conference that: 
“…Deutsche Welle neither influences the global discussion on climate development in a one-sided manner, nor does it intend to, through its reporting or through the international convention: Global Media Forum..”

However your website announcement itself states: 
“Global warming presents grave problems for the world. Climate change not only has impacts on geo-political peace, regional conflicts, social well-being and human rights, it also impacts our very existence – whether or not the planet will be a hospitable place. Starvation, mass movement of refugees, flooding, lost harvests, extreme storms, droughts and pandemics weaken the foundation of our collective home. The Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum 2010 will put the main topics concerning climate change at the centre of focus and search for a practical way out of the current situation, whereby the role of the media at the international, national and local levels are considered. To prevent the catastrophe, drastic instruments and measures are required.”
This is indeed state doctrine that DW is describing. But it is factually false and moreover it involves the massive, forbidden influence of public opinion. Furthermore, you deny influencing of participants with seminar speakers. But the web announcement itself states, for example: “For journalists it is almost impossible to check over each and every statement for factual accuracy…,“ and: “Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics…This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.“ And further: “That’s why it simply cannot be said that Deutsche Welle is promoting in any way, within the framework of the Global Media Forum,  a one-sided view on the problem of climate development.”
That the single pages of the seminar cannot be called up does not change in any way the publicly made Deutsche Welle objective of influencing public opinion.
In addition you write:  “…through presentations, discussions and debates, the Global Media Forum is a conference for journalists, politicians, scientists and many others in dealing with the question of what role the media have in sharpening people’s awareness regarding the complex topic of climate change.” 
Yet, to the contrary, the stated objective of the conference is to sharpen the fear of climate catastrophe. That’s a big difference. 
You further confirm your denial of public fact, and contradict your own website announcement: 
“Deutsche Welle offers a forum for these discussions , and as a publicly funded broadcaster, does not represent a pre-decided opinion in one direction or another…”
For any normal German reader, it is obvious that the statements made in your letter are in direct contradiction to the publicly stated objective of the forum.  The forum Deutsche Welle is conducting does not in any way comply to the requirements for publicly funded media outlet, paid by the German taxpayer.
Thus we request once again that you cancel this one-sided, catastrophe-promoting conference. The public will be kept informed by us in the appropriate ways.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. H. Thuss,         Dipl. Ing M. Limburg, 
Präsident               EIKE Vizepäsident
Of course the conference began yesterday, and ends tomorrow. No word if some of the conference’s content has been removed in order to comply with the law. Don’t hold your breath. One can now safely say that one publicly funded media arm in Germany has officially gone from journalism to state-sponsored propoganda.

"Brazil’s environment minister, Ricardo Salles, will meet a rightwing US advocacy group that denies climate change, just four days before the United Nations Climate Action Summit. Salles will meet representatives from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) at the headquarters of the US Environmental Protection Agency on 19 September, Brazil’s Folha de S Paulo newspaper revealed.  The meeting was immediately condemned by environmentalists, who said it showed that the government of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, had no commitment to fighting the climate crisis. News of the meeting emerged a day after Brazil’s foreign minister questioned the scientific proof for global warming in a convoluted speech in Washington. Addressing the Heritage Foundation, Ernesto Araújo said “there is no climate catastrophe” and described efforts to fight climate change as a plot to destroy national sovereignty. Brazil is doubling down on its efforts to convince the world the Amazon is in safe hands, despite soaring deforestation and a huge spike in seasonal fires that provoked an international crisis. Bolsonaro is due to address the UN general assembly on 24 September. “This is a government that makes efforts to deny the problems, not to face them,” said Marcio Astrini, director of public policy at Greenpeace Brasil. A spokesman for Salles said he could not confirm nor deny the meeting and a spokeswoman for the Competitive Enterprise Institute did not respond to requests for comment. The CEI’s director for energy and environment, Myron Ebell, led Donald Trump’s transition team at the Environmental Protection Agency. His biography quotes Business Insider, which said: “Myron Ebell may be enemy #1 to the current climate change community.” “Climate change does not endanger the survival of civilization or the habitability of the planet. So-called climate solutions are bureaucratic power grabs and corporate welfare schemes with no detectable climate-related benefits,” read a June article on the CEI site. Before Salles took office in December, a São Paulo judge found he had altered plans for an environmentally protected area in order to favour businesses while state environment secretary. Salles denied the accusations and is appealing against the ruling. In July he said that Brazil was not far from “zero illegal deforestation”. Satellite date from Brazil’s Space Research Institute calculated a 278% increase in deforestation in July. The institute’s director was fired after Bolsonaro described the data as “lies”. Its data showed more than 30,000 fires in the Amazon in August, the highest since 2010. In a recent interview with the far-right Canadian YouTuber Stefan Molyneux, Salles hailed Brazil’s conservation record. The minister argued that a primary cause of deforestation was the lack of proper documentation for Amazon land, despite widespread evidence that much degradation takes place in protected areas and indigenous reserves and has been partly fuelled by Bolsonaro’s attacks on environment agencies and protection."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman professor, co-founder of modern environmental movement, says climate science is exaggerated, filled with fairy tales and believes the Paris Accord is “already dead”. 
In an interview with publicist Roland Tichy, Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt – one of the founders of Germany’s modern environmental movement – said we have in fact three generations time to revamp the world’s energy supply system to one that is cleaner and sustainable.
He rejects the Fridays For Future claim that there are only 12 years left.

Climate catastrophe not taking place
In the interview, moderator Tichy reminded that civilization began 7000 years ago, a time when it was “3°C warmer than today”, and Vahrenholt responded saying he expects civilization to continue for another seven thousand years. There was no tipping point back then, why would there be one today? “Warmth and moisture have always been good for mankind,” said Vahrenholt. “Cold has been man’s worst enemy.”
Plenty of time to move rationally
The German professor also said that the claimed catastrophe “is not taking place” and that policymakers are trying to use “panic and fear to get the people to act.”  Much of the warming measured since 1850 is the result of natural warming taking place due to the end of the Little Ice Age, he explained.

Later the German professor of chemistry calls the belief that wind and sun are able replace fossil fuels “fantasizing” and that Germany, with its 2.3% share of global CO2 emissions, can rescue the global climate “a fairy tale”.
Meanwhile, the warming of the last 150 years is in large part caused by natural cycles. “In the 20th century the sun was more active than at any time over the past 2000 years.”
Economically, Vahrenholt believes that a frenzied rush to renewables will lead to “horrible” economic consequences from European industrialization.
On the topic of a scientific consensus, the German professor says this is a claim made by the IPCC, which run by the UN with an agenda behind it.
Electric cars a “crackpot idea”
Vahrenholt also believes electric cars powered by batteries is not a feasible technology, and that other experts quietly call it “a crackpot idea”, and don’t speak up for fear of losing research funding. The vast majority of funding comes from the German government.
“Paris Accord already dead”
The professor of chemistry, co-author of a recent bestseller, also describes Germany as a country in denial when it comes to the broader global debate taking place on climate science, and declared the Paris Accord as being “already dead”.
“The Accord is already dead. Putin says it’s nonsense. […] The Americans are out. The Chinese don’t have to do anything. It’s all concentrated on a handful of European countries. The European Commission in massively on it. And I predict that they will reach the targets only if they destroy the European industries,” said Vahrenholt.
He characterizes Europe’s recent push for even stricter emissions reduction targets to madness akin to Soviet central planning that is doomed to fail spectacularly.

"From weakening vehicle emissions to blocking warnings about how coastal parks could flood or the impact on the Arctic, the Trump administration is accused of muzzling climate science. Here six whistleblowers and former government scientists describe being sidelined by the administration – and why they won’t be quiet. What did the work involve? “I was an engineer at the EPA, working for 40 years in a very technical job. In 2009, after the election of Barack Obama, the EPA started working on greenhouse gas standards for vehicles for the first time. It felt like we were making history. “There was a team of around 25 people producing thousands of pages of analysis for the standards. We knew it would be controversial but it was a very big deal, the first critical steps to address the climate crisis.” What changed under the Trump administration? “Once Trump was elected it became pretty clear that things would change. The president came out to Michigan in March 2017 and gave a speech where he said he’d look at the standards, that they hurt economic activity and jobs. That was an obvious sign, really. “In August 2018 the administration proposed an eight-year freeze of the greenhouse gas standards. It was unbelievable, really – for the first time in the history of the EPA the political leadership decided to change pollution standards that were doing well without allowing the career staff and experts to play any sort of role. We were completely locked out. “There was no scientific or technical rationale to rolling back the standards, the analysis they used was the most biased thing I’ve ever seen. They cooked the books and changed every assumption they could to get the answer they wanted. It was so bad that some EPA career staff asked their bosses to take the EPA name off it all.” How do you feel about your experience? “It broke my heart. I’d had this wonderful career, playing a small role in making the world a better place. Then we had a political leadership making decisions on ideology, denying science, basically being climate deniers. It felt horrible. “I was 62 years old and there were a few family things going on, but the Trump administration made a difficult decision to retire much easier. I felt I could do more good on the outside, educating the public on what’s going on. By the time I left, the morale was the lowest I’d seen in 40 years. Our work had become irrelevant.” Asked by the Guardian on Monday about the concerns outlined by four former EPA scientists, the EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in a statement: “The EPA under President Trump has strived to create an agency that is responsive to the American people.” The statement said this included “proposing the Safe (Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient) rule that will save lives and produce savings for American consumers, working on the first major update to the lead and copper rule in nearly three decades”. It added the agency was also “on track to become the first administration to complete an ozone NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) in the five-year review cycle envisioned by Congress”, and had deleted 22 sites from the national priorities list of those eligible for Superfund cleanup, the most since the financial year 2005. What did the work involve? “I was studying how climate change will affect 118 coastal parks in the US for the National Park Service. I started this work in July 2013, it was my baby.” What changed under the Trump administration? “My study went through peer review and was ready to be released but I was told by the NPS a few days after Donald Trump’s inauguration that they were ‘waiting for messaging’ first. I thought that was no big deal but then nothing happened and I started calling up every few weeks to say, ‘We’ve got to get this out, it’s getting stale.’ “The excuses varied but became ever more vague, such as ‘we are ever so busy’ or that it would worry people during hurricane season because it mentions storm surge in coastal areas. A superior said they wanted to keep a low profile on climate change for four or maybe eight years while Trump was around, which really upset me because we don’t have four to eight years to do nothing. I felt I was being silenced. “I went on maternity leave around Christmas 2017 and the report still hadn’t been released. I got an email from a colleague saying, ‘Congrats on the baby, by the way you should know they are editing your report.’ “We had a conference call and it became clear that any mention of human-caused climate change had been taken out. I was asked how I would feel if they didn’t release the report at all, which felt like a threat. I stood my ground and was told ‘they aren’t going to be happy about this from above.’ It was never clear who ‘they’ were – perhaps Trump himself or Ryan Zinke [the then secretary of the interior]. “I then had a meeting with a senior NPS official who came out from Washington DC. The other report co-authors were there, too. That’s when it all unravelled, it became incredibly hostile. I was told not to attribute changes in public lands to human actions. “I felt like we worked for the American people and I didn’t want to lie to them. But a superior said that we in fact work for the executive branch of which the president is the head. The president is the boss and we are going to put our heads down and put out the line of the administration. “A journalist did a freedom of information request and saw all the emails of us fighting over this and asked me for a statement. I ended up going on the record because I thought it was a very important issue. I was aghast I was being asked to lie. These people were violating the mission of the NPS. “After I came back from maternity leave I was demoted to be an intern on $25,000 a year. And then in February this year they said there was no money left at all and that I would have to leave. It was devastating. I offered to work for free as a volunteer but was turned down, which shows that it wasn’t a money issue really. I packed up my office and I was gone. I filed a whistleblower complaint in July.” How do you feel about your experience? “I have faced retribution, I was threatened and placed in a hostile work environment. It’s clear in some agencies there’s a culture of fear where scientists are being intimidated. When I wrote this report, politics was the last thing on my mind, I was thinking about climate change and these coastal parks. “It’s very frustrating, it’s not where I pictured where my career would be at this time in my life. I don’t even know if I have a career any more. What’s left is in tatters.” Response from the National Park Service A statement from the NPS said it was “confident in the quality and accuracy of the science behind the sea level rise and storm surge projections presented in the report” and staff involved showed “utmost professionalism”. It added: “The report underwent several rounds of internal and external scientific peer review to ensure that it is most helpful and relevant to the intended audience of park managers and planners…” The NPS said understanding how climate change “affects park resources and infrastructure is part of our core responsibility to protect parks”. What did the work involve? “The Clean Air Science Advisory Committee (Casac) is required to inform the EPA administrator over air quality standards, if they are sufficient to protect public health or not [under the Clean Air Act]. The EPA’s Science Advisory Board is a much larger committee that takes on all sorts of things – clean water rules, vehicle greenhouse gas standards, rules about transparency and so on.” What changed under the Trump administration? “Initially there was a neglectful relationship with the new Trump administration; they seemed uninterested and the amount of scientific advisory board work dropped off. Then, from October 2018, there were the first signs of the ideological assault on scientific advice at the EPA. “Scott Pruitt [then administrator of the EPA] wrote a memo that said that researchers that have received grants from the EPA aren’t allowed to serve on panels because of a perceived conflict of interest. But there was no prohibition on industry people serving and the number of them on the panels has increased. It’s been a way to kick qualified people off the boards and get cronies in their place. “There was a complete turnover of Casac and it shows in meetings. They now bumble through things because they don’t understand the process and the Clean Air Act. Political appointees are interfering with the selection of candidates, essentially picking those sympathetic to the agenda of the administration, even if they have fringe views like climate change isn’t happening, that kind of stuff. “I was on a panel looking at the risks posed by particulate matter. We had a lot more work to do but we were disbanded four days before the EPA released an assessment that we would’ve reviewed. The timing was mind-boggling. I found out by seeing a press release on the EPA website, which was followed by an email saying our services were no longer needed. “I was also a nominee for a panel on ozone but then they said they wouldn’t go ahead with that. It was a little frustrating for me personally, but it’s more of a loss to the American public. The EPA has always been thought of as a science-based agency; what we see now is no basic respect for science.” How do you feel about your experience? “There’s not even lip service to the science. Science can’t be controlled like ideological spin, so the administration is afraid of that. They don’t want scientists and their evidence-based opinions – they’d rather have cronies trot out the same tired talking points on fringe scientific views.” What did the work involve? “I was at [the department of the] interior for nearly seven years. I started on 3 January 2011 – I know the exact date because of how excited and inspired I was at the thought of serving in the federal government. I was hired as a senior executive to run the office of policy analysis, which sits in the office of the secretary. “One of the main areas of focus was addressing the impacts of climate change in the Arctic, which is warming two to three times faster than the rest of the planet. Entire Alaska native villages are threatened by rapid coastal erosion and storms because they no longer have a sea ice curtain to protect them from fierce Arctic storms in the fall and early winter, and the ground beneath their feet is falling away as the permafrost thaws.” What changed under the Trump administration? “The new Trump team was very thin and most of them knew very little about the agency mission – they were mostly oil and gas lobbyists and some campaign workers. Whatever they were talking about up on the secretary’s hallway, it sure wasn’t being shared with the career staff at the agency. So you basically had 70,000 employees scratching their heads and getting back to doing their jobs while a couple dozen political appointees tried to get their act together to lead them. It was surreal. “But this neglect soon turned into scorn, characterized by comments from the new secretary, Ryan Zinke, that the staff were disloyal. Morale began to quickly plummet as the political ranks showed not only ignorance of, but disdain for the wide-ranging agency mission. Here you had tens of thousands of people working hard in public service and being told what they do is not important. “The National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service had it worst because they didn’t have anything to do with oil and gas or mining permitting process, and the lobbyists in charge had no interest in wildlife, conservation or biodiversity. “But every agency suffered, because the mantra of the administration was to drain the swamp – and it quickly became clear that the swamp was not the high-paid lobbyists, but the rank-and-file government professionals who serve the country. “On a Thursday night in June, just a week after I’d been in New York to speak at the United Nations about climate change adaptation issues, I received an email that said I was being moved to a new position. “It was quickly obvious that this was a retaliatory action, as I was moved away from any climate change work to the office that collects royalty income from oil, gas and mining companies – an auditing position for which I had zero expertise. The email explained that because I had economists on my policy staff that I must clearly know about numbers, so I’d be good in an auditing office. “I’d heard that they were looking for a job that I would not want, in hopes that I would quit. It’s not unusual for senior executives to be reassigned, it’s part of the job, but reassignment can’t be used to get people to quit – and Secretary Zinke testified to Congress a week later that he was using reassignments, among other methods, to trim the workforce. Sadly, I was only one of dozens of executives who were reassigned that night, many of us for clearly retaliatory reasons. “I found legal counsel and eventually filed a whistleblower complaint and went public with an op-ed in the Washington Post. I wasn’t worried too much about my job at that point, I was worried about the work I’d been doing on behalf of Alaska Natives, and it was clear they had no intention of continuing to work to help those frontline communities. “A couple months later I decided that they’d already taken my job, but there was no way I’d let them take my voice, so I resigned and continued to speak publicly about these abuses and the implications for American health and safety.” How do you feel about your experience? “The Trump administration is threatened by evidence, by science and by expertise. These things interfere with their ability to hobble government agencies and reduce oversight. It’s mind-boggling and a profound threat to democracy but it also increases risks to American health and safety. Every American should be concerned, regardless of political stripe.” A Department of the Interior spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian: “The department works to ensure that the scientific activities that it carries out use the best science and are the result of robust and independent processes.” The department said it was required by law to research and publish reports regarding the changing conditions of the climate and has a “rich and longstanding culture of scientific integrity that prevails independently of individual administrations”. What did the work involve? “I was at the EPA for 33 years, starting in 1984. I worked in the water program and on Superfund cleanups, working on the criteria for drinkable water.” What changed under the Trump administration? “I left in August 2017 and made a very public retirement statement about how bad this administration is and its assault on science. It went viral and since then I spend 20 to 30 hours a week helping the press and Congress understand the impact of what the Trump administration is doing. “We’ve never seen anything like this complete abandonment of science, solely to maximize corporate profits. Everything changed after the election. The climate change section of the EPA website came down and Scott Pruitt came in and brought in a bunch of political appointees who didn’t need Senate confirmation. “I was working on a chemical safety rule that was rewritten by Nancy Beck, someone from the American Chemistry Council [an industry lobby group] who Pruitt brought in. It basically repeated the talking points she used on the chemistry council. “Pruitt never spoke to any of the career staff before he made decisions on replacing rules. I worked on a rule that would require coal-fired power plants to treat toxic waste rather than simply dump it into leaky ponds. Pruitt met with Bob Murray [head of the coalmining firm Murray Energy Corporation] and decided to postpone the rule and the first we knew about it was when we were asked to check a draft press release about the rollback. “Scientists are really irrelevant at the EPA now, their input isn’t requested. They are simply directed by the political team to help fulfill the desires of political donors, no matter the cost to Americans. At the moment it’s just a logistical question of how fast they can go on this. They have something like 70 regulation repeals under way and because it will be hard to do this with legal challenges they want to undermine the underlying science.” What happened after you left? “Within a couple of days of me leaving an opposition research firm did a freedom of information request for all my emails and the EPA immediately handed them over. I found out they made a big effort to connect with all the rightwing media to trash me. They made up this lie that I was being paid more than a Congress member for every year of my retirement. It got really ugly, so I got off social media. “The same opposition group then tried to find out if any EPA employees donated to [Bernie] Sanders or [Elizabeth] Warren. It’s stunning to target federal employees like that. I’ve never seen that before.” What did the work involve? “I was brought in by the EPA to do climate change work for the office that oversees the Superfund site program, which are toxic areas that require a federal cleanup. “I was specifically working on the Superfund site program because President Obama had issued an executive order for any federal agencies that would put forward new federal dollars into infrastructure. Essentially, he wanted those agencies to incorporate climate change into flood risk for that infrastructure. “The model essentially looks at how much sea level rise is expected over the next 100 years. Plus what did the extreme floods look like in those areas? And I combine those two sets of data to create a model that is predictive of these future extreme floods that we’re seeing more of currently and are expected to see more of in the future.” What changed under the Trump administration? “I knew from President Trump, then candidate Trump’s campaign, how he felt about climate change, that I was likely on the chopping block because I was a postdoctoral fellow and my contract was sort of on a year-to-year basis. “And so after the transition occurred, I was there for a couple of weeks and then one day my boss came to my office and said: ‘I think you should probably start looking for another position.’” How do you feel about your experience? “It was a very difficult time for me, absolutely. I was extremely sad and depressed. I really liked the work that I was doing. I felt like I was doing research that was really going to have a significant impact. “I had worked really hard on it. To see something like that just get sort of tossed out the window was really disheartening to see. And the fact that they were just going to completely dismiss this climate change work altogether was also really disheartening. So, yeah. It was a very sad time for me. I will not lie. “There’s a ton of different scenarios that have occurred that show that this administration really does not care about progressing climate change or climate science, in general. “I mean, any time you see some sort of report come out of the agency that even mildly mentions climate change and maybe its impacts to national parks, or something to that extent, the administration tries to downplay human connection to climate change. They try to downplay the role of climate change and federal scientists’ work in press releases. “They try to downplay the role of climate change and research that they’re funding. So even in grants that the agencies are receiving, they’re now being vetted by political officials to essentially make sure that climate change is not mentioned in those proposals. It’s not a great time to be a climate change scientist in the federal government.” • This article was updated on Tuesday September 24 2019 to add a statement from the National Park Service.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThanks to Tom Nelson for posting this. Thomas L. Friedman has earned a spot in my category: Lifestyles of the Rich and Alarmists. Normally I avoid riding on the coattails of other blogs,  but this time I’ll make an exception.If  Thomas Friedman walked around barefoot preaching his gospel like Kung Fu did, then I’d have a lot more respect for the guy. Now I have zero respect.  Like most environmental hypocrites, it’s: “do as I say, and not as I do”. But hey, they’re entitled to live like kings for all the important work they do in rescuing man and the planet.
The rest of us? Well we don’t really do anything important. All we do is impact the environment, and thus we ought to be relegated back to the mud and rice fields.
It never fails. Take almost any Hollywood star or elite left-winger, and you’ll see their environmental activism is invariably proportional to their wealth, A = kW. The same equation applies for their hypocrisy: H=kW, where k > 10.
Let’s take a look at some of the eco-features of his spread.
1. The pool looks to be about 30′ x 70′, no solar heating for it.
2. The asphalt 2-lane driveway is large and wide enough for a stretch limo to easily curve around.
3. No solar panels on the roof. The place is a virtual heat sink.
4. Judging from the angle of the sun and season, the house faces southwest, yet does nothing to take advantage of that. The south-facing windows are even modest in size.
5. Lots of carbon-storing trees were cleared away.
6. I count 3 chimneys – lots of heating.
7. There’s got to be at least 8 bathrooms in the place, who knows how many heated jacuzzis.
8. Even the white car parked outside doesn’t look like a hybrid.
It certainly tops Al Gore’s mansion (the one in Tennessee). But who knows, maybe he takes the hybrid once a week.

The online Manure Manager Magazine (essential literature when debunking anthropogenic global warming science) reports here that the Pacific Legal Foundation has filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas “endangerment” finding under the Clean Air Act because the agency did not submit the proposed finding to independent scrutiny by its Scientific Advisory Board.
Excerpts of the Pacific Legal Foundation release now follow:
The SAB is a panel of top scientists from universities, research institutions, and other highly regarded organizations, empowered by federal law to review any new “criteria document, standard, limitation, or regulation” that EPA proposes to issue under the Clean Air Act.

At issue is the EPA’s finding, announced in December, 2009, that “greenhouse gas” emissions from automobiles pose a danger to public health and welfare.
Even though courts have held that endangerment findings are ‘regulations’ – and therefore must be reviewed by the Scientific Advisory Board – EPA dismissed PLF’s request and refused to allow review of its CO2 endangerment finding,”said Hadzi-Antich, attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation.
Hadzi-Antich adds:
The purpose of this lawsuit is to force EPA to obey the law and to ensure the integrity of the regulatory process. EPA cannot be allowed to evade the scrutiny and accountability that federal law requires.
EPA’s cavalier approach to regulation is especially outrageous when the economy is struggling and unemployment is at the highest levels in decades.
The greenhouse gas ruling could unleash a torrent of command-and-control regulations across the economy. Potentially, every activity that emits CO2 could be subject to new federal restrictions – from a steel manufacturing facility to a neighborhood pizza shop, and everything in between.
EPA cannot be allowed to impose a crippling burden on the economy by ignoring checks and balances, and shielding its regulatory process from legally required outside review.
————————————————————————————-
Expect the EPA to get lawsuits from all sides, as it should. This is an overzealous power-grab by an out-of-control regulatory agency. It’s time  to rein it in. Contact the: Pacific Legal Foundation.

Share this...FacebookTwitter77 German scientists have signed an open letter to Chancellor Angela Merkel casting their doubt on the hypothesis of manmade CO2 emissions causing considerable global warming. The letter, drafted in 2009 by EIKE, continues today to gather signatures from scientists in Germany. Here is the German Letter with signatures, and here’s the English translation.
The open letter states:
…humans have had no measurable effect on global warming through CO2 emissions
and
More importantly, there’s a growing body of evidence showing anthropogenic CO2 plays little measurable role. Indeed CO2’s capability to absorb radiation is almost exhausted at today’s atmospheric concentrations. If CO2 did in fact have an effect and all fossil fuels were burned, then additional warming over the long-term would remain limited to only a few tenths of a degree.
The letter is also signed by more than 300 concerned citizens, many with doctorate, engineering and other professional titles.
Recently the online Franfurter Rundschau published some comments made by German über-alarmist Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and an advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel, implying that sceptics were hiding in anonymity and that scepticism was anti-scientific, saying:
Most of them [sceptics] operate from the safety of anonymity in the internet. They don’t try at all to do it successfully through a factual debate; rather they attempt to sow scepticism on science being an instrument to explain reality.
Perhaps the open letter will convince Herr Prof Dr Schellnhuber that the sceptics are not as anonymous as he would like to believe. Furthermore when it comes to debate, Schellnhuber employs the same tactic as Al Gore – running and hiding. Still, he is surely welcome to debate the issue at the  ICCC now taking place in Chicago. But don’t expect him to show up. He’s too busy scrambling to keep his science alive in Germany.

"In this age of rapidly melting glaciers, terrifying megafires and ever more puissant hurricanes, of acidifying and rising oceans, it is hard to believe that any further prod to climate action is needed. But the reality is that we continue to live in a business-as-usual world. Our media is filled with enthusiastic announcements about new fossil fuel projects, or the unveiling of the latest fossil-fuelled supercar, as if there’s no relationship between such things and climate change. In Australia, the disconnect among our political leaders on the deadly nature of fossil fuels is particularly breathtaking. Prime minister Scott Morrison continues to sing the praises of coal, while members of the government call for subsidies for coal-fired power plants. A few days ago, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, urged that the nation’s old and polluting coal-fired power plants be allowed to run “at full tilt”. In the past, many of us have tolerated such pronouncements as the utterings of idiots – in the true, original Greek meaning of the word as one interested only in their own business. But the climate crisis has now grown so severe that the actions of the denialists have turned predatory: they are now an immediate threat to our children. Each year the situation becomes more critical. In 2018, global emissions of greenhouse gases rose by 1.7%, while the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere jumped by 3.5 parts per million – the largest ever observed increase. No climate report or warning, no political agreement nor technological innovation has altered the ever-upward trajectory of the pollution. This simple fact forces me to look back on my 20 years of climate activism as a colossal failure. Many climate scientists think we are already so far down the path of destruction that it is impossible to stabilise the global temperature at 1.5℃ above the pre-industrial average without yet to be developed drawdown technologies such as those that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. On current trends, within a decade or so, stabilising at 2℃ will likewise be beyond our grasp. And on the other side of that threshold, nature’s positive feedback loops promise to fling us into a hostile world. By 2100 – just 80 years away – if our trajectory does not change, it is estimated that Earth will be 4℃ warmer than it was before we began burning fossil fuels. That future Earth may have enough resources to support far fewer people than the 7.6 billion it supports today. British scientist James Lovelock has predicted a future human population of just a billion people. Mass deaths are predicted to result from, among other causes, disease outbreaks, air pollution, malnutrition and starvation, heatwaves and suicide. My children, and those of many prominent polluters and climate denialists, will probably live to be part of that grim winnowing – a world that the Alan Joneses and Andrew Bolts of the world have laboured so hard to create. How should Australia’s parents deal with those who labour so joyously to create a world in which a large portion of humanity will perish? As I have become ever more furious at the polluters and denialists, I have come to understand they are threatening my children’s wellbeing as much as anyone who might seek to harm a child. Young people themselves are now mobilising against the danger. Increasingly they’re giving up on words and resorting to actions. Extinction Rebellion is the Anthropocene’s answer to the UK working class Chartists, the US Declaration of Independence and the defenders of the Eureka Stockade. Its declaration states: This is our darkest hour. Humanity finds itself embroiled in an event unprecedented in its history, one which, unless immediately addressed, will catapult us further into the destruction of all we hold dear […] The wilful complicity displayed by our government has shattered meaningful democracy and cast aside the common interest in favour of short-term gain and private profit […] We hereby declare the bonds of the social contract to be null and void. Not yet a year old, Extinction Rebellion has had an enormous impact. In April it shut down six critical locations in London, overwhelmed the police and justice system with 1,000 arrests and forced the British government to become the first nation ever to declare a climate emergency. So unstable is our current societal response that a single young woman, Greta Thunberg, has been able to spark a profoundly powerful global movement. Less than a year ago she went on a one-person school strike. Today school strikes for climate action are a global phenomenon. On Friday in Australia and elsewhere, school principals must decide whether they will allow their students to march in the global climate strike in an effort to save themselves from the climate predators in our midst, or force them to stay and study for a future that will not, on current trends, eventuate. I will be marching with the strikers in Melbourne, and I believe teachers should join their pupils on that day. After all, us older generation should be painfully aware that our efforts have not been enough to protect our children. The new and carefully planned rebellion by the young generation forces us earlier generations of climate activists to re-examine our strategy. Should we continue to use words to try to win the debate? Or should we become climate rebels? Changing the language around climate denialism will, I hope, sharpen our focus as we ponder what comes next.

"It is not quite true that behind every great fortune lies a great crime. Musicians and novelists, for example, can become extremely rich by giving other people pleasure. But it does appear to be universally true that in front of every great fortune lies a great crime. Immense wealth translates automatically into immense environmental impacts, regardless of the intentions of those who possess it. The very wealthy, almost as a matter of definition, are committing ecocide.  A few weeks ago, I received a letter from a worker at a British private airport. “I see things that really shouldn’t be happening in 2019,” he wrote. Every day he sees Global 7000 jets, Gulfstream G650s and even Boeing 737s take off from the airport carrying a single passenger, mostly flying to Russia and the US. The private Boeing 737s, built to take 174 passengers, are filled at the airport with around 25,000 litres of fuel. That’s as much fossil energy as a small African town might use in a year. Where are these single passengers going? Perhaps to visit one of their superhomes, constructed and run at vast environmental cost, or to take a trip on their superyacht, which might burn 500 litres of diesel an hour just ticking over, and which is built and furnished with rare materials extracted at the expense of beautiful places. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised to learn that when Google convened a meeting of the rich and famous at the Verdura resort in Sicily in July to discuss climate breakdown, its delegates arrived in 114 private jets and a fleet of megayachts, and drove around the island in supercars. Even when they mean well, the ultrarich cannot help trashing the living world. A series of research papers shows that income is by far the most important determinant of environmental impact. It doesn’t matter how green you think you are; if you have surplus money, you spend it. The only form of consumption that’s clearly and positively correlated with good environmental intentions is diet: people who see themselves as green tend to eat less meat and more organic vegetables. But attitudes have little bearing on the amount of transport fuel, home energy and other materials you consume. Money conquers all. The disastrous effects of spending power are compounded by the psychological impacts of being wealthy. Plenty of studies show that the richer you are, the less you are able to connect with other people. Wealth suppresses empathy. One paper reveals that drivers in expensive cars are less likely to stop for people using pedestrian crossings than drivers in cheap cars. Another revealed that rich people were less able than poorer people to feel compassion towards children with cancer. Though they are disproportionately responsible for our environmental crises, the rich will be hurt least and last by planetary disaster, while the poor are hurt first and worst. The richer people are, the research suggests, the less such knowledge is likely to trouble them. Another issue is that wealth limits the perspectives of even the best-intentioned people. This week, Bill Gates argued in an interview with the Financial Times that divesting (ditching stocks) from fossil fuels is a waste of time. It would be better, he claimed, to pour money into disruptive new technologies with lower emissions. Of course we need new technologies. But he has missed the crucial point: in seeking to prevent climate breakdown, what counts is not what you do but what you stop doing. It doesn’t matter how many solar panels you install if you don’t simultaneously shut down coal and gas burners. Unless existing fossil fuel plants are retired before the end of their lives, and all exploration and development of new fossil fuel reserves is cancelled, there is little chance of preventing more than 1.5C of global heating. But this requires structural change, which involves political intervention as well as technological innovation: anathema to Silicon Valley billionaires. It demands an acknowledgement that money is not a magic wand that makes all the bad stuff go away. Tomorrow, I’ll be joining the global climate strike, in which adults will stand with the young people whose call to action has resonated around the world. As a freelancer, I’ve been wondering who I’m striking against. Myself? Yes: one aspect of myself, at least. Perhaps the most radical thing we can now do is to limit our material aspirations. The assumption on which governments and economists operate is that everyone strives to maximise their wealth. If we succeed in this task, we inevitably demolish our life support systems. Were the poor to live like the rich, and the rich to live like the oligarchs, we would destroy everything. The continued pursuit of wealth in a world that has enough already (albeit very poorly distributed) is a formula for mass destitution. A meaningful strike in defence of the living world is, in part, a strike against the desire to raise our incomes and accumulate wealth: a desire shaped, more than we are probably aware, by dominant social and economic narratives. I see myself as striking in support of a radical and disturbing concept: enough. Individually and collectively, it is time to decide what “enough” looks like, and how to know when we’ve achieved it. There’s a name for this approach, coined by the Belgian philosopher Ingrid Robeyns: limitarianism. Robeyns argues that there should be an upper limit to the amount of income and wealth a person can amass. Just as we recognise a poverty line, below which no one should fall, we should recognise a riches line, above which no one should rise. This call for a levelling down is perhaps the most blasphemous idea in contemporary discourse. But her arguments are sound. Surplus money allows some people to exercise inordinate power over others: in the workplace; in politics; and above all in the capture, use and destruction of the planet’s natural wealth. If everyone is to flourish, we cannot afford the rich. Nor can we afford our own aspirations, which the culture of wealth maximisation encourages. The grim truth is that the rich are able to live as they do only because others are poor: there is neither the physical nor ecological space for everyone to pursue private luxury. Instead we should strive for private sufficiency, public luxury. Life on Earth depends on moderation. • This article was amended on September 19 to remove an inaccurate reference to the world’s most expensive superyacht. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Krüger of Readers Edition has a post on Germany’s first offshore Alpha Ventus windpark located in the North Sea, 30 miles from shore. Alpha Ventus has 12 5-MW wind generators. The electricity will have to cost 7 – 8  US-cents per kwh just to cover the construction costs. That’s about the price electricty is traded at on German commodity markets. But then you have to add the operating, maintenance and dismantling costs after the expected 20 years of operation. Also the added cost of expanding the electrical grid to accommodate the wind parks has to be added in.
In general windparks cannot compete against conventional power plants. That’s why the German government subsidizes windpark operators and guaratees them 19 US cents per kwh. The higher costs are of course borne by the consumers and industrial customers.
Contribution to “climate protection”. So what is the consumer getting for his money? Using IPCC data and forcings, Krüger calculated how much Alpha Ventus will help to reduce the global temperature:
Without the assumed positive feedbacks: 0.000001°C,  with the assumed positive feedbacks 0.000005°C.
That’s right – a whopping few millionths of a degree! Boy can you feel it already?
Protest: The offshore windparks also kill a considerable number of migratory birds, and so environmentalists are already protesting the planned construction of 11 additional offshore parks. Indeed a Folks’ Initiative protest against wind energy is taking place in Berlin this coming weekend: http://www.volksinitiativewindrad.de/.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his latest video , Joe Bastardi gives his latest hurricane forecast.
Joe compares 2010 with 1950, a year the hurricane season started off late, but then did so with a vengeance. It produced 8 major hurricanes in 6 weeks. He sees 2010 having very similar conditions, and so he predicts the same pattern as 1950.
Joe also explains his theory that with global warming, the tendency will be less tropical storm activity because there will be less of a need to redistribute heat and pressure to the higher latitudes. That’s what hurricanes do.
So far for this year, Joe says:
Yet, we’ve had globally the weakest start to a hurricane season, Pacific basin and Atlantic basin, through the month of August so far. It’s just astounding how quiet it’s been – so far.
Joe doesn’t expect it to stay quiet. He’s telling you to fasten your seatbelt, because we are very likely in for some rough riding.

The press frets: Where are the hurricanes?

Meanwhile the generally sceptic Austrian online Die Presse has a story called Weather: Were Are The Hurricanes?  (Notice how when the hurricanes don’t show up, it’s called “weather”. Die Presse quotes the NOAA:
There are no tropical cyclones at this time.
What can the alarmist media do without the promised hurricanes and the calamity they deliver? Die Presse writes:
They should have arrived a long time ago. The hurricane season goes from June 1 until November 30, and the fanfare from the US press was shriller than usual back in May: It’s the five-year anniversary of Katrina, the storm that devastated New Orleans. ‘The 2010 hurricane season could be a monster, warned Time on May 26.
Die Presse explains that weak hurricane activity last year was due to the El Nino blocking effect. But this year La Nina is developing, and so the coast is clear for the hurricane parade. But the media so far has fretted:
Now El Niño is out of the way, La Niña rules and clears the path for hurricanes. First came one, Alex, in June, followed by Bonnie in July, which did not even reach hurricane status, and Colin in early August, which also amounted to nothing.
But the media ought not fret too much. If Joe is right, the chasers of destruction in the media will get plenty to hyperventilate about soon enough. Then they’ll be categorising hurricanes under “climate”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYou’ll recall that WUWT reported here  a couple days ago on NASA’s warnings of “huge space storms” causing devastation in 2013 or so.  Well, one leading Russian scientist has something to say about it.The German edition of the online Russian RIA Novosti has a report today called: World Catastrophe in 2013? Russian Solar Scientist Is Sceptical. Astrophysicist Sergei Bogatchov told RIA Novosti yesterday:
Today there exists no scientific basis that allows the condition of the earth and the sun to be predicted over such a time period.
Mr. Bogatchov researches at the Laboratory for Solar X-Ray Astronomy at the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Scientists indeed expect a peak in solar activity in 2013, but nobody can say how strong it’s going to be.
Moreover RIA Novosti reports,
The current solar slumber extending to 2013 also cannot be excluded.
And adds background info for its readers:
In the past weeks the media quoted the Head of NASA’s Heliophysics Division, Richard Fisher, that unprecedented solar eruptions are to be expected. That could mean disruptions in satellites, shutdowns in navigation systems and power grids.
So there you have it. A leading Russian scientist is scratching his head wondering how NASA scientists could possibly come up with such a prognosis.
My guess is probably the same way they make their climate projections: Conjure up a catastrophe scenario, insist it withstands rigorous review, get the media and idiot politicians to believe it, and then get more funding!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Klimazwiebel blog run by Prof. Hans von Storch brings our attention to a newly released Dutch report on the IPCC. The report is published by the Rathenau Institute and is titled:
Room for Climate Debate:
Perspectives on the interaction between climate politics, science and
the media,
It is written by Jeroen van der Sluijs, Rinie van Est and Monique Riphagen. It’s lengthy, but the abstract sums it up. You can read the abstract in full at von Storch’s site.

The Rathenau report looks at the interaction of science and politics. It concludes that politics has come to rely on science to tell it what to do. More science means more knowledge, and thus less uncertainty. The problem, however, is that this approach leaves little space for debate. As a result, the political debate moves to science, which in turn leads to politicised science.
The authors recommend more dissent be allowed in the process, which will certainly not be welcome by those who have hijacked the scientific process for the purpose of achieving political aims.
In the abstract the authors write:
To depoliticise science and offer more room for the political debate, more space should be given to dissent opinions, sceptic as well as alarmistic. More openness about uncertainties in scientific knowledge and more room for these dissent scientific views in the IPCC reports would restore the political debate and enhance societies’ capacity to deal with this uncertainty.
Keep in mind that the InterAcademy Council will publish its evaluation of the IPCC this month.  Climate science has come under heavy fire since Climategate and the discovery of mistakes, gaffes and alarmist exaggerations in the last IPCC report.
The IPCC process is broken, and needs to be overhauled. Will the InterAcademy Counciltake the Rathenau Institute’s advice and allow dissent, or will it be just another corrupt whitewash?
Both, politics and science can work only if they are open to dissenting view and opinions. Anything else is authoritarian.

"Why are you publishing this book now?I still feel that the way that we talk about climate change is too compartmentalised, too siloed from the other crises we face. A really strong theme running through the book is the links between it and the crisis of rising white supremacy, the various forms of nationalism and the fact that so many people are being forced from their homelands, and the war that is waged on our attention spans. These are intersecting and interconnecting crises and so the solutions have to be as well. The book collects essays from the last decade, have you changed your mind about anything?When I look back, I don’t think I placed enough emphasis on the challenge climate change poses to the left. It’s more obvious the way the climate crisis challenges a rightwing dominant worldview, and the cult of serious centrism that never wants to do anything big, that’s always looking to split the difference. But this is also a challenge to a left worldview that is essentially only interested in redistributing the spoils of extractivism [the process of extracting natural resources from the earth] and not reckoning with the limits of endless consumption.  What’s stopping the left doing this?In a North American context, it’s the greatest taboo of all to actually admit that there are going to be limits. You see that in the way Fox News has gone after the Green New Deal – they are coming after your hamburgers! It cuts to the heart of the American dream – every generation gets more than the last, there is always a new frontier to expand to, the whole idea of settler colonial nations like ours. When somebody comes along and says, actually, there are limits, we’ve got some tough decisions, we need to figure out how to manage what’s left, we’ve got to share equitably – it is a psychic attack. And so the response [on the left] has been to avoid, and say no, no, we’re not coming to take away your stuff, there are going to be all kinds of benefits. And there are going to be benefits: we’ll have more livable cities, we’ll have less polluted air, we’ll spend less time stuck in traffic, we can design happier, richer lives in so many ways. But we are going to have to contract on the endless, disposable consumption side. Hundreds of newsrooms around the world are banding together this week to commit their pages and air time to what may be the most consequential story of our time. As world leaders descend on New York for the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September  – and millions of activists prepare for a global climate strike on 20 September – the media partnership Covering Climate Now is launching its first large-scale collaboration to increase climate coverage in the global media and focus public attention on this emergency. The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, which was founded earlier this year by the Columbia Journalism Review  and the Nation. The partnership currently includes 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people. The network represents every corner of the media including TV networks (CBS News, Al Jazeera), newspapers (El País, the Toronto Star), digital players (BuzzFeed, HuffPost, Vox), wire services (Getty Images, Bloomberg), magazines (Nature, Science), and dozens of podcasts, local publishers, radio and TV stations. You can learn more about the initiative here. Do you feel encouraged by talk of the Green New Deal?I feel a tremendous excitement and a sense of relief, that we are finally talking about solutions on the scale of the crisis we face. That we’re not talking about a little carbon tax or a cap and trade scheme as a silver bullet. We’re talking about transforming our economy. This system is failing the majority of people anyway, which is why we’re in this period of such profound political destabilisation – that is giving us the Trumps and the Brexits, and all of these strongman leaders – so why don’t we figure out how to change everything from bottom to top, and do it in a way that addresses all of these other crises at the same time? There is every chance we will miss the mark, but every fraction of a degree warming that we are able to hold off is a victory and every policy that we are able to win that makes our societies more humane, the more we will weather the inevitable shocks and storms to come without slipping into barbarism. Because what really terrifies me is what we are seeing at our borders in Europe and North America and Australia – I don’t think it’s coincidental that the settler colonial states and the countries that are the engines of that colonialism are at the forefront of this. We are seeing the beginnings of the era of climate barbarism. We saw it in Christchurch, we saw it in El Paso, where you have this marrying of white supremacist violence with vicious anti-immigrant racism. That is one of the most chilling sections of your book: I think that’s a link a lot of people haven’t made.This pattern has been clear for a while. White supremacy emerged not just because people felt like thinking up ideas that were going to get a lot of people killed but because it was useful to protect barbaric but highly profitable actions. The age of scientific racism begins alongside the transatlantic slave trade, it is a rationale for that brutality. If we are going to respond to climate change by fortressing our borders, then of course the theories that would justify that, that create these hierarchies of humanity, will come surging back. There have been signs of that for years, but it is getting harder to deny because you have killers who are screaming it from the rooftops. One criticism you hear about the environment movement is that it is dominated by white people. How do you address that?When you have a movement that is overwhelmingly representative of the most privileged sector of society then the approach is going to be much more fearful of change, because people who have a lot to lose tend to be more fearful of change, whereas people who have a lot to gain will tend to fight harder for it. That’s the big benefit of having an approach to climate change that links it to those so called bread and butter issues: how are we going to get better paid jobs, affordable housing, a way for people to take care of their families? I have had many conversations with environmentalists over the years where they seem really to believe that by linking fighting climate change with fighting poverty, or fighting for racial justice, it’s going to make the fight harder. We have to get out of this “my crisis is bigger than your crisis: first we save the planet and then we fight poverty and racism, and violence against women”. That doesn’t work. That alienates the people who would fight hardest for change. This debate has shifted a huge amount in the US because of the leadership of the climate justice movement and because it is congresswomen of colour who are championing the Green New Deal. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib come from communities that have gotten such a raw deal under the years of neoliberalism and longer, and are determined to represent, truly represent, the interests of those communities. They’re not afraid of deep change because their communities desperately need it. In the book, you write: “The hard truth is that the answer to the question ‘What can I, as an individual, do to stop climate change?’ is: nothing.” Do you still believe that?In terms of the carbon, the individual decisions that we make are not going to add up to anything like the kind of scale of change that we need. And I do believe that the fact that for so many people it’s so much more comfortable to talk about our own personal consumption, than to talk about systemic change, is a product of neoliberalism, that we have been trained to see ourselves as consumers first. To me that’s the benefit of bringing up these historical analogies, like the New Deal or the Marshall Plan – it brings our minds back to a time when we were able to think of change on that scale. Because we’ve been trained to think very small. It is incredibly significant that Greta Thunberg has turned her life into a living emergency. Yes, she set sail for the UN climate summit in New York on a zero carbon yacht ...Exactly. But this isn’t about what Greta is doing as an individual. It’s about what Greta is broadcasting in the choices that she makes as an activist, and I absolutely respect that. I think it’s magnificent. She is using the power that she has to broadcast that this is an emergency, and trying to inspire politicians to treat it as an emergency. I don’t think anybody is exempt from scrutinising their own decisions and behaviours but I think it is possible to overemphasise the individual choices. I have made a choice – and this has been true since I wrote No Logo, and I started getting these “what should I buy, where should I shop, what are the ethical clothes?” questions. My answer continues to be that I am not a lifestyle adviser, I am not anyone’s shopping guru, and I make these decisions in my own life but I’m under no illusion that these decisions are going to make the difference. Some people are choosing to go on birth strikes. What do you think about that?I’m happy these discussions are coming into the public domain as opposed to being furtive issues we’re afraid to talk about. It’s been very isolating for people. It certainly was for me. One of the reasons I waited as long as I did to try and get pregnant, and I would say this to my partner all the time – what, you want to have a Mad Max water warrior fighting with their friends for food and water? It wasn’t until I was part of the climate justice movement and I could see a path forward that I could even imagine having a kid. But I would never tell anybody how to answer this most intimate of questions. As a feminist who knows the brutal history of forced sterilisation and the ways in which women’s bodies become battle zones when policymakers decide that they are going to try and control population, I think that the idea that there are regulatory solutions when it comes to whether or not to have kids is catastrophically ahistorical. We need to be struggling with our climate grief together and our climate fears together, through whatever decision we decide to make, but the discussion we need to have is how do we build a world so that those kids can have thriving, zero-carbon lives? Over the summer, you encouraged people to read Richard Powers’s novel, The Overstory. Why?It’s been incredibly important to me and I’m happy that so many people have written to me since. What Powers is writing about trees: that trees live in communities and are in communication, and plan and react together, and we’ve been completely wrong in the way we conceptualise them. It’s the same conversation we’re having about whether we are going to solve this as individuals or whether we are going to save the collective organism. It’s also rare, in good fiction, to valorise activism, to treat it with real respect, failures and all, to acknowledge the heroism of the people who put their bodies on the line. I thought Powers did that in a really extraordinary way. What are you views on what Extinction Rebellion has achieved?One thing they have done so well is break us out of this classic campaign model we have been in for a long time, where you tell someone something scary, you ask them to click on something to do something about it, you skip out the whole phase where we need to grieve together and feel together and process what it is that we just saw. Because what I hear a lot from people is, ok, maybe those people back in the 1930s or 40s could organise neighbourhood by neighbourhood or workplace by workplace but we can’t. We believe we’ve been so downgraded as a species that we are incapable of that. The only thing that is going to change that belief is getting face to face, in community, having experiences, off our screens, with one another on the streets and in nature, and winning some things and feeling that power. You talk about stamina in the book. How do you keep going? Do you feel hopeful?I have complicated feelings about the hope question. Not a day goes by that I don’t have a moment of sheer panic, raw terror, complete conviction that we are doomed, and then I do pull myself out of it. I’m renewed by this new generation that is so determined, so forceful. I’m inspired by the willingness to engage in electoral politics, because my generation, when we were in our 20s and 30s, there was so much suspicion around getting our hands dirty with electoral politics that we lost a lot of opportunities. What gives me the most hope right now is that we’ve finally got the vision for what we want instead, or at least the first rough draft of it. This is the first time this has happened in my lifetime. And also, I did decide to have kids. I have a seven year old who is so completely obsessed and in love with the natural world. When I think about him, after we’ve spent an entire summer talking about the role of salmon in feeding the forests where he was born in British Columbia, and how they are linked to the health of the trees and the soil and the bears and the orcas and this entire magnificent ecosystem, and I think about what it would be like to have to tell him that there are no more salmon, it kills me. So that motivates me. And slays me. • Naomi Klein will be in conversation with Katharine Viner at a Guardian Live event on 15 October."
"This Friday’s school strike, which adults around the world have been asked to join, is the largest mobilisation yet attempted by the youth climate movement launched last year by the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. As such, it is an event of international significance. History shows not only that social change is possible, even when the interests ranged against it are formidable, but that peaceful protest is among the most effective ways to bring it about. The campaigns against slavery, for female suffrage and for workers’ and civil rights, as well as the independence movements of former colonies including India, all harnessed new forms of civic participation and activism to the cause of progress. Movements on behalf of people who lack voting rights, of course, have little choice but to try to exercise influence outside the ballot box. As adults in democracies, we have become used to making our political choices in elections, with only a small minority in most countries actively involved in parties or campaigning. That does not mean political action should end there. And except for 16- and 17-year-olds in a handful of countries, children cannot vote. If they want their voices to be heard they must seek other means – such as a school strike. Some of the young people demonstrating on Friday will have been influenced by adults. But teenagers, who are typically rebellious and open to new ideas, have been important in social movements before. No one should be surprised if young people are more alarmed than their grandparents about effects that are predicted to become more severe in 20 or 30 years’ time. Hundreds of newsrooms around the world are banding together this week to commit their pages and air time to what may be the most consequential story of our time. As world leaders descend on New York for the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September  – and millions of activists prepare for a global climate strike on 20 September – the media partnership Covering Climate Now is launching its first large-scale collaboration to increase climate coverage in the global media and focus public attention on this emergency.

You can learn more about the initiative here. It is the simplicity of the movement’s message, as well as the youth and determination of the protesters, that has made them unignorable. Less than a year ago, the world’s leading climate scientists issued a warning that we are running out of time to avert the worst effects of global heating, at a meeting at which some scientists were reported to be in tears. Temperatures are continuing to rise and the effects are already punishing, particularly in poorer parts of the world. But increases of more than 1.5 degrees celsius would lead, scientists warn, to food scarcity and water stress for hundreds of millions more people. Heat-related deaths, forest fires and mass displacements by flooding become far more likely in this scenario, while for species including coral the consequence would be extinction. Yet despite these dire warnings and the attempts at decarbonisation overseen since 1988 by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world is failing. Carbon emissions in 2018 reached a record high of 37.1bn tonnes. There has been some progress, measurable in pledges by governments and notably a decade of emissions cuts in the EU. The profile of green issues is higher, the cost of renewables is falling fast and public opinion in many countries is shifting. But our path is taking us towards a painful and dangerous future. The climate strikers demand that the world faces these facts. Their aim is to force us to confront a problem that, for far too long, we have found it convenient to ignore. When Greta Thunberg and other young campaigners met US legislators this week, it was to assert their right to a livable future. In a short film with George Monbiot, also this week, she was more specific, advocating the protection and restoration of ecosystems as a natural climate solution. A reckoning is overdue with those who, seeking to avoid the transition to clean energy, misled the public. Without the lost decades of inaction and denial, global heating need never have become the emergency it now is. Many politicians as well as fossil fuel industry executives and lobbyists are deeply culpable. But Friday is an opportunity to take action – as the Guardian is doing by declaring a climate emergency.  Environmental campaigners, scientists and others deserve praise for their climate work over many decades. That we are nowhere near where we should be, in spite of their efforts and knowledge, is a cause for anger. The freshness and seriousness of the school strike movement is a reason to hope."
"With just under 7,000 GP surgeries in England seeing millions of patients each week, family doctors can also have a dramatic impact on reducing emissions in the NHS. According to the NHS Sustainable Development Unit, pharmaceuticals are the biggest cause of emissions in primary care and make up 18% of the NHS’s total emissions. Reducing unnecessary prescriptions and single-use plastic blister packs for small medicines will make a big difference, as well as cutting costs, says Karen Creffield, practice manager at Frome medical practice, in Somerset, which is trying to cut its carbon footprint.  The practice has identified a number of areas where it hopes to “de-prescribe”: opioid reduction, hypnotics and antidepressants and reviewing patients taking seven or more medications. It is also promoting inhaler recycling and switching to more sustainable inhalers. Most asthma sufferers use metered dose inhalers, which use hydrofluorocarbons to propel the medicine into the airways. But these gases are much more potent than CO2. They make up 70% of inhalers prescribed by the NHS, but only 10% in Sweden. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence wants doctors to follow the Swedes’ example and consider prescribing dry-powder inhalers that provide the same medicines without the greenhouse gas emissions instead. Simply switching to lower carbon inhalers would reduce total emissions by 4%, according to the NHS long-term plan. The Royal College of GPs funds a green impact for health toolkit to help practices reduce their environmental footprint. “We want to promote actions in our practices for ourselves and our patients that are good for youthem and good for the planet,” says Terry Kemple, the former RCGP president and sustainability lead. In Frome all the practice staff are asked about their contribution towards sustainability in their appraisals, while a green impact policy emphasises the importance of turning off lights and electrical equipment. Its procurement policy prioritises working with suppliers who are committed to reducing their emissions. “All our tea and coffee is fair trade, we only use local companies for catering who are committed to locally sourced, fair trade and organic produce (where possible), says Creffield. “This includes healthy snacks at meetings (avoiding palm oil for example).” By sending more text messages to patients instead of letters, it has cut paper use significantly. Staff are encouraged to walk or cycle to work and the practice has two electric vehicle charging points."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is in response to some good questions/points by reader Actually Thoughtful in my previous post.
Indeed environmental restrictions have made a contribution in cleaning up the environment. But technology, awareness and the overall continued path of progress have also made major contributions. And keep in mind that placing stifling regulation on industries at home often prompts them to move to countries where they are allowed to produce more pollution, and more cheaply. So the net result is MORE pollution, not less, and lost jobs. I guess we could impose rigid environemntal regulations on poor coutries like China, India, Mexico etc., but if you’re honest you have to agree that they just aren’t that far yet.
This reminds me a little of the bio-fuels debacle. Sure biofuels are renewable and can cut fossil fuel CO2, but we have seen the far greater unintended catastrophic consequence on food prices and accelerated deforestation. This is one example of the importance of thinking things through first.  Sending the masses and policy makers into an uncontrolled, panicked stampede won’t work. Best is to explain it over time, and step by step we’ll get there in an orderly way. Hard working people are capable of understanding.
On feeding the hungry, huge progress has been made thanks to great strides in agricultural technology, expansion of free market principles throughout the globe, improved transportation and logistics, refrigeration and information management. Adam’s Smith’s invisible hand has played a huge role. Indeed the environment does best in developed, free-market oriented countries.

"People in Denmark will be able to “plant trees” from the comfort of their sofa in what is believed to be the world’s first TV fundraiser for forests. On Saturday the national broadcaster TV2 will air Denmark Plants Trees, a two-and-a-half hour live benefit event which will ask viewers to donate funds to plant 1m trees across the country.  Planting trees helps to reduce levels of CO2 and is seen as a central part of the climate crisis solution. The telethon will take place in the middle of Gisselfeld Klosters Skove forest with the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, planting one of the first trees. Martin Sundstrøm, a producer for the event, said viewers would be encouraged to raise 20m kroner (£2.4m) to help the Danish Society for Nature Conservation plant 1m trees, while 10% of the money raised would go to WWF to help save tropical forests. Nicolai Hansson, the editor of TV2, said: “We know we won’t solve the climate crisis just by planting trees, but hopefully people will feel that it’s something tangible that they can be an active part of and enjoy afterwards when they visit the new forests and watch them grow and flourish.” Those who donate to the cause will become a member of a new “folk forests” initiative, which will be created close to Danish cities. The project has 600 hectares (1482 acres) of land ready, and more will be added in the future. “All potential areas have been evaluated and prioritised based on suitability by forest experts from the Danish Society for Nature Conservation,” Sundstrøm said. “After Saturday there will be a number of tree planting events all over Denmark. The first events will be this autumn and then in spring 2020 a larger number of events will take place depending on how much we raise. If we raise the funds to plant one million trees we expect around 30 events.” Sundstrøm said he hoped to see Denmark Plants Trees lead to similar events in other countries. “I hope events like this might spread to other countries in order to engage the public, like Live Aid did in 1985.” Sara Lom, CEO of the UK’s Tree Council charity, said she would welcome a tree planting telethon in the UK. “To plant enough trees to help tackle climate change we will need everyone to get involved – and fast,” said Lom. “A national TV telethon – or a tree-athon if you will – would be a wonderful way of engaging people around the country to raise money to plant and care for more trees.”"
"An area of forest the size of the UK is being lost every year around the world, the vast majority of it tropical rainforest, with dire effects on the climate emergency and wildlife. The rate of loss has reached 26m hectares (64m acres) a year, a report has found, having grown rapidly in the past five years despite pledges made by governments in 2014 to reverse deforestation and restore trees. Charlotte Streck, a co-founder and the director of Climate Focus, the thinktank behind the report, said: “We need to keep our trees and we need to restore our forests. Deforestation has accelerated, despite the pledges that have been made.” The New York declaration on forests was signed at the UN in 2014, requiring countries to halve deforestation by 2020 and restore 150m hectares of deforested or degraded forest land. But the rate of tree cover loss has gone up by 43% since the declaration was adopted, while the most valuable and irreplaceable tropical primary forests have been cut down at a rate of 4.3m hectares a year. The ultimate goal of the declaration, to halt deforestation by 2030 – potentially saving as much carbon as taking all the world’s cars off the roads – now looks further away than when the commitment was made. In Latin America, south-east Asia, and Africa – the major tropical forest regions – the annual rate of tree cover loss increased markedly between 2014 and 2018, compared with 2001 to 2013. While the greatest losses by volume were in tropical Latin America, the greatest rate of increase was in Africa, where deforestation rates doubled from less than 2m hectares a year to more than 4m. The report uses data up to 2018 in most cases, so the figures do not include the impact of the most recent burning in the Amazon. The report’s authors note that in June, deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon rose by 88% compared with the same month last year. Streck warned the recent fires were a particular concern because, whereas in previous decades when the humid nature of the rainforest made it hard to burn, with the lush vegetation acting as an effective firebreak, global heating in recent years has dried out parts of the forest and made it easier to combust. “The fires are coming at the beginning of the dry season, which is when you would have expected the forests to be at their wettest and hardest to burn,” she said. “This shows we could be entering into a feedback loop.” Feedback loops are feared by climate scientists because they amplify the effects of heating. In the case of forests, climate change dries out trees, making them more flammable, and increasing temperatures so they burn more easily, which then contributes more carbon dioxide, which fuels heating. Keeping existing forests standing, particularly in tropical regions, and restoring wooded areas that have been damaged, has long been recognised as one of the cheapest ways of tackling the climate crisis. The cost of preserving key forests globally has been estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars a year, compared with the trillions needed to shift to low-carbon infrastructure. Jo House, a reader in environmental science and policy at the University of Bristol, said: “Deforestation, mostly for agriculture, contributes around a third of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. At the same time, forests naturally take up around a third of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. “This natural sink provided by forests is at risk from the duel compounding threats of further deforestation and future climate change. The continued loss of primary forests, at ever-increasing rates, despite their incalculable value and irreplaceability, is both shocking and tragic.” One of the difficulties highlighted by the report is that of gaining private sector support and investment for keeping forests standing. While there are clear economic benefits to cutting down forests, in the form of timber production and expanded agriculture, there are few investments being made in keeping existing forests healthy. Another complicating factor is that many governments offer subsidies to agriculture, which provide perverse incentives for deforestation. The report from a coalition of 25 organisations is being presented in New York before a series of events focusing on the climate crisis in the run-up to the UN secretary general’s summit later this month. At the meeting, world leaders are expected to come up with new proposals for tackling the climate emergency. But Streck said the failure to meet the pledges made five years ago undercut the value of such promises if they were not backed up with finance, detailed plans and on-the-ground implementation. “We don’t need more important guys standing up making pledges,” she said. “We need to go beyond declarations. Implementation is complicated, but it’s what we need.” There have been some bright spots. The rate of loss of primary forest in Indonesia slowed by nearly one-third between 2017 and 2018. Palm oil plantations in the country are a major cause of deforestation, but companies and the government have come under pressure from consumers and aid donors. Wetter weather that reduced forest fires also helped. While some countries have embarked on tree-planting schemes, notably in Ethiopia, but also in Mexico and El Salvador, these have been far outweighed by the loss of existing forests. Tree planting does not compensate for the loss of standing forests, because established growth yields benefits beyond carbon uptake, through the whole ecosystem. “It can take centuries for forests to recover their full carbon-absorbing and weather-regulating capabilities,” Streck said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Die Zeit reports here that a Canadian court has ruled in favour of the Inuit Indians, forbidding a planned Arctic expedition by Germany’s alarmist Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in the Lancaster Sound. Reports show that the German expedition may have included Arctic oil and gas exploration.
The AWI’s Polarstern research vessel was ordered to pack up and leave. Now it’s off the coast of Greenland.
Die Zeit writes:
A historic victory will be celebrated in Nunavut. This is the first time a Canadian court recognises the cultural and territorial rights of the Inuits, says a pleased Okalik Eegeesiak, President of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association in Canada.
What makes the story interesting is that the German scientists were not only getting ready to conduct sea ice and water studies, but appear to have been commissioned to conduct oil and gas exploration.

Works were planned to study the rotation of Greenland plates in the Paleocene and Eocene, 40 to 60 million years ago, says Die Zeit.
Die Zeit writes that the fine print in the project description submitted to Canadian authorities in Ottawa for approval (which was granted) included investigating the potential for single sediment basins for the formation of hydrocarbons. 
Hydrocarbons?

Oops! Was the Alfred Wegener Institute getting ready to conduct oil and gas exploration work on behalf of Canada and Germany under the guise of Arctic research? They all deny it.
The Polarstern planned to use air gun blasts for taking seismic readings of the seabed. The Inuit saw this opening, and exploited it, claiming that blasts would drive the seals and Arctic wildlife away. They took it  to court, and won.
Die Zeit also writes that this one particular expedition was not overseen by the Alfred Wegener Institute, as is usually the case, but by the German Ministry for Geosciences and Natural Resources. This ministry is a subordinate of the Ministry of Economics and is responsible for securing the supply of natural resources to Germany.
Hmmm. And all this time I thought these scientists were out there measuring the ice. C’mon, just put 2 and 2 together.
For the German research team, which was in the Baffin Bay getting ready to start its studies when the ruling was made, it’s the first time in 28 years that it has been forbidden to conduct research there. Last year the Inuits had protested a Polarstern expedition, but were unsuccessful.
Sure the ruling is a blow for Arctic oil exploration, but it’s not like we were ever going to get it anyway. The Arctic ice is coming back.
At least now we’re pretty sure what it’s really all about for the goody-too-green Germans and Canadians – oil!

Dirk Maxeiner brings up a piece appearing in the German online Frankfurter Rundschau titled: Campaign of Lies McCarthy Style Click here!
The piece describes how more than 250 scientists, among them 11 Nobel Prize recipients, have expressed their outrage in a letter published in Science claiming they’ve been the targets of McCarthy-like attacks. The Frankfurter Rundschau says the attacks are coming from “Konservative Think-Tanks” and “Republikaner”, among them the Heartland Institute, and James Inhofe, all designed to “torpedo the urgently needed climate protection measures”, and blah blah blah.
The tone of the piece of course is that sceptics are bad and the warmists are good. The piece also heavily bemoans the rapidly eroding public concerns of AGW as an issue, and asks: Who’s behind all that irresponsible scepticism?
Prof Hans Joachim Scellnhuber, an IPCC lead author, explains it for them. Here’s the text in German, then followed by the translation in English:

Der Potsdamer Klimaforscher Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Mitunterzeichner des Science-Briefs, hält den Einfluss der Skeptiker in Deutschland für geringer als in den USA. Es handele sich dabei um sehr unterschiedliche Gruppen, sagte der Präsident des Instituts für Klimafolgen-Forschung der FR. Die meisten operierten ‘aus der sicheren Anonymität des Internets heraus. Sie versuchen erst gar nicht, bei einer sachlichen Debatte erfolgreich zu sein, sondern vielmehr grundsätzliche Zweifel an der Wissenschaft als Instrument der Wirklichkeitserklärung zu säen.” Damit fänden sie große Sympathie “bei vielen antiaufklärerischen Kräften’.
In English:
Potsdam climate researcher Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, a signatory of the Science Letter, thinks the sceptics in Germany have less influence than in the USA. They involve very different groups, the Director of the Institute for Climate Impact Research told the Frankfurter Rundschau. Most of them ‘operate from the safety of anonymity in the internet. They don’t try at all to do it successfully through a factual debate; rather they attempt to sow scepticism on science being an instrument to explain reality.’  This is how they gain much sympathy ‘from the many forces of anti-science’.
In Schellnhuber’s world, scepticism is anti-science. And if you doubt their science, then you are anti-science.
Oh, by the way, let’s not forget that reality and science for them are doctored up iStock polar bear photos and manipulated temperature curves. And who are the ones who keep running and hiding from debate?
What about the polar bear photo in the Frankfurter Rundschau piece? The caption reads: “Polar bears searching for food”. But at least that photo, as far as I can tell, hasn’t been doctored.

"In 1991, 17-year-old Alex Lockwood was flipping through the Guardian Weekend magazine in his family’s car, en route to a family Sunday roast, when he spotted an image that changed his life. A harpooned whale, its body bloodied and lifeless, drew him to a feature about its killing. “That picture just shook me; it seemed so wrong. When I got to my nan’s house it hit me that the roast on the table was an animal that had also been killed.” He became vegetarian, then vegan, and nearly three decades later is one of the founding members of Extinction Rebellion’s new sister organisation, Animal Rebellion, which formed in June and plans to blockade London’s Smithfield Market – Britain’s largest meat distribution market – in October.  For almost a year Extinction Rebellion has made the headlines with its use of civil disobedience to pressure governments and corporations to act on the climate crisis, prompting MPs to pass a motion declaring a climate emergency in May. Inspired by its success, Animal Rebellion has set its sights on making Britain’s food system plant-based. While the group believes the meat and dairy industry is inherently cruel, the focus is predominantly on the environmental arguments. Lockwood, now a senior lecturer focusing on vegan and environmental issues at the University of Sunderland, says: “We can’t fix the climate emergency without ending the animal agriculture industry.” Veganism as a solution to the climate crisis has become a key discussion point in recent months. Amid record-breaking temperatures over the summer, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) proposed a major shift towards plant-based diets, warning that it will be impossible to avert climate catastrophe by reducing carbon emissions from manufacturing, power plants and transport alone. As thousands of fires blazed in the Amazon rainforest in August – many of them started to clear land for cattle rearing – and released huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, calls for boycotts of beef and other animal products grew louder. Animal agriculture accounts for 14.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, more than all transportation combined. Animal Rebellion wants everyone to go vegan – but, like Extinction Rebellion, its main goal is system change rather than telling individuals to change habits. Tomorrow about 50 activists from the group plan to stage a “reforestation” protest in Parliament Square: armed with spades, they aim to plant a two-metre-high walnut tree there, as well as dozens of seedlings, though they aren’t sure how far they will get before police make arrests. “We’re doing this because we need the government to act to stop deforestation,” says Simone Scampoli, Animal Rebellion’s action team coordinator. “We’ve all seen images of the Amazon on fire, but deforestation is happening all over the world to rear animals and grow crops to feed them. We know trees are essential for absorbing the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming.” Tomorrow’s protest is also a practice run of civil disobedience for the Smithfield Market blockade, which will be part of Extinction Rebellion’s next “movement of movements”, International Rebellion, encompassing other groups, starting 7 October. About 2,000 volunteers are signed up to take part in the blockade, set to begin with a training session at an undisclosed location, before they march to the market ahead of its opening for business at about 11pm. Protesters will camp in front of the market overnight and aim to hold on to the site for two weeks, blocking vans and lorries from entering. “It’s going to be lively and joyous, with singing, dancing, a boat, lots of fruit and veg stalls, a festival atmosphere,” Lockwood says. “We want to turn Smithfield Market into Britain’s most vibrant and colourful fruit and vegetable market.” Animal Rebellion says it has received messages on social media threatening violence if they go ahead with the protest. “We’re a peaceful, non-violent group and we’re all quite scared about that,” Lockwood admits. “We don’t want to cause trouble or hurt people’s livelihoods. But Smithfield is the symbolic seat of the UK meat industry, which is driving climate change, and if we carry on our current trajectory there won’t be any jobs left.” To many, Animal Rebellion’s goal of ending animal agriculture may seem unthinkable – much of the current debate revolves around reducing meat and dairy rather than cutting it completely. Commenting on Animal Rebellion’s planned protest, a spokesperson for the National Farmers Union said: “Farmers take the issue of climate change extremely seriously, which is why we have set our own target to be net zero by 2040. We believe British livestock has a crucial role to play in achieving our ambition. Our extensive grass-fed system means British farmers produce some of the most climate-friendly meat in the world. It is already 2.5 times more efficient than the global average.” Lockwood says that the 2040 goal is too late and relies on technology that has not yet been developed. Also commenting on the protest, James Tumbridge, chairman of the City of London Corporation’s markets committee, which includes Smithfield Market, said: “We will work positively with any protesters to allow peaceful demonstration, but our first aim must be the uninterrupted safe operation of the market. The intended protest is potentially very damaging to the workers at Smithfield Market. The men and women who work there are vital to feeding London, and we have a duty to protect their livelihoods and the food supply.”Animal Rebellion has been trying to engage Smithfield Market in dialogue, Lockwood says. “We recognise that butchers and meat industry workers have a deep pride in feeding the nation,” he explains. “We want them to carry on feeding people, but with plant-based food, in a way that’s sustainable and just.” Who are Animal Rebellion? Founded by around 12 people in June, including Dr Alex Lockwood (44), Dan Kidby, animal rights activist and the core founder of Animal Think Tank, Dilan Fernando, a 25-year-old from Australia who left his banking job to focus on organising social movements, and Esther Salomon (19), who has deferred starting her politics degree at Edinburgh University to work for Animal Rebellion full-time. How big is the group? Around 100 organisers, with 2,000 volunteers signed up for the Smithfield protest next month. What are its aims? To get the government to tell the truth about the climate emergency, reduce greenhouse gases to net zero by 2025, and set up a citizens’ assembly. Also to start a debate on switching to a plant-based food system."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is global warming, says the NOAA
Remember all those reports about how snow in the wintertime would be so seldom that it would be exciting, permafrost would melt, and palm trees possibly spreading to northern Europe? This all due to AGW. Well, according to the prominent online Sueddeutsche Zeitung (South German News), there’s been some, errr, adjustments to climate models, or something. Forget all them warming scenarios. The Suddeutsche Zeitung reports today the following:
Climate change could lead to especially cold winters to precisely large industrial nations in Europe, North America and Asia. The cause of all this is the irreversible disappearance of Arctic ice, says James Overland of the American weather adminstration NOAA.
and Overland is quoted as saying:
Cold and snowy winters will become more the rule than the exception.
Overland made these comments last Friday at a conference at the end of the International Polar Year in Oslo. Last winter was just a taste of what could possibly happen in Europe and in the USA.
Overland says that a warmer Arctic polar region leads to the development of stable cold highs in the north, which in turn pump cold Arctic air down to the middle latitudes, which include Germany, Great Britain and France.
Normally European countries are supplied with warmer, more moist Atlantic air that keeps winters on the mild side. But in the future, cold will predominate.
So take note all you tree-hugging Europeans: global warming means cold harsh winters. Don’t forget we told you so! It all fits with catastrophic AGW. Yes, it sounds crazy, but that’s what it is. So If some wacked out denialist brings up cold winters as an argument to refute AGW, then just tell them that to the contrary, it just proves AGW!
Update:
One Süddeutsche Zeitung reader Reinhard Boesch reacts, like many others, as follows:
I’ve been reading for 20 years now in the science section of your paper about the climate catastrophe, the greatest catastrophe in human history. This was fully supported by Graßl, Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf, with your editors prophesising red-hot summers, rainy winters and the end of skiing below elevations of 1500m. The fundamental science underpinning these claims was beyond doubt (settled) and anyone who dared to challenge the science was first labelled as a climate sceptic, then as a denier, and finally marginalised as a flatearther. But now it’s going to get colder because it’s getting warmer. Perhaps we should handle science reports like stock reports – ignore them and just take them as they come.

"Moderate congressional Democrats worried about the infeasibility of passing the kind of sweeping climate legislation their progressive counterparts are proposing, such as the Green New Deal, are laying out their own policies. The New Democrat Coalition released an 11-page outline of principles on Wednesday, along with a list of bills to back them up, advocating for incremental and “pro-market” steps to cut pollution. Their pitch comes as the Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg visits Capitol Hill to tell US lawmakers they just aren’t trying hard enough, and young people inspire global climate strikes this Friday ahead of the UN climate change summit next week. “Congress has been working for years on powerful, proven policy solutions,” they say. “Our challenge is to build on those efforts and push past entrenched partisan fights to secure durable climate legislation that ensures we lead the global transition in combatting climate change.” The New Democrats want to set a clean energy standard, encourage nuclear power and clean up methane leaks from oil and gas companies. They say they want to get carbon pollution to net-zero by 2050, calling the climate problem “unquestionably urgent”. Progressives, by comparison, have penned the Green New Deal, a blueprint for rapidly cutting heat-trapping pollution while fighting societal inequity. But the document, sponsored by the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is not legislation and does not spell out specific policy changes. The difference in the proposals highlights a rift between Democrats that is also on display with the 2020 presidential candidates. More centrist politicians worry about playing into Republican messaging that climate-focused Democrats want to ban cheeseburgers and end air travel. And they say lawmakers should focus on what is politically achievable. Progressives say the climate crisis requires radical change. Where Sanders has called for spending $16.3tn on climate goals and for going to war with fossil fuel companies, former vice-president Joe Biden would commit $1.7tn and has struggled to commit to phasing out the US natural gas that is contributing to heating the planet. Congressman Scott Peters, vice-chair of the New Democrats, maintained that his group’s proposals aren’t inconsistent with a Green New Deal and said some might be able to gain necessary support from conservatives. Peters said “rather than arguing about a political tool like the Green New Deal”, Democrats should be making plans. Peters acknowledged his group has more to do, noting that their package of legislation doesn’t include a plan to tax carbon pollution. But he said “this is what you need to do to start a path to net-zero by mid-century”. That’s the goal the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has laid out for keeping temperatures from rising unacceptably higher. “We really don’t have time to waste,” he said."
"The climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has bluntly told members of Congress to heed scientists’ warnings over global heating on a day when the existential anguish of young activists was given a voice at the heart of Washington DC power. Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who has ignited a global youth climate movement, said at a congressional hearing that she had no prepared remarks other than to submit the landmark IPCC report, published last year, that warned of the rapidly approaching catastrophe of global heating. “I don’t want you to listen to me, I want you to listen to the scientists,” Thunberg told the US lawmakers. “I want you to unite behind the science and I want you to take real action.” Thunberg told the joint House of Representatives committee that she was “furious” when she first learned of the climate crisis, adding that “it should be taken for granted” that climate science was accepted and acted upon. The 16-year-old was given a largely respectful reception by US politicians who remain deeply split over the urgency, and even the veracity, of the climate crisis. The hearing came on a day when Donald Trump’s administration, which has reversed the major climate policies put in place by Barack Obama, sought to hobble California’s ability to enact stricter emissions standards for cars and trucks. The Republican members of the committee, however, praised the efforts of Thunberg and acknowledged the reality of climate change. “I agree we need to take aggressive action,” said Garret Graves, a Louisiana Republican known for a firmer embrace of climate science than many others in his party. Graves did gently spar with Thunberg over his repeated assertion that China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, should be the main target of activist ire. Thunberg, who arrived in the US in August on a solar-powered yacht, was asked by Graves what she would do if she saw another boat throw rubbish into the sea. “I would tell [the] other boat to stop dumping trash in the ocean,” she said. She then told Graves: “I am from Sweden, a small country, and it’s the same argument: ‘Why should we do something? Look at the US.’ It’s being used against you as well.” Members of Congress heard from other young climate activists who explained the trauma of growing up in a world primed for greater floods, storms, heatwaves and unrest because of rising global temperatures. “This should fill you with shame. Youth climate activism should not exist,” said Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old who told of choking wildfire smoke in recent summers in her native Washington state. Margolin said her fellow students suffer anxiety and a “weird form of nihilism” where they wonder if it’s worthwhile making future plans. “There’s depression and fear,” she said. “It’s devastating and scary and also feels like we’ve been betrayed. It is shameful and cowardly to not take action. How can we call ourselves an example for the world if we are going to be cowards and not do anything?” Bill Keating, a Massachusetts Democrat who chaired the hearing, said he was sorry that young people had to come to Washington DC to plead for greater action. “Our generation has failed to adequately address our climate crisis,” he said. “This failure isn’t fatal, yet our failure to change will be. We wouldn’t be in this situation right now – our witnesses would be safely and happily in school pursuing their dreams and not protesting and pushing their governments to act – if everyone was already doing their part.” At a news conference following the hearing, plaintiffs in a lawsuit that alleges the US government violated young people’s rights by abetting activities that have contributed to global warming, called for legal action to force greater movement on climate change from the US. “We are very fortunate in this country that we have three branches of government so that when there are branches of government that are actively harming our children, and have done so knowingly over the last 50 years by creating an energy system based on fossil fuels, the courts can step in to protect the rights of our children,” said Andrea Rodgers, a staff attorney at Our Children’s Trust, which is representing the young people in the case. The committee was the latest stop in a long series of events for Thunberg, who last year started to skip school every Friday in order to protest against inaction over the climate crisis. Her stance spawned a global strike movement that will escalate on Friday when adults, as well as students, will walk out of their workplaces over the emergency. The protests come ahead of a UN climate summit in New York next week where governments will be urged to strengthen their efforts to cut emissions. The world is currently on track to surpass a warming limit of 2C agreed to in the Paris climate agreement, with major emitters such as the US and Brazil now headed by leaders who have questioned climate science and enthusiastically back mining and logging that causes the release of planet-warming gases. Greta Thunberg rounded off her two-day tour of Capitol Hill with a 15-minute address to around 150 people. The teenage activist looked a little nervous at first as she took the lectern under a giant chandelier in a grand committee room, but then smiled as she resumed her call to arms against the climate crisis.“The USA is the biggest carbon polluter in history,” she told the audience. “It is also the world’s number one producer of oil. It is also the only nation to signal its intention to leave the Paris climate agreement because it was ‘a bad deal’.”Speaking softly, she modulated her voice slightly to make clear she was quoting, disapprovingly, Trump with the words “a bad deal”.Thunberg invoked Martin Luther King’s struggle for civil rights and John F Kennedy’s goals that included landing a man on the moon – “not because they are easy, but because they are hard”, – to plead with Washington to lead in the fight, even if it seems impossible. “Giving up can never be an option,” she said. The speech was greeted with a standing ovation and followed by a panel discussion. Thunberg, due to take a train to New York on Wednesday night, was asked about her observations of the way Washington works. She replied: “It’s definitely more calm than I thought. Everything is just happening so slow and people are just repeating the same things over and over again. “I have heard so many politicians here say the same things over and over again. If it continues like that, we’re not going to get anywhere.” She also had a message for those who feel depressed or paralysed by the scale of the crisis. “I started to do something, take action, try to make a difference instead of sitting in despair. That changed my life. It gives your life meaning … To know you can have impact, it makes you feel a lot better.”"
"Nationals MPs have snubbed a farmers’ group launching a major climate change report that warns the Australian agricultural sector faces “significant threats to viability” without a new national climate strategy. The report, launched by the Farmers for Climate Action group at Parliament House on Monday, warns that agricultural production will fall, farm profits will decline and food insecurity will increase if the government does not come up with a cohesive national strategy on climate change and agriculture. Lucinda Corrigan, the chair of Farmers for Climate Action, said she had wanted Nationals MPs to attend the event, saying she believed cross-party support was needed given the challenge facing producers. “It would have been great if they had been there because they need to take this seriously,” Corrigan said. “Because being green is actually our agenda, it’s actually a conservative agenda, being a conservationist is a conservative agenda, it is not a green agenda, it has been taken from us and we actually want it back.” She also said Nationals MPs should consider the concerns within the agricultural sector about climate change separately to the issues affecting the energy sector. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “People see it as an and/or thing, and it is not and/or – this is something that needs to happen for the future of food and agriculture in Australia. What we do about the coal industry and the transition to clean energy is really a different conversation, even though it is equally important.” While no Nationals MPs attended the event, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, launched the report, saying she believed it was important that conservation and agriculture were “on the same page”. “I share the view that we face very real challenges from climate change now and in the years ahead,” she said. “There is no question that our climate is changing, and the science on that is conclusive.” Ley’s comments come after the Nationals MP David Littleproud last week cast doubt on the science of climate change, saying he was not sure if human activity was contributing. He later said he accepted that he accepted the science. Richard Heath, the executive director of the Australian Farm Institute, which completed the report, said that Australian agriculture needed a “national cohesive climate change strategy”. “We need this strategy because Australian agriculture is both partly responsible for and increasingly impacted by the impacts of climate change,” Heath said. “The pace and extent of change that the climate is now experiencing is going beyond the capacity of even the best farmers using the best practices and technologies to adapt.” Jody Brown, a farmer from drought-riven Longreach in Queensland in Littleproud’s electorate of Maranoa, said that a growing number of farmers were recognising the threat of climate change, but that some felt targeted in a city-country divide over the issue. “It’s a very difficult topic for a lot of graziers and some ways it is like the frog in the boiling water because it is not immediately obvious – it has always been hot and dry up there, it is just getting hotter and drier. But she said she believed Nationals MPs would be forced to confront the issue as support for action grew, saying she was frustrated at the lack of political will for a national strategy as politics lagged industry support. “If politicians are not taking this seriously it is quite negligent,” she said."
"Australians overwhelmingly support business leaders speaking out on social and political issues, according to a new survey that conflicts with government efforts to paint such efforts as corporate kowtowing to “noisy elites”. However, the new survey, from the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (Ceda), also shows that when chief executives do speak out they are regarded as doing so out of self-interest.  The survey of 3,000 Australians and 59 bosses showed 78% of the general public supported corporate leaders speaking out on issues of public importance, but 52% thought that when they were did, they were talking in the interests of their own company. The 2019 Ceda Company Pulse also reveals that big business chief executives are completely at odds with the public on where the fruits of increased productivity should go, with bosses wanting to return the spoils to shareholders while ordinary Australians think they should be distributed as higher wages and lower prices. “Despite all this talk about declining trust in business and business being on the nose, people understand the importance of big business,” the Ceda chief executive, Melinda Cilento, said. She said a majority of Australians wanted big business to speak out on social and environmental issues. “It’s a healthy majority around the country – this isn’t just a healthy majority in the inner-city CBD,” she said. “There’s a really small proportion of people in that camp that says business should only really comply with the law. “When it comes to these issues about social and environmental performance there was support for that.” Release of the survey on Monday follows a week of attacks by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and his government on big business for talking about social issues and the environment. On Thursday, Morrison’s assistant minister Ben Morton used a speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to launch a ferocious attack on the big end of town, saying chief executives “too often succumb or pander to similar pressures from noisy, highly orchestrated campaigns of elites typified by groups such as GetUp or activist shareholders”. In what was seen within business circles as an attack on one of Australia’s biggest resources companies, BHP, he mocked companies for “pretending you love paying tax or that you’re building electric cars rather than mining coal”. BHP boss Andrew Mackenzie has drawn the ire of rightwing commentators for announcing in July that the company would be taking action to reduce its carbon emissions, including those made by customers, and comparing the efforts needed to combat climate crisis to the mobilisation for the second world war. It is understood the pushback has not changed Mackenzie’s position, which is supported by the BHP board, and the company intends to push on with its plans to link executive pay to carbon emissions. As  Guardian Australia revealed last month, the company is also considering quitting the Minerals Council over its positions on coal and climate policy. Some in the investment community are sceptical of the push for greater engagement on social and environmental issues, with one market source saying there was a strong cohort who wanted business to stick to its knitting of making money for shareholders. BHP’s conversion to climate crisis activism has also prompted cynicism due to the company’s role in dramatically weakening the Rudd government’s proposed mining tax. “They privately admit the Minerals Council was the best return on investment ever given the billions they saved on the Resources Super Profits Tax,” one market source said. The report also showed the when companies lower costs, 52% of people surveyed thought the savings should be passed to customers and 38% said wages should increase. But just 14% of business leaders thought cost savings should result in wages going up, and only 31% thought customers should benefit. Instead, 56% said the extra money should go to shareholders. “There has to be a more clear discussion around how productivity does benefit workers and how it will flow through to them in higher wages and job opportunities,” Cilento said."

About 400 to 500 million years ago, Earth’s ocean temperatures averaged 35-40°C and atmospheric CO2 concentrations were “5-10x higher than present day values” (Henke et al., 2018). During this period, the marine biosphere thrived (Voosen et al., 2019).

During the last 5.4 million years, CO2 has varied between 180 and 500 ppm (Fletcher et al., 2019). During the Pliocene (5.4 to 2.5 million years ago), Arctic temperatures were said to have been 22°C warmer than today (Fletcher et al., 2017) and tropical ocean temperatures were 3-6°C warmer than present (Wycech et al., 2020).

During the peak of the last glacial (the Last Glacial Maximum) 19,000 years ago, the Southern Ocean was 2°C warmer than it is today even though CO2 levels were a dangerously low 180 ppm at this time. This was also the same period when the Earth’s bottom water temperatures warmed up by about 2°C 1,000 years before the oceans’ surface began warming and CO2 began to rise (Stott et al., 2007).

Image Source: Stott et al., 2007
As recently as 10,000 years ago, the Arctic Ocean’s bottom water temperatures were 6-10°C warmer than they are today (Beierlein et al., 2015).

Image Source: Beierlein et al., 2015
Global ocean temperatures were still warmer than today througout nearly all of the last 10,000 years (Rosenthal et al., 2017), including the Medieval Warm Period (Gebbie and Huybers, 2019).

In sum, paleoclimate research strongly suggests there is nothing unprecedented or even unusual about ocean temperature changes in the modern era.

Calamitologist at work.
Last week I asked readers to submit their own essays: Wanted! Readers As Guest Writers. Well, I’m happy to present the first one! Ed Caryl observes that skeptics tend to have more training and real life experience in the art of forecasting than warmists do. So who should we believe? Yeah, it’s a tough question. 
   
Chicken Little Was A Calamitologist 
By Ed Caryl 
Many writers have been unsatisfied with the terms used to classify the two sides of the climate debate. Warmist and skeptic seem unsatisfying for the first, and demeaning for the second. The warmist label is also a bit narrow, in that those on that side also preach ocean rise and acidification, severe storms, floods and droughts (on alternate days), and other disasters. Many of these predictions take on a “the sky is falling” tone. The warmists call themselves climatologists, but that term is a job description, not a degree. A better description would be calamitologist – one who envisions climate calamities. Let’s look at a few resumes of some famous calamitologists. 
Dr. Michael Mann: received his Doctorate from Yale, the Department of Geology and Geophysics in 1998. His undergraduate degrees are in Physics and Math.
Dr. Phil Jones: holds a BA degree in Environmental Sciences from the University of Lancaster, and a Masters and PhD from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
Dr. James Hansen: holds a BA degree in Physics and Mathematics, an MS in Astronomy, and a PhD in Physics, all from the University of Iowa. Early in his career he spent almost 20 years studying Venus. His calamitologist creds are based on that work.
Dr. R. K. Pachauri: studied at North Carolina State University, where he obtained an MS in Industrial Engineering in 1972, a PhD in Industrial Engineering and a PhD in Economics, a native of India.
Dr. Gavin Schmidt: BA (Hons) in Mathematics at Jesus College, Oxford University, PhD in Applied Mathematics at University College London.

The calamitologists, we notice, tend not to be trained and experienced in the actual science of forecasting. Just the seasonal forecast track record of the Met Office says it all. 
What about the other side, the skeptics?
Many among the “skeptics” are meteorologists who, unlike most calamitologists, are formally trained in forecasting and have gathered years of experience doing so. Some examples: 
Dr. Roy Spencer: B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Michigan; M.S. and Ph.D. in Meteorology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
Joe Bastardi: BS in Meteorology from Penn State University, a practicing meteorologist with AccuWeather.
Anthony Watts: practicing meteorologist, AMS Seal holder.
Joe D’Aleo: Weather Channel founder, practicing meteorologist.
Dr. Richard S. Lindzen: Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A.B in Physics, S.M. in Applied Mathematics, Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Harvard 
These are just a few of the names known in this controversy, but can you see the trend? Although the calamitologists have advanced degrees, usually in natural sciences, they lack training and experience in forecasting. That’s probably the reason why they often forecast long-shot calamity scenarios. 
On the other hand, the meteorologists are real forecasters, and their success depends on the accuracy of their forecasts. Every time they make a forecast, they put their reputations on the line. Sure, some will argue, weather forecasting is not the same. But if you can’t forecast a week or two ahead, can you reliably forecast 50 or 100 years ahead? Be honest. 
Indeed the more a person is trained in the science of forecasting, the more skeptical they appear to become of the AGW hypothesis and the ability for models to predict longterm climate. Real forecasters seriously doubt CAGW. 
Perhaps in the future we ought to refer to the two sides as calamitologists and real forecasters.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the German Readers Edition, Rudolf Kipp has a short write-up poking fun at Kevin Trenberth’s missing heat. http://www.readers-edition.de/2010/04/18/raetsel-geloest-globale-erwaermung-versteckt-sich-in-den-ozeanen/. I’d like to build further on that.
Kevin Trenberth is a devout believer in AGW. Unfortunately measurements haven’t been cooperating and they show the world hasn’t warmed up at all over the last years. Frustrated, Trenberth was unable to contain his exasperation in a Climategate e-mail:
The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t. 
If that weren’t bad enough, new studies now show the oceans, where most of the thermal energy is stored, are cooling. http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/03/21/recent-ocean-heat-and-mlo-co2-trends/
Still, like a true believer, Trenberth denies it and insists the heat is there – somewhere. It’s just simply hidden. After all the climate models say the heat has to be there. And so he warns us:
The heat will come back to haunt us sooner or later.

In the meantime more signs are mounting that we should be preparing for cooling due to quiet solar activity, which some scientists are now realising there’s strong evidence of a link. http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/5/2/024001/fulltext   
In May 2008 Mojib Latif was one of the first established climate scientists to recognise cooling, writing that the missing heat was due to ocean oscillations and that it would last another 10 to 20 years. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7191/abs/nature06921.html and http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17742-worlds-climate-could-cool-first-warm-later.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=online-news.
Meteorologist Joe Bastardi has also been beating the drums of a cooling period, saying the current El Nino is about to fizzle out and that we can expect a La Nina with a couple of cold years ahead. And recall that a recent survey showed that a large majority of meteorologists believe climate is driven by natural factors, and much less so by man.
Dr. Don Easterbook and others are convinced that the cooling will indeed be longterm. Kevin Mooney writes: http://www.sott.net/articles/show/206060-21st-century-global-cooling-trend-debunks-United-Nations-computer-climate-models
The momentum is now very much with researchers who have identified natural forces as opposed to human activity as the primary driving force behind warming and cooling trends. Ideally, they should find greater expression.
But devout believers will hear none of it and they continue to believe in the Hidden Heat. Stefan Rahmstorf even defiantly offered to bet “big money” that average temps will continue to rise through 2020. http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/05/global-cooling-wanna-bet/langswitch_lang/en.  Of course Rahmstorf would not be so careless as to forget a back-door escape clause, just in case:
 To be fair, the bet needs an escape clause in case a big volcano erupts or a big meteorite hits the Earth and causes cooling below the 1994-2004 level.

"In the New South Wales town of Wollar you can’t hear children laughing in the school playground any more. Coal has silenced the schoolyard, coated the remaining houses in a layer of dust and cut off the future of our community, just as it is doing to our children’s future on a global scale. When the world takes part in the climate strike on Friday, those with a remaining connection to Wollar will strike too, at the empty local school.  Our school is empty because the state and federal governments put coal above the needs of our children, allowing Peabody’s coalmine expansions to swallow up this town. 350 people once lived in Wollar, before Peabody’s Wilpinjong coalmine was allowed to destroy the countryside and our town. The primary school and the shop were once the hub and lifeline for this community. Folks from all walks of life worked and played together here. It was an ideal place for children to grow up. As the Wilpinjong coalmine expanded, families moved out of Wollar. The mining company bought the shop and bought out locals. This process of negotiation was very stressful. People were asked to sign confidentiality agreements, pitching the community against each other. During this process people became ill, divorced and displaced. To locals it seemed as though the company never encouraged mining families to move to the village and send their children to the Wollar school. Remaining families complained of rent increases in Peabody-owned companies and soon left Wollar. As student numbers dwindled, Wollar school was put into recess. Recess should be when children go into the playground. It should be a time when kids can play and learn life skills. It should not mean the end of a child’s community. Since last December, there’s been no more laughter, songs, balls over the fence or indeed any life at all at Wollar school. When it went into recess, Kay Bushnell, the school’s principal, observed that “the last vestige of identity has gone”. To say coal is stealing our children’s future is not dramatic. We have known since the 1970s that coal is driving climate change, fiercer bushfires, droughts, heatwaves and storms. What coal has done to Wollar is being played out around the world in every community devastated by a record-breaking weather event, with residents left to pick up the pieces while the coal companies continue to profit. Our town is now a ghost town, with a dirty coalmine charging closer as you read. Who would want to send their children to a school with coal dust in the drinking water, the roar of a mine in the background, and trucks careering by the school gate? The permanent closure of our school is imminent but some still call this progress. I call it an emergency for human life and a lesson. We need to learn from the story of Wollar. The students that have started the climate strike movement in Australia are now asking us adults to listen and to act. We can’t afford to leave it any longer. We can’t afford to wait until coal swallows up the future of all of Australia’s children. We must get active now. • Alison Smiles-Schmidt used to work at Wollar school. She is the manager of a nursery in Mudgee"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Polarstern ice breaker of the government-funded Alfred Wegener Institute is now returning from a 7-month long expedition to the Antarctic, putting 37,000 nautical miles behind it. A total of 150 scientists from 15 countries have taken part in the Antarctic research expedition. here
Onboard in the ship’s cargo bays are 1000 meters of sediment cores, weighing 11 tonnes in total. These cores will now allow the researchers to extract climate information for the period from 400,000 to 4 million years ago.
There’s already considerable knowlege going back about 600,000 years.
But beyond that it starts to get awfully fuzzy. We do know that it has been trending colder over the last 5 million years.
The period from 400 thousand to 4 million years back is not well-researched, and so the sediment cores will certainly deliver key information on how the climate developed in leading up to the periodic ice ages, clues about ice behaviour, and ocean currents. Surely it’ll take some time to extract the data and digest them. We’re certainly looking forward to the first results.
Normally the AWI provides a translation of their press releases in English. I expect one will be out shortly.

Mother Jones took a look at the solar industry, and what they found isn’t pretty. It cites a survey conducted by the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) with 25 solar cell companies, and this is what was found: http://motherjones.com/blue-marble/2010/03/are-your-solar-panels-toxic

 – Only 14 companies responded to the survey.
 – Six companies reported their products contain lead.
 – Three companies said their products contain cadmium, a known carcinogen.
 – One company uses nitrogen triflouride, a potent greenhouse gas 17,000 times more powerful than CO2.

       This is only on the production side, and does not look at how production is done in China, for example, where many cells are produced cheaply and with practically no environmental standards.
      Then there are the environmental hazards of disposing of used solar cells.
      Keep in mind that many are being replaced long before their 20 year lifetime is reached because the new ones are more efficient. California and Europe have exempted solar manufacturers from strict recycling laws. Solar panel manufacturers are barricading against any regulation that would require them to deal with the waste they produce. Indeed only eight companies said they would support “extended producer responsibility” laws that would require them to take back and recycle their waste.
So just how much waste is expected to be produced?
In the coming years, SVTC estimates that 1.5 billion pounds of solar panel waste containing 2 million pounds of lead and 600,000 pounds of cadmium will be disposed of in California alone. 
Now just throw in all those mercury-filled light bulbs, and you get your Green Revolution (For the toxic material industry, that is).

"The Queensland government sought the input of the mining lobby on new laws, introduced into state parliament, designed to stop acts of civil disobedience by protesters using “dangerous attachment devices”. The controversial legislation introduced on Thursday proposes new penalties for activists who block transport infrastructure or business access and use locking devices to prevent their removal. Police will be given new powers to search people and vehicles suspected of carrying such devices.  In recent months, climate change activists have ramped up efforts to disrupt the coalmining sector, including by blocking machinery and freight routes. There is a dedicated campaign to disrupt the activities of businesses bidding for contracts with the Adani Carmichael project. In explanatory notes to the new laws, the government says the peak mining lobby group, the Queensland Resources Council, was consulted on the legislation, alongside civil liberties groups and others. The Queensland Greens MP Michael Berkman said he was “barely surprised” the government sought the mining sector’s input. “It just makes it crystal clear that this legislation is really about protecting Labor’s fossil fuel donors and obscuring their climate hypocrisy,” he said. The laws were announced last month largely in response to climate protests that had blocked commuter roads in Brisbane. The government has now softened much of its language initially used to justify the laws, including branding activists as “extremists” and making unsubstantiated claims about their intentions. The state premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said last month that climate activists were using “sinister tactics” and devices laced with booby traps that were “designed to harm”. Police have never made any such accusation against a protester, and the government has not supplied evidence to support such claims. In tabling the draft legislation on Thursday, the police minister, Mark Ryan, acknowledged the intent of such “locking” devices was to prevent or delay the removal of protesters. “Some people have also made use of bespoke items that have been constructed or designed to defeat attempts to remove them,” Ryan said. He told parliament that “it has been reported some people have claimed” to have placed glass or aerosol canisters inside devices. The only reports of such claims were based on the premier’s initial speech to parliament in August. “These types of [dangerous attachment devices] represent a real risk of injury or death to a person, emergency service workers and the public as the incorrect disassembly or removal of these devices may lead to serious injuries, not only for the person attached to the device but anyone in the vicinity,” Ryan told parliament. The laws outline new fines and potential jail terms for people who use locking devices during protests – up to $6,500 or two years in prison for people who block transport infrastructure, and $2,600 and one year in prison for those who block business access. Berkman said the laws were unfounded, unnecessary and dangerously anti-democratic. “Minister Ryan was clearly feeding us lies recently when he said that protesters were ‘booby-trapping’ devices. “The actions supposedly targeted by this bill are already illegal, this is obviously just about politics and vilifying peaceful protesters.” In explanatory notes, tabled alongside the new bill, the government outlined that it believed public order and safety outweighed the right to peaceful assembly. “The introduction of new offences ... to prohibit the use of a dangerous attachment device may impact on those persons who wish to use these devices when exercising their right to peacefully assemble. “However, this right has to be balanced against considerations about public order and safety and the rights and freedoms of others affected by the assembly. These dangerous attachment devices may cause a real risk of injury or death to a person or persons using the device, emergency service workers and the public when attempts are made to disassemble these devices.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to Die Welt online, a team of German physicists at the Freiburger Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems set a new world record by making a solar cell that can convert 41.1% of the sun’s light into electricity. Today’s typical silicium panels on homes don’t even reach 20%.
http://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/innovationen/article7498251/Weltrekord-beim-Strom-aus-Sonnenlicht.html
How did they do it? According to Die Welt, the solar cells have 3 layers stacked on top of each other, each converting a certain part of the sunlight.
In the first layer the visible light spectrum is converted into electricity. The thermal spectrum of sunlight passes through the first layer and is absorbed by a 2nd layer and converted into electricity. Especially longwave infrared light is converted by a third layer.
In addition to the three layers, which are made of elements such as gallium, germanium, indium and arsenic, the cells also have 22 micrometer–thin layers that perform special electrical functions. Physicist Frank Dimroth, who with his team worked 10 years to reach the record, says:
 It’s all horribly complicated.
There are other drawbacks. The cells are efficient only in intensive, direct sunlight, which means they will find only a use in dry equatorial regions and will have to be equipped with a sun-tracking system to follow the sun from morning until evening.
They are also very expensive. The manufacturing cost is 50 times more than today’s conventional solar cells. Still, Dimroth hopes that production costs can be brought down to earthly levels by mass production. There’s no mention in the report of recycling and disposal costs.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA heat wave in Russia, a flood in Pakistan and a calving glacier in Greenland were enough to trigger mass hysteria in Germany. The warmists pulled out their hair, socialites fainted, re-insurers went bezerk and the German media screamed bloody climate murder. Really.
Meanwhile the rest of Germany relaxed on their long holidays and yawned. So it’s only fitting that somebody step up and offer a message of calm to the bedwetters.
German online Die Welt has a piece by Ulli Kulke titled Enough with the Panic Slogans of Climate Chaos. It’s an attempt to deliver a message of calm and reason, one that is sorely needed by Germany’s irrational media.
First he explains that this year was a warm one, but so was 12 years ago – 1998, due to a strong El Nino effect. And he points out that the blazing heat in the northern hemispehere strangely could not stop Arctic sea ice from increasing in size compared to the years before. The Antarctic sea ice is growing too.

But, writes Kulke, has a lot to do with other factors other than temperature, namely precipitation and wind conditions, Kulke writes:
The Arctic ice is not a suitable instrument as a thermometer for measuring global climate, for warming or cooling.
Also Kulke points out that the media already proclaiming the year to be the hottest on record, long before it’s finished, has become an annual media event in Germany. Kulke writes:

When you look back at the archives, you’ll find that a lot of years were declared the all-time warmest already when just one or two especially warm months were measured. At the end of the year, of course, they turned out not to be the hottest. That has occurred year after year since 1998, which, according to measurements, was the hottest in over 100 years. This has contributed to warming inflation in the minds of the people.

And what about all the natural catastrophes occurring this summer? Is there a connection with climate change? Kulke rightfully points out that there’s no statistical evidence of this when one looks back at decades of records. It was not long ago, 2005, when many claimed hurricanes like Katrina were proof of global warming. Since then hurricanes have been almost off the radar.
Concerning the Russian fires, Kulke writes:

Also the fires in Russia were not examples. Their extent this year was not more than in previous years. To the contrary, the only (deadly) difference: this year the fires occurred near metropolis Moscow and thus got more interest from the international media.

Even in famous magazine New Scientist climate scientists have shown that solar activity was responsible for the blocking weather patterns that led to the extremes in Russia and Pakistan. Kulke writes:

In fact, the situation in Pakistan actually contradicts the popular version of climate scientists. They’ve always claimed that monsoons were especially weak in South Asia during El-Nino years, with droughts even occurring. This year that’s not the case, as is clear looking at the awful images shown on TV every evening. No drought there this El Nino year.

Finally Kulke advises those looking for weather records to go to Ham Weather, where you’ll find that weather records, hot and cold, occur every day, every week, every year…after year, after year, after year. That’s nature.
But don’t expect a change from the German media. Words of reason probably will not cure their incontinence.

The Conference has begun – I’ll get right to the points.
1) How’s the mood going to be over there? Like a funeral?
LOL! Yeah, like dancing on the grave of your most bitter and hated enemy. I wish I could be there. It goes without saying, the mood will be festive, buoyant, and giddy. So much has happened since the last Conference back in June in Washington. Just 11 months ago who would have ever thought science would progress so much and that the ugly truths behind the CAGW science would be exposed like they have been?
2. What has changed since the last Conference?
The last 11 months in climate science have been like a millenium.  Huge seismic events have occurred, namely the scandal that was Climategate and the debacle that was the IPCC’s 4th Assessment Report. The report has been completely discredited. Chairmann Rajendra Pachauri surely will be forced to go. The CAGW science has been reduced to a heap of crushed ice.
3. What about the program there?
First of all, let the guys and gals celebrate a little. It’s good they are getting away from their laptops and blogs and coming together to talk face-to-face. As mentioned in Pt. 2, there’s a lot to talk about. This year the program is much bigger than last year’s.  The roster of speakers is second to none. There are other speakers I’d like to see, but I guess you have to draw the line somewhere.

4. What about inviting the warmists?
That’s been done. The sceptics don’t hide behind closed, locked doors. The doors are wide open and I’m sure the sceptics would even roll out the red carpet for the warmists. Note how the sceptics have no qualms about opening the Conference up to other points of view. That’s how science works. Compare that to how the warmists conduct their conferences, making sure no dissenting views are expressed. Personally I don’t know why people like Mann should be invited. He’s a climate science fraud and criminal. His hockey sticks have proven that. Others like Hansen, Gavin, etc. – okay. Red carpet’s waiting just for you!
5. What are they going to accomplish there?
It’s a chance  to spawn new initiatives and to communicate other points of view to the public. Sure the old washed up MSM won’t be there. But my view is: Who cares! I hope Talk Radio mentions it and maybe Fox News will do a story or two. Otherwise, the growing internet media will do the rest.
6. How do the warmists feel about the Conference?
They can’t stand it. Already many are peeing and moaning about how demoncracy doesn’t work anymore, and that the media gives the sceptics too much coverage, and that they are in a way aiding and abetting the “denialists”. Of course this shows what they really think of free speech and democracy. They’d prefer not have them. Yesterday I wrote about Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, IPCC lead author and Director of Germany’s Postdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who said:
They [sceptics] don’t try at all to do it successfully through factual debate; rather they attempt to sow scepticism on science being an instrument to explain reality. 
In Schellnhuber’s world, scepticism is anti-science. And if you doubt his science, then you are anti-science.
Well Schellnhuber, the doors to debate are wide open in Chicago. You only need the courage to walk through them.

"Australia is experiencing one of its most severe droughts on record, resulting in desperate water shortages across large parts of New South Wales and southern Queensland. Dams in some parts of western NSW have all but dried up, with rainfall levels through the winter in the lowest 10% of historical records in some areas. The crisis in the far west of the state became unavoidable after the mass fish kills along the lower Darling River last summer, but now much bigger towns closer to the coast, including Dubbo, are also running out of water. Residents of three distinct areas talked to Guardian Australia about the state of their towns under extreme stress from water shortages, expressing anxiety about their future but also determination to keep communities alive. It seems unthinkable that the city of Dubbo, with a population of 40,000 and home to the Western Plains Zoo, could be facing the prospect of running out of water by mid- 2020. But as the drought enters its second summer, that’s exactly what is facing the main town in the central west of NSW. It’s also raising questions about management of water in the region, as irrigators in the basin have been permitted to continue to take water in the expectation that inflows would occur. Instead inflows into the Macquarie River are at historic lows. The vast Burrendong dam on the Macquarie – six times the size of Sydney Harbour and the main water source for Dubbo, Wellington, Narromine, Nyngan, Cobar and Warren – is now at 4.5% capacity and dwindling rapidly as unseasonably high temperatures hit the region. This is not just a matter of water restrictions and inconvenience. The drought and water shortages spell potential economic catastrophe for Dubbo as farmers leave fields unplanted and sell off stock, tourist numbers wither and parks and gardens turn brown. Dubbo still looks like an oasis in the brown landscape that surrounds it, despite being on level two restrictions. But tougher level three restrictions are imminent if there is no spring rain, as the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting. Then the city will rapidly go to level five, then level six. That means no watering of lawns and parks. Some of the council’s pools will be emptied and residents will be required to use no more than 120 litres a day – half the amount now permitted. That means short showers and limited use of evaporative coolers, in a summer when the temperature on most days will be well over 30C. “There are no records of the sort of drought that we are experiencing,” says the chief executive of Dubbo council, Michael McMahon. “At the same time the population has grown and there are more businesses here.” A fortnight ago the state government announced a $30m program to sink more bores, and McMahon says he hopes to shift to roughly 50/50 bore and dam water by March. But there are serious questions about whether groundwater in sufficient quantity and quality can be found to support all the people who rely on Burrendong. “I’m quite concerned that the groundwater they find won’t be enough or of good enough quality to help Dubbo,” says the Healthy Rivers Dubbo convenor, Melissa Gray. She points to a risk assessment by state water authorities in November 2018 that found the risk of compaction and subsidence, caused by extraction of groundwater, was high in several zones of the Macquarie aquifer. There is also a high risk of poor quality water travelling through the aquifer as water is withdrawn at other points. Bill Johnson, a former Murray-Darling Basin Authority senior staff member, says the problem is the climate is getting hotter and drier but allocations are being made on the expectation of previous dry times. “There isn’t plenty of water for towns now because too much has been given to irrigation in the recent past,” he says. McMahon also acknowledges concerns about bore water. He is confident it can be treated to provide drinking water but says there are limits to how much can be extracted. Astoundingly, farms with groundwater entitlements are still permitted to extract from underground aquifers for irrigation, Gray says. “They can still flood irrigate with groundwater so, despite the conditions, there will be cotton grown in this region this year.” In the meantime some of the city’s big water users, including the zoo, are trying to reduce water use further. The zoo has a 500-megalitre allocation from Burrendong, which it uses for its non-potable water, mainly for the irrigation of lawns, for water features and moats around enclosures, and for growing “browse” feed for animals. The zoo’s director, Steve Hinks, says it has already cut irrigation back significantly to 340ML a year but is looking at what else can be done, through greater recycling. “We hold 50ML on site at any one time,” he says. “The water is stored in a reservoir and flows through a lake system, so the hippo lake here is one of the last lakes in our natural system.” The zoo is installing a pump system to take the hippo lake water back to the reservoir, where it will run through a series of natural wetlands to purify it. “We can not only reuse the water and get a longer lifespan, but we are creating an environment for a lot of the native bird species,” Hinks says. “Even if it rains in the next few months we will forge ahead with this project as it sets us up for the future, because historically droughts are cyclical, and historically people tend to put the changes on hold. “We are planning for the eventuality of no water in Burrendong but I don’t think we would necessarily close the zoo or drastically reduce the animals here. We are working closely with Water NSW and council about options such as sinking bores on site, and desalination and sewage treatment and recycling.” The further you travel from Dubbo, the more acute the problems are. Nyngan, which sits on the red soil plains 120km to the north-west, was seared into the national consciousness in 1990 when the Bogan River overran its banks, inundating the town of just over 2,000 people. Such excesses are now a distant memory. There has been no rain since 2016 and the town is relying on a combination of its off-river storage, shrewdly built by the council in 2017, and a channel that brings water from Dubbo and the Burrendong. “Having this backup makes it a lot better than it would be,” says Nyngan’s water manager, Trevor Waterhouse. It holds about 700ML, which is close to a year’s water for the town, particularly with water restrictions. But it depends on water from Burrendong, brought by the 66km Albert Priest channel. Further west along the road to Bourke, the situation is already dire. Girilambone, population 26, is already part of the way towards becoming a ghost town but this drought could be the last straw. The town water supply ran out six months ago and water is now trucked in every two days. The rail line to Bourke closed in 1986 and, since then, the town has been in retreat. The station is derelict. The hotel burned down. The general store and petrol station closed two years ago.  “The mines [at Cobar and Girilambone] have already had meetings and said if they don’t have rain before January, it’s no more,” says Darren Painter, who runs the hotel in the old RSL. “This is the only small business here. In turn that will shut us too. “There’s not much laughter here in the pub these days. The farmers try to come in to buy two beers but then they have to go. “Ah, but it will be all right. We’ve got through this before.” After 73 days it rained a trickle in the southern Queensland town of Warwick in August. Few locals celebrated the end of the longest dry spell in living memory. The drought had passed the point where 5mm in the rain gauge could make a drop of difference. “Warwick is a fantastic town, a very proud town, but it’s on its knees,” says Ian Macdonald, who runs a local garden nursery with his son, Brent. “I don’t know how we ever come back from this. Because if it rained tonight, it doesn’t rain money and we’re about a quarter of a million dollars down the gurgler.” Warwick is on track to run out of water within months. Roadside signs heading into town remind residents of the new restrictions: 100 litres per person, per day. Locals take pride in their rose gardens – shopping centres and hotels and Chinese restaurants are named after Warwick’s signature flower. Each year in October the Rose and Rodeo festival is the town’s showpiece event. “We can’t afford the money to bring in roses this year because no one is buying and you’d quite easily do your arse taking a gamble,” Macdonald says. “What people don’t get about a drought is that it hurts everybody … If the farmers have got no money, none of us have got any money ... People don’t buy plants to take home. They don’t stop after the cattle sales and buy a pie at the pie shop.”  In Stanthorpe, 60km to the south, “day zero” – when drinking water supply runs dry – is approaching just as quickly. The towns in Queensland’s Southern Downs and Granite Belt are hubs for primary producers; mostly fruit and vegetable growers. Last month the Granite Belt Growers Association estimated the reduction in wages and expenditure would cost the local economy $100m. Ann Bourke from Jester Hill Wines – a spokeswoman for the Granite Belt Wine Tourism body – says the latest vintage was picked a month earlier than usual, and most local winemakers now have business plans that assume they will lose one harvest in every five. “It’s costing us $2,000 a week to buy in water,” Bourke says. “We’re still in two minds, do we throw the dollars at buying more water and have a vintage, or do we concentrate on just keeping the vines alive?” Some of the bigger farms have decided not to plant this year, which means there is no additional work, and few backpackers in town. “That means there’s less people employed, families might move away, next year our school numbers will drop,” says Amanda Harold, the secretary of the Stanthorpe chamber of commerce. “It’s very scary and very stressful for everyone.”  Harold says Stanthorpe faced a similar situation 10 years ago, when the community was months away from running out of water. She, like many locals, thinks authorities should have acted more quickly to build the Emu Swamp dam. The dam tends to split opinion, but most accuse successive councils and governments of failing to plan properly. Rick Humphreys, a small producer, decided not to grow his primary crop – parsley – this year. He says there’s an increased acceptance that climate change will force farmers to adapt their practices. “I think people now acknowledge that we’re in uncharted territory,” says Humphreys, who is a member of the group Farmers for Climate Action. “A lot of the old blokes, whose families have been keeping records a long way back, they say this is the worst drought on record … “If the numbers are right a version of this is going to become the new normal in the mid-term and we need to think differently about how we produce things and what we produce. The worst thing we can do is carry on farming ... the way we always have.” Macdonald says he was called “a communist” by a local Warwick identity for suggesting the weather patterns had changed and that October thunderstorms were no longer a regular occurrence. “I’d be too frightened to talk about [climate change] in this town,” he says. “It doesn’t get through to people at all. Not one bit.”  The far western town of Walgett will be back on bore water again next week. Rain in March sent the last natural flow down the once-mighty Barwon River, and the quality of what remains has been declining ever since. On 3 September the shire council warned locals to boil water for drinking and food preparation owing to “high turbidity” – a level of murkiness that can indicate the presence of disease-causing bacteria such as E coli. Locals say the water coming out of the tap is brown, brackish and smells bad. “It’s yucky water,” says Clem Dodd, from the Dhariwaa elders group. “It stinks. You can’t wash in it or wash your clothes in it, or they’ll stink too.” Walgett shire’s general manager, Greg Ingham, agrees the situation is “pretty dire”. “I really do feel for the community about the river,” he says. “It’s sad to go down and see what was a thriving lifeblood of our community just a dry, parched riverbed.” Walgett’s bore water is high in sodium, which can pose a risk for people with heart disease, diabetes and other chronic health conditions. The water supply is regularly independently tested, and the NSW health department has said it is safe but the taste can be unpalatable. Ingham says the shire is in discussions with the state government to install a desalination system but that in itself will not solve the town’s water woes. “The output of any desalination treatment won’t be the same as what is currently going through our treatment plant. Desalination on its own won’t be enough to supply all our needs. We might have to look at a blend of the two.” For the past year locals have been buying bottled water or receiving crowdfunded donations shipped in by truck and car. When Walgett’s only supermarket burnt down after an electrical fault in June, locals had to make an 80-minute round trip to Coonamble to buy water, or go further afield. A temporary shop opened in August. “We’ve had various campaigns,” Ingham said. “We’ve had a lot of bottled water coming in, through GoFundMe pages. Then we had a concern about all those small empty bottles piling up here, not being great for the environment. “Now 20- to 50-litre-sized containers are being delivered to households. But the bottom line is we’re no different to any other part of regional Australia suffering through the drought. The only real long-term solution is rain.” The Walgett Aboriginal Medical Service and the Dhariwaa elders group have been distributing bottled water, and delivering water to housebound elders. “Buying water is expensive,” says a local Gamilaraay woman, Vanessa Hickey, “having to spend extra, to wash fruit and veggies.” Both she and Dodd have started to think about what the lack of water might mean for the future. Dodd says moving away is a possibility but Hickey says she’s not going anywhere. “They’ve already ruined our rivers with cotton, coal seam gas and mining. But I’m not moving. The community suffers from other people’s wrongdoing. It’s not our fault but we’re the ones who suffer the most. “They want us gone because they want the land; they want what’s under the land. But where can we live in the city? We only live in the country. I’d rather live in a tent on the riverbank – only we’ve got no river to live on.”"
"Fiona Harvey is surely right when she says “adaptation alone won’t save us from climate disaster” (Journal, 12 September). She gives an apt metaphor that adaptation “while continuing to burn fossil fuels is like trying to mop up an overflowing sink while the taps are still running”, but she still talks of mechanisms for “better economic growth”. Political leaders worldwide need to recognise the causal connection between economic growth and global heating, manifest in fossil fuel consumption. To save the planet, fossil fuels need to stay underground – unused by the greed of humankind. Our energy must come from wind, wave, hydraulic and solar sources, but this will be insufficient to maintain many of our industries and, consequently, many jobs will be lost.  Societies need to adapt so that acquisitive individualism is replaced by cooperative community life. Partly self-sustaining communities need to be created where home workers (ie, non-wage workers) can find worthwhile activity in home care, environment care, vegetable gardens, allotments, orchards, community social activities and other unpaid pursuits. To alleviate the potential poverty of those losing jobs, universal citizen’s income will be needed – recovered in taxation from those in wage-paying work. Come the next general election, would-be MPs should tell us how they propose to tackle climate change and how they intend to engage in worldwide discussion of necessary measures.Michael BasseyNewark, Nottinghamshire • Does Fiona Harvey go far enough in her judgment that emissions reduction, adaptation and coastal protection constitute the main “tools in the box” for averting such a disaster? An analysis of the stress exerted on our climate and ocean system by the growing excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere suggests an aim which is fundamentally more appropriate: the retrieval of this overload, with the goal of returning carbon dioxide’s concentration to its stable and pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million, from the present, and growing, 408ppm. Ultimately, taking care of the stressor would take care of the raised temperatures which we so rightly fear. Such a policy would demand a great deal of money, more perhaps than the public and financial institutions are currently willing to part with. And it would necessitate the worldwide adoption of technologies in which fossil fuels would no longer play a part. These technologies are known to many, and are already developing fast. We need to displace fossil fuels and embrace all that solar energy has to offer in the forms of electricity, heat and hydrogen derived from solar-electrolysed water. And we need to develop forms of enhanced photosynthetic growth, in expanding forests and in harvesting specially planted grasses, ensuring that the carbon thus embedded in their tissues is never returned to the atmosphere.Mike KoefmanDirector, Planet Hydrogen, Manchester • Fiona Harvey stated two profound truths. The first in the title; the second in the words: “As long as we continue to pump CO2 into the air, we are fuelling rises in temperature.” But it is the second truth that identifies the fundamental solution – to pump CO2 out of the air faster than the rate at which it is being pumped in. This is known as greenhouse gas removal, the subject of a 2018 report from the Royal Society, in which we read that “reducing emissions is not enough – we must also actively remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere”. So perhaps Fiona Harvey should be less dismissive of geoengineering. Funding a major project to develop large-scale ways to extract greenhouse gases from the atmosphere will save the planet.Dennis SherwoodRutland, East Midlands • Fiona Harvey says: “Melting permafrost releases methane, a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than CO2.” While the levels of methane gas should certainly be reduced, that phrase demonises methane over CO2. According to Simon Fairlie in his Meat: A Benign Extravagance, methane doesn’t stay in the atmosphere for longer than 12 years, while the same value of CO2 has its effect spread out over two centuries. By demonising methane, it will be more likely that rural communities whose modest lifestyles include a few ruminants and timber-fuelled sources of energy would be penalised over industrial-scale CO2 producers and users. This would be patently unfair.Ann SpencerHarefield, Middlesex • Fiona Harvey is absolutely right that there is going to be no wall high enough to keep out the consequences of inaction on greenhouse gas emissions. All the more disappointing therefore that she seems to buy into the Global Commission on Adaptation’s assumption that investment now is about buying us “trillions of dollars in potential growth”. That’s a priority one might expect from Bill Gates, but the work of thinkers from sociologists like Jem Bendell to economists like Tim Jackson now suggests that we won’t really get started on adapting and building resilience until we accept that growth of any kind is over. The planet simply cannot cope with any more of it. The vitally urgent need now is to find a just and viable post-growth way of life.John FosterDepartment of politics, philosophy and religion, Lancaster University • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Image cropped from Twitter GIF file.
Here’s a short but interesting report on how all the climate alarmism in Germany is now taking a psychological toll, especially on the youth.
Hat-tip Die kalte Sonne.
German broadcaster RTL here has an article at its site titled: “Climate Change and Psyche: Burnout Courses for Demonstrators“. According to RTL:
One year after the start of the Fridays for Future protests in Lower Saxony, psychologists are observing that the climate crisis may be putting a heavy emotional strain on young people. Psychotherapists are therefore now offering free workshops, for example in the Hanover region. Nationwide, therapists have joined forces with “Psychologists for Future” – an environmental group of psychologists that now has 400 volunteers who want to support the climate activists.”
Die kalte Sonne comments: “If you preach climate catastrophe all day long, you will eventually believe it yourself. Then burnout is not far off. Fortunately there are now courses against it. Will the health insurance soon pay for it? Will ‘climate alarmism’ now be a recognized disease?”

Also don’t use charcoal or real meat! And check your lighter fluid to be sure it’s not wrecking out atmosphere.

The wrong way to barbecue, German environmentalists say. Image: Barbeque block party Kansas City. CC BY-SA 3.0, Source: Wikipedia.
Today’s article may have useful tips for readers who feel compelled to worry about everything. For the rest of us, it’ll be entertaining. So grab yourself a bag of popcorn as we take a short trip through the wacky world of radical environmentalists.
Today’s topic comes from Germany’s chapter of Friends of the Earth, BUND Hamburg: how to barbecue in a more environmentally friendly way.
Use the proper charcoal
First the BUND Hamburg advises that if you insist on using charcoal, use only the stuff from European hardwood forests – not from tropical forests – and make damn sure it’s FSC certified.
And if burning what used to be living trees is not an acceptable option, then the BUND Hamburg suggests using “olive stone briquettes, which are made from the waste product of the olive oil production process. “No tree has to be used for this type of charcoal.”
The BUND Hamburg also suggests using grapevines, or barbecue charcoal made of bamboo or coconut shells – ” currently available mainly in organic markets.”
Don’t ignite with cancer-causing lighter fluid

//-->




When it comes to lighting up the grill, the BUND warns: “Under no circumstances should the grill be ignited with chemical ignition aids, paper or pine cones, as this releases carcinogenic substances.” Instead you need to to use “pressed wood with oil or wax, brushwood or wood shavings”.
Never grill real meat, instead grill eggplants!
Now that the grill has been lit and is hot enough for cooking, the BUND writes that under no circumstance shall you throw real meat on it. It doesn’t matter if this is what grilling is all about! The BUND recommends vegan and vegetarian foods during barbecues. Example meat substitutes the BUND recommends are: “peppers filled with mozzarella, grilled and pickled eggplants or mushrooms with herb butter” are enough.
Avoiding meat and sausage “protects the environment and climate”. Every single kilogram of beef “requires 15,000 litres of water and emits almost 30 kilograms of carbon dioxide,” says the BUND. “In addition, farm animals are usually kept in huge stables under conditions that are not appropriate for their species.”
“Piles of rubbish”
Another reason barbecues are bad thing is because they create “large piles of rubbish”. But, if you cannot the resist the temptation of having a summertime barbecue, then please at least have the courtesy of using “reusable barbecue utensils instead of plastic dishes and disposable barbecues,” the BUND Hamburg says. Also avoid the use of aluminum!
Barbecuing in the evening is bad for the climate!


Another tip is provided by career environmental whiner Georg Etschelt, who cites tips from a Hamburg newspaper:
Perhaps in order to alleviate the summer barbecue problem a little, the main barbecue times could be shifted by decree from the evening – when most people are at home and do not want to be disturbed – to the early morning.”
“This would also make sense from a climate policy point of view. ‘Trees absorb CO2 during the day, so hobby cooks should only use the barbecue during the day,’ was recently reported in the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper on a course titled ‘Green barbecue.'”

"In a cold, dingy room at the back of a Loughborough pub, maths student Steff Farley would meet with friends to discuss an issue they felt no one was talking about on campus. These conversations over a few pints were the start of a campaign that would eventually push the university to divest from fossil fuels. The students ran peaceful, relatively small demonstrations; they’d hand out leaflets about Loughborough’s fossil fuel investments during open days, or write fossil-free slogans in chalk on the campus grounds. “We started off small,” Farley says. “We decided that students should be able to demand from our university what we deserve.” Although university campuses have historically been spaces for activism, Farley felt Loughborough was fairly apolitical. “There were a couple of general leftwing groups but they both fizzled out.” But things are beginning to change: “This environmental campaign is sticking around.”  Farley, who is a member of People & Planet, a UK-wide student network that pushes for environmental justice, has seen support grow as groups like Extinction Rebellion and the school strikers made headlines. “You need other students to believe in what you’re doing,” she says. “A lot of people feel powerless. But when you join an activist group, it’s healing to finally be doing something. A lot of hope comes from it.” The past year has seen millions of students skip school or college to strike over government inaction on the climate emergency, and they’re set to return to the streets on 20 September. Organisers say that university students have been prominently involved too. The National Union of Students (NUS), which has been monitoring attitudes towards the environment since 2014, says 91% of students are “fairly or very concerned” about climate breakdown; 80% want their institution to be doing more on sustainable development, while 60% want to learn more about sustainability. Paris Palmano, a student activist at the University of Sussex, set up the Climate Action Movement with two friends in 2017, a university society aimed at improving education on climate crisis. At meetings students discuss climate issues, policy, science and possible solutions. “It’s a space for young people to discuss and gain a perspective on this stuff. It’s not offered by any societies; I imagine if you’re on the right master’s course you do learn this stuff, but it’s not accessible,” he says.  Members have gone on to become key organisers of the local youth strikes and Extinction Rebellion’s youth group. Palmano and another student at Sussex were even claimants on a major climate change lawsuit against the UK government. The lawsuit said the government’s 2050 carbon target didn’t meet the science or its legal obligations to the Paris agreement. They lost the case, but the impact has been far-reaching: the government’s climate change committee issued a review of the 2050 carbon target. “We’re not going to solve climate change in a courtroom. It’s going to be this much wider societal process of changing the opinions and culture until the politics doesn’t fit the culture any more, and then the politics will change,” he says. Campus can be a platform for changing culture. “It’s the perfect space to disrupt and partake in these kinds of things,” says Mary-Jane Farrell, a student at Sussex who organises the youth strikes in Brighton. “The grounds can allow you to be radical.” Palmaro adds: “The main reason I’ve been able to do this so consistently and so relentlessly is because I’m a student. The academia I’m involved with is enough to make me angry, and the spare time I have is enough to make me active.” But students are operating in a difficult environment. Although many universities across the country are leading in climate science and research, institutions themselves are lagging behind when it comes to confronting the climate emergency. According to the University green rankings by People and Planet, two-thirds of UK universities are likely to fail their 2020 targets for reducing carbon emissions. It doesn’t mean the climate movement isn’t visible on campus – the University of Manchester, for example, hasn’t divested from fossil fuels despite a persistent campaign from students at Fossil Free. This has given rise to splinter activist groups: an Extinction Rebellion youth group has launched at Manchester students’ union. In December, sabbatical officer Lizzy Haughten set up a zero-waste shop on campus, selling sustainable products made by students, such as bath soaps and beeswax wrap. It has been so popular that the shop has opened in a new location at a university building in the city. “While setting up a zero-waste shop is not going to save the world, it’s things like this that need to be in place when the government realises we need to change,” Haughten says. “Things like Extinction Rebellion and zero waste can work together – Extinction Rebellion demands government to make the changes, then there are already things in place that show these changes work.” Harriet Thew, a postgraduate researcher on youth participation in global climate governance at the University of Leeds, says the movement’s reach has gone beyond the student body – in February more than 200 academics voiced their support for the youth strikes. Meanwhile, the lecturers’ trade union is calling on members to walk out in support of young people in the school strikes on 20 September. “It’s challenging that relationship we have with the younger generation – it’s not about hoping they’ll do things in the future. Staff are now facing questions of intergenerational justice head on,” says Thew. In Brighton, Farrell is preparing for the next global youth strikes, predicted to be the biggest yet. “What’s so refreshing about having uni students come along with secondary school, primary school [pupils], is that the youth generation is united,” she says. “It really breaks down the barrier between academia and primary level education, which directly challenges the educational system we are demanding to be reformed.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve gotten into a bit of a squabble at Georg Hoffmann’s blog concerning Henrik Svensmark’s cosmic ray cloud-seeding hypothesis.
Hoffmann cites two recent papers that investigate Forbush decreases and their impacts on clouds, and thus climate. The two papers reach different conclusions.
The first paper is by Calogovic et al. (Jürg Beers Gruppe) in GRL, which analyses the 26 strongest Forbush events beginning in 1989 and compares them to ISCCP cloud data. This Calogovic paper finds nothing. No systematic changes in low cloud cover were associated with Forbush events.

The second paper by a German team, Rohs et al, appeared in the Journal of Geophysical Research and found a faint but detectable correlation that seems to contradict Svensmark’s hypothesis that low, earth-cooling clouds would be produced. Rather, Rohs et al finds that high, earth-warming type cirrus clouds are produced instead.
That would be astonishing because it would mean that periods of low solar activity would cause warm periods, and not cold ones, thus completely flying in the face of the Maunder and Dalton minimums.
The Rohs team used Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) data, which uses so-called limb-viewing of the atmosphere. Six Forbush events over 1.5 years were analysed.

//-->




Although Hoffmann admits that 6 Forbush events in 1.5 years is a scant amount of data, he can hardly contain his glee with Rohs’s findings and deems them sufficient enough to openly taunt proponents of Svenmark’s hypothesis. He even singles out the “usual suspects”:  THE HOCKEY SCHTICK and GREENIE WATCH, here and here respectively, for claiming Rohs’s paper supported Svensmark. THE HOCKEY SCHTICK and GREENIE WATCH did not mention that the clouds formed in the Rohs paper were of the high, warming kind.
Of course, in a reader comment, I asked why the long periods of long protracted solar inactivity during the Manunder Minimum and Dalton Minimum did not lead to warming. Why was it cold instead? Hoffmann replies with interesting speculation:
Concerning the Maunder Minimum. So IF the Rohs relationship turns out to be robust, it is in fact the wrong sign fo the suggested sun/climate relation. Then you have a couple of other possibilities: 1) Direct forcing (TSI) is sufficient to compensate the Cirrus effect. That means a comparably high climate sensitivity. 2) Volcanoes were mainly responsible for the Maunder Minimum and compensated the Cirrus effect 3) The target is not clear meaning there is no clear relationship between the sun and climate.
For the moment I tkink one has to wait for more MIPAS data. Svensmark idea is by any means not even close to something verfied.
I wonder if he realises what he is saying. If Rohs turned out to be robust ( I doubt it will), then it would turn climate science on its head. Now that would be most interesting.
Note: Georg Hoffmann is a researcher at the LSCE (Laboratory of Sciences of Climate and Environment) in Paris and focuses on various aspects of paleo-climatology. His area of specialty includes climate reconstruction of the last 1000 years and the coupling of carbon cycles to climate development on paleo-timescales.
——————————————————————————————————————————-
UPDATE: HOCKEY SCHTICK REPLIES:
1. The abstract says they only looked at mid and high altitude clouds, so nothing can be concluded from this study about low altitude clouds &amp; GCRs
2. The abstract says “a 15% increase in CNM would result in … an increase in cloud opacity,” so unless the abstract is worded incorrectly, there is no problem with the sign of the correlation. This would also be consistent with earlier statement of a “positive cloud-CNM correlation.”
3. The claim that high altitude clouds warm the planet because they “absorb more IR and reflect less sunlight” seems tenuous at best. Incoming solar energy is 45% IR, so these clouds absorb significant amounts of solar energy BEFORE it reaches the earth, thus acting as a sunshade. Furthermore, high altitude clouds at -18C or less are not capable of heating the earth at 15C because “a cold body cannot heat a warm body” from the 2nd law of thermodynamics.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAbout 70% of the Earth’s post-1980s vegetative greening trend has been driven by CO2 fertilization. More greening has offset or reversed 29% of recent anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Greening also has a net cooling effect on surface temperatures.
Earlier this year we highlighted a study (Haverd et al., 2020) asserting rising CO2 and warming are the dominiant drivers of Earth’s strong post-1980s greening trend. This greening expands Earth’s carbon sink so profoundly that by 2100 the greening of the Earth will offset 17 years (equivalent) of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
A 17% offset over 80 years, or net CO2 emissions reversal, would easily supplant the effectiveness of Paris climate accord CO2 mitigation policies.

Image Source: Haverd et al., 2020
Now another new study (Piaoet et al., 2020) expands upon these same principles, further suggesting the net effect of more CO2-driven greening is more cooling and carbon sink expansion.
Since the 1980s, 29% of human CO2 emissions were cancelled out by the CO2-induced greening of the Earth. The post-2000 vegetative greening expansion has been so massive (5.4 million km²) its net areal increase is equivalent to a region the size of the Amazon rainforest.
“Vegetation models suggest that CO2 fertilization is the main driver of greening on the global scale, with other factors being notable at the regional scale. Modelling indicates that greening could mitigate global warming by increasing the carbon sink on land and altering biogeophysical processes, mainly evaporative cooling.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAgain the excellent Readers Edition here has an excellent piece on Pachauri, which I’ve written here in English. Pachauri became Chairman of the IPCC in 2002.The following is his little-publicised partial resume of some of the posts he’s held. Now if you look closely and squint your eyeballs really hard, you might see a conflict of interest here and there.

1981 director Tata Energy Research Institute in New Delhi
2001 general director of  The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI)
2005 founder of GloriOil, which developed TERI technology for exploiting remaining oil reserves of abandoned oil sources
2007 on the advisory committee of Siderian Venture Capital in San Francisco
2008 consultant to Credit Suisse on renewable and sustainable energy
2008 on the advisory committee of the Rockefeller Foundation
2008 on the supervisory board of Nordic Glitnir Bank which launched the Sustainable Future Fund
2008 Chairman of Indochina Sustainable Infrastructure Fund
2008 Director of the International Risk Governance Council in Geneva, which was founded by French power company EDF and German power company E.On
2009 strategy advisor for the New York based Pegasus Investment Fund
2009 Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Asian Development Bank
Head of the Climate and Energy Institute of Yale University, which is funded by millions of dollars from USA and private companies
Member of the Climate Change Board of Deutsche Bank
Director of the Japanese Institute for Global Environmental Strategies
Advisor to Toyota Motors
Advisor to the French state-owned SNCF rail
President of the Industrial Lobby TERI-NA which is funded by 130 government and corporate sponsors, which include the Rockefeller Foundation, Monsanto and the World Bank

Today, billions are being made trading paper called CO2 certificates. For example, Indian Tata moved its steel production of 3 million tonnes annually from England to India, and thus earned almost 2 billion euros in CO2 credits. Not only that, almost 2000 honest workers lost their jobs². India alone has 1455 emissions trading projects up and running with an estimated value of US$33 billion. Many are run by Tata.
Pachauri is also on the Advisory Committee of the Chicago Climate Exchange, the largest and most lucrative CO2-exchange in the world, which was supported by TERI. One director is Maurice Strong, former General Secretary of the UNCED, and head of Petro-Canada, and head of Ontario Hydro. In 2005 he had to step down because of his involvement in the UN Oil For Food scandal. Since then he’s been living in Peking, where he directs his oil business and advises the Chinese government on how to get rich with CO2 certificates – just like India is doing. (But don’t blame India and China – they are only accepting great offers. Who wouldn’t!).
Now one begins to see just how corrupt the UN climate policy is. People near its core are getting seriously rich. Now you know why Al Gore will say and do anything to keep the scam going. 
Pachauri also asked the EPA to limit CO2 emissions without waiting for Congress to act. The EPA took his advice and declared CO2 “dangerous to human health”. The EPA based all this on the bogus IPCC 2007 4AR. This alone  is going to cost industrial countries another estimated $45 billion.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe future for the backbone of the German economy is looking bleak. A look at the impacts of climate policy on the German car industry.
===============================================
By AR Göhring at EIKE
(Text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
Not only at Daimler, Volkswagen and others, but elsewhere the working people have to fear for their jobs after Brussels and Berlin have declared war on Germany’s most important industry. Now the automotive supply chain is also being hard hit.
Berlin, Brussels tighten the screws
The value-adding industry has already been badly shaken by the exaggerated, simply senseless corona measures of the Merkel IV government. Now the Brussels EU government (including former German minister Ursula von der Leyen) are tightening the screws even more as they love to ban internal combustion engines completely. The EU has just tightened the rules for limiting CO2 emissions. Not only the well-known car manufacturers are under pressure, but also their suppliers, hardly known by name, such as Mahle from Stuttgart.
Mass job losses

The globally producing parts manufacturer still has around 12,000 employees in Germany (72,000 globally). In the country, 2,000 workers are expected to lose their jobs, globally 7,600, and this despite a partial switch to e-car parts. It’s not enough, says a works council member, because there is no concept for the domestic combustion engine factories to convert over to electrical parts.
E-mobility not economically feasible
Why should there be, one might ask, since hardly anyone is buying e-cars anyway? Significant sales figures can only be achieved through massive tax incentives, but the government cannot keep this up forever. In other words, a complete “transformation” to e-mobility cannot be economically feasible.
It would make sense to downsize existing locations and let them settle for the winter. Only develop and produce burners in climate fanaticism-proof countries like Russia, Mexico and possibly the USA. As soon as Merkel’s energy transition in Germany crashes for all to feel and a rationally acting government comes to the helm again, the locations could be rebuilt and production could be brought back.
Highly skilled workers risk going idle
The problem is that machines and buildings are only a part of the company portfolio. The most important factor of a medium-sized manufacturer, however, is its skilled workforce, whose skills, acquired and honed over decades, are not so easily exported or imported. So Mahle and Co. would have to send their Swabian skilled workers with good programs and a lot of money to a safe foreign country for a few years. Is that possible? With difficulty. Home, mortgage, children, school, friends, family … skilled workers are people.
Mahle is unfortunately not the only supplier who is being needlessly driven out or exiled by the misguided caste of the political media. Well-known companies such tire manufacturer Continental will also have to take massive hits – Continental plans to cut 30,000 jobs worldwide.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA survey on climate science views conducted at Hans von Storch’s blogsite klimazwiebel has yielded some interesting results. Though the survey sampled only a small group of persons and not conducted scientifically, the klimazwiebel claims to be: “the only site which is almost equally well attended by skeptics and warmists, etc. Another factor that may help retrieve quite useable data is the good geographical distribution of survey attendees.”
Some findings:
1. The survey showed only a weak correlation between belief in AGW and political orientation.
2. Of all those counted, more than three quarters were non-alarmist, i.e. either lukewarmer, sceptic or denier.

I remember seeing Gallup polls listing Global Warming and Environment separately, and almost always near the bottom on the list of concerns. But I don’t ever recall GW being relegated to obscurity – but maybe I’m wrong here. Anyway the “climate crisis”, as Gore likes to call it, is not even among the top 10  concerns for Americans. Here are the latest Gallup poll results.

Maybe global warming has been lumped in under Environment, along with air and water pollution, littering, lawnmower noise and plastic bags.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe April 21, 2010 German edition of the Russian news website RIA Novosti has a piece with a possible explanantion as to why Antarctic sea ice is expanding while the rest of the globe is warming. http://de.rian.ru/science/20100421/126005955.html
A Russian scientist believes it is due to the ozone hole over the South Pole. According to Alexander Klepikov of the Research Instritute for Arctic and Antarctic at the Conference Maritime Research of Polar Regions of the Earth in the International Polar Year:
Over the last 3o years of satellite measurement, the growth of the ice amount in the Southern Ocean which surrounds Antarctica was more than 4 percent.
Klepikov emphasised that sea ice growth around the Antarctic coast was irregular and occurred at different areas. There was an especially large amount of sea ice growth in the Ross Sea located in the western part of the Pacific sector. Klepikov says British researchers, using mathematical models and analysis of meteorological data, could attribute the increasing sea ice trend to the so-called ozone anomaly in the South Pole region.
Reduced ozone concentrations over the South Pole leads to cooling of the upper atmosphere, and eventually leads to a strengthening of the circumpolar circular flow – winds that blow along the Antarctic coast and protect the Antarctic zone against the effects of warmer air. The same mechanism has the opposite effect on the Larsen Ice Shelf, causing increased melting.

Share this...FacebookTwitter{Note 15 August 2010: Joe has replaced his Penn State post with a new post, and so you can no longer read it.]Anyone who reads this blog knows that meteorologist Joe Bastardi is one of my favorites. Yesterday he wrote a scathing piece at his European blog about his alma mater Penn State for the way it whitewashed the Michael Mann affair, and other things.
Joe Bastardi is a graduate of Penn State, receiving a degree in Meteorology and is a leading Accuweather meteorologist. His seasonal forecasts almost always far outperform those of “climate scientists”. It’s because Joe knows what he’s talking about, the “climate scientists” don’t. A Penn State investigation of Michael Mann, author of the infamous hockey stick graph, led to his exoneration, much to the protest of the scientific community. Many called the investigation a whitewash. Bastardi agrees. At his blog he writes:
Though I have a degree from the once proud and great meteorology department, it was EARNED during its glory day, when we graduated 2/3rds of the worlds meteorologists, and were the envy of other schools. That was yesterday, and yesterdays gone.
and says:
Penn State has lost its way.
I will no longer refer to myself as a Penn State grad, nor promote the university in my appearances.
That’s pretty heavy. And if you still don’t think Joe is ashamed of Penn State, read on:

One cannot imagine the betrayal I feel at the hands of this university. AND THAT SAYS IT ALL.
The fact is the university I busted my tail for, and defended all these years, is complicit in not only advancing an agenda driven matter in the name of “science” but also trying to suppress freedom of independent, rational thinking. Its that simple.
Joe is not alone. Many share his opinion. He writes:
And believe me, there are many.. legion, that graduated PSU through the 90s that feel the same way I do.
Joe will no longer remaim silent, and that’s good. We need more figures like Joe to speak out and express a dissent that is more necessary now than ever.
I also feel a little bit that way about my own alma mater, the University of Arizona, where one of Mann’s colleagues is a professor – but thankfully not at the College of Engineering and Mines, where I studied and got my Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering. I can imagine that this has got to be really tough for Joe to do.
Write to Joe to express your support: bastardi@accuweather.com. I think he’ll appreciate it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecently I wrote a post about Reiner Fuellmich, a German trial lawyer who is certified to practice in both Germany and California.
PCR test is a fraud
Over the years, Fuellmich has landed some awfully impressive trophies, among them Deutsche Bank and VW. Now he’s taking aim at Big Pharma and tech companies for what he considers to be crimes against humanity, mainly that the PCR test is a fraud. .
Designed to make people panic, submit to Big Tech
In a recent video he talks about how all the COVID-19 measures imposed, such as social distancing, wearing a mask, lockdown and quarantine are designed to “make people panic so that they believe without asking questions that their lives are in danger so that in the end the pharmaceutical and tech industries can generate huge profits from the sale of PCR tests, antigen and antibody tests and vaccines, as well as the harvesting of our genetic fingerprint.”
Hat-tip: Reader Sommer
Fuellmich sees nothing less than attempted crimes against humanity taking place.
What follows is his video on the subject, and well worth viewing.

It’s terrible what’s going on. People are made to believe that we are now bearers of dangerous pathogens and that we need to be continuously tested, drugged, covered up and controlled. We’re on the brink of what was once thought to be an unimaginable dystopia.

"Every spring, 4.4 billion bogong moths migrate up to 1,000km to the alpine regions of Victoria and New South Wales ahead of the summer heat. But for the past two years, the number of moths that have made the journey to those areas from breeding grounds in Queensland, NSW and western Victoria has crashed to almost undetectable levels and scientists are turning to the community for help. A new website, led by Zoos Victoria, is asking Australians to take a photo if they think they see a bogong moth, and to record when and where they saw it. Called Moth Tracker, the website has been set up to try gather information on the migration routes of the bogong moth and what the coming summer will bring for the species and animals that rely on them. That includes the mountain pygmy possum, a critically endangered marsupial that hibernates for five to seven months of the year. Just 2,000 of them remain in the wild. When the possum emerges from under the snow, the bogong moth is its main food source. Last year, scientists monitoring the mountain pygmy possum late in the breeding season in Victoria found that between 50% and 95% of the animals had lost their full litters of young. Analysis found the animals had starved to death without their main food source. “The migration of bogong moths has occurred for over 7,000 years and their arrival in the alpine zone is the second biggest arrival of nutrients in the area after the sun,” Marissa Parrott, a reproductive biologist at Zoos Victoria, said. “They’re an important species in their own right and they’re crucially important for mountain species like the pygmy possum as well as birds, frogs and plants.” Parrott said researchers had developed the Moth Tracker website because not enough was known about why the moths were not making it to their summer destination. The collapse in numbers is unprecedented and there are three likely causes scientists are exploring. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning They are the ongoing drought in south-eastern Australia, changes in agricultural practices such as spraying of crops or flooding of areas for cotton and rice production, and light pollution in urban areas that diverts the moths away from their migration path. In addition to asking Australians to log sightings of moths – and how many – on the website, the researchers are also asking for assistance in the south-east of the country to reduce light pollution. Some of the greatest beacons are sporting fields and Canberra’s Parliament House and its surrounds. Until the end of October, the scientists are asking people to turn off unnecessary outdoor lighting. To use the Moth Tracker website, participants just need to take a photo, upload it the website, along with the time of the sighting, location and how many moths. An expert will then examine the photo and if it is identified as a bogong moth it will be logged on a map. Parrott said it was hoped the data would help researchers to create short- and long-term strategies to aid in the recovery of the moths and the possums. “We’ve never seen this loss of moths happening before,” she said. “We’re gathering all the data we can … so that we can have both short-term and long-term strategies to protect these species and learn more about what is an unprecedented event.”"
"Shane Warne has called for cricket to be “proactive, not reactive” about the dangers the sport faces due to the climate crisis, after being shocked by a report that called on the authorities to act now against “humanity’s most pressing challenge”. Warne was part of the MCC World Committee that was last month given a preview of the Hit for Six report, published on Tuesday, which examined the threats that face cricket-playing nations, many situated in areas of the world most vulnerable to the changing climate. “At times in the past, it has been hard to know who to believe, but I think we all have to admit now that climate change is a huge issue,” the former Australian leg-spinner said. “Scientists with proven facts are telling us things we can’t dispute about the rising temperatures, the rising sea levels. “Before I’d seen the report I hadn’t really thought about how it would impact the game of cricket. Some of the stuff that we were presented with: how hot it was for some of the players at certain times – up to 50 degrees in the middle – how dangerous it was for them. How the risks affects local club cricket, how clubs have had their changing rooms destroyed by flooding in the UK, how the rising temperatures affect the way grass grows, was scary.” The report, written by academics and sports scientists, focused particularly on how heat affects players and called for cricket’s administrators to protect players and reduce the game’s own carbon footprint. It pointed out that batsmen and women are uniquely vulnerable to the heat, covered up by protective clothing which limits their ability to sweat, and running a succession of 22-yard sprints for up to eight hours a day. It came up with a number of recommendations, from players wearing shorts to play being abandoned during the hottest parts of the day. “The game has to have a plan, a strategy for how we adapt for it. It wasn’t something I’d really talked about with ex-cricketers until this year at Lord’s. I was really taken aback,” Warne said.  “I’m lucky enough to be on these committees with some very intelligent people and I hope they can come up with something. I’m more than happy to put my hand up, and sit down at a round-the-table discussion.  “I have got three children – 22, 20 and just about to turn 18 – it’s a different world for them. People want to put their head in the sand, and say I’m not going to be around in 50 years. That’s just wrong.”"

"On Friday, thousands of adults across the world will take part in the global climate strike to show solidarity with Greta Thunberg and the young students who have been walking out of school for months to raise awareness of the climate emergency. Among them will be many public sector workers, including some NHS staff.  With the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report last year warning that the human race has just 12 years to limit the most devastating impacts of global heating, stark images of the toxic effect of plastic on marine life in David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II and the devastating fires in the Amazon rainforest, the scale of the crisis is all too clear. New research published last week by the Health Care Without Harm (HCWH) campaign (an NGO that works to reduce the environmental footprint of health worldwide) and consultancy firm Arup, calculates that globally, healthcare’s climate footprint accounts for an astonishing 4.4% of the world’s net C02 emissions. If healthcare were a country it would be the fifth largest emitter on the planet. The report also finds that the NHS produces higher emissions than the global average for healthcare and is responsible for 5.4% of the UK’s total carbon emissions, equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions of 11 coal-fired power stations. Its emissions are not much lower than those for both aviation, and agriculture, forestry and land use in the UK (each 6.5% according to Committee on Climate Change figures). The NHS was one of the first national health systems to produce a carbon reduction strategy 10 years ago and started measuring emissions in 2007. Since then the health and social care sector has cut emissions by 18.5%, according to the NHS Sustainable Development Unit, despite a 27% increase in clinical activity over the same period. But Kristian Steele, an associate at Arup and one of the HCWH report’s authors, says the findings show that the NHS needs to up its game. “As we continue to work to deliver high standards of quality healthcare, we must also address the environmental burden associated with this. The sector must strive to do no harm by working to cut its carbon emissions.” This summer, more than 1,000 doctors signed an open letter calling for widespread nonviolent civil disobedience in the face of the environmental crisis and the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change, which represents all major health bodies and 650,000 healthcare professionals in the UK, has recognised the climate crisis. “While the UK Health Alliance is not calling for health professionals to join strikes during scheduled working hours, we share the fervour of strikers for urgent action to mitigate against the damaging effects of climate change through changes to our behaviours as individuals, members of institutions such as the NHS, and as a country,” says Nicky Philpott, director of the alliance. “Failure to act quickly will heighten existing national health challenges, place undue financial strain on the NHS, and worsen health inequalities both within the UK and internationally.” Yet, so far, only two NHS bodies have declared a climate emergency: Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust and the Greater Manchester health and social care partnership. In contrast, more than 100 local authorities have declared a climate emergency, and the government has committed the UK to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. “In a sector that has health promotion and healing in its mission, it’s a no-brainer for it to want to protect health by cutting its own carbon footprint,” says Josh Karliner, HCWH international director. “Health systems need to weigh in for clean, renewable energy to protect the health of their patients. Decarbonising will reduce morbidity and mortality caused by the combustion of fossil fuels.” Coming from a partnership that represents all health and social care bodies in the region and around 100,000 workers, Greater Manchester’s climate emergency declaration last month is potentially a game-changer. Some £6bn a year is spent on health and social care in the city region. Getting all 13 trusts, 10 clinical commissioning groups and the 10 councils responsible for social care to become carbon neutral by 2050 will be no mean feat. Anthony Hassall, joint chair of the partnership’s sustainable development leadership group, says: “Our actions must cover everything from the types of drugs and treatments we purchase, the energy used in our buildings, the waste we generate in clinical procedures to the transport our staff and patients use.” A detailed plan is due to be published by the end of the year. As air pollution causes 1,200 deaths a year in the region, one of the priorities will be to improve public transport to and between NHS sites and reduce emissions from delivery vehicles, as well as installing electric vehicle charging points. It also aims to improve energy efficiency of NHS buildings, reducing single-use plastics, and planting trees. Newcastle upon Tyne’s declaration – which came in June, before Greater Manchester’s – made it the first healthcare organisation in the world to declare a climate emergency and pledge to become carbon neutral by 2040. Newcastle has been in the vanguard of sustainability for decades. The trust installed combined heat and power plants in its hospitals in the late 1990s and all electricity bought comes from 100% renewable sources. It has sent zero waste to landfill since 2011 and recycles more than 40% of non-clinical waste (the average in the NHS is 23%). All procurement contracts include sustainability criteria, while hospital cafes and restaurants provide compostable cutlery and plates. The trust has commissioned new staff, patient and visitor electric bus services for 2020 and already has electric catering and estates vehicles. But it is in the clinical areas – dialysis for kidney patients and anaesthetics in its operating theatres – that Newcastle really stands out. Its “renal green group” has been working to reduce the environmental impact of dialysis since 2010. It recycles packaging and used dialysis fluid canisters, while energy-saving measures include the retrofitting of heat recovery technology within dialysis machines. The trust has also pioneered ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions from anaesthetics, which make up 5% of acute hospitals’ total emissions and 1.7% of CO2 for the UK’s health and social care sector. Much of this is about the choice of anaesthetic: some gases are more polluting than others. The two most common anaesthetic gases are Sevoflurane and Desflurane, which largely do the same job. But Desflurane has a global warming potential 20 times greater than that of Sevoflurane. Dr Cathy Lawson, a fellow in environmentally sustainable anaesthesia for the Association of Anaesthetists and the Centre for Sustainable Healthcare, based at Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals, saysreducing the use of Desflurane can make a real difference. “Since 2016, we have cut emissions from anaesthetic gases by 45%, through education about the environmental impact that our different gases have, supporting our colleagues to make informed choices about their clinical practice and using behavioural nudges to reduce unintentional use of our more harmful agents.” From November she hopes to start introducing technology to capture these gases, and support staff in using alternative techniques with less emissions. She is also working with colleagues to improve the sustainability of operating theatres by cutting energy use and waste, reducing single-use plastics through recycling, and procuring more sustainable and reusable clinical items. Jonny Groome, co-founder of the Greener Anaesthesia and Sustainability Project and anaesthetic registrar at Barts Health NHS trust, points out that 40% of waste in operating theatres is a high-quality product that could be recycled. Unfortunately, most waste ends up being labelled as “infectious clinical waste”, he says, and gets incinerated at a high financial and environmental cost.  Transport is a big contributor to NHS emissions. The NHS accounts for almost 10bn road journeys each year – around 3.5% of all road travel. The long-term plan has committed to cutting mileage and air pollution from ambulances, patient transport and staff journeys by a fifth by 2024 – and ensuring that nine out of 10 vehicles are low emission within a decade. In February, NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens, called on vehicle manufacturers to develop greener ambulances. Some trusts are introducing energy-saving measures to reduce car journeys such as lift-share schemes for staff, free shuttle buses between sites, and cycle-to-work schemes, as well as building staff accommodation within walking distance of work. Sussex Community NHS foundation trust has introduced a “care without carbon” mantra throughout the organisation. It developed an internal network to encourage departments to re-use furniture and unwanted office products, opened a travel bureau in 2013 to encourage public transport and cycling and has introduced a car lease scheme for staff with a cap on car emissions. As a result, emissions are down by 37%, says Susie Vernon, associate director of sustainability at Sussex Community NHS foundation trust. Oxford University hospitals NHS foundation trust provides a cycle-to-work scheme, as well as a free staff shuttle bus between the trust’s four sites in Oxford. It offers a lift-share scheme, as well as discounted bus and rail passes. The trust is also building two nearby staff accommodation developments. University hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS trust projects carbon savings of 2,000 tonnes over 20 years due to reusable sharps containers. But with two hospitals still using coal boilers and some oil-fired, getting to net zero emissions is a huge challenge for the NHS. Stephen Powis, medical director for NHS England, says: “As part of our long-term plan, the NHS is doing its bit to protect our environment with practical measures like reducing the need for road traffic for appointments, phasing out coal in our buildings, supporting staff to use bike and car hire schemes and making use of safe, greener treatments including low-emission inhalers where it’s appropriate and good for patients.” “For more than 70 years the health service in England has protected our country’s health with world-leading treatments, research and staff, but we also are doing more to protect our patients’ environment and help prevent ill health, which will not only safeguard the NHS and public health for future years, but save taxpayers money into the bargain.” In the end, though, the best way to cut emissions is to keep patients healthier. “Nothing could be less environmentally sustainable than delivering interventions that do not work,” says Chris Naylor at The King’s Fund. “Arguably the best way to cut emissions would be to change the way we do healthcare, to prevent illness in the first place.”"

The German European Institute For Climate and Environment (EIKE) brings our attention to a report by the publicly funded NDR German television news show Panorama concerning the state of climate science and politics today in Germany. If you’re a climate activist, things just couldn’t be worse.

NDR Panorama report on Germany”s mood with regards to climate change (in German).
In summary the topic of climate change in Germany has gone far beyond its shelf-life. It is used up and no longer draws a bit of interest from the public. As the clip shows, the German public has grown tired of the constant barrage of climate alarmism, and is now über-bored by it. Editors have since taken climate news off the front pages. The public doesn’t want to hear it anymore, editors fret.
At 0:36 of the clip, normal citizens are asked about climate change. The reaction:  they couldn’t care less about it. Indeed some even say warmer is better. Climate change? No worries at all!

The depth of public apathy has left climate activists and experts like Professor doom & gloom Hans Joachim Schellnhuber frustrated, depressed and resigned. Schellnhuber at the 1:39 mark:
Just a few years ago it was so that when a meteorological extreme occurred, the phones would be ringing off the hook. Today hardly anyone calls; climate change has quasi become taboo.

Nobody wants to talk about it. And after the disaster that was Copenhagen, neither do the political leaders. In Schellnhuber’s view, the optimism in achieving a climate treaty is gone. That was clearly visible at the recent UN Climate Conference in Bonn. Says Karsten Sach, leader of the German negotiating delegation:
Everyone knows we’ve reached a dead-end.
The media has lost interest in reporting on the constant failure by policymakers. At the 3.56 mark, accompanied by gloomy music, a chart shows how the number of reports on climate change appearing in three major centre-left newspapers has dwindled. The hype is over. The public is fatigued, fed up, and disinterested.
Editor Dagmar Dehmer of Berlin’s Der Tagesspiegel says somberly:
Editors know the topic is important, but it’s not topic no. 1 at the moment. Climate is no longer on the front pages, and is not viewed as an earth-moving topic.
The video clip then moves to a car-tuning meet, where one auto-tuning enthusiast says:
Nobody cares about it.
And what about Chancellor Angela Merkel? Climate change has become a thorn in her side. She associates the issue with failure and hopelessness. Says Tagesspiegel editor Dagmar Dehmer at the 5:38 mark:
Climate change has become a loser topic. And Angela Merkel wants nothing to do with it.
Yet, Merkel’s minister of environment insists that climate change is an important topic for the future.
For the future, yes.  But not for today. The report ends with relaxed vacationers chuckling when asked by the journalists about the threats of climate change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a just published 43-page paper, leading scientists and professors are calling for a completely new direction in climate policy after what they call “The Crash of 2009”. http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/mackinderProgramme/pdf/HartwellPaper07052010.pdf
This was made public this morning by Dr Reiner Grundmann, one of the paper’s authors, at http://klimazwiebel.blogspot.com.
In its Executive Summary, the paper states that climate policy “has failed to produce any discernable real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years”, adding:
…UNFCCC/Kyoto model was structurally flawed and doomed to fail because it systematically misunderstood the nature of climate change as a policy issue between 1985 and 2009.
In my view this paper reveals that many scientists and policymakers are now realising what many of us already knew: Radical regulation and taxation of carbon is not going to work. The paper proposes a much watered down version of what governments, interest groups and activists were previously pushing for. Its authors are still calling for a tranformation in energy supply and consumption, but in a more measured and targeted approach using low taxes and through the development of unsubsidised energy sources.
The authors say of their paper:
It explains radical and practical ways to reduce non-CO2 human forcing of climate. It argues that improved climate-risk management is a valid policy goal, and is not simply congruent with carbon policy.
Well at least governments now have an option: they can continue to allow energy policy to be formulated and driven by zealots, or they can hand the job over to the lukewarmers, who are promising a less painful approach, one that respects human dignity.

"Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions from road transport have continued to grow since 1990 despite more efficient cars because traffic has increased by almost a third, according to government figures. Cutting emissions on Britain’s roads remains a significant challenge, according to the report from the Office for National Statistics, citing a 6% rise in greenhouse gases in the past three decades. More fuel-efficient vehicles have mitigated but not stopped the increase in emissions, as traffic rates rose from 255bn miles travelled a year in 1990 to 328bn miles in 2018. Greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon emissions, or CO2, peaked in 2007 before levels of road traffic tumbled during the financial crisis. But road emissions have steadily risen again since 2013 to more than 118m tonnes in 2017, more than a fifth of the UK’s total emissions. Campaigners said the figures showed car use had to be curbed, and that private vehicles were “locking us in to a high-carbon future”. Car owners were encouraged by government in previous decades to switch to diesel, a policy that helped limit carbon emissions but contributed to worsening air quality in urban areas. Though greenhouse gas emissions improved relative to the volume of traffic, the slow rate of change has resulted in the transport sector overall – including rail and domestic aviation – overtaking energy production as the most polluting sector. Overall UK emissions dropped by almost a third in the same period. Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Despite noise made by vehicle manufacturers about cleaner petrol and diesel technology, transport is still the most climate-polluting sector and it’s clear petrol and diesel sales have to stop as soon as possible. Admittedly there has been some progress but the ever-increasing number of car miles is still locking us in to a high-carbon future, as well as causing health-damaging air pollution. “The only way to stop transport from leading us to further climate breakdown is to drastically cut the miles travelled by car. Cleaner options such as bicycles, buses and trains need to me made more accessible and more affordable, which will be good for the health of people and the planet.” Campaigners’ calls for a modal shift in transport come in the face of figures showing declining use of buses. The number of annual journeys in England has fallen by more than 300m in the last five years, to 4.3bn in the year to March, and the Local Government Association repeated warnings last week that half of all routes were at risk. Fares on buses, as on trains, have risen faster than inflation. China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.  Hopes for bringing down emissions otherwise lie in the swift uptake of low- and zero-emission cars. The Tesla Model 3 helped sales of battery electric vehicles surge last month to a record 3.4% of the UK market, although there was an accompanying slump in sales of hybrids from last August, after subsidy cuts at the turn of the year. The business minister Nadhim Zahawi said: “As electric vehicle sales reach a record high, the potential of this market for the UK car industry and wider economy is huge. We are committed to achieving our aim for all new cars and vans to be effectively zero emission by 2040.” Although motor manufacturers have said the viability of that transition remains in doubt, in May the Committee on Climate Change recommended bringing forward the deadline so that only zero-emission vehicles would be sold after 2035. By the end of last year, while almost 2% of new registrations were ultra-low-emission vehicles, they comprised only 0.5% of all cars on UK roads, the ONS said. Research published on Monday by Go Ultra Low, a joint government and industry campaign to promote electric vehicle (EV) use, found that despite low current sales, EVs were regarded as increasingly normal. It found 69% of people expected “electric cars” to be referred to simply as “cars” by the end of the decade. Almost half cited concerns over the availability of charging points as the biggest deterrent to buying an electric car."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThanks to reader ThomasJ, who provided this link to a Norwegian documentary about bird-killing windfarms. It might take a few moments to load. And although the clip is in Norwegian, the pictures themselves tell the story. The Norwegian windfarms are turning once majestic landscapes into a nightmare. http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/klipp/282395
I’m also amazed at the number of websites, blogs, documentaries, reports, etc. popping up and casting light on this large-scale avarian slaughter by windmills. Expect resistance to this failed experiment to grow. The Green Movement is quickly proving to be an abject folly.
Aren’t all those windmills along Norway’s prestine natural coastline just lovely?
Update: No problem littering the landscape with bird-chopping windmills – but try putting up a new bridge. http://www.thelocal.de/society/20100513-27141.html

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe hear it from the panic-obsessed media and politicians all the time. Even kids too have to go to school with masks and maintain distance from one another. Large events are being called super-spreaders and so being shut down. Global travel restrictions abound.
The virus is far more dangerous than the influenza and we are living in a worldwide pandemic, they say. Moreover, all the world citizens are being told that restrictions – and vaccinations – may be mandatory. So get used to the idea. But it’s all for our own good, leaders and  media want us to believe.
All the panic, however, is based on rising “new cases”. And charts from Worldometer show that new cases are indeed on the rise in many countries and that the second wave has come!
But how dangerous is this second wave really?
Today we look at the statistic that really counts: the daily death rate. Here in Germany, where tens of thousands of anti COVID-19 restriction protesters are now being savaged by the media as ignorant everything under the sun because they dared to question the restrictions, the death rate has in reality been close to zero for some 2 months now.

Skyrocketing new cases in France, but deaths near zero!
Lately France has seen a sharp rise in “new cases”, as the chart below shows. But the next chart shows that despite all the “new cases”, there have been virtually no change in the number of daily deaths, which are very close to zero.

Viva bella Italia 
Next we look at the situation in Italy – the epicenter of the COVID pandemic earlier this year, which the media and leaders shamelessly used to spread mass panic worldwide.

Images cropped from worldometer.com
Also Italy has just experienced a “second wave” of the “deadly virus”, but as the above chart shows, there have been almost zero daily deaths since early July!
Experts also say that many of the new cases are not even showing any symptoms.
The story is very much the same at many locations around the world. Lots of testing, lots of false positives and so lots of panic reports – but the deaths in Europe are increasingly rare.
Time to end the public health insanity
Despite the low death numbers, the panic has taken on new, unprecedented dimensions of public health hysteria and absurdity.  Though the virus in combination with the lack of preparedness indeed had posed a risk earlier this year, the situation today is totally better now and there is no need to continue on with all the restrictions. Very few people are dying of it in Europe.
All the mass economy-killing restrictions are in fact leading to far greater death numbers, especially in poor countries. It’s time to end the insanity.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe dreamers of global warming calamity always have to find imaginative explanations for inconvenient truths and paradoxes. Today’s German papers are reporting on the recent study by Judith Curry and Jiping Liu, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology. The paper is an attempt to provide an explanation for the paradox of increasing Antarctic sea ice in a warming climate.You see, there’s a simple explanation for everything.
The latest explanation is a brainstormed hypothesis at most, and nothing more. Hypotheses are important in science of course, but they are only its very raw trial material. They are not fact.
Yet today, in climate science, we are expected to accept half knowledge and computer-generated scenarios as “finished” science. Folks, it’s a farce.

So just what is the Liu/Curry explanation? The German Sueddeutsche Zeitung here presents it as follows:
The ice in the south polar sea is still growing there because climate change means more precipitation, most of it as snow. This snow reflects part of the radiative warming back out into the atmosphere and thus prevents the ice from melting.
But if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase over the next decades as expected, then sea ice will eventually melt from underneath. In addition, precipitation will fall increasingly as rain, and not as snow. This means the radiative reflection will diminish and thus lead to acclerated ice melt at the surface from above.

Depending on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the decades ahead, the researchers calculate a shrinkage in Antarctic sea ice of 40,000 to 300,000 sq. km. per decade . The ice is expected to melt especially rapidly starting at the end of the 2060s.
40,000 to 300,000 sq km/decade? At the end of the 2060s? Really?
Recall this is all based on still really crappy climate models. It’s crystal ball science by fortune tellers. Don’t get me wrong. Science starts with wild hypotheses. But only in climate science do they seem to end there. Curry and Liu, your work is far from finished. You are a long way from being able to make such predictions with even minimal certainty. You get paid for that?
This is not the first time an attempt has been made to hastily explain, using dubious methods, why the Antarctic is not cooperating. Steig et al used dubious statistical acrobatics to produce a warming Antarctic graphic, i.e. it is cooperating! Read here.
The following NASA chart made before all this Orwellian history rewriting shows some parts of Antarctica indeed have warmed over the last decades, but most of the continent has cooled.
he Antarctic continet has cooled, not warmed.
Source: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=6502
And as long as it cools, the ice will expand, reflect more radiation out into space and…well, I’ll let the readers apply their own Curry-like hypotheses from there.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German virologist Professor Hendrik Streeck is skeptical about a quick vaccine for COVID-19, reports t-online.de.

Virologist Prof. Hendrik Streeck. Image: Cropped here, University of Bonn. 
When asked in an interview why he was so skeptical, Streeck, director of the Institute of Virology at the University Hospital in Bonn, said
nobody can say exactly when the vaccine against Covid-19 will be available and thinks “a Covid-19 vaccine in the near future is unlikely”.
Currently several vaccine projects are currently in the final clinical trial phase on volunteers. Streeck told t-online: “It may be that the next vaccine will work wonderfully. But it may also be that all vaccines that are in Phase III do not work. This simply cannot be seriously predicted.”
To caution against a new vaccine, Streeck cites  a 1961 vaccine against RSV, where “everything went well” in initial tests on children. Later it turned out it could make the disease even worse. “As a result of the vaccine trials in 1961, two children who had previously received the vaccine died. We know the same phenomenon from dengue and other pathogens,” he told t-online.
He added another example: an AstraZeneca vaccine, which he says is likely to cause someone to become infected and so the ” virus can still be passed on”.
According to Streeck, it’s far too early to say when a vaccine will be ready and effective. “I’m just saying we don’t know.”
Streeck also criticizes the lack of coordination and cooperation in the research and some researchers are more concerned about their egos than getting good results. “The research is not done together, everyone tries to be the fastest for himself. This is a pity, because it is partly about delivering fast results, so that the individual distinguishes himself with a better publication,” Streeck told t-online. “A pandemic should lead to a distribution of tasks among all researchers. That is my vision for science, that we all work together – worldwide.”
Virologist Streeck is sure about one thing: ”There is no question that the number of infections will increase.”

In yet another “we’re all threatened by climate change” piece, the German online FOCUS magazine presents here a piece on the desertification of the earth, of course all worsened by climate change. FOCUS quotes a source:
Almost 33.3% of the earth’s surface is threatened by so-called desertification.
Right off the bat I have trouble with that statement because we know that only 29% of the earth is land. Does that mean 4% of the Earth’s water surface is about to dry up?
FOCUS reports that poor nations of Africa are the most threatened by the spread of desertification. But looking at the Sahara, there’s scientific literature that shows the opposite is happening. For example a 2009 National Geographic report relies on scientific literature and says:
Emerging evidence is painting a very different scenario, one in which rising temperatures could benefit millions of Africans in the driest parts of the continent.
Scientists are now seeing signals that the Sahara desert and surrounding regions are greening due to increasing rainfall.

Images taken between 1982 and 2002 revealed extensive regreening throughout the Sahel, according to a new study in the journal Biogeosciences.
Sounds like good news to me. So why does FOCUS peddle something that’s so misleading? Well, just take a look at its source of information: Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit, in English: German Society For Technical Cooperation. It’s a private company owned by the German government, that promotes sustainanble development and…well, you get the picture.  Perhaps FOCUS should rely more on scientific literature in the future.
Finally, and interestingly, National Geographic also attempts to project future trends for the Sahara, but finds it’s a very difficult and complicated task.  It quotes Martin Claussen of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, who says:
Half the models follow a wetter trend, and half a drier trend.
And so much for the climate models!

"It is impossible to disagree with the Food and Land Use Coalition report’s findings ($1m a minute global farm subsidies ‘are destroying the world’, 16 September). Yet it would be wrong to dispense with all agricultural support programmes, particularly in the UK. Big changes are needed, but there will always be targeted support to certain sectors and farm types. First, we do need to support the small-scale, family-based business structure. This is the only way of sustainable farming in the uplands and less productive land areas. All land use requires management, even woodland. This is not poor resource use; it is supporting public benefit from business centres that would otherwise not be financially viable.  Second, good sustainable farming can be compatible with good wildlife and habitat management. I do it every day. But it requires some well-thought-out financial incentives in small, monitored quantities. Finally, we need a micro-management farm-level approach to this funding.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI) WHO ARE THE SCEPTICS IN GERMANY?
The real “troublemakers” in Germany are:
1. Professor Hans von Storch of the GKSS (warmist, but scientific and welcomes debate).
2. Prof. Josef H. Reichholf of the Technical Univ. of Munich.
3. Hans H.J. Labohm (Dutch), journalist.
4. Prof. Augusto Mangini, U. of Heidelberg (maybe not a sceptic, but critical of AGW science).
5. Dirk Maxeiner, journalist German blog.
6. Matthias Storx, journalist.
7. European Institute for Climate and Energy EIKE blog.
8. Readers Edition blog.
9. Klimanews blog.
9. Die Welt newspaper, which sometimes publishes sceptical pieces.
10. Der Spiegel magazine, which sometimes publishes sceptical pieces.
11. Petition of 77 sceptical German scientists.
(And maybe some day this here blog may make it to the top 100!)II) WHO ARE THE ALARMISTS?
1. Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research PIK. Government funded.
2. PIK Director Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber – visionary of the Great Transformation (a dangerous social engineering experiment). He’s the no. 1 climate advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel (yikes!). Has tried to shut down debate read here.
3. Prof. Stefan Rahmstorf, gatekeeper, attack-dog. Notorious for efforts to stifle dissent and to marginalize sceptics. Calls sceptical media reports irresponsible and disinformation.
Famous for publishing alarmist scenarios just before climate conferences.
4. German media, almost unanimously. Perfect example here and here.
5. Munich Re Reinsurer, purveyor of catastrophic scenarios.
6. The German school system, which repeatedly shows AIT to children uncritically.
7. A host of well-funded environmentalist groups like BUND, NABU, WWF, Greenpeace, Germanwatch, etc.
8. An array of companies set to make tons of money in trading CO2 certificates.
9. A vast majority of politicians, conservatives and environmentalists alike.
III) HOW IS AGW VIEWED HERE?
Germany is a country that has a powerful green movement. Environmentalism has become a religion for many. Probably has something to do with atonement for past sins. Environmentalism is pounded daily into the German psyche by the public-funded media, the state school system and other institutions. What you as a person does to “protect the climate” is a measure of how good you are. It’s like Karma. (So, I’m quite the naughty boy here).
IV) ARE ATTITUDES CHANGING HERE?
Yes!  Thanks to the little but vital  information the media allowed to drip out about Climategate, the recent bitter winter and a small group of concerned but very active citizens, there’s been much success in educating the public. Recent polls have alarmed the massive Green Establishment. They’re in panic. The sceptics have the momentum. Indeed the dreaded “tipping point” may have been reached. Just a couple of years ago, the media promoted the notion of universal consensus, and Mann’s depiction of the last 1000 years as fact. Today they can no longer maintain that.
V) GERMANY’S POLITCAL PARTIES – HOW GREEN?
There are five significant parties in Germany.
1. CDU/CSU – center right. Equivalent to the US RINOS. Led by a centrist Angela Merkel. They like cap & trade and believe in AGW. Favour use of nuclear energy.
2. SPD – socialists. Equivalent to the US Democrats.
They love cap & trade, regulation and are in love with Barack Obama and the US Democrats. Against nuclear power. Led by Sigmar Gabriel – Fan No. 1 of Al Gore. He distributed 6000 copies of AIT to advanced secondary schools for indoctrinating university-bound children.
3. The Greens. Made up of enviro-zealots, treehuggers and elitists. Vehemently against nuclear power.
4. FDP – Free Democrats – libertarian. Supporters of free markets, nuclear energy. But pay much lip service to green alternative energy, but not real big supporters.
5. Die Linke – The communists.
They like anything that gives the state absolute power. Ought to be viewed as a threat to democracy.
Currently a coalition of the CDU/CSU and FDP are in power. But they are weakening. Elections may have to be called.
VI) WHAT IF ELECTIONS WERE HELD TODAY (June 20, 2010)?
– CDU conservatives- 33%
– SPD socialists – 32%
– Green treehuggers – 15%
– Die Linke communists – 11%
– FDP libertarians – 6%
That means there’d possibly be a Socialist/Green/Communist government, and thus a huge push by Germany for a global climate treaty. So, although there’s been much progress, there’s still much to do in Germany when it comes to educating the public.
Note: I’m sure I’ve forgotten some names and other information. Your tips would be welcome.

Calamitologist Stefan Rahmstorf once defended his alarmist sea level rise scenarios by saying:
I can’t help it. It’s simply the laws of physics.
The question is: Whose physics?
No science has rewritten the laws of physics like climate science. In climate science, it works like this:
1. Develop a model that shows heating in the future.
2. Then compare the model projections with reality. If there’s a discrepancy:
3. Don’t change the models, instead go and change the measured data so that they agree with the models.
One way to do this is to go back and adjust the historical data, like GISS has done – GISS REWRITES HISTORY!
Another way is to modify your measurement methods and systems so that they put out only data that agree with the models. This involves closing down certain weather stations and then using data from urban-heat-island stations for filling in. GISS has done that too.
You may be able to fool the public this way, but you can’t fool the ice.
Joe Bastardi reports in his latest clip Ice Ice Baby how the Arctic ice simply refuses to melt, although we are told it’s getting warmer and warmer and warmer. Indeed look at total sea ice, north and south pole, here.
There we see a sea ice anomaly of ZERO! Global sea ice is right at normal.
Indeed the ice has been recovering over the last three years – even though we are told that it is getting hotter. This can mean only one thing. When it gets warmer, you get more ice.
We can’t help it, it’s simply the laws of climate physics.

In the German edition of Ria Novosti, Russian scientist Oleg Pokrovsky of the Main Geophysical Observatory says the world should expect cooling – and not warming – and that this will interfere with Russia’s plans to exploit the Arctic’s rich resources. The climate has been cooling since 1998.
At a climate research conference for the Arctic and Antarctic in St. Petersburg, Friday, Pokrovsky said the Earth’s temperature fluctuates in 60-year cycles.
There isn’t going to be an ice age, but temperatures will drop to levels last seen in the 1950s and 1960s.
Pokrovsky adds:

Right now all components of the climate system are entering a negative phase.  The cooling will reach it’s peak in 15 years. Politicians who have geared up for warming are sitting on the wrong horse.
The Northeast Passage will freeze over and will be passable only with icebreakers.
Pokrovsky also claims that the IPCC, which has prophesized global warming, has ignored many factors. He also noted that most American weather stations are located in cities where temperatures are always higher.
We don’t know everything that’s happening. The climate system is very complex and the IPCC is not the final truth on the matter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMaybe tough talk has to do with surviving the coming midterm elections in the USA. When I watched the video posted here at the Guardian, I thought at first for sure Gov. Joe Manchin was some sort hard-right republican.
But no, he”s a West Virginian Democrat running for the Senate and now he’s acting like he means business. Of course it’s understandable that a Democrat from West Virginia would want to protect the economic interests of his own state, especially before an election.

The above clip is pretty emphatic – best anti-Cap & Tax clip I’ve seen in a long time. I admit I even felt myself bonding with Joe’s message. Susanne Goldenberg of the Guardian, however, is a little less enthusiastic about the ad, and writes:
A number of Democrats trying to hang on to their careers in these congressional elections are distancing themselves from Barack Obama, but only one, so far, is suggesting he would take a gun to the president’s energy policies.
Oooh, I do like that suggestion.
But I wonder if Manchin is just shootin blanks. And if not, can he shoot straight? Notice how the ad doesn’t show him hitting anything. That hole in the paper was probably put there by Sarah Palin, who I think can shoot a hell of a lot straighter than Manchin.
Many Democrats have a habit of talkin real tough when the GOP has the momentum, but then turn mushy later on (after the election). Right now Manchin is saying:
I sued the EPA and I’ll take dead aim at the cap and trade.
Well Joe, you got my vote – if you keep that promise. In Indiana Congressman Joe Donnelly is also in a tough race, and he’s running TV ads calling climate change legislation “Nancy Pelosi’s energy tax”. Howabout just taking dead aim at the Cap&Trade bill too, Mr Donnelly? And don’t forget to pull the trigger.
The question is: Can we rely on these possible phonies to follow through on their promises? Talk is cheap and thousands of jobs are on the line. Check their records to be sure how they really vote.

Share this...FacebookTwitterStarting tomorrow another Corona lockdown goes into effect in Germany
By A.R. Göhring
(Text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
The government factions and the Greens decided on a significant increase in CO2 price – from 10 euros per ton up to 25 euros. Not only heating and filling the gas tank will become even more expensive from January 2021, but other sources of energy as well.
In the “climate package” of Autumn 2019, a price of 10 euros per ton of emitted CO2 was agreed upon, but this was criticized by the German Greens and their affiliated Fridays for Future organizations and numerous editorial offices because a curbing effect would not result from the low price.
In plain language, it probably means that not enough money is coming in to pay the profiteers, and therefore the many green lobbyists put pressure to raise the carbon price significantly. And with success: the German Parliament decided to more than double the price to 25 euros per ton.
And since the lockdown has already ripped huge holes in the wallets of many employees and self-employed persons since March, the rising prices of consumer products across the board will put German citizens economically under even more pressure.
Although taxpayers saw some relief from the lowered  value added tax to 16%, it is of no use: the reduction expires already on New Year’s Eve.
But, the additional additional revenue from CO2 taxes is also aimed at reducing the burden on citizens, for example the EEG feed-in levy to promote green electricity will be lowered and the commuters will be given tax breaks. But this does not benefit producers, which is why the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce has demanded subsidies. Not without reason: Otherwise, our companies could migrate to nearby foreign countries where no fanatic climate activists are at work.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWood pellets.
Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann calls it “the dumbest energy and environmental policy ever”. Now, finally, after years of being warned, Germany’s mainstream media are finally showing signs of waking up to it.

Idiots and energy policy: Burning of “CO2-friendly” wood pellets driving mass European deforestation. Illustrative photo by P. Gosselin
Germany’s flagship ARD public broadcasting recently presented a report earlier today about how “CO2 neutral” wood burning is leading to widespread deforestation across northern Europe – a rather embarrassing development for the Europeans, who  recently expressed their condemnation over Brazilian forest policy.
Deforestation up 49%
The ARD’s “Das Erste” reports how satellite images show deforestation has risen 49% since 2016 in Sweden, Finland and the Baltic countries. The reason: “Because of the CO2 targets. That sounds totally crazy but precisely because of the trend to renewable energies is in part responsible for deforestation in Estonia,” says the Das Erste moderator.

Having spent some time working for the EU, Liiana Steinberg explains in the report how she recently returned to her native Estonia and was shocked to see how much deforestation had taken place over the recent years (2:25). “I discovered how the forests no longer exists here left and right.”
For “CO2-neutral” wood pellets
Where once massive hardwoods once stood now grows tiny fir trees. The harvested trees, the report says, were used for wood pellets – a form of renewable green energy. The trees, the pellet industry says, will grow back.
Not only are the forests taking a hit, but so is the wildlife that once inhabited in them. According to Ms. Steinberg, bird life has fallen some 25%. “It’s wasted. Now we have to start all over again.”
Idiots “follow the science”
Climate activists, including the media like ARD, have long insisted that burning trees was good for the climate and environment because the emitted CO2 would simply be recycled back into nature – “follow the science” they insisted again and again.  But they failed to understand that trees, depending on their age, acted as sinks and that some 100 years of stored carbon would be unloaded into the atmosphere in just a matter of hours if burned for heat.
It’s sad that they are just waking up to this (maybe).

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn the surface, looking at warmist blogs and sites can be quite entertaining at times. But reading more closely between the lines, the entertainment always seems to turn into a surreal horror story.For the most rabid among the environmentalists, who strangely never seem to run out of funding, saving the planet means having to deny others life.
I happened to go to Al Gore’s site where he linked to a piece in Seed Magazine called Eating Away. It takes a look at growing human population, the agriculture needed to feed it, its consumption and impact on the planet.
Seed Magazine admits that the population growth rate peaked in the 1980s and that the world has gone from Baby Boom to Baby Bust, much of this trend owing to the education and empowerment of women, especially in developed countries.
But having population growth under control here and there is not enough. Poor countries still have exploding populations. Environmentalists worry about the extent the planet could sustain a population of 9 billion, projected to be reached by 2050.

Apocalyptic scientists fear that the CO2 emission resulting from a growing population will lead to a climate catastrophe. According to biologist E.O. Wilson of Harvard University:
A population growth to 9 billion people alone will add as much as 2 billion metric tons more of carbon dioxide to the greenhouse gas blanket smothering Earth.
In their view, the planet has become too small. So who should be the first to leave?
Target: USA’s 10,000-tonne children
Some already have a clear target in the crosshairs, for example reproductive biologist Roger Short of the University of Melbourne. Seed Magazine writes:

Short goes so far as to call for a halt to future population growth. After all, the most profound way a U.S. citizen can impact climate change is to have fewer children, since every American child born today will add almost 10,000 metric tons of CO2 to the atmosphere under current conditions—five times more than a Chinese child and 160 times more than a baby from Bangladesh.
Having one fewer child would reduce a family’s greenhouse gas impact 20 times more than driving a Toyota Prius, using Energy Star appliances and other environmentally friendly lifestyle choices combined, according to researchers at Oregon State University.
So it’s not really about the number of people on the planet, rather it’s more about who. Future American children have been degraded and reduced by the Greenshirts to grotesque 10,000-tonne planet-threatening monsters.
Andrew Bolt’s recent commentary looks at the psychopathology behind the radical green movement, read Totalitarian Itch.
Seed Magazine writes:
The world’s richest 500 million people produce half of global carbon dioxide emissions, while the poorest 3 billion emit just 7 percent.
Ultimately, the problem isn’t the number of people. It’s what those people do. The average American (just one of 309 million) uses up some 194 pounds of stuff—food, water, plastics, metals and other things—per day, day in and day out.
The poor 3 billion are not the problem. American parents and kids, they’re coming after you. The blood hounds have picked up your scent. You can hear them barking in a not so far away distance.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe blogosphere has started to buzz about alleged proposals in the European Parliament in Europe to criminalize climate science scepticism. Science progresses through scepticism and rigorous testing of hypotheses. Criminalising scepticism would be the same as criminalising science. It would be a going back to the Dark Ages.
Lubos Motl wrote a piece at his blog on these proposals and so I listened to the audio he has available. In the audio a name of an International Academy of Environmental Science http://www.iaes.info/ came up, and whose president is a Professor Abrami. I tracked this down and this is what I found:
Abami is invited to the EU in Brussels:
The European Parliament invited Abrami to explain his proposal at a meeting on July14th in Brussels.
The European Parliament Invitation written by Jo Leien to Professor Abrami of the International Academy of Environmental Science: http://www.iaes.info/pdf/Prof.%20Abrami% 20let.pdf. Excerpt of the invitation:
Dear Professor Abrami,
I am writing to thank you very much for your letter of 13th May 2010 in which you set out the background to the interesting proposal of the International Academy of Environmental Sciences for the creation of an International or European Environmental Criminal Court.
I would like you to present the proposal to the Environment, Public Health, and Food Safety Committee at its meeting on Wednesday 14th July at 4.30 pm in the European Parliament in Brussels, and thereafter to participate in an exchange of views with the members of the Committee…blah blah blah
 
The Meeting’s Agenda
Now here’s the agenda for the 14th July meeting: http://www.iaes.info/pdf/ordine%20giorno%2014-7-10_EN.pdf. The meeting agenda includes topics on biodiversity, and the notorious Pt. No. 14:
14. Presentation of a proposal for an International or European Environmental Criminal Court
Exchange of views with Professor Antonino Abrami, acting President of the International Academy of Environmental Sciences (IAES)

So here we see the EU wants to clamp down real hard with environmental regulation. It’s gaming to set up a dictatorship through environmental regulation. But readers can interpret this how they wish.
Abrami’s Hearing: What is he calling for?
What function could such a court have? Here is the link to the Professor Abrami hearing at ENVI Committee http://www.iaes.info/pdf/ENVI_REL_EN_%20HEARING_DOC2.pdf. Professor Abrami outlines the function of such a proposed court, and an overview of the projects and the urgency of its realization. 
According to Abrami, there’s:
– A growing need for a coherent and coordinated body of legal regulations, bringing more restrictive limitations  in human activities that are inherently dangerous for the ecosystems.
– The adoption of transnational investigations and jurisdictional instruments meant to enforce environmental protection.
Abrami says:
It is necessary to consider the development of the “thirst” for knowledge of preventive and repressive measures within a system of Justice that prescribes effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.
Among other things, he asks:
Whether, and in what terms, great environmental disasters which destroyed eco-systems and /or human lives can fall under the category of Crimes Against Humanity?
I guess that means; “you mess with them bats, then you’re messing with the EU Justice”. That’s pretty radical. I certainly would not want to be that poor bloke who messed up on that BP platform.
Abrami is definitely calling for a draconian, radical clampdown for environmental protection. But in the hearing’s record I see no mention of clamping down on scepticism. I’m not a lawyer and I didn’t dissect the text. Maybe someone else will find something I missed.
In the meantime, I guess I can keep blogging without feeling like a criminal.

"When I was an undergrad learning geology, the maxim that was thumped into me wasn’t how to build a mine or drill for oil and gas, it was simply: “The present is the key to the past.” The thing that took a while to accept was that the past was really, really, long. It’s hard to comprehend the scale of geologic time: the timespan for continents to crash together and rip apart, for tiny sea creatures to live, die and condense into kilometres of limestone, or streams to carve epic canyons carrying mountains to the sea. We use comparisons our minds can grasp, such as if all cosmological time was the length of string or compressed into a single year (humans beings appear in the final six hours).  But kids deal with billions of years without a problem – 64 billion is my son’s favourite number. So, when I explained geologic time to my children as we travelled to the last students’ climate rally in Melbourne, they got it: geologically, things happen slowly. And yes, there are exceptions, volcanoes, landslides, earthquakes, to name but a few, but I am talking about the fundamental processes: mountain building, sediment creating, climate changing kind of processes. Although geologists can handle deep time, they really can’t handle unprecedented rates. It took life millions of years to change the composition of the atmosphere first time round. Granted, that was 2 billion years ago and times, clearly, have changed. However, through all the corridors of conceivable time, evidence indicates the climate has never, ever, changed as rapidly as we see today. Claude Albritton once wrote: It has not been easy for man to face time. Some, in recoiling from the fearsome prospect of time’s abyss, have toppled backwards into the abyss of ignorance.” And ignorance, particularly wilful and entrenched ignorance, is a much harder rock to smash. A fundamental tenet of the scientific method is that there is never certainty in science, only observation, experimentation, hypothesis refinement and the empirical accumulation of evidence. Our past and present leaders exploit that fact, warning of the dangers of scientific consensus as if it reeks of climate conspiracists. Yes, there have been warmer periods and colder periods in the geologic record and while the effects may be similar, the various causes over time differ. Tony Abbott recently stated that despite there being no humans around in the Jurassic to burn stuff and produce carbon dioxide, incredibly, the climate was even warmer then - ergo manmade climate change is “absolute crap”. He failed to comprehend the other mitigating factors, like the volcanoes in the southern hemisphere spewing out gases, including, wait for it … carbon dioxide. Our Earth is immensely complex and scientists the world over are doing their best to understand it. So when they form a consensus, we should listen. Perhaps we need to explain climate change to sceptical politicians as we would to very small children. Here, let me try. The sun is very, very hot. Heat comes from the sun and enters the Earth’s atmosphere. But, some of that heat bounces off the Earth and heads back out to space. And before the heat escapes off into space, gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, capture and absorb it. Consequently, the atmosphere heats up – warms if you will. More heat-absorbing gases in the atmosphere, the greater the impact. It’s really not rocket science, simply Earth science. Unlike many adults, kids know they have a lot to learn and they actively seek knowledge, they ask teachers, parents, peers. I don’t get it, they say how does it work? Kids love to learn, they are inquisitive, excited and determined – all the characteristics of good scientists. Kind of like all the good climate scientists out there churning out increasingly alarming reports. While politicians debate the cause, and incredibly, even the validity of climate change, scientists are measuring the effect. Because that’s what scientists do, they measure, they experiment, and they learn. It’s been stated that children will learn nothing from attending climate rallies except how to join the unemployment queue and that is fundamentally wrong. On Friday, children at my kid’s school will spend the morning discussing the protest, what it is about, why it is important and what it is hoped will be achieved. They’ll learn about the atmosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere and how they interact with the biosphere – namely us. While the past has impacted the future and will continue to do so for some time, decisions we make today are critical in ensuring a safe and sustainable world. Our government is showing an appalling lack of climate leadership, that has just been made glaring obvious on a global scale, with our PM’s decision to not attend the UN climate summit. But, on Friday, schoolchildren will show that the present is the key to the future. And as a scientist, academic and a parent, I cannot be prouder that my children are standing up for their future. • Emma White is a hydrogeologist and freelance writer"
"Atmospherically speaking, Brexit will certainly dominate Labour’s conference, as it has for the Liberal Democrats, and will for the Tories. All the conversations outside the hall, in fringe meetings, on beaches, in pubs, either side of the karaoke (activists love microphones, no one knows why) will revolve around it. The “Love Corbyn, Hate Brexit” tote bags will have been updated. “Remain, Reform, Revolt” on one side, and – optimistically – “Labour can stop Brexit” on the other; there will be no shortage of views as to how. Labour is, with or without Jo Swinson’s missteps, plainly the party of remain: in its membership and its voters; in its stated policy of backing a second referendum; in most of its MPs and the bulk of its shadow cabinet; in its visceral reaction to Boris Johnson and his crash-and-burn fantasies. Yet the leadership is still clinging to the dated electoral calculation that it can only win if they pick up votes from both leavers and remainers, and the idea that it is possible, if you’re clever enough, to simultaneously support both outcomes.  This will come to a head over the issue of a Labour-negotiated exit deal. The Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Organisation (Tulo) reiterated on Tuesday night their determination to go into an election with the promise of negotiating their own Left Brexit, then taking that to the public for a vote. This apparently makes sense within the union DNA, negotiating a deal, then advising their members to vote for or against it. It sure as hell doesn’t make sense to anyone else, and it is not a tenable manifesto position, torching what should be their strongest argument: we can make this Tory-confected nightmare end. With John McDonnell now as openly pro-remain as he has ever been, this crack has snaked to the top of the party and cannot be papered over – especially with 91 motions submitted by constituency Labour parties (CLPs), the vast majority of which are calling for Labour to explicitly back remain. Remember the success of last year: 150 mainly pro-remain motions were composited in a tense, five-hour meeting into the single motion that Keir Starmer announced to a standing ovation: Labour became, in September 2018, a party that believed in a second referendum, with remain on the ballot. This is probably the most significant achievement any anti-Brexit campaign has ever managed, most of the other hurdles to Brexit having been erected by Brexiters themselves. Never underestimate how much people can get done when they understand the rules. However, Lexit has one more manoeuvre up its sleeve; this is where it all goes a bit The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. There are rules, and then there are deeper laws. There’s no way to head off a repeat of last year’s remain roar, but an alternative motion can change the frame, especially if it’s been submitted by more CLPs. Explicitly pushed by Momentum, and encouraged by the leadership, Labour for a Green New Deal have got 128 CLPs calling for the party to commit to zero emissions by 2030. It’s not quite “nearly double” the 91 Brexit-related motions that have been submitted this year, as a rather bellicose announcement from the New Dealers claimed, but they could certainly make a claim as bold as “they have more”. From the outside, it is impossible to imagine why these issues would ever be set in competition against one another: if there’s a remainer in the UK who doesn’t also want to tackle climate change, I’ve yet to encounter them. Indeed, one of the core arguments for staying in the EU is that climate change is best fought collectively, and the EU’s proudest moments (unless you count “not having a war”) have been its environmental achievements. The economist Ann Pettifor, the architect of the Green New Deal, is fiercely critical of the EU but a stalwart remainer, identifying these institutions as the bulwark against the rise of fascism, which is the major threat, both to social democracies and the environment. But this is a coded red-on-red battle: Lexiters versus left remainers (and, indeed, remainers across the membership spectrum, which is now pretty much all of it), struggling for control of the narrative. This is a very common line at the local level when criticism of the Brexit project, and Jeremy Corbyn’s failure to oppose it, comes up against loyalists who will hear no word against him. It is that trivial people fight to stay in the EU, while serious people are fighting for the environment, whose growing emergency will make our obsession with treaties and institutions look like deckchair-tidying on the Titanic. It’s a completely false binary, but a very convenient one, since it equates seriousness of political purpose with unquestioning loyalty to the party’s leadership. But it’s not without jeopardy. If this conference is successfully branded as a fight for climate justice, that won’t make Brexit go away. It won’t reduce the urgency of coming up with a manifesto position that voters can actually understand, and it won’t meet the democratic duty towards the members. There isn’t time for this division to play out subtly. It cannot be bumped down the list of priorities. Plainly, all these ambitions can work in concert, and become stronger and more inexorable when they do: you can fight for regional renewal founded on dispersed green infrastructure, and for a genuine and sustainable prosperity that’s based on an entirely different model of energy creation, at the same time as taking your place at the centre of an international rule-based order whose own green revolution will be reinforced by transnational solidarity. The tergiversations and control-freakery of the leadership have turned this into a false choice between climate justice and remain, but that loyalty-or‑bust reasoning may not survive the transparency of the conference floor. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
"The Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, has called on Australia to be “far more ambitious” in reducing greenhouse gases, linking the climate crisis to extreme weather events in the Pacific including drought and bushfires in Australia. On the final official day of his visit to Australia, Bainimarama nominated the “varied level of ambition when it comes to confronting the threat of climate change” as a key difference between the two countries and called for everyone to “unite behind the science” of limiting global heating to 1.5C.  Bainimarama’s visit follows his heavy criticism of Scott Morrison at the Pacific Islands Forum, where he said the Australian prime minister had insulted and alienated Pacific leaders over his failure to back stronger emissions targets. In a speech at the Australian War College in Canberra, Bainimarama said Fiji was seeking “common ground” with Australia, praising the two countries’ shared values and thanking Australia for its support in the aftermath of cyclone Winston. But Bainimarama said that nations – as with families – “only thrive when those living under the same roof are considerate of each other”, acting “in the collective interest of the household and not just their own”. A “degree of frankness that might sometimes offend” is essential to preserving any relationship, he said. “I understand that politics is the art of the possible. I understand the depth of feeling in coal-producing communities in Australia and the wider economic imperatives at state and federal level. “But I also hope that we can eventually find more common ground in our vuvale [partnership] on the climate issue. “Because it is the greatest threat to our security in the Pacific and for my own people, and other Pacific Islanders, the impacts are really starting to bite. “Not only extreme weather events like Winston but the rising seas and changes to agriculture and fisheries that threaten our food security and our livelihoods.” Bainimarama said that millions of Australians are also bearing the brunt of climate change, in recent bushfires, ongoing drought and severe water shortages. He said the “steady deterioration in the state of the only planet we have” means that all nations need to be more ambitious in cutting greenhouse gas emissions. “We must all unite behind the science and the IPCC report that calls for the average global temperature to be capped at 1.5C above that of the pre-industrial age.” Bainimarama called on Australia to “join us in stepping up our collective response to the climate threat”, including by putting the IPCC report back on the agenda at COP25 in Chile in December. “Fiji and the other Pacific nations have already declared a crisis in our own region in the Kainaki II Declaration arising from last month’s meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu. “This was the strongest declaration from the PIF on climate and we appreciate Australia’s support as a signatory to the declaration.” Bainimarama suggested Australia could also help Fiji with renewable energy research, development and investment, reduce dependency on fossil fuels and increase carbon stocks through better management of landscapes and soils. Guardian Australia reported last week that Morrison will not attend the upcoming UN climate action summit despite him being in America to visit the Trump administration at the time – sending the foreign minister, Marise Payne, instead – because speaking slots were reserved for countries announcing new emissions reduction targets or financial commitments to the UN Green Climate Fund. On Sunday Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, recommitted to a target of net zero emissions by the middle of the century. He warned the Coalition’s target of 26% reduction by 2030 is “unanimously regarded as grossly inadequate, [and is] consistent instead with more like 3C or 3.5C of global warming, which would be utterly catastrophic”."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThanks to the Energiewende (transition to green energies), which is tantamount to a vegan energy diet, Germany’s electricity prices have soared 27% over the past decade to become the most expensive in Europe, if not the world, according to the STROM-REPORT.

Source: Infografik “Strompreise in Europa 2020”, STROM-REPORT.de, Creative Commons License CC-BY-ND
Taxes, surcharges and a catalogue of other fees make up 53.6% of Germany’s electricity price, only Denmark has a higher share at 67.8%. Only five European countries have seen electricity prices drop over the last 10 years.
Soaring prices in Latvia and Great Britain
No country has seen electricity rates rise more than in Latvia and Great Britain, where the price has risen a whopping 55% and 46% respectively over the past 10 years.
What’s behind the high electricity prices? According to the STROM-REPORT: “The biggest intra-European differences are caused by taxes and duties. The EU average is 36.6%. But the values vary from country to country and are highest in Denmark with 63.7%. In Germany, where the government-induced price components also account for more than half [52.3%] of the price, the EEG levy, which enables the expansion of renewable energies, is included at 21.5%.”

"The end of London fashion week was somewhat sombre on Tuesday evening. It culminated in Extinction Rebellion’s funeral march calling for the event to end in its current form, with the group criticising the clothing industry as a major offender in the climate crisis. Extinction Rebellion kept to the drama of which fashion is so fond. Starting at Trafalgar Square, a group of about 200 people – some in funereal outfits complete with black veils – gathered around two black coffins. “RIP LFW 1983-2019” read one, while the other simply said “Our Future”. They were accompanied by a live band as they made their way up to 180 The Strand, a venue that hosted fashion week shows.  Here they laid the coffin down, with participants throwing flowers on it. A speech urging the industry to bring an end to a system where each season means new clothes was perhaps less well received. The crowd also stopped outside the flagship store of H&M, a giant of fast fashion. Safia Minney, the founder of Fair Trade clothing company People Tree made an impassioned speech about how fashion needed to change its ways. “I’m calling on London fashion week to have the courage and the strength to change everything it does,” she said, while behind her, standing hands outstretched, several young people dressed in red robes. The protesters were mainly young. Mohan Keryk, 17, said the action was the start of things to come: “We have to continuously be active. We need the change.” Tolmeia Gregory, 19, who described herself as an environmental activist and sustainable fashion blogger, said: “There’s a big mindset shift that needs to happen. It’s an emergency, but a lot of people aren’t there yet.” The group maintains that it appreciates the creativity of fashion. This was certainly clear by the outfits on display – one young male protester wore a police officer’s helmet, high heels and gloves with crystals, and another had a picture hat and floor-length black cape covering their face, decorated with only sunglasses. Earlier in the day, the British Fashion Council’s Positive Fashion initiative – which focuses on sustainability, diversity and human rights – hosted a panel discussion. The event was standing room only. Experts including the journalist Tamsin Blanchard, the model and environmentalist Arizona Muse, Extinction Rebellion’s Bel Jacobs and the designer Phoebe English discussed issues around the climate emergency. The panel discussed how fast fashion was the biggest polluter, with Jacobs commenting she would “love to give the Heading for Extinction talk at Boohoo”. A rental model, growing in scope within high fashion, was mooted as an alternative option for the sector. Eighteen months ago, English took a two-season hiatus from fashion shows to reboot. “The more you read, the more horrendous the realisation becomes. For a time I was waking up and saying: ‘Why am I doing this? What is the actual point of what I do?’” she said. “It was an experiment – I was like: ‘I’ll try this thing, and maybe I’ll have to close down.’ But then, I found hunting for the solutions really exciting and reinvigorating.” English argued that the most important objective was “making excess unfashionable”. The funeral is the culmination of Extinction Rebellion’s actions at London fashion week. They also staged a die-in outside one of the show venues on Friday and a swarm outside Victoria Beckham’s show on Sunday, with protesters holding placards reading “fashion = ecocide” and “the ugly truth about fashion”. The group is targeting the fashion industry for its actual environmental impact. The United Nations has said it uses more energy than the aviation and shipping industry combined, with a projected 63% increase in the global consumption of apparel by 2030. Extinction Rebellion says the industry also gives the impression that the world is not in a climate emergency. “Culture is complicit in our destruction, when it should be taking responsibility for people getting their heads around this existential problem,” said Extinction Rebellion’s Sara Arnold ."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Australian Bureau of Meterorology has just released its latest ENSO Report. It starts out with:
The La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean has strengthened further over the past two weeks. All computer models surveyed by the Bureau predict the La Niña will last through the southern hemisphere spring, with the majority indicating the event will persist into at least early 2011.

The graphic above shows the 30-day moving SOI has reached a new high, even already surpassing the peak reached in January 2008. The following graphic in the BOM report shows sub-surface temperature from May-August, with the cool water progressing to the surface.
The BOM writes:
In the central Pacific, the sub-surface of the ocean is more than 6°C cooler than normal for this time of the year, on a weekly scale.

La Niña depresses average global surface temperatures, which will soon show up in the months ahead in the monthly temperature statistics. Dr Roy Spencer’s site here shows surface temperatures now dipping below last year’s level.
Forecasters are busy revising their projections
Meanwhile, forecasters have been busy revising their earlier projections. Here’s the forecast made back on July 16, 2010, i.e about 2 months ago. The blue line dips to about -1.7.
July 16, 2010 projections
Two months later, in their latest September 14 projections, the blue line now dips down to -1,9.

This La Niña is shaping up to be deeper than previously expected. Does that mean we’re headed for global cooling? No it doesn’t. This is just one ocean cycle. Maybe a few more EL Nino/La Niña flip-flops will tell us more, meaning we have to wait another 5 or 10 years.

"Our built environment is becoming one big computer. “Smartness” is coming to saturate our stores, workplaces, homes, cities. As we go about our daily lives, data is made, stored, analyzed and used to make algorithmic inferences about us that in turn structure our experience of the world. Computation encircles us as a layer, dense and interconnected. If our parents and our grandparents lived with computers, we live inside them. A growing chorus of activists, journalists and scholars are calling attention to the dangers of digital enclosure. Employers are using algorithmic tools to surveil and control workers. Cops are using algorithmic tools to surveil and control communities of color. And there is no shortage of dystopian possibilities on the horizon: landlords evicting tenants with “smart locks”, health insurers charging higher premiums because your Fitbit says you don’t exercise enough.  Digitization doesn’t just pose a risk to people, however. It also poses a risk to the planet. July was the hottest month on record. Large chunks of the Arctic are melting. In India, more than half a billion people face water shortages. Putting computation everywhere directly contributes to this crisis. Digitization is a climate disaster: if corporations and governments succeed in making vastly more of our world into data, there will be less of a world left for us to live in. To understand the relationship between data and climate, the best place to start is machine learning (ML). Billions of dollars are being spent on researching, developing, and deploying ML because major breakthroughs in the past decade have made it a powerful tool for pattern recognition, whether analyzing faces or predicting consumer preferences. ML “learns” by training on large quantities of data. Computers are stupid: babies know what a face is within the first few months of being alive. For a computer to know what a face is, it must learn by looking at millions of pictures of faces. This is a demanding process. It takes place inside the data centers we call the cloud, and much of the electricity that powers the cloud is generated by burning fossil fuels. As a result, ML has a large carbon footprint. In a recent paper that made waves in the ML community, a team at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, found that training a model for natural-language processing – the field that helps “virtual assistants” like Alexa understand what you’re saying – can emit as much as 626,155lb of carbon dioxide. That’s about the same amount produced by flying roundtrip between New York and Beijing 125 times. Training models isn’t the only way ML contributes to the cooking of our planet. It has also stimulated a hunger for data that is probably the single biggest driver of the digitization of everything. Corporations and governments now have an incentive to acquire as much data as possible, because that data, with the help of ML, might yield valuable patterns. It might tell them who to fire, who to arrest, when to perform maintenance on a machine or how to promote a new product. One of the best ways to make more data is to put small connected computers everywhere: Cisco predicts there will be 28.5bn networked devices by 2022. Aside from the energy required to manufacture and maintain those devices, the data they produce will live in the carbon-intensive cloud. Data centers currently consume 200 terawatt hours per year – roughly the same amount as South Africa. Anders Andrae, a widely cited researcher at Huawei, tells me that number is likely to grow 4-5 times by 2030. This would put the cloud on par with Japan, the fourth-biggest energy consumer on the planet. What can be done to curb the carbon costs of data? Greenpeace has long pushed cloud providers to switch to renewable energy sources and improve efficiency. These efforts have seen some success: the use of renewables by data centers has grown substantially. Meanwhile, efficiency gains from better techniques and bigger economies of scale have moderated the cloud’s power consumption in recent years. When it comes to ML, a group of researchers are calling for a more energy-conscious approach, which they call “Green AI”. These are encouraging trends, and tech workers themselves are likely to play a key role in advancing them: Amazon employees have been organizing for a climate plan since late last year, and they recently announced a global walkout for 20 September. Among their demands is for the company to commit to zero emissions by 2030 and to stop selling cloud services to fossil fuel companies. But it’s clear that confronting the climate crisis will require something more radical than just making data greener. That’s why we should put another tactic on the table: making less data. We should reject the assumption that our built environment must become one big computer. We should erect barriers against the spread of “smartness” into all of the spaces of our lives. To decarbonize, we need to decomputerize. This proposal will no doubt be met with charges of Luddism. Good: Luddism is a label to embrace. The Luddites were heroic figures and acute technological thinkers. They smashed textile machinery in 19th-century England because they had the capacity to perceive technology “in the present tense”, in the words of the historian David F Noble. They didn’t wait patiently for the glorious future promised by the gospel of progress. They saw what certain machines were doing to them in the present tense – endangering their livelihoods – and dismantled them. We are often sold a similar bill of goods: big tech companies talk incessantly about how “AI” and digitization will bring a better future. In the present tense, however, putting computers everywhere is bad for most people. It enables advertisers, employers and cops to exercise more control over us – in addition to helping heat the planet. Fortunately, there are latter-day Luddites working to stem the tide. Community groups like the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition are organizing to shut down algorithmic policing programs. A growing campaign to ban the government use of facial recognition software has won important victories in San Francisco and Somerville, Massachusetts, while workers at Amazon are calling for the company to stop selling such software to law enforcement. And in the streets of Hong Kong, protesters are developing techniques for evading the algorithmic gaze, using lasers to confuse facial recognition cameras and cutting down “smart” lamp-posts equipped with monitoring devices. These are just a few possible sources of inspiration for a broader movement for decomputerization, one that pursues social and ecological goals simultaneously. The premise of the Green New Deal is that we can make society greener and more equitable at the same time – that we can democratize as we decarbonize. We should apply the same logic to our digital sphere. Preventing a local police department from constructing an ML-powered panopticon is a matter of algorithmic, social and climate justice. As they used to say in the 1960s: one struggle, many fronts. For such a struggle to be successful, however, resistance is not enough. We also need a vision of the future we want. Again, the history of the Luddites can be helpful. In 1812, a group of Yorkshire Luddites sent a factory owner a letter promising continued action until “the House of Commons passes an Act to put down all Machinery hurtful to Commonality”. Following their example, we might derive a simple Luddite principle for democratizing technology: we should destroy machinery hurtful to the common good and build machinery helpful to it. What does this mean in practice? It’s hard to think of anything more hurtful to our common life than heating large portions of the planet beyond habitable levels. Privacy advocates have long called for companies to restrict their collection of data to the minimum necessary to perform a service – a principle now enshrined in the GDPR, the EU’s omnibus data regulation. A 21st-century Luddism should embrace this principle but go further. What matters is not only how much data a service collects, but what imprint that service leaves upon the world – and thus whether it should be performed at all. Decomputerization doesn’t mean no computers. It means that not all spheres of life should be rendered into data and computed upon. Ubiquitous “smartness” largely serves to enrich and empower the few at the expense of the many, while inflicting ecological harm that will threaten the survival and flourishing of billions of people. Precisely which computational activities should be preserved in a less computerized world is a matter for those billions of people themselves to decide. The question of whether a particular machine hurts or helps the common good can only be answered by the commons itself. It can only be answered collectively, through the experiment and argument of democracy. The zero-carbon commonwealth of the future must empower people to decide not just how technologies are built and implemented, but whether they’re built and implemented. Progress is an abstraction that has done a lot of damage over the centuries. Luddism urges us to consider: progress towards what and progress for whom? Sometimes a technology shouldn’t exist. Sometimes the best thing to do with a machine is to break it."
"We are sadly accustomed by now to the idea that our reliance on oil and gas causes random but predictable outbreaks of flood, firestorm and drought. The weekend’s news from the Gulf is a grim reminder that depending on oil leads inevitably to war too. Depending on how far back you want to stand, the possibility of war with Iran stems from a calculated decision by Tehran or its Houthi allies to use drones and missiles on Saudi installations, or on the infantile rage that drove President Trump to tear up a meticulously worked out and globally sponsored accord with Iran and to wreck its economy. But in either case, if you really take in the whole picture, the image is rendered in crude, black tones: were it not for oil, none of this would be happening. Were it not for oil, the Middle East would not be awash in expensive weapons; its political passions would matter no more to the world than those of any other corner of our Earth. Were it not for oil, we would not be beholden to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – indeed, we might be able to bring ourselves to forthrightly condemn its savagery. Were it not for oil, we would never have involved ourselves in a ruinous war with Iraq, destabilising an entire region. (I remember the biting slogan on a sign from an early protest against the war with Saddam Hussein: “How did our oil end up under their sand?”) Conveniently, the largest ever demonstrations about energy policy are scheduled to take place this Friday We’ve come to take for granted that this is how the world works. Within hours of the pictures of devastated oilfields, we had “explainers” from our various news outlets reminding us of the realities of our predicament: with Aramco largely offline, the world’s spare capacity was mostly gone. Hence oil prices would spike upwards. Hence there would be damage to the world’s economy. Reporters quoted gloating Revolutionary Guards from Iran and concerned Opec officials, and stock analysts waiting breathlessly to see how Wall Street would react. The drama seemed choreographed because we’ve seen it so often that everyone knows their parts. But this iteration of the opera is different in one way. An unspoken truth hangs over the whole predictable scene: this will be the first oil war in an age when we widely recognise that we needn’t depend on oil any longer. The last time we started down this path, in Iraq more than 15 years ago, a solar panel cost 10 times what it does today. Wind power was still in its infancy. No one you knew had ever driven an electric car. Today the sun and the breeze are the cheapest ways to generate power on our Earth, and Chinese factories are churning out electric vehicles. That is to say, we have the technology available to us that would render this kind of warmongering transparently absurd even to the most belligerent soul. We haven’t come close to fully deploying that technology, of course – and unlike 15 years ago we understand why. Thanks to great investigative reporting, we now know that the oil industry knew all about climate change decades ago, but instead of acknowledging it and helping us move to a new energy future, they instead spent billions building the scaffolding of deceit and denial and disinformation that kept us locked in the present paradigm. Just as they have profited from sea-level rise and Arctic melt, so they will profit from the war now starting to unfold. (Right on schedule, the share prices of fracking firms and oil majors all jumped perkily northwards on Monday morning.) If it happens, this war, like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, will cost untold lives, most of them civilian. It will also, like those conflicts, cost trillions of dollars. Imagine if we had spent those trillions of dollars not on cruise missiles and up-armoured Humvees, but on solar farms and offshore wind turbines. Imagine if we’d stuck insulation in the walls of every building in the US, and built a robust network of electric vehicle chargers. That’s not a fanciful vision – it’s exactly what legislation such as the Green New Deal envisions in the US – and indeed there are very similar proposals in the UK and Canada, and across the EU. But we are told that the Green New Deal is an impossibly expensive boondoggle – by precisely the same people now eager to pour blood and treasure down a hole in the desert. A trillion dollars spent on war returns nothing except trauma and misery; a trillion dollars spent on solar panels leaves behind a nation that gets its power for free each morning when the sun comes up. That new world is coming – in fact, you can sense its arrival in the somewhat muted reaction to the oilfield drones and missiles. Yes, the price of oil “spiked”. But it’s still historically low, because the planet is awash with oil – and that’s in part because demand growth has begun to soften. The day will come when blocking the strait of Hormuz or blowing up a petrol station will be an empty threat – and that will be a good day indeed. We can speed up that process immeasurably by pushing our politicians to act much faster on the transition to clean energy. There’s no mystery about the necessary steps. Big support for renewables, rigorous “keep it in the ground” policies, making polluters pay for the damage they’ve done: pretty much precisely the plans the Democrats are rolling out as they campaign. But we need the will to make these things actually happen. Conveniently, the largest ever demonstrations about energy policy are scheduled to take place this Friday. The climate strikes touched off by Greta Thunberg and her young colleagues around the world go multigenerational on 20 September (you can find the closest ones to you at globalclimatestrike.net). They are designed to deal with the greatest existential threat humans have ever faced: the rapid heating of our Earth. But they also serve as a chance to say no to this and other oil wars. We have to do it fast – if we don’t, we’ll just go from fighting wars over oil to fighting wars over survival on a fast-degrading planet. No one will ever fight a war over access to sunshine – what would a country do, set up enormous walls to shade everyone else’s panels? (Giant walls are hard to build – just ask Trump.) Fossil fuels are concentrated in a few places, giving those who live atop them enormous power; renewable energy can be found everywhere, the birthright of all humans. A world that runs on sun and wind is a world that can relax. • Bill McKibben is an author and Schumann Distinguished Scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College, Vermont.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA survey appearing in the Journal Global Environmental Change shows climate scientists fly more often than other researchers. 
On average, climate researchers travel by plane more often each year than other scientists, the large, international survey and experimental study of academic travel found.
Especially professors, fly more than other researchers.
The paper’s abstract follows:




Aviation is a fast-growing sector, releasing more carbon dioxide per passenger kilometre than other transport modes. For climate change researchers, work-related travel – including for conferences and fieldwork – is a major carbon-emitting activity. At the same time, many argue that climate scientists have an important role in curbing their own aviation emissions to align their practices with their assertions in relation to emissions reduction. We examine the tensions between competing professional demands in relation to flying; measure levels of flying by climate and non-climate researchers; assess influences on choices and attitudes; and consider how information provision and structural changes might enable changes in practice. Study 1 entails a large, international survey of flying undertaken by climate change (including sustainability and environmental science) researchers and those from other disciplines (N = 1408). Study 2 tests effects of varying information provision on researchers’ behavioural intentions and policy support to reduce flying (N = 362). Unexpectedly, we find climate change researchers – particularly professors – fly more than other researchers, but are also more likely to have taken steps to reduce or offset their flying. Providing information about the impacts of aviation increases behavioural intentions and support for institutional policies to reduce flying, particularly amongst more pro-environmental respondents. However, while attitudinal factors (e.g., personal norm) predict willingness to reduce flying, structural/social factors (e.g., family commitments, location) are more important in predicting actual flying behaviour. Recent initiatives to develop a low-carbon and more inclusive research culture within climate science and the broader research community thus need to be supported by broader policies and technologies to encourage and enable low-carbon and avoided travel.




More than 1,400 scientists from 59 countries are being asked how often they fly and why. Most respondents came from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Australia. Climate experts fly on average five times a year according to the study.
Experienced climate scientists fly 9 times a year
Also air travel becomes more frequent with increasing professional experience. Climate research professors fly nine times a year on average.
Lorraine Whitmarsh, environmental psychologist at the University of Bath, UK, who led the study, said: “These figures are pretty blatant and should be a wake-up call for the entire scientific community.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe AGW religion in Germany is in deep trouble. Consensus is crumbling. the science is coming under attack.
It’s taken a awhile, but slowly and surely, Germany, once the premier power in science, is beginning to ask questions again. When lectures and seminars questioning climate science take place within academic circles and at German universities, then you know something is afoot.
Skeptic blog Readers Edition posted yesterday a clip of a seminar here by Professors Dr Klaus Landfried of Heidelberg and Dr Werner Kirstein of the Institute for Geography at the University of Leipzig before an audience at the University of Leipzig. The seminar is titled:
 “Where’s The Climate Change?”

Dr Kirstein opens the seminar and expresses his surprise that so many people are in attendance, some travelling from far away. The introductory part is then handed over to Professor Dr Klaus Landfried.
Professor Dr Landfried reminds us that a university is one of the few places in society where questions can be asked freely, where answers are searched, and then questioned again, and that without any restrictions, in an environment where debate is free.  Landfried says, “Religions have a hard time dealing with that.”

Landfried sets the tone of the seminar in no uncertain terms. This is a seminar that is absent of Rahmstorfian rules and Schellnhuber suppression.
At the 7:10 mark Dr Landfried slams any peer review process run by a good ol boys network.
In the world of science it is unavoidable, as humans are involved, that there are always attempts to portray truths as unacceptable, or to try to suppress them using methods that have nothing to do with science, and perhaps to even slander persons in an attempt shut them up. One method used here is to claim that everything that is good must go through peer review.
Dr Landfried delivers his speech forcefully, slamming peer review processes that involve a cartel of ideas, where some participants are excluded, and the others focus on concentrating their power. He reminds us that the misuse of peer review has always been a problem in science. Conflict in science is nothing new. For example, oncology has long been in bitter dispute.
At the 13-minute mark, Dr. Werner Kirstein starts his presentation. He addresses three main topics:
1. Are the IPCC model-based climate projections something to be taken seriously?
– uncertainties
– model deficiencies
– quotes Neils Bohr: “Prognoses are always problematic, especially when they look at the future.”
2. Sea level rise and glaciers
– Satellite photos show that Bangladesh is actually growing 20 sq km per year.
– Bangladesh land area is 44,000 sq km more than 10,000 years ago (4.4 sq km growth per year).
– Axel Mörner and Vincent Gray say the IPCC is corrupt.
– Rahmstorf projects 140 cm rise, Fred Singer 18 cm, the GFZ 2mm/yr, Mörner max. 20cm by 2100.
– North German coast: no detection of any acceleration in sea level rise.
– For the Pacific Micronesia, tectonics are at play.
– Islands on the Carolina Plate are sinking because the Carolina Plate is being forced down.
– Slams Rahmstorf’s and Schellnhuber’s Potsdam Institute for disinformation.
– Observations vs models, nature vs IPCC.
– Glaciers have retreated and advanced throughout time.
– In the last 10,000 years, glaciers have been smaller than they are today 2/3 of the time.
– Arctic ice is also within boundaries of natural variation.
3. The controversy and politics of climate change
Many meteorologists say about climate science: ” That’s political and has nothing to do with science.”
Dr. Kirstein: “Climate change? – That’s political and has nothing to do with normal science, it’s post-normal science.” With post-normal science, politics is at the forefront and science is just a tool to promote and drive “good” policy” by spreading fear and sticking to a dogma. In the early 1980s, “scientists” projected that all trees would die in Europe by 2005. Dr Kirstein then quotes Hans von Storch:
Climate science is not normal. It’s post-normal.
Post-normal science is always for a good cause or a political agenda. The target is to achieve de-industrialiasation – The Green Economy – The Great Transformation. The modus operandi: by spreading fear. Kirstein then quotes Maurice Strong, John Houghton, Stephen Schneider, and explains some of the recent and infamous PR scare campaigns. There’s even a Climate Change Hotel and tourism in Greenland where you can actually “see climate change taking place”.
After viewing Dr Kirstein’s presentation, it is absolutely no wonder that Hal Lewis called “climate science” the greatest fraud he’s ever seen. Dr Rahmstorf, Dr Schellnhuber, your sham is up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith all the talk about heat waves and alleged record high global temps, one could be led to think that manmade global warming is real and that we’d better install the mercury lights made by Philipps and use electricity made by GE wind generators, and invest in green commodities packaged by Al Gore.
As the following graphic shows, it was a warm year globally. Careful though, some of them red dots are exaggerated in my view, as we know there are lots of instrumental issues and dubious computational methods involved (see  here).
And the media are still going wild with all the hype about heat waves. Is the globe really hot everywhere now?
And will it remain hot for the rest of the year? The answer is NO! 
The next chart shows the temperatures for the period July 4-11. Here, as Steve Goddard shows at WUWT here, 5% more pixels were cool than warm. The globe has definitely cooled over the last weeks, as it enters a La Nina phase.
The first six months were dominated by the recently fizzled out El Nino. Data now show we’ve entered a La Nina phase (see next chart), and models show with high certainty that we are now headed for a good cooling off, which means headlines of a record-setting 2010 were premature. Here’s the ENSO model forecasts for the next 6 months:
Now let’s look at the southern hemisphere. The following 3 graphics show the forecast for the week ahead, July 17 – 24. Do you see any heat waves in South America? I wonder if we’ll get any press releases on the extreme cold gripping South America? And have we heard anything about Antarctic sea ice almost reaching a record high?
And here’s the outlook for Africa, also more on the cool side:
Australia has reported record cold temps. What’s ahead for Australia in the days ahead? No heat-waves there either.
Okay, maybe I’m cherry picking. What’s ahead for the globe for the next 6 months or so? Here’s the global outlook according to NOAA:

To me it looks like a lot of cooling off going on. Again, all this hype about 2010 being the hottest is about to get doused with cold water. It was premature. I suspect this was known at NOAA, and so they rushed out their overheated press releases while they could. Don’t expect to see any more for quite some time. These headlines and press releases were to help Harry Reid (God forbid he gets his crap and trade bill through at the end of the month).
Joe Bastardi goes into the forecast at his European website here.  Here are some things he says:
The coming drop of global temperatures over the next year, to levels not seen since the 1990s, should put to an end to the AGW argument for good except for the most radical elements.
However, also coming is major drop of .5 to .7C in the global temps which will take us below normal for a time.
And Joe adds:
In addition, the reason for the drop will easily be linked with the cooling of the Pacific, which will remain in its cool stage for the next 30 years. Once the Atlantic, still warm, goes into its cool stage in 10-15 years, global temps will fall even further, back to where they were in the 1970s.
How cold was it in the 1970s? The link that follows is a clip that will tell you.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nprY2jSI0Ds&feature=related
It even includes Stephen Schneider as a young whippersnapper acknowledging the coming ice age, and displaying his complete ignorance of global commerce, thinking every country is isolated from each other like North Korea.
There you have it. We’ll find out soon enough who’s right, and who’s full of it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScientists continue to document severe discrepancies between climate modeling and observations in newly published scientific papers.
1. Models run too hot and yield “unrealistically high” estimates of the climate’s sensitivity to CO2 forcing.
McKitrick and Christy, 2020
“All model runs warmed faster than observations in the lower troposphere and midtroposphere, in the tropics, and globally. On average, and in most individual cases, the trend difference is significant.”
“[W]e present evidence that the distribution of ECS [equilibrium climate sensitivity] values across the model is unrealistically high.”
2. Models can’t decide if cloud feedbacks are positive or negative. Half think they’re positive, the other half negative.
Block et al., 2020
“Very intriguing is however, that 7 out of 13 models show positive ΔR [cloud feedbacks] in the Arctic while the other 6 have negative values. This implies that half of the models analyzed here simulate local runaway climate systems in which the gain of energy is larger than the loss of energy if advection is not taken into account. These models increase the initial radiative perturbation rather than to reduce it. On the other hand, models exhibiting little warmings tend to be dominated by the negative Planck feedback and can be brought back to radiative balance without the contribution of advection.”
3. Long-term climate (rainfall) projections are “dubious” and almost “non-informative,”  calling into question their “theoretical and practical relevance.”
Iliopoulou and Koutsoyiannis, 2020

“A relevant case study by Lee and Ouarda (2010) concluded that predictions of decadal streamflow extremes using the NAO as a covariate were impacted by large uncertainty to the point of almost being non-informative.”
“From a systematic investigation of long-term rainfall records, corroborated by simulation results, we have verified that local trends have poor out-of-sample performance, being outperformed in their predictions by simpler models, as the local mean. This empirical finding suggests that the large inherent variability present in the rainfall process makes the practice of extrapolating local features in the long-term future dubious, especially when the complexity of the latter increases. This in turn questions the theoretical and practical relevance of projections of rainfall trends and the grounds of the related abundant publications.”

4. Contrary to climate model claims that warming induces perpetually rising positive feedbacks with water vapor, producing even more warming, the observed “buoyancy effect” suggests higher atmospheric water vapor means outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is enhanced, not reduced. This negative water vapor feedback stabilizes the Earth’s climate and prevents runaway warming.
Yang and Seidel, 2020
“We propose that the vapor buoyancy effect can increase Earth’s OLR and helps stabilize Earth’s climate by regulating the atmosphere’s thermal structure. Figure 1 shows the temperature and virtual temperature (buoyancy) fields in the moisture space from 2°S to 2°N using NASA AIRS data. In the free troposphere (p < 850 hPa), buoyancy is horizontally uniform because of the small Cori olis parameter and efficient gravity waves (Charney 1963; Bretherton and Smolarkiewicz 1989; Sobel et al. 2001; Yang 2018a). However, temperature increases toward dry columns due to the vapor buoyancy effect. Moving toward the dry columns, moisture and its associated vapor buoyancy are reduced. To maintain uniform buoyancy, temperature has to increase.”
“Although there is no such constraints in the boundary layer, we can assume that ∆T = 0 at the surface temperature because of the uniform sea surface temperature (SST). We, therefore, require ∆T equals ∆TW BG in the free troposphere but smoothly decays to 0 at surface: ease with climate warming due to increasing atmospheric moisture, leading to enhanced OLR over the dry area. This is a negative feedback which can help to stabilize Earth’s climate.”

"Climate activists have welcomed the launch in the Northumberland countryside of a “vegan Silicon Valley”, which is aimed at helping to fight climate change. The 55-acre site, the brainchild of the entrepreneur Heather Mills, will offer manufacturing, storage and business space exclusively to vegan entrepreneurs and plant-based businesses.  The valley, 10 miles from Newcastle, has been nicknamed Plant-based Valley. There are hopes for it to be at the centre of a food revolution as the world increasingly turns toward plant-based diets and more people change their eating habits in an attempt to halt the climate emergency. Mills said it would make the region a “world centre for the creation of planet-rescuing ideas” and the “northern powerhouse for the brightest vegan minds”. She has previously given her backing to several vegan startups. In 2009 she launched a food range, VBites, which distributes products around the world. “This is not merely a business and investment enterprise, this is an enterprise on which the future of the planet is going to depend,” said Mills at the launch of the project at her VBites factory at Seaton Delaval, near Newcastle. “I have been warning about this for more than 20 years and it is now an accepted scientific fact, endorsed by everyone from the United Nations to David Attenborough to Greta Thunberg’s teens-based movement, that the cattle culture diet is having a disastrous effect on the climate and it threatens our very existence.” Climate activists and the Green party welcomed news of the launch, pointing out the need for humans to cut down on their meat and dairy consumption to halt climate breakdown. Alex Lockwood, a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion – a partner organisation of Extinction Rebellion – said the launch showed north-east England would take a leading role in the UK’s transition to a plant-based food system. “Newcastle and the north-east has a strong activist community and is rich in vegan cafes and eateries, but for animal justice activists this is fantastic news, because it is creating jobs that people can be proud of and shifting farm and slaughterhouse workers away from animal agriculture and into more secure and sustainable jobs,” Lockwood said. “The north-east was the seat of the industrial revolution. And here it is again, leading the way in the UK’s plant-based revolution.” Clare Oxborrow, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “As more people choose to eat less meat or cut it out altogether, this move to repurpose an abandoned factory site and support plant-based innovation could be a timely development.” The Green party’s deputy leader, Amelia Womack, said: “As the IPCC report argued a few months ago, we need to reduce our reliance on meat supply chain to reduce its impact on the climate. “The UK as a whole should support initiatives and businesses that give us healthy food and at the same time reduce our carbon footprint.” During the launch, Mills also called on the government not to abandon plans for HS2, which she said provided an “essential artery” for businesses in the north. “HS2 is not only crucial to bolstering the economy of the north and the north-east, it is indispensable to the key role that the [region] can have in providing a manufacturing innovation, which will be a lifeline not only for the UK but for the planet.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany people around the world play at online casinos, and thats fine if its your only source of gambling. However, online casinos situs bola are nowhere near as close to the real thing when it comes to simulation. Take Craps for example. The casino determines what number rolls by using a random number generator. However, just how random is random? If you have been in a casino, you know that every single person at a table has a unique rolling pattern. Some stack the dice and casually vault them into the air. Others shake them up and rocket them to the back wall, while other frequently launch the dice off the table or fall short of the back wall. There are even players who change their rolling pattern every roll or point.
An online casino does not have the ability to simulate this. Sure, they can manipulate the random number generator, but theres still no way to accurately simulate table action. Having programmed, I know that a random number generator is not all that random. Worse, if the computer simply picks a number, it is not even a proper setup to being with. Lets keep looking at Craps. Does the casino have a random number generator that simply picks a number between one and twelve? If so, all the numbers have an even shot at coming out, which is against true probability. Perhaps they list out all probable combinations and then the computer selects one. This would be a little more accurate, probability wise, but it still lacks the real randomness of live actionand weird events are more likely to ensue.
What Im about to tell you is true and happens more frequently that one would imagine. A tester recently played at an online casino (Craps) to monitor number frequency in the field. Within the span of just 150 rolls, the computer rolled 11 non-field numbers in a row and then followed it up a handful of rolls later by rolling 12 non-field numbers in a row. Whats the big deal you ask? Well, first, the field has a 44.5% chance of winning on every roll and second; the probability of throwing 11 non-field rolls in a row is .0015%. The probability of throwing 12 non-field numbers in a row is .0008%. These events should happen once every 667 rolls and once every 1176 rolls respectively, yet both where seen within a handful of rolls from each other within the 150 rolls monitored.
But wait, theres more. Within these same, now historic, 150 rolls, a six was not thrown for 13-16 rolls 5 times. The probability of not throwing a six 13 times is 14.5% (9% for 16 rolls)this happened 5 times in 150 rolls. The same happened to the eightin factthere were two instances where an eight was not thrown for 18-20 times. The probability of this happening is 5-7% and it happened twice.
When you add all of these things together, you get a more accurate picture of just how unrealistic random number generators are for simulating real casino action. I am not trying to scare you away from playing. In fact, money can be made and fun can be had at online casinos. However, you need to realize that you are playing in a different environment with different rules. You cant go chasing bets thinking they are overdue, mathematically, to come in, because this is a different world with a different way of producing outcomes. Playing strategies that you would use in a real live casino might not be applicable in an online casino.

"The climate crisis was on the agenda again at London fashion week on Monday, with sustainability experts and activists taking part in a symposium at the Finnish Institute focusing on creativity and sustainability. It was in keeping with fashion week so far, which has seen Extinction Rebellion activists stage a “die-in” and swarm the Victoria Beckham show, one of the week’s highest-profile events, hoping to force the industry to take the climate emergency seriously. The symposium was a follow-up to July’s Helsinki fashion week, which is open exclusively to designers and brands who produce sustainable collections. Similar events have already taken place in New York, and there are more planned for Paris and Milan – part of a programme focusing on sustainability and the identity of each host city. For London’s instalment, which was chaired by Helsinki fashion week’s founder, Evelyn Mora, creativity was deemed an appropriate topic given the British capital is, in her words, “the belly of the beast”, known for its fashion-forward approach to design.  The audience was a mix of activists and fashion insiders wearing Matrix glasses and cowboy boots. Hung around the space – and worn by model-activists Nimue Smit and Aine Campbell, who were in attendance – were garments from some of the designers who showed at Helsinki, including the young Liverpudlian Patrick McDowell (whose work using unwanted fabrics has garnered him big-name fans such as MIA), Ka Wa Key, young n sang and Bleu Chose. Mora, who founded Helsinki fashion week in 2014, said designers often asked her whether creativity is an obstacle to sustainability. For her, they are not mutually exclusive: “Innovation to me is no longer about travelling to the moon; it is about finding something new in the old.”  The panel also included Sara Arnold, a founding member of Extinction Rebellion; Charlotte Turner, the head of sustainable fashion and textiles at Eco-Age, a London-based sustainability consultancy; Dr Amy Twigger Holroyd, a professor of the school of art and design at Nottingham Trent University and Bel Jacobs, a former Metro fashion editor and Extinction Rebellion member. Each were invited to give their take on what creativity means. All agreed the focus need not be simply on creating new products, but also on finding solutions. Holroyd, who is a board member of the Council of Concerned Researchers in Fashion, said: “maybe answers already exist in different contexts and cultures.”  Jacobs spoke of creativity stemming from limitation, saying she had seen innovative design starting with what material was available – “I only have these things; what can I make with them?” – rather than with the end garment already in mind. She added that it was about rethinking what it is to be creative. Extinction Rebellion puts an emphasis on creativity via reusing what is already out there. Arnold said it was about “going into secondhand and vintage shops and finding something that means something to you and chimes with your personality,” as well as looking into your own wardrobe. As she pointed out: “we probably already have enough clothes in there to last us the next 20 years.” Jacobs pointed to Sara’s fashion-forward vintage glasses, often the subject of comments, for proof that “we’re not saying [we need to see] the end of creativity”. What did need to change, she said, was “the system of production, consumption, disposal.” Creativity will also be necessary in rethinking the fashion industry as a whole – according to Arnold, “we need to start envisioning another world.” Holroyd spoke of the need to acknowledge that the capitalist model was inherently unsustainable, while Mora said the industry was broken and needed to come together before it could move forward. Turner said getting companies to implement a living wage was key: “The whole fashion system is basically propped up by the fact they are currently able to employ people and not pay them a living wage.” A living wage, she said, “will force brands to realise that if they want to keep producing at such high volumes they will need to rethink their whole supply chain.” For Extinction Rebellion, solutions need to be drastic – in line with the 18 months some scientists say we have left to save the planet – and cannot work within the current capitalist system. They are hoping their London fashion week interventions, which will culminate in a funeral march for the fashion industry on Tuesday, will help. For Jacobs, the British Fashion Council (BFC) standing up and saying we are in a climate emergency would be a powerful step. While the BFC has spoken of a commitment to sustainability goals, it is a far cry from Helsinki fashion week, which is known, even among the eco-conscious fashion weeks of Scandinavia, as a pioneer. At this year’s instalment, animal leather was banned, with designers encouraged to use plant-based leathers and other sustainable textiles. While the picture is bleak – the 63% projected increase in global apparel consumption by 2030 sits uneasily next to news of melting ice caps and species being driven to extinction – there were also words of encouragement from the panel. Arnold put fashion at the heart of affecting change, rather than being simply an ill that needed remedying: “Think how you can use the communicative power of fashion to get this message out there,” she said, having earlier cited the practice of printing T-shirts people already own with slogans. “As a communication tool, fashion is so influential – we all have to put clothes on and that has power.” Holroyd spoke of “creating visions of alternative worlds” as a “creative, powerful, playful and highly subversive act”. Earlier in the talk, she also cited Ursula K Le Guin: “We live in capitalism, its power seems inescapable – but then, so did the divine right of kings.” "
"Australia’s minister responsible for drought and natural disasters, David Littleproud, now says he accepts the science on manmade climate change, and “[I] always have”. Littleproud’s comments to the House of Representatives on Thursday were entirely at odds with a written statement he made to Guardian Australia on Tuesday. In response to questions, Littleproud said: “I don’t know if climate change is man-made.” “I’m about practical outcomes, whether that’s about having a cleaner environment or giving farmers and emergency services the right tools to adapt,” the minister said in that statement. “I am responsible for making sure we have the tools we need to adapt to a changing climate.” Guardian Australia approached Littleproud to clarify his position after comments he made to the ABC at the start of the week about the relationship between early spring bushfires in Queensland and climate change. David Littleproud - Australia’s minister responsible for drought and natural disasters - now says he accepts the science on man-made climate change: ‘I’m just a poor humble bloke with a Year 12 education but I’m prepared to accept what our scientists are telling us"". pic.twitter.com/dQljftGhpp On Monday, Littleproud told ABC’s Radio National that Australia has been “adapting to a changing climate since we first settled this country and we’ll have to continue to do that and do that with the best science we’ve got available.” When asked whether human-induced climate change was making bushfires more intense, Littleproud replied: “We’re adapting to it as the climate continues to change and we’ll continue to equip our service workers … Whether it’s manmade or not is irrelevant.” The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. The minister suggested there were “extremes from both sides” of the debate, which should be about “do we want to breathe healthy air”. He said his job was to ensure emergency services “are given the tools and resources they need, [and] they have the science to understand that these events could become more severe”. Asked by Guardian Australia why he had stepped around the human contribution to climate change given expert scientific advice on the increased frequency of really bad fire days, Littleproud’s office supplied a written answer attributable to the minister: “I don’t know if climate change is man-made.” Later on Tuesday, Littleproud told Sky News in response to a question from the network’s political editor, David Speers, about whether manmade climate change was real: “I am going to be honest with you – I don’t have an opinion.” But Littleproud launched a complete about-face in parliament on Thursday, saying: “I accept the science on manmade impact on climate change. Always have.” “I accept the science. I’m just a poor humble bloke with a year 12 education but I’m prepared to accept, prepared to accept what our scientists are telling us – it’s as simple as that.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In defence of his position, Littleproud pointed to his positive record on climate change, which included driving a climate adaptation response in the agriculture portfolio. In an interview with Guardian Australia last June, Littleproud said the climate was changing and the transition in the energy market – with renewables displacing traditional generation sources – was “exciting, not only for the environment but for the hip pocket”. The Queensland National said then the climate had been changing “since we first tilled the soil in Australia” and he did not care whether the change was due to human activity or not. “I’m not losing any sleep on that, whether you want to prove it is manmade or not – I want to be pragmatic.”"

"A new effort to rally governments and corporations behind technologies that suck greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to help stave off disastrous global heating will be launched at the United Nations on Tuesday. The first annual Global Climate Restoration Forum, held in New York, aims to spur international support for emerging and sometimes controversial methods to claw back planet-warming gases after they have been emitted from power plants, cars, trucks and aircraft. The Foundation for Climate Restoration, the group behind the forum, has released a manifesto for its goal to “restore” the climate by reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to those of a century ago. Atmospheric CO2 is rising sharply, peaking at 415 parts per million this year, far above the level during most of human history, around 300ppm. The foundation aims to restore this historical norm by 2050, saying success would be on a par with the moon landing or the eradication of smallpox. It warns that the current climate is leading us “down a path toward the probable extinction of our species and thousands of others”. “Mother Earth will survive without us but we’d like for humans to survive too,” said Rick Parnell, chief executive of the foundation, which was created last year. “This is the beginning of a 10-year strategy to get governments and companies to understand the need to restore our climate now. Humanity got us into this situation, it can get us out of it.” Global average temperatures have increased by around 1C in the past century due to the buildup of planet-warming gases from human activity. World leaders have agreed to limit this rise to 2C, and ideally 1.5C, although global greenhouse gases are not declining and major emitters such as the US and Brazil have shown signs of going backwards. Any realistic chance of avoiding highly dangerous levels of global heating will likely involve the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, either through mass reforestation or nascent technology that either eliminates it from industrial processes or sucks it directly from the air. Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com The Foundation for Climate Restoration’s report outlines the most promising of these options, such as Climeworks, a Swiss company that uses giant machines to pull CO2 from the air and use it in greenhouses to boost plant growth. It has more than a dozen projects under way and has partnered with an Icelandic project that injects CO2 deep underground into basalt formations. Another avenue defined by the foundation as “permanent, scalable, and financeable” is a company that turns CO2 into limestone that can be used in building. It recently supplied concrete for a new terminal at San Francisco’s airport. The report also mentions the intentional placing of iron in parts of the ocean to boost its ability to absorb CO2, as well as efforts to seed reflective sand across the Arctic to reduce escalating melting. Some environmentalists have rejected such approaches as radical geoengineering that will have harmful unintended consequences. Others have criticized the development of CO2 removal technology as distracting from the need to reduce emissions. However, the UN-hosted forum highlights the narrowing window to confront the climate crisis before scientists’ warnings of severe societal impacts become reality. “Mitigation and adaptation are absolutely critical in climate change, the piece missing is restoration,” said Parnell. “It’s not about leaving things as business as usual, younger generations won’t allow that. But we need a breakthrough, we need to go further.” David Keith, a Harvard academic who has led solar geoengineering work, said it was “encouraging” that the ideas were being discussed but said the ambition of the forum may be a little unrealistic. “I think the timescales they propose for deployment of carbon removal make little sense and seem ungrounded in the real-world politics of cutting emissions which ought to be our first priority,” he said. Klaus Lackner, director of the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions at Arizona State University, said it would be difficult to restore the Arctic and that iron fertilization of the oceans “has not been proven. In fact most data suggest that its contributions would be small, they also would have large ecological impacts.” “I think [the foundation] wants to do the right thing, but it is also important to do a careful analysis,” Lackner said.

"On Wednesday in a committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Greta Thunberg delivered some very brief remarks. Presenting the Congress members gathered with a special report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released nearly a year ago, the Swedish climate activist said succinctly: “I don’t want you to listen to me, I want you to listen to the scientists. I want you to unite behind science. And then I want you to take real action.” Republicans who have accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from fossil fuel companies and electric utilities spouted their usual talking points (“We’re already doing enough!”; “What about China?”), cooked up by lobbyists in K Street boardrooms. Garret Graves – who has taken more than half a million dollars from Pacs linked to dirty energy interests during his short stint in Congress – said we need “more science, not less” and seemed to take some pleasure in lobbing similar red herrings at the youth assembled in front of him, who asked mainly that he and his colleagues begin taking the potential end of human civilization seriously. The Georgia congressman Buddy Carter went a step farther and peddled a standard denialist line: “I believe in climate change. The climate has been changing since day one … Does man have an impact? Yes, that impact might be debatable.” But many Democrats aren’t taking the science much more seriously. The IPCC report Thunberg presented does not lay out a legislative proposal, though it does set some parameters. Barring a truly miraculous level of technological advancement, if the world is to stay below 1.5C of warming, coal, oil and gas usage will have to decline by 94, 87 and 74% worldwide, respectively, by 2050 – and probably sooner in the countries such as the United States that are best positioned to transition rapidly, so as not to eat up more of the planet’s dwindling carbon budget than it already has. The world has 12 years to cut its emissions in half to keep warming below that threshold, which climate-vulnerable nations have long argued is critical to their survival. To listen to the science, as Thunberg suggests, is to reach some pretty radical conclusions. Most every elected Democrat has called for the US to recommit to the Paris agreement, but staying below the “well below 2 degrees” warming limit that document sets as its goal would require a rapid decline in the business model of the fossil fuel industry; added together, the national pledges it outlines as of now would shoot the world beyond 3 degrees of warming. Pushed by calls for a Green New Deal, those vying for the party’s nomination have by and large adopted ambitious pledges on climate – some more than others. Yet establishment Democrats in Congress are still attempting to pursue a middle ground on climate that simply doesn’t exist. On Wednesday, the 103-member New Democrat Coalition –whose Pac BP, ExxonMobil and the Edison Electric Institute have all maxed out on donations to this year – outlined a series of incremental and “pro-market” steps to curb emissions. A suite of legislation unveiled on Wednesday would do many great things, like investing in clean energy research and development via ARPA-E and limiting emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. It is not, however, a plan for fulfilling the challenge laid out by the IPCC, leaving the door open to define coal as a potential source of “clean energy” in pursuit of a “technology-neutral, market-oriented standard for electric energy generation” and providing a financial incentive for fossil fuel companies to capture carbon dioxide and funnel it back into pumping out more fossil fuels. Scientists don’t recommend a specific policy suite, but it would be hard to listen to them earnestly and reach the conclusion that you can gently nudge the fossil fuel industry toward a world warmed by less than 1.5 degrees, as New Democrats hope to. It’s also hard to square their argument that that approach would “build bipartisan consensus” with the last decade-plus of climate policymaking, where yielding off the bat to the Republicans and fossil fuel industry – boosting narrowly focused, technocratic measures – has failed to create any meaningful policy wins. The upshot? Thunberg’s right. And establishment Democrats pushing doomed strategies and policies are denying climate reality nearly as much as Republicans.

"Two-thirds of Americans believe climate change is either a crisis or a serious problem, with a majority wanting immediate action to address global heating and its damaging consequences, major new polling has found. Amid a Democratic primary shaped by unprecedented alarm over the climate crisis and an insurgent youth climate movement that is sweeping the world, the polling shows substantial if uneven support for tackling the issue. More than a quarter of Americans questioned in the new CBS News poll consider climate change a “crisis”, with a further 36% defining it as a “serious problem”. Two in 10 respondents said it was a minor problem, with just 16% considering it not worrisome at all. More than half of polled Americans said they wanted the climate crisis to be confronted right away, with smaller groups happy to wait a few more years and just 18% rejecting any need to act. “Americans are finally beginning waking up to the existential threat that the climate emergency poses to our society,” said Margaret Klein Salamon, a clinical psychologist and founder of the Climate Mobilization Project. “This is huge progress for our movement – and it’s young people that have been primarily responsible for that.” But while nearly all of those questioned accept that the climate is changing, there appears to be lingering confusion over why and scientists’ confidence over the causes. There is a consensus among climate scientists that the world is heating up due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels for electricity generation and transportation, as well as cutting down forests. However, just 44% of poll respondents said human activity was a major contributor to climate change. More than a quarter said our impact was minor or nonexistent. There is an even starker split on the findings of climate scientists. According to the CBS poll, 52% of Americans say “scientists agree that humans are a main cause” of the climate crisis, with 48% claiming there is disagreement among experts. “This remains a vitally important misunderstanding – if you believe global warming is just a natural cycle, you’re unlikely to support policies intended to reduce carbon pollution, like regulations and taxes,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, which has made similar findings in its own, long-running polling. “These results also again confirm a longstanding problem, which is that many Americans still believe scientists themselves are uncertain whether human-caused global warming is happening. “Our own and others’ research has repeatedly found that this is a critical misunderstanding, promoted by the fossil fuel industry for decades, in order to sow doubt, increase public uncertainty and thus keep people stuck in the status quo, in a ‘wait and see’ mode.” Similar to previous polls, the CBS research finds sharp ideological differences in attitudes to the climate crisis. While nearly seven in 10 Democratic voters understand that humans significantly influence the climate and 80% want immediate action, just 20% of Republicans think humans are a primary cause and barely a quarter want rapid action. On the science, nearly three-quarters of Democrats said almost all experts agree that humans are driving climate change, with just 29% of Republicans saying the same. Age is another key variable. While 70% of 18- to 29-year-olds think climate change is a serious problem or crisis, just 58% over 65 concur. Younger people are far more likely to consider it a personal responsibility to address the climate crisis and to believe that a transition to 100% renewable energy is viable. Young people have been galvanized by climate science being taught in schools as well as a spreading global activist movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who started a wave of school walkouts to demand action. Thunberg recently arrived in the US on a solar-powered yacht, ahead of a major United Nations climate summit in New York on 23 September. This generational divide even cuts across party affiliation, with two-thirds of Republican voters aged under 45 considering it their duty to address the climate crisis, according to the CBS poll. Just 38% of Republicans aged over 45 feel the same. “Younger Republicans are much more convinced climate change is a crisis and are supportive of action than older Republicans – which has big implications for the future of the party,” said Leiserowitz. Around three-quarters of all respondents said they understand that climate change is melting the Arctic, raising sea levels and causing warmer summers. A further two-thirds accept that hurricanes will be made more severe by global heating. Hurricane Dorian, which recently devastated parts of the Bahamas, made 38% of Americans more concerned about the climate crisis, with 56% unswayed. Leiserowitz said that the relationship between extreme weather events and concern over climate change is a complex one, with people already worried the most likely to say that their alarm has increased when a major storm or flood hits. Regardless of concern over climate change there appears to be skepticism among Americans about how much humans can do about it. Just 19% said humans can stop rising temperatures and the associated impacts, with nearly half thinking it possible to slow but not stop the changes and 23% refusing to believe humans can do anything at all. This may well influence the views of leading presidential contenders’ climate plans. Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders, for example, has proposed a rapid remodeling of society where planet-warming emissions from transport and power generation are eradicated within just 11 years. “By saying we should merely slow and not reverse global warming, we are passively accepting the deaths of billions of people,” said Margaret Klein Salamon, of the Climate Mobilization Project. “The only thing that can protect us is an all-out, all-hands-on-deck mobilization, like we did during the second world war. Avoiding the collapse of civilization and restoring a safe climate should be every government’s top priority – at the national, state and local levels.”"
"Media interest in natural disasters concentrates on events such as hurricanes that happen over a short period in a specific area. Sometimes, though, destructive weather effects build up gradually across a region over many months, like the floods afflicting the American midwest this year. A blizzard described by the National Weather Service as “of historic proportions” in March added to already deep snow cover. Spring rains rapidly melted the snow and the inundation began. Above-average rainfall has continued through August, and a slow-motion disaster has played out.  Farmlands and roads have been flooded, and communities evacuated. Emergencies were declared over a wide area, with 11 states requesting federal disaster relief. One Nebraska official described the flooding there as “biblical”. Satellite data indicated that the Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas rivers had all reached record-breaking levels. Millions of acres of farmland have been underwater for months. There have been few deaths, though, and the communities affected are mainly in poor rural areas, so the floods rarely make the national news. The damage already runs to billions of dollars, but a full assessment is impossible until the waters recede and the impact on the harvest is known. Recovery is likely to take at least a decade, and this would be set back if there is further flooding during that period."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a story on how a publicly funded broadcaster in Germany has abandoned obeying the laws of the Land, and succumbed to the temptation of practicing activism instead of journalism (a violation of German law). All of this of course on the premise of the fantasized urgent need to rescue the planet.
On June 9 the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)  based in Germany sent a Letter of Protest to the Intendant of German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle demanding that it refrain from the illegal use of public funds by canceling its one-sided alarmist conference for journalists called: The Heat Is On – Climate Change and the Media.
Background here:
1. Journalism For Dummkopfs
2. From Journalism To Thought Control
3. Protest Begins To Mount!
4. EIKE Sends Letter Of Protest
Well, EIKE has received a reply from Deutsche Welle Intendant, Erik Bettermann, and the reply couldn’t have been more mind-blowing. Certainly makes one appreciate the frustration Steve McIntyre must feel at times.
First recall one workshop at the conference: How to professionally deal with climate scepticism, has the stated objective:
This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.
The panelists at the conference go on to warn:
Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics at the expense of the basis of life.
Obviously this conference has nothing to do with balanced journalism, rather just the opposite. So how did Intendant Bettermann respond to EIKE’s request they obey the law and return to balanced journalism?

Easy – Bettermann simply denied any one-sidedness, and asserted they are being fair and balanced. Bettermann’s letter starts with:
In response to your letter dated 9 June 2010, we would like to inform you that Deutsche Welle neither influences the global discussion on climate development in a one-sided manner, nor does it intend to, through its reporting or through the international convention Global Media Forum.
That’s a flat-out lie. And later writes:
As we have already mentioned, we enable representatives of a wide range of viewpoints and opinions to discuss in an international forum. And we will report on these discussions with our media in an honest, comprehensive and balanced manner.
That’s untrue as not a single non-alarmist view is included in the conference. He then adds:
In these discussions Deutsche Welle is only offering a forum and does not represent a decided point of view in one direction or the other.
Yet, just compare the contents of the conference announcement with the statements made by Bettermann. They could not be more diametrically opposed. The conference’s own program announcement is proof of its total one-sidedness, which means publicly funded Deutsche Welle is actively violating German law by not remaining balanced in its journalism.
Let’s be honest. Bettermann is no fool. He knows exactly what he’s doing. He has no intention of being fair and balanced on the climate issue. He’s hoping EIKE will give up trying to take on the state-funded Deutsche Welle and all its legal counselors, and simply go away.
Deutsche Welle has de facto gone rogue. It has long since abandoned journalistic principles. Rather, the broadcaster intends to shape political opinion and public policy in Germany. Now that’s real power! Boring journalism be damned.
But EIKE is not about to back down, and has sent a reply and intends to turn up the pressure. It’s a battle between David and Goliath. It’s a battle they will probably lose, but it’s certainly worth fighting. There’s simply too much at stake.
Tomorrow, EIKE’s reply to Bettermann’s denial.

"Some of Wall Street’s largest asset management companies are failing to live up to commitments to use their voting power to fight the climate crisis, according to a new report. The report, published on Tuesday by the Washington DC-based Majority Action and the Climate Majority Project, claims that BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager with more than $6tn under management, and Vanguard, with assets of $5.2tn, have voted overwhelmingly against the key climate resolutions at energy companies, including a resolution at ExxonMobil’s annual shareholder meeting, and at Duke Energy. Had BlackRock and Vanguard not torpedoed these investor efforts, at least 16 climate-critical shareholder resolutions at S&P 500 companies would have received majority support in 2019, representing a significant corporate shift on climate, the report claims. Refusing to use their proxy votes to support shareholders’ resolutions means letting companies off the hook – even as the climate crisis threatens their investors, their business models and the planet, the group says. “The climate crisis is well upon us, and leading investors are stepping up to press fossil-fuel-dependent companies to align their strategies to the goals of the Paris agreement but some of the largest US investment companies are severely lagging,” said Majority Action’s Eli Kasargod-Staub. “Blackrock and Vanguard have been using their shareholder voting power to undermine, rather than support, investor action on climate, including opposing every one of the resolutions proposed by the $34tn Climate Action 100+ coalition, calling for significant board room reform in response to its failure to act on climate change,” Kasargod-Staub added. Blackrock published a report in April on climate-related risk stating: “Climate change is a risk investors can’t ignore.” Vanguard publishes an annual “investment stewardship” report outlining its commitment to sustainable investing. Majority Action, which delivered a petition of 129,000 petition signatures to Blackrock in April, claims it ranks at the bottom of the list of fund managers using their voting powers to force companies to act responsibly on climate. “We have the largest investment stewardship team in the industry and engage with companies even in the absence of shareholder proposals,” Blackrock said in a statement to the Guardian.“We support shareholder proposals that we believe will enhance the value of our clients’ investments. But not all shareholder proposals are created equal, and it would be wrong to equate good governance with voting against management without regard for a proposal’s impact.” While funds like Blackrock and Vanguard may not be using their proxy power to force change, there is evidence that some of their funds are moving toward investing under environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. Blackrock has launched an array of sustainable equity exchange-traded funds, and it offers clients direction to build portfolios focused on companies that are likely to offer returns on clean-energy investments. Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi’s $800bn sovereign-wealth fund recently added a new criterion to its investment process: how will the Earth’s changing climate affect a potential asset’s price? According to the data provider EPFR Global, the total value of funds that have integrated ESG factors into their investment process has more than quadrupled since 2014, rising to $485bn as of April. Funds that may not be explicitly listed as ESG are also investing with the climate in mind. Blackrock holds that its 45-member environmental stewardship team engaged 250 companies last year on the subject of climate change. It says singling out the use of proxy votes is misleading because it ignores the totality of Blackrock’s engagement on the issue. In its 2018 stewardship report, the company said its discussion with clients addressed the robustness of board oversight, ESG disclosure frameworks, climate risk management, environmental impact management and sustainability around waste, water, energy efficiency, packaging and product life-cycle management. Nicholas Eisenberger at the advisory firm Pure Energy Partners said he was encouraged by the growing awareness of the urgency of the climate crisis in the business sector. “Large asset managers are just at the beginning of taking the urgent actions required to more aggressively confront the threat of climate change,” he said, describing them as battleships at the start of an emergency corrective turn. “We seen a fundamental shift in the last two years in the understanding of the dangers climate change presents but the steps we’ve taken are nowhere near adequate to the task yet.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German GKSS research centre located near Hamburg has put out a press release that kind of baffles me. Early Warning System For Heat Waves Necessary.
The press release starts:
After a very cold winter, a heat wave has gripped Germany. All signs point to July being the hottest month ever since records have been kept. The heat wave hit us just as surprisingly as the past extreme winter. So far there have not been any reliable instruments for predicting extremes. The Climate Service Center of the GKSS ResearchCentre in Geesthacht recommends improving forecast models.
I’ve been living in Germany since 1990, and to me this has not been a really hot summer. We’ve had some hot days, but with cool weather in between over the last 4 weeks – whoopie. It’s being hyped and milked for all it’s worth.
But that is not what surprises me. What surprises me is the claim there are no reliable instruments for predicting heat waves and cold waves. The press release states:
Currently it is not possible to make reliable seasonal forecasts for Europe, and to sort of predict extremely hot summers or heat waves. This is urgently needed in order to be able to implement the necessary adaptive measures and thus reduce the negative impacts on man and environment.
I think that’s crap. There are number of organisations that have had pretty good track records in making seasonal forecasts. So where could the notion that there are no reliable forecasts come from?
The press release amply cites the NOAA.

Voila! There’s your answer. If you rely on dubious institutions for your information, then you can only reach the “no-reliable-forecasts” conclusion. And we also know that the Met Office, with their super computers, failed miserably in their seasonal forecasts, so much so that they became a laughing stock and have since given it up.
But to say there no reliable forecasts available for Europe is false. There are. For example, how is it that Joe Bastardi of Accuweather has consistently called them right? Joe not only predicted the hot summer back in February/March (early warning enough I’d say), but also forecast the cold winter back last fall. Contact him. Maybe his data sources and models are better – less corrupt.
I called Rüdiger Braun, GKSS press spokesman, and he was kind enough to explain that the target is to simply build upon the existing system and to improve it.
Sounds reasonable. My suggestion then is that they start by separating the bad forecast models from the good ones, and to take it from there.
Finally, it’s peculiar how climate scientists insist their 20, 50 and 100-year projections are spot on, while other scientists fret about the lack of reliable 3-month forecasts.
And finally here’s the forecast for my town here in Germany. 20°C is a heat wave, right?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe last two years of minimal solar activity did not prevent the earth from warming, and thus shows that the theory that the recent abnormally low solar activity could lead to a little ice age is false, so writes German FOCUS magazine.
Online FOCUS magazine  here reports on how solar activity has awoken, and thus the prospects of a new little ice age befalling the planet are now excluded.According to FOCUS, the sun has been showing some “hefty” activity over the last weeks. The series of violent eruptions had started already back in early spring, and increased in frequency over the summer.
FOCUS here is hyping the current solar activity, making it sound like the sun is really firing up. Solar Cycle 24 indeed has started, but is still sputtering badly, see the following graphic:


Not only is solar cycle 24 way behind schedule, and that scientists have had to postpone its projected start a number of times, solar cycle 24 is still well behind even the latest updated projection, and it may have a hard time reaching 75 sunspots when it peaks. Yet, FOCUS writes:
The sun is proving, in the most impressive way, that its period of minimum activity is now over and is now powering ahead toward its maximum of its new cycle, which will be in 2013.
And:
The increasing activity not only settles the dispute of a new little ice age for good, But in interaction with the El Niño, which dominated in the Pacific until summer, it could also make 2010 the warmest year since records have been kept.
So FOCUS is claiming that the recent low solar activity couldn’t stop the hot 2010.  And because solar cycle  24 is is getting active, FOCUS now sees nothing getting in the way of more warming. Rising temperatures despite 2 years of little solar activity proves the sun is not the driver. Worries of a little  ice age were for nothing. So get back to worrying about global warming!

FOCUS makes this earth-shattering conclusion based on just a couple of years of observation. This kind of junk science is not unusual in the German media.
In the report FOCUS emphasizes how some scientists were concerned about the possibility of a new little ice age beginning, like during the Maunder and Dalton minimums. FOCUS writes:
Due to the recent reduced radiation by the sun, cooling of the planet was expected. Some scientists even prophesied a little ice age.
FOCUS explains how some solar scientists believe  solar activity effected global temperature in the past.
The cause of the devastating cold periods was the sun. During the entire Little Ice Age, it showed only very minimal activity, which was evidenced by the very small number of sunspots. In one 30-year phase of the Maunder-Minimum, only 50 spots showed up  – normal would be thousands.
FOCUS then dismisses the theory applies today, saying  the theory of the recent solar minimum causing cool temperatures has failed:
Some climate sceptics even announced a cooling of about 0,2°C, but that was a false conclusion, as 2009 was the 5th warmest year since temperature recording began. The months of January to July, 2010 were the warmest such period ever – even though the sun was still close to its low period of activity.
So even with 2 or three years of low solar activity, it still got hot, and so the theory is dead, FOCUS  tells its readers. FOCUS avoids mentioning the impact of the 2009/2010 El Nino. Finally, FOCUS concludes:
Nobody has to worry about another little ice age occurring. Even if the sun were to go into a protracted minimum, the rise in temperatutres brought on by GHG would compensate for it.
I wonder what FOCUS will write if Joe Bastardi’s forecast for the next few years pans out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany people In Europe are now installing ground surface lights in their gardens to add a little flair to their evening patio parties. But now one German blog called Frischer Wind  (fresh wind) is a bit upset about it, calling such lights senseless and useless.
After all, all they do is throw light up into the dark night sky.

You see, these lights are already widely used in pedestrian zones, parks and plazas. They also provide much architectural flair to mansions, like around the swimming pool. They look great.
Unfortunately, a lot of regular folks are now picking them up at home centres and hardware stores and installing them in their humble backyards – because they too also want a taste of what it’s like to live as the rich and wealthy do. You know, like how Hollywood and elitist activists live.
Well, we can’t have all these regular folks doing that, now can we?
According to Christian Reinboth at Frischer Wind blog, it’s all a big waste that’s getting out of hand. This type of lighting contributes nothing except for illumination pollution. That’s right – there’s now too much lighting at night. To prove his point, he sets up a DIALux simulation series to demonstrate the inefficiency of these lamps by measuring ULRs (upward light ratios).

In the simulation, the illumination of a light mounted on a mast is supplemented by five 70-watt ground-surface lamps space 1 meter apart. The finding:
  The 5 ground-surface lamps contribute quite exactly nothing to the illumination of the area.
Horrors! In another scenario Reinboth determines:
…only 0.5% of the light emitted by the lamp serves as illumination – the rest is wasted directly into the night sky.
So be warned. Get them while you can. Already Edison’s light bulb is on the verge of being banned in the USA. In Europe everything 60W and above is already banned, and in a few years all incandescent bulbs will be illegal (I’ve stashed a good number of them away, so there!).  Next it’ll be the “senseless and useless” ground-surface lights, no matter what type they are. After all, they only consume energy and pollute the night skies with light.
There’s no end to possible illumination regulation. Lights can do so many horrible things. If the light colour is wrong, they attract and endanger poor little night insects, or they can cause glare, and they consume energy, which leads to climate change. The regulation is only beginning. The Dark Ages are about to return.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHaving received a request to cease and desist airing the famous self-made “Hide the Decline” G-rated YouTube political satire video, the Minnesotans For Global Warming have grown weak-kneed and decided to take down the video, which had been viewed more than half a million times on YouTube and was even featured on the Rush Limbaugh show (20 million listeners). But Michael Mann, the target of its satire, was not amused. And when the cat says meow, mice run.
Of course I’m not familiar with the details and legal fine points of the issue, but I have seen much worse go unchallenged. When George W. Bush was President, much worse videos were made. Barack Obama has to take the same treatment too – like all public figures.  Obviously the video had gotten under Mann’s thin skin. Mann, a professor at Penn State, creator of the phony, discredited hockey stick graph, a public employee as far as I know, has demanded that the M4GW stop practicing its right to free speech.
Personally I can’t believe the M4GW waved the white flag so quickly. I thought they had more guts than that. But I guess Beauregard’s French genes got the best of him. Now some goofball No Cap & Trade organisation will have to storm the beach and take the bullets.  M4GW have sent a disturbing message by cutting and running.
They ought to put the video back up and take Mann on like a man.
And what do I think of the NO Cap & Trade Hide the Decline II?  It’s crap. But I’m sure they’ll be enough dim bulbs out there who will accept it and think it’s cute.  Bring back the original!

The German Research Foundation is back, again in favor of diversity of scientific opinion! Image: Galileo fails to change Catholic Church doctrine.
After widespread criticism, the German Research Foundation (DFG) has decided to reverse its July 30th decision to take down a dissident climate science statement from prominent German satirist Dieter Nuhr (background here).
The DFG has put Nuhr’s statement back online again after realizing it had blundered when it caved in to activists and had not acted in the interest of science (pdf here).
What follows is DFG’s new statement in English (my emphasis added) expressing its regrets and announcing that Mr. Nuhr’s statement has been put back:
The DFG expressly regrets that the statement by Dieter Nuhr was taken hastily from the website of the online campaign #forknowledge. Mr. Nuhr is a person who stands at the heart of our society and is committed to science and rational discourse. Even if his pointed satirical nature may be irritating for some people, an institution like the DFG in particular is committed to the freedom of thought based on the Enlightenment. We have therefore reinstated his statement. The discussion about his statement exemplifies the developments that currently characterize many public discussions about science.

“A culture of debate has developed in various sectors of our society, in which it is often not the objective and stronger argument that counts, in which less is listened to and inquired about, but rather increasingly judged and condemned hastily. Instead of joint dialogue, increasingly polarized and divisive debates are taking the place of mutual dialogue. Particularly in the case of central issues such as climate change or the coronavirus pandemic, this hinders the really necessary discussion of scientific topics and the constructive exchange between science and society. Scientists who make their findings public and describe political options for action are increasingly the target of unobjective attacks and personal defamation. This also applies to social movements that advocate science and publicly call for scientific findings to be made more of a basis for decisions and actions.”
“These developments are not beneficial to society and are all the more worrying as science plays a central role in meeting current challenges, with which it is currently strongly perceived and valued in society. For its part, it is dependent on a critical, OPEN and constructive culture of communication.”
“The DFG would like to take these observations as an opportunity to initiate an intensive debate on the current debate culture surrounding science. The DFG stands for diversity of opinion and freedom of expression as well as for a differentiated culture of discussion. It will continue to do everything in its power to achieve this in the future – together with other figures from science, media, politics and other areas of society, both in Germany and abroad.”
What follows below is Nuhr’s original statement which the DFG “hastily took down” when it caved to public pressure from activists and ideologues. There’s nothing wrong with this statement:
Knowledge does not mean you are 100% sure, but that you have enough facts to have a reasoned opinion. But many people are offended when scientists change their mind: That is normal! Science is just THAT the opinion changes when the facts change. This is because science is not a doctrine of salvation, not a religion that proclaims absolute truths. And those who constantly shout, “Follow science!” have obviously not understood this. Science does not know everything, but it is the only reasonable knowledge base we have. That is why it is so important.”
Now after public outrage across Germany, Nuhr’s statement has been reinstated. A big victory for open science!

Watching some World Cup soccer, now taking place in South Africa, I’ve noticed fans have been attending the games wearing some pretty serious winter gear. Indeed it’s been awfully cold in South Africa. According to South African News24: 
Winter has struck with a vengeance in the Western Cape with some towns recording their first snowfalls in almost 20 years. 
The unusually wintry weather is causing traffic havoc too. 
The cold has also taken a heavy toll on penguins, killing 500 at Algoa Bay in the Eastern Cape, SA National Parks (SanParks). 
According to SanParks spokesperson Megan Taplin: 
 The chicks, aged between a few weeks and two months, are covered only with down feathers. They succumbed to the cold and wet weather that has hit Bird Island. 
Well, at least penguins would have nothing against a little warming.

German editorialists digested the news on Thursday and warned that both Republicans and Democrats were right to feel uneasy.
In the elitist established medía in Germany, “digested” is not the right word, Better and more accurate would be “vomited”. They are utterly horrified of and shaking at the thought of the American tea party movement and pro-life Palin.

After hearing Karl Rove out himself and his GOP Establishment yesterday, I realise that the GOP is still that snobby country club after all. Rove didn’t hold back attacking Christine O’Donnell for her financial problems and crapping all over her. Egads, voters – she’s like the rest of you other struggling Americans! You want her to represent you!
The GOP Establisment is hardly better than the condescending millionaire elitists on the Democrats side, Hollywood, James Cameron, Wall Street, Al Gore, media etc. – all preaching us to sacrifice, while they themselves live high on the hog.
Well, I’ve got a message for BOTH SIDES:

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe reduction in phytoplankton is not due to oceanic warming, but instead to overfishing. Guest writer Ed Caryl digs into the subject of phytoplankton.

The Phytoplankton Are Starving
By Ed Caryl
A recent press release from Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, announced an article published in Nature (behind a pay-wall) that we’ve been losing 1% of our phytoplankton each year dating back to 1899, meaning 40% since 1950. The article blames it on ocean warming. The article was discussed in July on WUWT and here. Let’s pull our heads back a bit more and look beyond warming.
Why are phytoplankton important?
Phytoplankton or algae are single-celled, photosynthesizing creatures at the “bottom” of the ocean food chain. They take in sunlight and CO2 and produce carbohydrates, just like plants do on land. They are the source of the biomass that all larger animals and fish feed upon. Without them, life in the ocean would not exist. Yet, much of the literature makes no mention of any dependence in the other direction, i.e. phytoplankton depend on the creatures higher up in the food chain.

Phytoplankton are a hybrid of plant and animal. Some have locomotion capability as if they were single-celled animals. They need the same nutrients as all plants: CO2, nitrogen (as nitrates or ammonia), and phosphorus (as phosphate); iron, zinc and manganese are also needed in trace quantities. When there is an excess of these nutrients, such as in agricultural runoff, “blooms” can occur where runaway reproduction produces so many that during the night when they are not photosynthesizing they can consume all the dissolved oxygen in the water, and thus suffocate themselves and the fish.
Why are phytoplankton disappearing in deep ocean areas?
In the deep ocean, away from nutrient-feeding rivers and streams, the phytoplankton population is generally low. This can be seen in the graphic above from satellite data where blue indicates low chlorophyll.
Upwelling from the deep-ocean delivers nutrients from the bottom and increases the population in areas close to shore where waters are shallow, and where rivers and streams bring nutrients from land. The phytoplankton population seems to have increased in shore areas in recent years, probably due to nutrient runoff from agriculture, while the mid-ocean gyres are still seeing population decreases.
The questions then are:
1) Why is the mid-ocean so generally poor in phytoplankton?
2) Why has the overall phytoplankton population dropped?

Let’s discuss the possibilities: Is increasing CO2 in the atmosphere causing it?
This is unlikely for three reasons. First, CO2 started increasing in a significant way many years after the reduction in phytoplankton started. Second, CO2 is a nutrient that should stimulate growth, not inhibit it. Three, the recent inshore population increase seems to go against the CO2 influence.
Is ocean warming the culprit?
Note that planktons are plentiful in very warm equatorial waters where nutrients are available. Even though the far north and south seem to have more phytoplankton, warm temperatures do not seem to be the limiting factor. Phytoplankton are not a single monolithic species. There are thousands of species of phytoplankton, adapted to various environments, including temperature.  Some phytoplankton also diurnally move vertically in the water column through large temperature gradients.
So, what could be limiting phytoplankton? The likely culprit is the limitation of nutrients. Phytoplanktons are starving in the mid-ocean. Why?
The oceans are mostly a closed ecosystem. Inputs to the system are sunlight and nutrients from rivers and streams. 95% of the biomass in the ocean is phytoplankton. Everything else in the ocean depends directly or indirectly on phytoplankton. Zooplankton: copepods, krill, and shrimp eat phytoplankton. Small fish, such as herring, sardines, and menhaden eat the zooplankton. Large fish eat the small fish. At the top of the food chain are: squid, tuna, salmon, sharks, whales, porpoise, etc…and finally us humans. But remember, this is a closed system. Except for what man removes, everything else recycles in the ocean. Everything in the ocean lives, excretes, dies, or is eaten by something. Even if it falls to the bottom, bacteria, worms, and crabs consume what is left. Only the non-digestible mineral skeletons and exoskeletons remain in the ocean-bottom sediments. Except for what man removes, the nutrients remain in the ocean. And when man does remove those nutrients, it’s forever.
Man’s removal from the oceans
The problem is that we have fished out the oceans. Only 10% of the large fish found in the oceans in 1950 remain. And we have been over-fishing the oceans far longer than just the last 60 years. Even backe in 1950, people were already noticing a reduction in stocks of whales, salmon, cod, halibut, and other fish. We probably have less than 10% of the large fish and whale stocks that were present before we began harvesting the seas in earnest.
Where does the nitrogen that phytoplankton require come from? At the the mid-ocean levels, some comes from nitrogen fixing bacteria, but the rest comes from excrement in the form of urea and ammonia from bacteria breaking down protein as carcasses decompose. Iron, molybdenum, and phosphates come from the same sources. But remember we are removing large amounts of fish protein from the ocean, especially whale, tuna, shark, and other large fish. 90% of what was there is now gone. We are removing more every year. The fish products are no longer available to the phytoplanktons. Their food supply has diminsihed. They are starving.
What does that mean for the carbon cycle?
Why is this important? If we have lost 40% of our phytoplanktons, then we have lost a significant part of the photosynthetic biosphere. Photosynthesis binds 100 to 115 million metric tons of carbon each year. Phytoplanktons are responsible for half the photosynthesis that occurs on the planet. If we have lost 40% of the phytoplanktons, then we have lost 20% of our total photosynthesis capability, or the conversion of more than 20 million metric tons of carbon per year, in carbon dioxide, into oxygen and water. This is a huge loss, but it pales in comparison to a larger loss.
Phytoplanktons have silica and calcium carbonate skeletons. Phytoplanktons are eaten by copepods and other zooplankton, which also have calcium carbonate skeletons and exoskeletons. 40% of the carbon is converted into calcium-carbonate shells and excreta that sink to the bottom, and 60% to dissolved organic carbon originating from flesh. In 1950 planktons were sequestering 16.6 billion metric tons of carbon. Today, planktons convert 10 billion metric tons of carbon. If we have lost 40% of the phytoplanktons since 1950, i.e. 40% of the carbon sequestration capability, then 6.6 billion metric tons of carbon should appear in the atmosphere.
Currently we are adding more than 5.5 billion tons of carbon yearly to the atmosphere from fossil fuel and cement production (here). In 1950, we were adding more than 1.5 billion tons of carbon per year. That’s a 4 billion ton increase. Four billion tons a year is the yearly average atmospheric carbon-in-CO2 increase. But if in that same period, 40% of plankton have starved out, they are no longer sequestering 6.6 billion tons of carbon. These figures don’t agree. This is probably because the plankton loss is not quite 40%, but somewhat below 30%. Still, the plankton loss alone can account for the rising atmospheric CO2 levels.
Maybe it’s time we curtailed eating fish for a while, and focus on consuming poultry, pork or beef.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScientists often say that if you want to see the climate change signal, then look at the poles, especially the Arctic. How often have we seen the following red-coloured graphic, or similar, and thought: Oh my God!
Well don’t panic. Even with all the “hottest-ever-first-6 months” in 2010 belly-aching, temperatures are about to take a dive. I’m not talking about because of fall and winter are approaching, I’m talking temperature anomalies over the winter. They are projected to be far below normal.
The NOAA models predict a major cooling for the Arctic this coming winter. Indeed they show a significant cooling globally. These models have been converging on an Arctic deep freeze for a few weeks now. Already the mercury north of 80° latitude has taken a dip back down to the freezing point, see DMI chart:
Now lets look at the NOAA Arctic seasonal forecast for the period Aug/Sep/Oct 2010:
In the above chart, you can see that the Arctic above Scandinavia, Russia, Siberia has cooled to a slight negative anomaly. The Canadian Arctic is still on the warm side. But almost everything above the 80°N line is blue, meaning colder than normal.
Now take a look at the next NOAA graphic which shows the global temperature anomalies for the period Jan/Feb/Mar 2011 – the dead of winter (entire NOAA graphic series here):
Look at all the deep blue up in the Arctic indicating well below normal temperatures! Some readers may say: “Well, it’s only 1 or 2°C below normal, what’s the big deal?”  It is a big deal. Today warmists are screeching about global temperature anomalies of +0.5°C.  So 2.0°C in the Arctic is huge. The Pacific and the Antarctic coast are also frigid.
Keep in mind this this post was written just by looking at the leading Climatic Indicators I have listed on my homepage. Anyone can go there and take a look at the charts. The data are there, take a look at them yourself and draw your own conclusions. Do your own thinking.
How long will the cold last? That depends on the developing La Nina. Again the big climate institutes point to a good-sized La Nina.
So, to summarise, expect Arctic sea ice to get pretty low this year, and to hear lots of headlines about it, but then watch the ice recover next year. Joe Bastardi thinks it could reach near record highs. This of course depends on how reliable the NOAA seasonal forecasts are.

"This week I had a mole checked on my leg and my doctor quickly agreed it should be removed. While I contemplated the anxiety of what that could mean I did not sit there wondering which day it was that I got sunburned which caused the corruption of a cell that has started to turn the mole abnormal. Was it from the time I spent summers working as a fruit-picker during university? Or those many afternoons down on the banks of the River Murray swimming with friends during high school? Was it the time I got absolutely burned to a crisp on an overcast day holidaying on the Gold Coast in my early 20s? We don’t ask this because it is in essence unanswerable, but we also know that – as the advert says – every tan is doing you damage. And I know that my lack of care during my youth while out in the sun is the reason I am going to get the mole removed (and hopefully will not require much more surgery after that). We don’t stop to ask for a specific causal event to give us proof of the link between sunburn or a tan and skin cancer. And yet change the topic to climate change and immediately we demand specifics. This week the fires burning in southern Queensland, though started by a vandal, thrived in conditions brought about from climate change. The summer ahead looks to be a horror one for bushfires, with the latest Bureau of Meteorology outlook suggesting most of the continent has a less than 30% chance of exceeding its average rainfall for October to December. But were the bushfires this week caused by climate change? No – at least not definitively so. It is quite difficult to attribute any individual bushfire or cyclone or drought to climate change, because what climate change affects is long-term trends – trends that will see more droughts and less rainfall in certain areas, as well as conditions more conducive to longer bushfire seasons. It is much the same as with gun laws in the US. The lack of gun laws does not cause every single gun fatality to occur, but they cause a situation that makes gun fatalities much more likely to occur. While with melanoma we grasp the long-term and act and adapt accordingly – actions that help reduce the likelihood of melanoma through “slip-slop-slap”, and adaptation required in lieu of being unable to reverse the past (ie checking moles for changes). But on climate change we are like some old bloke who has spent his life in the sun saying sunburn never killed him, all the while ignoring the mole on his back growing larger and more discoloured every month. Most of our politicians – and certainly our government – are not even at the stage of adaptation, let alone ready to take actions that might prevent further damage. The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. I had a check of my skin because this week the Labor MP Jason Clare tweeted an image of his bandaged leg after he had had a melanoma removed. It was one of those cases where whenever you hear of anyone who has had a melanoma removed it is used as the perfect time to remind everyone to go get checked, to wear sunscreen and to do all you can in effect not to get skin cancer. But when a bushfire or a cyclone or a drought occurs, there is conversely always the push to not politicise it, to not talk about climate change. I suspect this is because if we did so we might have to start wondering why we were not doing anything about it. So we had the bizarre situation this week of the minister for natural disasters, David Littleproud, telling Guardian Australia in writing that “I don’t know if climate change is manmade”. He then went on Sky News and told the same thing to David Speers before in parliament on Thursday suggesting that it was all a mistake and he really does think climate change is manmade. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Littleproud is not one of the climate change looneys in the government, so it did smack a little bit of him seeking to placate the ignorant in his party before realising that it made him look ignorant before the entire nation. The ALP was not exactly covering itself in climate change sunscreen this week either. On Wednesday the Greens moved a motion which, after acknowledging the early fire season and the critical role of emergency services, called on the government to “urgently take action to address climate change and manage the risk and severity of bushfires, invest in community adaptation efforts to build resilience to climate change in moderate and high risk areas, and commit to action to progress a rapid and just transition to clean and renewable energy sources to reduce the harmful emissions driving climate change”. In essence, to act and adapt. The ALP voted against the motion because, as senator Katy Gallagher stated, it sought “to politicise the emergency in Queensland, where 72 fires are currently burning”. The ALP senator Murray Watt echoed these thoughts on Twitter and he replied when I (and others) criticised him by referring to a speech he had made on the issue the day before. In that speech on the bushfires his one reference to climate change was this: “It is of concern that so many bushfires of this severity are occurring so early in the year, and this should prompt further thought by all in this place.” Yeah. That’ll do it. It is bizarre the Cancer Council hasn’t gone with the campaign slogan of “the growing number of moles on your body should prompt further thought”. We need to be as loud and active about combating climate change as we are about skin cancer. Stop seeking excuses not to act, stop demanding definitive proof for every single incident, and look at the overall trends. We need to use the moments when bad things happen to remind everyone that further action and further adaptation is needed unless we want to see more severe events occur more often. Oh, and also go have a mole check up. Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Max Planck Institute has an interesting article (in German) here When Man Engineers Climate concerning the international legal aspects of employing technical means to engineer climate change. Personally, I think there isn’t much man could do, unless all resources were focussed in doing so. But others think it’s possible and even feasible.Scientists are developing processes to counteract the alleged negative impacts of climate change. But employing these untested processes could very well lead to unexpected results instead. Do these technical processes – should they function at all – comply with international norms?
There are several techniques that may be used to influence climate on earth, or what some call climate engineering, or geo-engineering or climate therapy. But the impacts of climate engineering would be completely unpredictable, and could cause more harm than good for a region. Who would be liable for damages? Think of the technical legal complications in proving in an international court that a negative impact was caused, or could be caused.
There are basically two general technical methods to counter global warming:
1. Reducing solar radiation by using reflective aerosols.
2. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere.
No. 2 for example, uses iron fertilisation to promote the growth of algae. The algae then absorbs CO2, which would disappear at the seabed when the algae dies off.  The Alfred Wegener Institute even conducted a controversial experiment to see how well that would work: The Lohafex Experiment. The scientists dumped iron sulphate over 300 sq km in the South Pacific. But things did not go as hoped. The fertiliser did indeed promote the growth of algae, but swarms of small crabs descended and torpedoed the project with their large appetites. No extra CO2 was absorbed in the end.
No.1 can be achieved by cloud-making, which reflects sunlight back into space. This can be done through salt crystals or using sulfuric acid. Mt Pinatubo showed that this works as it spewed 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, which scientists say caused global temps to drop 0.5°C.
Engineering climate (doing climate-therapy) would likely lead to unpredictable consequences. According to legal researcher David Reichwein:
Nobody knows what consequences such experiments could have on the global climate and how these consequences would impact different regions in different ways.

Reichwein adds:
A large-scale attempt to remove CO2 using iron sulphate to promote algae growth could have considerable negative impacts on ecological balance.
Climate therapy by using reflective aerosols could also lead to nasty side effects. For example a study based on a model conducted by Patricia Heckendorn of the Atmospheric and Climate Sciences Institute of the ETH Zurich showed that using sulfur aerosols in the stratosphere would likely lead to a considerable degradation of the ozone layer.
In Pinatubo’s aftermath, shifts in precipitation were observed. So a large-scale application by man could lead to devastating results, and thus would certainly be challenged legally.
The problem is that the impacts of climate therapy processes cannot be contained to a specific area. The threat of uncontrolled adverse impacts entail international law and human rights issues. Says Reichwein:
Geo Engineering up to now has yet to find a foothold in human rights treaties.
Employing geo-engineering processes will lead to the opening up of a whole new can of worms legally, let alone questions of technical feasibility.
In the meantime, hoards of companies, all with promises of delivering successful climate therapy, are lining up at the feeding troughs, which are filled by crooked politicians.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s what Joe says in his latest video. The PDO is now going into its cold phase and the current La Nina is going to be a bear – and quite possibly a polar bear at that.
The Pacific, the primary global climate driver, has been in its warm cycle since the late 1970s, and that’s coming to an end. That period was dominated by El Ninos, which kept the planet on the warm side. But now the Pacific has flipped and we’re now entering a cool phase, where La Ninas are expected to dominate.
I disagree with Joe when he says the brutal winters are going to start in 2013. In my view they’ve already started! So If Joe thinks the last couple winters have been mild, I sure hate to see what “brutal” is going to look like!

Joe thinks that brutal winters follow deep La Ninas. And because he thinks the next 2 years will be dominated by a major La Nina, then cold winters are expected to strike beginning in 2012-2013.
He’s getting bold with his predictions. But if he winds up being right, then the AGW theorists and their half-baked models are history. Joe says in the video:
Here we go. We spike this up. And now we’re into a major La Nina that’s going to last for the next couple of years. When we come out of that, there’s really good reason to believe the winter of 2012-13, and perhaps beyond, is going to be quite cold.
Then there are the wild cards, says Joe: solar activity and volcanoes, which impact the ENSO. Joe also mentions how the current La Nina has so far come on faster and harder than anything he can remember. You can see what he means looking at the following graphic:
Comparing this La Nina to the last one, this one is in a big hurry, and is shaping up to be a deep one. That all of this is occurring during a very slow solar cycle may be just a coincidence, but enough scientists are out there yelling “heads up!”
I myself am buying extra long-johns this fall for the months and years ahead. Last year’s pairs are already worn out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new potentially dangerous fungus seems to have appeared in the Northwest US and British Columbia, this according to Reuters. http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N22129903.htm
‘This novel fungus is worrisome because it appears to be a threat to otherwise healthy people,’ said Edmond Byrnes of Duke University in North Carolina, who led the study.
When I was reading this, I thought it’s just a question of time, maybe a few days, before someone claims it’s all because of climate change. Well I didn’t have to wait long. The last sentence of the report:
Freezing can kill the fungus and climate change may be helping it spread, the researchers said.
So there it is. Everytime something potentially threatening appears, the first suspect is automatically climate change. It’s gotten that bad.

Doran et al (2002) reported “a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000”.

Image Source: Doran et al., 2020
Obryk et al. (2020) – with P.T. Doran a co-author – have extended the Doran et al. (2002) record to 2017 and found the -0.7°C cooling that lasted from 1986 to 2000 persisted until 2006. A recovery since 2006 has been observed, but not enough to be documented as statistically significant.

Image Source: Obryk et al., 2020
Turner et al. (2020) report cooling of the Antarctic Peninsula since about 2000 and no net warming in East Antarctica since the early 1980s.

Image Source: Turner et al. (2020)
Hrbáček and Uxa, 2020 report a “significant air temperature decrease started around 2000 along most of the Western AP [Antarctic Peninsula].” Specifically, “the north‐eastern AP region exhibited a MAAT more than 1°C lower in the period 2006–2015 compared to 1996–2005, and autumn (MAM) air temperature was even about 1.5°C lower.”

Image Source: Hrbáček and Uxa, 2020
Fatras et al., 2020 find “a cooling of -0.60°C/decade of the air temperature for Greenwich Island” (Antarctica) from 1998 to 2015.

In summary, scientists have been consistently documenting significant cooling trends throughout the Antarctic continent in recent decades despite the common media portrayals of rapid Antarctic warming in response to human activities.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe forcing uncertainties and lack of observational measurements in the top-to-bottom global ocean preclude an assessment that modern warmth is due to anthropogenic activities.
Key points from a new paper (Gebbie, 2021):
• 93% of the changes to the Earth’s energy budget, manifested as warming of the Earth system, are expressed in the global ocean. Just 1% of global warming is atmospheric.
• Even with the advent of “quasi-global” temperature sampling of the ocean since 2005 (ARGO), these floats “do not measure below 2,000-m depth.” This means that temperature changes in “approximately half the ocean’s volume” are still not being measured today.
• To detect the effects of anthropogenic forcing, it would require energy budget imbalance measurement precision of 0.1 W/m² at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). Uncertainty in the forcing changes affecting climate are ±4 W/m², meaning that uncertainty is about 80 times greater than an anthropogenic signal detection.
• Past changes in global ocean heat content, such as the last deglaciation, have been 20 times larger than modern changes.
• Ocean heat storage during the Medieval Warm Period (Medieval Climate Anomaly, or MCA) was much greater than modern. Modern global ocean heat uptake is “just one-third” of what is required to reach the levels attained during Medieval times.

One final point. Dr. Gebbie asserts that approximately 15% of modern global warming (ocean) can be attributed to geothermal heat fluxes through the sea floor that “persistently heat the ocean.” Interestingly, he also assesses that the value attained for geothermal heating of the ocean, 87 mW/m², is similar to that which is required to end a glacial period (melt ice sheets) and transition into an interglacial.

Considering the ocean bottom waters warmed up 2°C from 19,000 to 17,000 years ago about 1,000 years before the surface warmed (and CO2 began rising) (Stott et al., 2007), and that Arctic bottom waters were 6-10°C warmer than today at the beginning of the Holocene about 10,000 years ago (Beierlein et al., 2015), geothermal heat fluxes could potentially explain a large portion of glacial-interglacial transitions – as well as millennial-scale global ocean temperature changes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Arctic had a steep last spurt of melt over the last week, sending the ice area below 5 million sq. km. That puts 2010 as the third lowest ice extent, or the 2nd highest in the last four years, spin it the way you want.

But the melt is now pretty much over, and temperatures in the Arctic have started their plunge. The Danish Meteorological Institute’s latest graphic clearly shows.


The Arctic forecast for the next 14 days shows things are going to get cold fast, with frost spreading south into Canada.

Colder than normal Arctic is in the forecast for the coming winter
But this happens every year of course. Unless winds play some tricks, the sea ice area is not going to get less. The volume reduction is over. So what can we expect for the coming winter? Joe Bastardi for example predicted we would finish at about where we finished this years, but then predicted a recovery over the next couple of years. We’re entering a cold PDO, and the NOAA forecast for the coming winter indicates a colder than normal Arctic.
NOAA NWS Chart 
Remember, NOAA and GISS are used to painting the Arctic red, and not blue. So, if the foreacst pans out, both poles will be colder than normal. That means thicker and more extensive ice. That’s why I made the WAG prediction a couple weeks ago of 5.75 million sq km for September, 2011. Maybe it’s a bit on the high side, but more likely than the once almost certain death spiral made by the experts a couple of years ago.

"The UN secretary general says that he is counting on public pressure to compel governments to take much stronger action against what he calls the climate change “emergency”. “Governments always follow public opinion, everywhere in the world, sooner or later,” António Guterres, said on Tuesday in an interview with Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets, led by Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation, in partnership with the Guardian. Guterres, a former prime minister of Portugal, added: “And so … we need to keep telling the truth to people and be confident that the political system, especially democratic political systems, will in the end deliver.” Guterres refused to comment on Donald Trump and the Trump administration’s hostility to climate action, but a CBS News poll released on 15 September found that 69% of Americans want the next president to take action, while 53% say such action is needed “right now”. Guterres said that “it would be much better” if the US was “strongly committed to climate action”, just as it would be better if Asian countries [notably, China and Japan] stopped exporting coal plants. Until then, he said, “what I want is to have the whole society putting pressure on governments to understand they need to run faster. Because we are losing the race.” With five days remaining before the UN climate action summit on 23 September, the secretary general cited the “fantastic leadership” of young activists as a leading example of how civil society can pressure governments to honor the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit temperature rise to “well below” 2C and preferably to 1.5C. Recent election results across Europe – where green parties gained significant public backing – also left Guterres optimistic that at next Monday’s summit the European Union will announce that it promises to be “carbon neutral” by 2050, as the Paris Agreement mandates. “Nature is angry,” said Guterres, who recently returned from a visit to the Bahamas, where Hurricane Dorian unleashed what he called “total destruction”. He further cited ferocious drought in Africa, melting glaciers, bleaching coral reefs, the hottest month in recorded history last July, and potential future sea level rise of 10 to 20 meters (33 to 66ft) as evidence that, “You cannot play games with Nature. Nature strikes back.” Don’t bring a speech – bring a plan, Guterres famously told heads of state and government in the months leading up to this summit, and it appears that only leaders who followed his instructions will be allowed to speak at the plenary session. To gain a slot, a country had to commit to doing one of three things, said UN officials: be carbon neutral by 2050; “significantly” increase how much it will cut emissions (or, in UN jargon, significantly strengthen its Nationally Determined Contribution); or make a “meaningful” pledge to the Green Climate Fund, a pool of money provided by wealthy countries to help developing countries leave fossil fuels behind and increase their resilience against climate disruption. UN officials expect that 60 to 70 countries will have made sufficiently solid commitments by next Monday that their leaders will be invited to outline their country’s plans from the dais, with each leader granted a mere three minutes to speak. While emphasizing that he had no desire to intervene in the 2020 US presidential election, Guterres spoke positively about a proposal by a leading Democratic candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders, for a Green New Deal that would be global. Most of the leading Democratic presidential candidates endorse one form or another of Green New Deal, a program in which the US government would create millions of jobs by investing in solar power, energy efficiency and other measures to reduce heat-trapping emissions. But a new report by the Nation magazine pointed out that only Sanders’ Green New Deal meets the scientific imperative of cutting global emissions by 45% by 2030 on the way to carbon neutrality by 2050. Sanders’ Green New Deal does this by pledging not only to slash emissions in the US but to help developing countries cut their emissions as well. “The Paris Agreement was very clear,” said Guterres. “There was a commitment by the developed countries to mobilize $100bn per year, from private and public sources, to support the developing world both in mitigation [ie, reducing emissions] and adaptation [preparing against impacts]. Obviously, it is essential that all countries, including the United States, play a role in relation to this.” Rich and poor countries have wrestled with the question of whether and how much financial assistance the rich should give the poor ever since governments first began debating the climate problem at the UN “Earth Summit” in 1992. The poor argue that the rich countries’ emissions are the foremost cause of global warming and climate disruption, while poor countries are the ones that suffer most of that disruption. Rich countries generally do not dispute those facts, and have given lip service to providing assistance, but actual contributions have been modest. The US, for example, has contributed only $1bn, and the Trump administration blocked any additional contributions.  Guterres said in the interview that “of course” he was aware of the global dimensions of Sanders’ Green New Deal, and he added that, “Any attitude from a country like United States to increase … finance to the developing world would be of course welcome.” As required by UN protocol, the secretary general was careful to add, “That doesn’t mean that we want to interfere in the American election.” As a former elected official himself, Guterres also emphasized the need for governments to show the public that climate protection need not mean economic hardship. The secretary general advocates in particular climate-smart tax reform: reducing taxes on people’s incomes while increasing taxes on heat-trapping emissions. “If I [as a politician] take money from you with an increased carbon tax but I give you nothing in return, people will be against [it],” said Guterres. Although rarely described this way, corporate subsidies for production of fossil fuels are also a form of tax. “Let’s be clear: subsidies are paid with taxpayers’ money,” he said, adding with a smile, “I really do not like to see my money as a taxpayer going to bleach corals and melt glaciers.” Guterres disputed a common criticism of a Green New Deal – that it will cost too much – by turning the question around. “What is the cost of the consequences of taking no action?” he asked. Depending on what governments do at the climate action summit next Monday, and are pressured to do by civil society in the weeks and years to come, the world may learn the answer to that question soon enough.

"Trade unions representing hundreds of millions of people around the world have come out in support of what is expected to be the biggest climate mobilisation the world has ever seen. The global climate strike on Friday is set to see thousands of walkouts and demonstrations in cities on every continent except Antarctica.  For the first time adults, businesses and trade unions have been asked to join the youth climate campaign which has grown in just over 12 months from one teenager’s solo protest outside the Swedish parliament a year ago to a millions-strong movement of young people demanding radical action. College students and school children are expected to be joined by adults at more than 4,500 demonstrations in at least 130 countries on Friday as young and old, rich and poor take to the streets to demand politicians urgently tackle the climate crisis. Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, said its 200 million members in countries from South Africa to Germany, Mozambique to Turkey would stand shoulder to shoulder with the students. “The solidarity of the trade union movement globally is behind you,” she said. “The ITUC, with over 200 million members around the world, is totally in support of your leadership.” Burrow said her members would strike alongside students in the streets where the local laws allowed, and where that was not possible trade unionists would take “stop work action” or stage other forms of protest and workplace campaigns to demand radical climate action. Strikes and supporting actions are being planned by unions in scores of countries from the UK to South Africa, Italy to Australia, Brazil to the Philippines. “You need to know that your stand is our stand,” she said. “This is the challenge of our future. For unions we have been saying for a very long time, there are no jobs on a dead planet.” It remains up to individual trade unions to decide what action to take and organisers say it is unclear exactly how many trade unionists will take to the streets alongside the students on Friday. But the backing of some of the biggest and most powerful workers’ groups in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa is a significant boost for the climate movement. Jake Woodier, from the UK Student Climate Network, said: “Unions have a rich history of fighting for progress, so for the global climate strike to have the backing of The International Trade Union Confederation adds massive weight behind our calls for taking immediate action.” In the UK there are now over 200 demonstrations planned for Friday – the biggest mobilisation to date – and the Trades Union Congress last week urged its members to back the global strike with a “workday campaign action” with workers staging walkouts, joining demonstrations or holding environmental workshops. In New York, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who started the youth climate movement, will join students and adults ahead of a key UN climate summit taking place in the city next week. The demonstrations were given a boost after New York public schools said pupils could leave lessons to join the strike without being penalised. The New York demonstrations will culminate with protesters surrounding the UN Climate Summit on Tuesday, when world leaders meet in an attempt to step up action. But organisers say time is running out and are calling on everyone who is alarmed by the unfolding ecological crisis to join Friday’s demonstrations and send a clear message to politicians around the world. Woodier said: “We need ambitious plans – like a Green New Deal – that will tackle climate breakdown while making our societies more equal. To achieve climate progress we need everyone to take action before it’s too late.” Friday’s global strike marks the start of a week of climate protests around the world, culminating in a second global day of action, labelled Earth Strike, on 27 September. Leila Alam, 13, from Lahore in Pakistan, has been campaigning for clean air and water and said everyone should join Friday’s protests wherever they are. “We really want Pakistan to play its proper role in controlling climate change and to make sure we can adapt and not be unprepared for the coming challenges we have been warned of.” Jerome Foster II, a 17-year-old from Washington DC, agreed: “We are calling on everyone to join us. We need a truly diverse and multi-generational movement, made of people from all ages and backgrounds, not just the youth. “We need adults to stand up and call for action and to support young people and do things that young people can’t do. We should be fighting for our future.”"

Snow down to 2300 meters
“At high altitudes of the Alps, precipitation turned into snow overnight,” reported Wetteronline.de here. “In some areas, the snowfall line dropped to an altitude of around 2300 metres.”

Wetteronline.de also noted that on Germany’s highest mountain, Zugspitze, “about 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell in the morning at minus 2 degrees.”
“Employees of the Zugspitzbahn were in continuous operation to clear paths and the visitor platforms from the summer snow masses.”
DWD national weather service labels a cooler than normal July “quite warm”
Meanwhile Germany’s DWD national weather service recently issued what I’d call a press release that is designed especially for stupid and lazy journalists who won’t bother fact-checking. In its preliminary report on July weather in Germany, the DWD announced that the mid summer month this year was “rather warm”.
According to the DWD, the average temperature in July for Germany was 17.7°C, which was “0.8°C above the value for the internationally valid reference period 1961 to 1990.”
But what the DWD fails to tell us is that the 1961-1990 period was a cold one. And not only that, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) no longer uses the 1961-1990 reference period. Instead it uses the 1981-2010 period to calculate the means.
The DWD does mention that July 2020 was 0.3°C too cold compared with the valid reference period 1981 to 2010. So at the DWD, 0.3°C below the valid mean is in their eyes “rather warm”.

Share this...FacebookTwitter12°F warming and 20 ft sea level rises over the next 100 years?  Yawn – how boring. That doesn’t scare anyone anymore. Boring, boring, boring.We need shock and awe. It’s time to get drastic and bury the needle, time to roll out the mothers of scare stories.
For the warmists it’s Hail Mary time.  The “”unless-we-announce-disasters, nobody-will-listen” gig has to be taken to a whole new unheard-of level. The populace is simply much denser than ever imagined. They just aren’t getting it. It’s not sinking in.
It’s time to bring in the super special effects. So leave it up to the German Die Welt online to do that. The normally respectable Die Welt online reports here on scientists studying the planet Venus and coming to the conclusion that Earth may end up like her hellish little sister planet, with surface temperatures of 875°F and atmospheric pressures of 1300 psi (90 times more than now on earth) and more.
This is not the first time a media outlet in Europe has ventured out to this extreme. But hey, things are desperate for the warmists – and especially for their vision of geopolitical and societal resurfacing.
The Die Welt piece starts with the title and introduction:
Hell Planet Venus Is Not So Different From Earth
875°F and sulphuric acid in the air: A climate of hell reigns on the planet Venus and scientists are now studying if those conditions are threatening the Earth.
Die Welt reports on what scientists said at an international Venus conference in Aussois, France. They have determined that inhospitable Venus is much more similar to Earth than previously thought.
Yes, be worried, be very worried. Die Welt writes the scientists believe that:
Venus in the past may have been very similar to Earth – with oceans – and even life. Then the climate changed, and the planet turned into red-hot desolation.
These claims, says Die Welt, are not just science-fiction fantasy, rather they are based on measurements from the European Venus Express probe launched in 2005, which is currently measuring and analysing Venus with an array of high-tech instruments.
Researchers from the Max-Planck-Institute for Solar System Research in Lindau and Germany’s version of NASA are also involved.
Even scientists like Colin Wilson of the University of  Oxford thinks it is probable that:
 In the past there had to have been a lot of water on Venus.
Just like Earth. But what really makes Venus interesting, says Die Welt:

 —is the fact that it is a prime example of a runaway greenhouse effect that may have started in a way that is feared to be now taking place on Earth.
Die Welt describes how things work on Venus:
Due to its thick cloud cover, only 20% of the solar energy reaches the planet’s surface. This 20%, however, cannot be radiated back into space because of Venus’s dense atmosphere, and thus leads to enormous heating of the planet.
Die Welt then adds:
The manmade pollution of the Earth’s  atmosphere – warns a majority of climatologists – could also lead to a runaway situation whose final result would be what we have on Venus today.
That is: 875°F and an atmospheric pressure over 1300 psi.
Scientists are interested in finding out if volcanoes could have erupted and disturbed the atmosphere on Venus early on, and thus led to a runaway greenhouse effect, The scientists at the conference in Aussois are trying to determine the cause of resurfacing on Venus.
To summarise, Die Welt is attempting to get its readers to believe we are creating a hell on Earth. It doesn’t get more cynical than that.
Meanwhile, just in the time it took to read this post, hundreds of people died worldwide because of malnutrition. But governments and the media couldn’t care less of the current, real tragedy, it seems. It’s more important to go all out and spend billions to cynically concoct new bogus future scare stories to frighten citizens, and ignore the messy problems of today.
Journalists and governments need to wake up and get back to doing what they’re supposed to do. Funding and supporting scientists in concocting ridiculous scare stories is not one of them. Indeed it’s willful neglect of the pressing problems we face right now on the planet today.
In Germany this behaviour is a violation of the law and is called Unterlassene Hilfeleistung (neglect to provide rescue assistance).
The world is not facing a climate catastrophe. Instead it’s dead in the middle of a leadership catastrophe. So much so that one could argue it’s bordering on crime.
Voters and consumers, it’s time to run these bums out-of-town.
Update: Craig Goodrich brings to our attention the following very useful link to a post by Steve Goddard at WUWT. http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/05/06/hyperventilating-on-venus/, and Lubos Motl http://motls.blogspot.com/2010/05/hyperventilating-on-venus.html.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHave you ever read something about yourself in the newspaper and thought: “Man, they got it wrong”?
Yesterday I summed up in English and posted a German-language piece put out directly by RIA Novosti (see post from yesterday) http://de.rian.ru/science/20100423/126040500.html.  Then a few hours later WUWT posted an English version of the same story released by the UPI. The two versions could hardly be different. It’s one thing to get some things wrong, but it’s quite another to write a whole new story.
1. The UPI opens with:
A Russian scientist says the Arctic may be getting colder, not warmer, which…
But the German version, direct from RIA Novosti, says:
Not warming, but cooling will impact the Earth’s climate over the next few years….

2. The UPI wrote:

An Arctic cold snap that began in 1998…

But the German version says:
The climate has been cooling since 1998…  
When translating, you’ll rarely get it 100% right. Translators try to get as close as possible. But here there really is no excuse for screwing up cooling will impact the Earth’s climate and writing instead: Arctic may be getting colder.  In no. 2 they translate “climate“ to “Arctic“!
The UPI then leaves out (censors?) a large portion of the text as well. For an issue on which the future of humanity hinges, one that is as grave as WWII, the UPI translation sure was awfully careless. It gets a failing grade. Readers – check your sources!

"At a meeting of the Senate climate crisis task force on Tuesday, lawmakers praised a group of young activists for their leadership, their gumption and their display of wisdom far beyond their years. They then asked the teens for advice on how Congress might combat one of the most urgent and politically contentious threats confronting world leaders: climate change. Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who has galvanized young people across the world to strike for more action to combat the impact of global warming, politely reminded them that she was a student, not a scientist – or a senator. “Please save your praise. We don’t want it,” she said. “Don’t invite us here to just tell us how inspiring we are without actually doing anything about it because it doesn’t lead to anything. “If you want advice for what you should do, invite scientists, ask scientists for their expertise. We don’t want to be heard. We want the science to be heard.” In remarks meant for Congress as a whole, she said: “I know you are trying but just not hard enough. Sorry.” The audience laughed. Supporters broke into applause. Senator Ed Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-sponsored the Green New Deal and leads the Senate task force, was perhaps surprised by her bluntness. But he smiled. Seated at the table with the teens were some of the most sympathetic and vocal supporters of bold action on climate change in Congress. But facing a Republican-controlled Senate and a hostile White House, the prospect of enacting reforms at the scale and scope called for by activists – and many scientists – is bleak. “We need your leadership,” Markey told Thunberg. “Young people are the army politically, which has arrived in the United States. You put a spotlight on this issue in a way that it has never been before. And that is creating a new X factor.” Still, he vowed to try: “We hear you. We hear what you’re saying and we will redouble our efforts.” Thunberg was one of several youth activists invited to address the task force during two days of action and speeches aimed at urging lawmakers to support “transformative climate action”. She was joined by activists from across the US and South America, part of a “multiracial, intergenerational” effort to combat climate change. In August 2018 Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden when aged 15. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries. Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.” Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings. Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. The meetings and speeches in Washington are intended to raise awareness ahead of a global climate strike on Friday in which students and workers will walk out of schools and offices to pressure their governments to act as world leaders gather in New York for the annual United Nations summit. “The generation of the Green New Deal will not only survive but we will thrive,” said Nadia Nazar, co-founder of the advocacy group Zero Hour, at a news conference earlier on Tuesday. “We will no longer be known as the kids fighting the apocalypse. We will be known as the solution to the climate crisis.” In the US, support for sweeping action on climate change is polarized. Many Republicans – among them Donald Trump – are still openly skeptical of the science behind global warming. Republican leaders have mocked Democrats for introducing a Green New Deal and have used the proposal as a cudgel against lawmakers and presidential candidates. The Green New Deal is an ambitious 14-page resolution that calls for a “10-year national mobilization” that would eliminate the nation’s emissions in one decade. Scientists say limiting warming to 1.5C would require cutting manmade carbon levels by 45% by 2030 and reaching net zero around 2050. Markey said their movement is shifting the political landscape. The senator pointed to the 2020 presidential debates as evidence of what has changed. Candidates are being asked about climate change and pushed to introduce plans to combat global warming. This is in stark contrast to 2016. “What has happened? You have happened,” he told the activists. “You are giving this extra level of energy to the political process that is absolutely changing the dynamics of politics in the United States.” The 2020 election, Markey said, will in many ways be a “referendum on climate change”. Thunberg arrived in the US after crossing the Atlantic on a solar-powered yacht. She rose to international prominence after launching “Fridays for Future”: student-led strikes that have spread to 135 countries. She has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. On Monday, she met Barack Obama. The former president shared a photo from their meeting, in which he praised Thunberg as “one of our planet’s greatest advocates” and someone who is “unafraid to push for real action”. Later on Tuesday, the group was scheduled to meet Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal in the House. On Wednesday, Thunberg will deliver what has been billed as a “major address” to members of Congress."

Share this...FacebookTwitterPrompted by the observation that dramatic COVID-related reductions in 2020 human CO2 emissions had zero impact on the Earth’s CO2 concentration, two scientists conduct extensive statistical probability analyses to conclude temperature changes lead CO2 changes, not the other way around.
The nearly global acceptance of economically-devastating lockdowns as a mitigating response to the COVID-19 pandemic has inspired many to question the assumption humans drive changes in CO2 concentration.
As Drs. Koutsoyiannis and Kundzewicz  point out in their iconoclastic new study, “despite unprecedented decrease in carbon emission, there was an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, which followed a pattern similar to previous years.”

Image Source: Koutsoyiannis and Kundzewicz, 2020
Utilizing the obvious condition that causes precede effects, or that effects do not lead causes, the authors first point out that the paleoclimate record shows CO2 changes follow temperature changes by about 1000 years. Then they examine the sequential relationship between global temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration during 1980–2019.
While they find the causality direction for CO2 leading temperature (T) changes does exist, the results of their study clearly “support the hypothesis that the dominant direction is T → CO2,” not CO2 → T.
In fact, the statistical probability is so robust “the p-values in the direction T → [CO2] are always smaller than in direction [CO2] → T by about 4 to 5 orders of magnitude, thus clearly supporting T → [CO2] as dominant direction.” Temperature is shown to lead CO2 changes by about 6 months to a year.
Drs. Koutsoyiannis and Kundzewicz acknowledge the perspective “CO2 → T prevails in public, as well as in scientific, perception.” So they point out that an IPCC analysis has natural ground (soil) CO2 emissions reaching 114 to 119 gigatons of carbon (GtC) per year, whereas ground (fossil fuel) emissions from anthropogenic sources only amount to 8 or 9 GtC per year. Consequently, the “change in carbon fluxes due to natural processes is likely to exceed the change due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions” as the “the intensity of biochemical process increases with temperature [and] leads to increasing natural CO2 emission.”

Image Source: Koutsoyiannis and Kundzewicz, 2020
This study is not without precedent. Another analysis of the temperature-CO2 phase relation for 1980-2012 (Humlum et al., 2013) indicated “changes in atmospheric CO2 are not tracking changes in human emissions” and “changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging 9.5-10 months behind changes in global air surface temperature.”

Atmospheric physicist Dr. Murry Salby authored a textbook highlighting the dependence of CO2 emissions on temperature. He insisted that “a significant portion” of the recent increase in CO2 “derives from a gradual increase in surface temperature” (pg. 253).
But there is also a “major inconsistency” in the currently accepted paleoclimate and straight-line (Mauna Loa) CO2 progressions, as they imply CO2 molecules do not respond to temperature like they are observed to do so chemically.
He concludes: “The two proxies of previous climate are incompatible. They cannot both be correct.”

A critical analysis of the paleoclimate CO2 record (Jaworowski et al., 1992) suggests the assumption we can accurately determine the entire Earth’s CO2 concentration by examining ancient polar ice bubbles – 36 to 100% of which are contaminated by exposure to today’s air – is “shown to be invalid.”
In Holocene-era ice cores, CO2 reaches 2500 ppm, 2900 ppm, even 7400 ppm per measurements taken in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. These values were selectively rejected by those seeking to reach “consensus” that modern CO2 concentration values are unprecedented.

To further illustrate the currently accepted paleoclimate CO2 records are likely to be invalid, consider the fact that modern CO2 concentrations beneath snowpack in forests and meadows range from 600 to 1800 ppm and these concentrations can fluctuate by as much as 200 ppm within a period of just 4 days (Massman and Frank, 2006).
If this kind of flux can be observed for modern conditions, assessing the CO2 concentration beneath snowpack that is thousands of years old is little more than fanciful speculation.

"As irony would have it, the Sunday of London fashion week was a freakishly warm day for mid-September. Victoria Beckham’s show was being held in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, so there was a queue snaking down King Charles Street in Westminster while ID cards were checked, bags were scanned and the audience lolled in the sunshine. On the other side of the road, the fashion queue was mirrored by an orderly lineup of climate crisis activists – many dressed not dissimilarly from the fashion crowd, with a lean toward asymmetric clothing and unusual sunglasses – holding placards reading “The Ugly Truth About Fashion” and “Business As Usual Is Killing The Planet”. Sara Arnold, an Extinction Rebellion spokesperson, talked eloquently about the need to “wake people up to their power as citizens, not consumers”. A fashion photographer, perhaps misjudging the mood, began to heckle her, only to be shushed by the very showgoers who the protesters were facing off against. “If we realise and act now, we have the power to change our course,” Arnold continued. The fashion industry audience listened politely, until all the Saint Laurent and Gucci handbags had been through the scanner and we could file into the show space, where a view of David Beckham and Dame Helen Mirren displaced from our minds any thought of the imminent demise of the human race. Welcome to Late Stage Capitalism: The Musical – the show formerly known as fashion week. Fashion week has never just been about fashion. It is a microcosm of everything that is compelling and seductive about modern life, and of everything that is terrifying about modern life as well. The gaudy consumerism that makes fashion week an increasingly queasy spectacle isn’t just about handbags: it’s about the processed food we eat, the packaging we use, the trips we make by car and plane. Fashion week is an all-singing, all-dancing, jazz-hands live-action hot take on how we live. Fashion has been the golden child of popular culture for two decades. From Sex and the City to Beyoncé’s politically charged wardrobe in the Formation video, from the Oscar red carpet to Chanel’s Superbowl-sized catwalk shows, fashion has broadcast to the whole world. Fashion weeks in Lagos and Copenhagen as well as London, New York, Milan and Paris have fed on the intravenous energy of their cities, becoming a modern version of the royal box at the opera house: the place to see and be seen as both powerful and glamorous. (We have a word for that, in fashion. It’s called being fabulous.) Fashion’s lure to celebrity extends way beyond the ranks of reality TV stars. Last Thursday, the day London fashion week began, I was at a lunchtime event with Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and then spent the evening down-table from Theresa May at a women’s-only dinner thrown by the designer Anya Hindmarch. If fashion is the new opium of the masses, fashion week is the A-list’s guilty pleasure. But the climate crisis has set fashion on a collision course with the zeitgeist. This is both a practical and a philosophical problem for fashion. Practical, first, because of the ever-increasing production of new clothes and the churn of landfill this leaves in its wake. But philosophical, too, because fashion has to be about looking ahead. If fashion doesn’t engage with the future, it literally isn’t fashion. “The climate crisis is this generation’s war, and wars change everything,” said Hindmarch at dinner on Thursday. There is a new seriousness to the mood music in fashion. Alpha front-row reading now means Fashionopolis: The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes by Dana Thomas, or The Testaments. (The most-Instagrammed bag of show week was a tote bag printed with the cover of the new Atwood novel. If you can’t track that down, there’s a Guardian x Katharine Hamnett tote in partnership with Friends of the Earth, on sale Thursday.) If you are reading a magazine, make it the new issue of Teen Vogue with Greta Thunberg on the cover. It is now more of a status symbol to boast about how old your clothes are, whether sourced from your own wardrobe or from a vintage store, than how new-season they are. Deadstock – unsold clothes from past seasons – is a buzzword all of a sudden. Backstage after the Preen show on Sunday morning, the designer Justin Thornton told me that some pieces in the collection would be made in limited runs, as they were being produced “out of deadstock we had in the studio from old seasons, that we wanted to reuse rather than buying new fabric”. Ganni, the cult Danish label that opened its first London store this week, regularly makes capsule collections out of old-season stock. Roland Mouret, who is on a mission against the wastefulness of single-use clothes hangers – “the plastic straws of the fashion industry” – also featured upcycled baseball caps by the Berlin milliners ReHats. A pivot away from new clothes doesn’t mean the end of fashion. Curated edits of pre-loved clothes are emerging as a model to bring hanger-appeal and contemporary relevance to secondhand clothes. At its most upscale, this can mean vintage Paris fashion hand-picked by Marie Blanchet at William Vintage. But it can also be rented designer pieces from MyWardrobe.com, from where you can borrow a Gucci handbag or a Burberry trenchcoat, boosting your wardrobe and the circular economy at the same time. Also on the rise is peer-to-peer rental on Hurr Collective, where a week’s rental of a new designer piece is usually around 15% of the retail price. It has become fashionable to predict that the future of fashion is the end of trends, but I’m not convinced. Watching models in white sunglasses and silk headscarves dance in feathered minidresses and foxy tailoring by the British luxury brand 16Arlington at its show this weekend, where the collection was inspired by the glamour of 1960s Italy, reminded me how evocative and desirable a retro look can be. These clothes were newly made, but a vintage-oriented fashion mindset could take such a show as a jumping-off point to fall back in love with old pieces in a wardrobe, an attic, or a secondhand store. With the future not looking all that pretty, nostalgia could be a rising stock. Fashion isn’t going away any time soon. But to keep pace with the zeitgeist, it needs to smarten up its act."
"I am not stockpiling for Brexit – that seems wildly melodramatic. Instead, I find myself waking up in the night, wondering whether to arm myself. By dawn, of course, this seems a little extreme, too. Somehow, by breakfast, I have reminded myself I am not in Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, feasting on a foetus, and that in fact I live near a well-stocked Tesco Metro. Yet, if Brexit is a vast psychodrama that is never about what it says it is about (no one is that emotionally invested in tariffs, whatever they suggest), then it is bound to provoke some deeply peculiar feelings. Some of my friends have become very anxious – about food supplies, medicines, civil unrest. We had some of this before 2016: food banks and riots, anyone? But the media ramps up these feelings by the hour. The message is that democracy has toppled and everything will close down on 1 November; in truth, this is the day negotiations will start for real.  Like everyone else, I absorb all this unease, which largely goes unspoken unless someone in the country happens to be vox-popped by a passing journalist. I asked my teenager the other day: “Should I buy, like … some extra chickpeas?” She no longer gets the news from what she calls the MSM, meaning mainstream media (places such as the Guardian), so Brexit barely registers for her. The whole situation is just another stupid thing adults have done to ruin everything. “You mean prepping, Mum?” she said. “Prepping?” “For the end of the world. We should be preppers.” She read about this in some Extinction Rebellion essays and thinks I should take it far more seriously. I know only about the Silicon Valley billionaires who are preparing for the breakdown of civilisation by building underground residences in New Zealand, but this doesn’t seem all that relevant, since I have never been to New Zealand and don’t have a private plane. Like my daughter, I find the climate crisis scarier than Brexit, because it is already happening: the flooding, the hurricanes, the desertification, the fires. There are already poor, desperate people who can’t get clean water. Will that one day be us? It will all come down to water in the end.  My daughter and I are suffering from what is now called “eco-anxiety”. Therapists and mental health experts are reporting that many children are now terrified of climate catastrophe. While this should be recognised as a psychological phenomenon, it is not a mental illness, because it is rational. For older people, Brexit now shades into a feeling of utter doom and powerlessness. My daughter says that, like those billionaires, we need to build a bunker. This seems wise, possibly. But, since New Zealand doesn’t look like an option and our money is far from limitless, where? I argue that we will have to leave London and get on to higher ground. I remember the strange couple I interviewed in 1999 about the Millennium Bug, who were taking to the hills. Nothing much happened, except they ended up divorcing. “We need to grow our own vegetables,” I say authoritatively, having grown up in Suffolk. The only problem is that you need a fair bit of land to feed a family; currently, we have decking. I tell my daughter that we will have to get rid of it, which comes as a bit of a shock to her. All of it is, really. The people who survive will be the people who know stuff or know how to find things out without the internet, I explain. This makes her anxious. “They’ll switch off the internet?” I don’t know who “they” are now. The government? Mark Zuckerberg? Vladimir Putin? Jean-Claude Juncker? If the internet goes down, “then I will die”, she says, matter-of-factly. “Don’t be ridiculous,” I say, while secretly thinking much the same. This is as far as we have got with the prepping. The reality is that, as we all know, anxiety is fuel for tyranny. Fear begets fear. Building my own bunker will not save me. That much I know. This comes as a relief – it would probably need planning permission. •Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterStanford researchers dispel the belief that high yield agriculture, with its intensive use of fuel-guzzling machinery and chemical fertilisers, emits huge amounts of “dangerous” greenhouse gases. Read here.High yield agriculture has resulted in a savings of the equivalent of 590 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide.
The Stanford news release writes:
– The yield improvements reduced the need to convert forests to farmland, a process that typically involves burning of trees and other plants, which generates carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
– The researchers estimate that if not for increased yields, additional greenhouse gas emissions from clearing land for farming would have been equal to as much as a third of the world’s total output of greenhouse gases since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in 1850.
– The researchers found that without the advances in high-yield agriculture, several billion additional acres of cropland would have been needed.
and
The researchers also calculated that for every dollar spent on agricultural research and development since 1961, emissions of the three principal greenhouse gases – methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide – were reduced by the equivalent of about a quarter of a ton of carbon dioxide – a high rate of financial return compared to other approaches to reducing the gases.
I wonder if these results will lead activist environmental organisations to reconsider the use of gene-improved plants, which have the potential to greatly improve yield. You also have to ask if organic agriculture, with its non-use of chemical fertilisers and thus lower yields, is bad for the planet. And, the results of this study should tell governments  concerned about GHG that bio-fuels are a bad idea because they require millions of acres of extra farmland, in addition to that used for food production.

"A “one-size-fits-all” solution to addressing the climate crisis through our diets could be unhelpful, as how we eat affects the environment in different ways depending on where we live and how our food is sourced, according to a new report. Although reducing the consumption of meat and animal-based products globally could lower greenhouse gas emissions, it could also have adverse impacts on people’s health and nutrition in some countries, according to a report published online in the Global Environmental Change journal on Monday.  The report, which assessed dietary patterns across 140 countries, paints a complex picture of the country-specific implications of dietary changes on both people and the environment. “We need to be careful about oversimplifying things or prescribing a ‘one-size-fits-all’, western-centric solution to the challenges of diet and climate,” said Martin Bloem, a director at Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future and one of the co-authors of the study. The report notes that many Britons are choosing vegetarian diets to reduce the environmental damage caused by their lifestyles, but suggests that they may better off going “two-thirds vegan” – eliminating animal products including meat and dairy from two in three meals. For a British person, going vegetarian would reduce the climate impact attributable to their diet by 36%, while cutting meat and dairy out of two-thirds of their meals would reduce it by 61%. That’s because dairy has a relatively high carbon footprint. In other countries, the impact of meat-based diets could be hugely different – for example, a pound of beef produced in Paraguay contributes nearly 17 times more greenhouse gases than a pound of beef produced in Denmark, partly to do with the deforestation involved in beef production in Paraguay. According to the study’s authors, diet-related solutions to the climate crisis ought to be sustainable and address the problems of undernutrition, obesity, poverty and economic development. Achieving healthy diet in most low- and middle-income countries could require an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and water use due to food production. “It is critical to recognise that different countries have different priorities and are at different stages of development – meaning there are different imperatives for these countries and their populations,” Bloem said. “A top-down diktat that recommends a plant-based diet without taking into account the nutritional needs of vulnerable populations or the availability of certain foodstuffs is neither helpful nor appropriate,” he added. “The fact is that in low-income countries, some people, especially young children, will need to eat more animal products, particularly dairy and eggs, to get adequate protein, vitamins, and minerals. Consequently the diet-related emissions and use of freshwater in these places will have to rise. This means that in high-income countries, where people generally have enough to eat – although [they] are not necessarily healthy – the shift towards more plant-forward diets and away from carbon- and water-intensive consumption patterns has to happen faster.” The report suggests that in the UK, while animal foods can be an important source of nutrients for young children, meat and dairy are overwhelmingly responsible for the greenhouse gas footprint of British diets. Plant foods account for 69% of the calories consumed in the UK but only 12% of greenhouse gases and 40% of the water footprint. “The solutions are not uniform and will inevitably involve trade-offs,” said Bloem. This article was amended on 18 September 2019 to make clear that 36% is the average amount that a British person’s carbon footprint attributable to their diet would be reduced by if they were to become vegetarian, as opposed to their overall carbon footprint."

"Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish climate activist, has tapped into a global passion for change from the outdated, exploitative system to a holistic and responsible one (Thunberg tells US Congress: ‘I want you to take real action on climate’, 19 September). The industrial paradigm separates materials from their histories. Forests may have been torn down, lakes polluted, people and animals displaced, but the consumer doesn’t know this. Society has taught us that it is essential to have the latest product and not to question where it came from or who was hurt in the process. The need for change has to be now.  Sometimes it is hard to know what to do. People have been led by consumerism for so long that it is difficult to see that there is another way, but there are many practical things we can do, such as: don’t fly unless absolutely necessary; eat less meat and dairy; plant a tree; create a garden with shrubs and flowers that will attract wildlife; line-dry clothes; unplug electronic devices; turn lights off when not needed; drive less; grow your own vegetables or eat local produce; don’t buy fast fashion; ask where products have come from.  Some of these will inevitably lead to a change in lifestyle, but if we do nothing our precious planet is at risk. We need to care for this planet like it is our own skin. It is time to look upwards into the sky and realise that there is nowhere else for us to go and to value this beautiful place we call home.Diana SandersLlanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, Conwy • On 20 September, many people will strike to raise awareness of the climate crisis and encourage governments to take action to tackle it. While this is a worthwhile endeavour, there’s no need to wait for a special date to commit to saving the planet. If you truly want to combat climate change, you can start today by removing meat, eggs and dairy from your shopping list. Each year, humans kill 60 billion land animals for food – that’s almost 7 million every hour. All these animals produce massive amounts of waste, which releases powerful greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. Animal agriculture is the single largest source of both methane and nitrous oxide, greenhouse gases that are, respectively, 25 and 300 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. A person who follows a vegan lifestyle produces the equivalent of 50% less carbon dioxide than a meat-eater and uses 1/11th of the oil, 1/13th of the water, and 1/18th of the land. That’s why the United Nations has stated that a global shift towards a vegan diet is essential to combat the worst effects of climate change, and research from the University of Oxford has found that going vegan is “the single biggest way” to reduce our environmental impact. So by all means take part in the strike for the climate – but remember that change starts on your plate and choose planet- and animal-friendly vegan meals.Sascha CamilliPeta Foundation • We cannot forget the rural poor in Africa as we tackle the climate crisis. Your recent article covering the Bloem report (Fighting climate crisis by avoiding meat ignores poor countries’ needs – report, 17 September) has confirmed what we have known for a long time: we need country- and community-specific solutions to address global nutrition and the climate crisis. Meeting sustainable diets in rural Africa remains a challenge. With livestock traditionally playing a significant part, the crucial question is of how animals are managed going forwards. In holistic, integrated farm systems, livestock can play a part in sequestering carbon, as well as ensuring that children grow up free from the lifelong effects of stunting due to malnutrition. With this in mind, the addition of livestock to small-holder farms in rural Africa cannot be tossed aside; it is still the sustainable solution they so desperately need. A dairy cow can, for example, regenerate tired soil through manure, and provide essential nutrition from milk. Without access to processed protein alternatives like tofu, eggs and milk are the most effective way for rural African communities to prevent stunting in children. The difference between the industrial-scale cattle ranching that is destroying the Amazon and sustainable family farmers in Africa really cannot be stressed enough.Richie AlfordDirector of research and impact at the charity Send a Cow • There are many of us who would agree with George Monbiot’s heartfelt plea to prevent wealth due to its irrevocable destruction of the planet (For the sake of life on Earth, we must put a limit on wealth, 19 September). It seems screamingly obvious to me too. But how do we bring about the change required to achieve this. No wealthy person is going to voluntarily give up reaping the rewards of wealth earned by their hard work. Their wealth is stashed away in financial havens all round the world. Have we got to recognise that the capitalist system is flawed? As a child playing Monopoly, it was clear that once the expensive properties had been acquired by one player the game was over. In real life the same rule applies: only other rich people can play a rich person’s game. So, George, let us hear your suggestions of how we can stop people getting rich; how the capitalist system can be revised to share wealth more equally? How can we change the human mindset? The human race is very competitive and individualistic. That is why we are still here today. But if we do not find a way, I believe we could destroy ourselves and the planet. I see it as evolution turned on its head. We have to go in reverse. Angela FinchSydenham, London • The effects of the climate emergency are blindingly obvious. All around us, we can see the damage in gardens, allotments, parks and farms in south-east and eastern areas of England. Due to the record high temperatures and very low rainfall, many trees are in danger, vegetables and shrubs are collapsing or failing to flourish, and grass is turning brown. And the air quality is even worse than usual in many areas as a result, with consequent risks to health. But you would be hard put to gather any of this from watching or listening to weather bulletins on mainstream TV and radio. Over and over again, weather presenters cheerfully welcome the high temperatures and dryness with barely a mention of the damage being caused. Any chance of rain is usually described as a risk, rather than something desperately needed. How do weather presenters think that plants, trees and wildlife grow and flourish? It is especially worrying that the effects of the climate emergency are being normalised on mainstream TV and radio. The BBC and other broadcasters need to step up to the plate and properly inform and educate people about the effects of the climate emergency on our weather. Programmes about extreme weather or climate change don’t redress the balance when everyday weather bulletins normalise what is happening and ignore the extremely serious effects.Linda LennardSt Albans, Hertfordshire • Bill McKibben is so right (If the world ran on sun, it wouldn’t fight over oil, 18 September). A few years ago I wrote to the then Tory energy secretary suggesting that every new-build house be fitted with solar panels. The reply I received was that the cost to housebuyers would be excessive in an already inflated housing market. Yet an extra £7,000 on the mortgage for a £400,000 house is peanuts and would soon be recouped by energy cost savings. It would revitalise the solar industry, guarantee work in that sector for evermore, and help save our planet. Everyone I share this idea with supports it as being sensible and an easy part solution to the oncoming climate crisis – particularly if we continue to get such global warming and sunshine as we have seen these last couple of years. I cannot for the life of me think what objections governments can have to this in this day and age. I wish someone in authority would tell me.Rob Parrish,Starcross, Devon  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Many moons ago in Tibet, the Second Buddha transformed a fierce nyen (a malevolent mountain demon) into a neri (the holiest protective warrior god) called Khawa Karpo, who took up residence in the sacred mountain bearing his name. Khawa Karpo is the tallest of the Meili mountain range, piercing the sky at 6,740 metres (22,112ft) above sea level. Local Tibetan communities believe that conquering Khawa Karpo is an act of sacrilege and would cause the deity to abandon his mountain home. Nevertheless, there have been several failed attempts by outsiders – the best known by an international team of 17, all of whom died in an avalanche during their ascent on 3 January 1991. After much local petitioning, in 2001 Beijing passed a law banning mountaineering there. However, Khawa Karpo continues to be affronted more insidiously. Over the past two decades, the Mingyong glacier at the foot of the mountain has dramatically receded. Villagers blame disrespectful human behaviour, including an inadequacy of prayer, greater material greed and an increase in pollution from tourism. People have started to avoid eating garlic and onions, burning meat, breaking vows or fighting for fear of unleashing the wrath of the deity. Mingyong is one of the world’s fastest shrinking glaciers, but locals cannot believe it will die because their own existence is intertwined with it. Yet its disappearance is almost inevitable. Khawa Karpo lies at the world’s “third pole”. This is how glaciologists refer to the Tibetan plateau, home to the vast Hindu Kush-Himalaya ice sheet, because it contains the largest amount of snow and ice after the Arctic and Antarctic – the Chinese glaciers alone account for an estimated 14.5% of the global total. However, a quarter of its ice has been lost since 1970. This month, in a long-awaited special report on the cryosphere by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists will warn that up to two-thirds of the region’s remaining glaciers are on track to disappear by the end of the century. It is expected a third of the ice will be lost in that time even if the internationally agreed target of limiting global warming by 1.5C above pre-industrial levels is adhered to. Whether we are Buddhists or not, our lives affect, and are affected by, these tropical glaciers that span eight countries. This frozen “water tower of Asia” is the source of 10 of the world’s largest rivers, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yellow, Mekong and Indus, whose flows support at least 1.6 billion people directly – in drinking water, agriculture, hydropower and livelihoods – and many more indirectly, in buying a T-shirt made from cotton grown in China, for example, or rice from India. Joseph Shea, a glaciologist at the University of Northern British Columbia, calls the loss “depressing and fear-inducing. It changes the nature of the mountains in a very visible and profound way.”  Yet the fast-changing conditions at the third pole have not received the same attention as those at the north and south poles. The IPCC’s fourth assessment report in 2007 contained the erroneous prediction that all Himalayan glaciers would be gone by 2035. This statement turned out to have been based on anecdote rather than scientific evidence and, perhaps out of embarrassment, the third pole has been given less attention in subsequent IPCC reports. There is also a dearth of research compared to the other poles, and what hydrological data exists has been jealously guarded by the Indian government and other interested parties. The Tibetan plateau is a vast and impractical place for glaciologists to work in and confounding factors make measurements hard to obtain. Scientists are forbidden by locals, for instance, to step out on to the Mingyong glacier, meaning they have had to use repeat photography to measure the ice retreat. In the face of these problems, satellites have proved invaluable, allowing scientists to watch glacial shrinkage in real time. This summer, Columbia University researchers also used declassified spy-satellite images from the cold war to show that third pole ice loss has accelerated over this century and is now roughly double the melt rate of 1975 to 2000, when temperatures were on average 1C lower. Glaciers in the region are currently losing about half a vertical metre of ice per year because of anthropogenic global heating, the researchers concluded. Glacial melt here carries significant risk of death and injury – far more than in the sparsely populated Arctic and Antarctic – from glacial lake outbursts (when a lake forms and suddenly spills over its banks in a devastating flood) and landslides caused by destabilised rock. Whole villages have been washed away and these events are becoming increasingly regular, even if monitoring and rescue systems have improved. Satellite data shows that numbers and sizes of such risky lakes in the region are growing. Last October and November, on three separate occasions, debris blocked the flow of the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet, threatening India and Bangladesh downstream with flooding and causing thousands to be evacuated. One reason for the rapid ice loss is that the Tibetan plateau, like the other two poles, is warming at a rate up to three times as fast as the global average, by 0.3C per decade. In the case of the third pole, this is because of its elevation, which means it absorbs energy from rising, warm, moisture-laden air. Even if average global temperatures stay below 1.5C, the region will experience more than 2C of warming; if emissions are not reduced, the rise will be 5C, according to a report released earlier this year by more than 200 scientists for the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). Winter snowfall is already decreasing and there are, on average, four fewer cold nights and seven more warm nights per year than 40 years ago. Models also indicate a strengthening of the south-east monsoon, with heavy and unpredictable downpours. “This is the climate crisis you haven’t heard of,” said ICIMOD’s chief scientist, Philippus Wester. There is another culprit besides our CO2 emissions in this warming story, and it’s all too evident on the dirty surface of the Mingyong glacier: black carbon, or soot. A 2013 study found that black carbon is responsible for 1.1 watts per square metre of the Earth’s surface of extra energy being stored in the atmosphere (CO2 is responsible for an estimated 1.56 watts per square metre). Black carbon has multiple climate effects, changing clouds and monsoon circulation as well as accelerating ice melt. Air pollution from the Indo-Gangetic Plains – one of the world’s most polluted regions – deposits this black dust on glaciers, darkening their surface and hastening melt. While soot landing on dark rock has little effect on its temperature, snow and glaciers are particularly vulnerable because they are so white and reflective. As glaciers melt, the surrounding rock crumbles in landslides, covering the ice with dark material that speeds melt in a runaway cycle. The Everest base camp, for instance, at 5,300 metres, is now rubble and debris as the Khumbu glacier has retreated to the icefall. The immense upland of the third pole is one of the most ecologically diverse and vulnerable regions on Earth. People have only attempted to conquer these mountains in the last century, yet in that time humans have subdued the glaciers and changed the face of this wilderness with pollution and other activities. Researchers are now beginning to understand the scale of human effects on the region – some have experienced it directly: many of the 300 IPCC cryosphere report authors meeting in the Nepalese capital in July were forced to take shelter or divert to other airports because of a freak monsoon. But aAside from such inconveniences, what do these changes mean for the 240 million people living in the mountains? Well, in many areas, it has been welcomed. Warmer, more pleasant winters have made life easier. The higher temperatures have boosted agriculture – people can grow a greater variety of crops and benefit from more than one harvest per year, and that improves livelihoods. This may be responsible for the so-called Karakoram anomaly, in which a few glaciers in the Pakistani Karakoram range are advancing in opposition to the general trend. Climatologists believe that the sudden and massive growth of irrigated agriculture in the local area, coupled with unusual topographical features, has produced an increase in snowfall on the glaciers which currently more than compensates for their melting. Elsewhere, any increase in precipitation is not enough to counter the rate of ice melt and places that are wholly reliant on meltwater for irrigation are feeling the effects soonest. “Springs have dried drastically in the past 10 years without meltwater and because infrastructure has cut off discharge,” says Aditi Mukherji, one of the authors of the IPCC report. Known as high-altitude deserts, places such as Ladakh in north-eastern India and parts of Tibet have already lost many of their lower-altitude glaciers and with them their seasonal irrigation flows, which is affecting agriculture and electricity production from hydroelectric dams. In some places, communities are trying to geoengineer artificial glaciers that divert runoff from higher glaciers towards shaded, protected locations where it can freeze over winter to provide meltwater for irrigation in the spring. Only a few of the major Asian rivers are heavily reliant on glacial runoff – the Yangtze and Yellow rivers are showing reduced water levels because of diminished meltwater and the Indus (40% glacier-fed) and Yarkand (60% glacier-fed) are particularly vulnerable. So although mountain communities are suffering from glacial disappearance, those downstream are currently less affected because rainfall makes a much larger contribution to rivers such as the Ganges and Mekong as they descend into populated basins. Upstream-downstream conflict over extractions, dam-building and diversions has so far largely been averted through water-sharing treaties between nations, but as the climate becomes less predictable and scarcity increases, the risk of unrest within – let alone between – nations grows. Towards the end of this century, pre-monsoon water-flow levels in all these rivers will drastically reduce without glacier buffers, affecting agricultural output as well as hydropower generation, and these stresses will be compounded by an increase in the number and severity of devastating flash floods. “The impact on local water resources will be huge, especially in the Indus Valley. We expect to see migration out of dry, high-altitude areas first but populations across the region will be affected,” says Shea, also an author on the ICIMOD report. As the third pole’s vast frozen reserves of fresh water make their way down to the oceans, they are contributing to sea-level rise that is already making life difficult in the heavily populated low-lying deltas and bays of Asia, from Bangladesh to Vietnam. What is more, they are releasing dangerous pollutants. Glaciers are time capsules, built snowflake by snowflake from the skies of the past and, as they melt, they deliver back into circulation the constituents of that archived air. Dangerous pesticides such as DDT (widely used for three decades before being banned in 1972) and perfluoroalkyl acids are now being washed downstream in meltwater and accumulating in sediments and in the food chain. Ultimately the future of this vast region, its people, ice sheets and arteries depends – just as Khawa Karpo’s devotees believe – on us: on reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. As Mukherji says, many of the glaciers that haven’t yet melted have effectively “disappeared because in the dense air pollution, you can no longer see them”."
"Citizens’ assemblies will decide what action should be taken on the climate crisis, the Treasury’s ability to stymie green measures will be neutralised and the Green Investment Bank will be revived under proposals set to be key planks of the Liberal Democrats’ general election bid. Along with sweeping reform of Whitehall, including bringing back a department of climate change, local government would be given new powers to cut emissions, there would be a moratorium on airport expansion and an end to fracking, and the UK would achieve net-zero carbon status by 2045 – five years sooner than the current government goal.  “Moving to net-zero is a complete game-changer,” Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem spokesperson for the environment and climate change, told the Guardian. “The whole of government and society need to understand the need to get to net-zero – everything we do needs to be seen in terms of that target.” Under the proposals to be presented to the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth this weekend, a new minister, who will attend cabinet, would be appointed chief secretary to the Treasury and oversee policy across departments to ensure it meets the zero-carbon pledge. “The biggest hurdle [to climate policies] was always the Treasury,” said Hobhouse. Soon after Theresa May unveiled her zero-carbon target this summer, her chancellor, Philip Hammond, claimed it would cost too much. “Having a chief secretary to keep reminding the chancellor of the need to get to net-zero is key,” said Hobhouse. To gain public support for urgent action on emissions, the Lib Dems would convene citizens’ assemblies across the country to debate new measures. These would include ways to ensure a massive expansion of electric vehicles and better public transport, and how to encourage new technology such as heating homes with hydrogen instead of gas. Councils would also be given greater powers over planning, for instance to promote electric vehicles, cycling and walking. “Citizens’ assemblies would not replace politicians’ decision-making, but would inform the options,” said Hobhouse. “We need decisive action – the government is not doing anything, they are dithering.” The Green Investment Bank, created under the coalition government, was sold off under George Osborne. Under a Lib Dem government, a replacement would be set up with public money, and have the powers to borrow money from the private sector. Hobhouse said Brexit was getting in the way of tackling the climate emergency: “Brexit means having less money, and it is very counterproductive. We need international cooperation – climate change is a global problem.” The Lib Dems would end the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2030 – 10 years sooner than the Conservatives – and stop fracking. There would also be more support for onshore wind and solar, which Hobhouse said the Conservatives had “stopped in their tracks” by drastically changing incentive schemes and planning laws. Green campaigning groups, keen that the climate crisis should not be overshadowed by Brexit as a general election looms, welcomed the Lib Dems’ focus. “Our country may be divided over Brexit, but it is not divided over the need for action on the nature and climate emergency – polling is consistently showing that concern over climate is at an all-time high and a large majority support urgent action,” said Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at WWF-UK.  “Now we need the climate and nature crisis prioritised at the highest level of government, and billions in new funding, to deliver on the rhetoric. We must stop things like airport expansion that make meeting net-zero even more difficult.” Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “With the government’s net-zero target currently lacking anywhere near enough policy to back it up, we’d like to see all parties thinking about what they’d do to make sure the target is actually reached. It’s no good talking about a net-zero future while pursuing a programme of roadbuilding, airport expansion and fracking.”"

Dr. Ulrich Keck called in on a German ARD public television talk show to express his views on the new lockdown that has just been imposed across Germany.

According to the German dentist (65), the lockdowns are causing more harm than the disease itself due to the added massive poverty they are causing globally.
He claims the “collateral damage” is being completely ignored.
“For example, 15,000 children die of hunger every day on the planet, now it’s 30,000 because the paths to supply them have been interrupted,” says Keck. He characterizes the German lockdown as completely unnecessary because the country has plenty of intensive care beds available. Keck then pleads for an end to the panic spreading.
At the end Keck concludes: “When you sacrifice freedom for security, you end up with neither.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterExtremist climatologists, with their wild global warming related doomsday predictions made earlier, are beginning to look more and more silly with every passing winter.
Remember when the once reputable CRU claimed that wintertime snow would be rare and exciting? Well, since that assertion was made, snows have been coming already at mid-autumn more frequently it seems, and winters have been increasingly harsher.
In fact Britain’s The Weather Outlook warned the UK is now being gripped by a bitter series of winters comparable with the harsh 1939-42 winters. Read more below.
Fall officially started only 3 weeks ago, and the official start of winter is still more than 9 weeks away. Yet, you wouldn’t know it looking at the latest weather forecasts throughout Europe which are calling for bitter cold and snow.
Germany’s online, English-written The Local reports snow forecast for the central and south Germany’s hilly regions for late this week:
On Thursday afternoon cloud cover will roll in, bringing rain to the north and the east – and possible snow in higher altitudes by Friday. Low-lying mountains in the Harz region, as well as the Fichtelgebirge in Bavaria and Saxony’s Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains, are all likely to see snow fly…
Great Britain’s online Telegraph reports today that snow is also in the forecast. We’re not talking about snowfall at the summits of tall mountains here, but down in the low hills. The Telegraph writes:
Winter will come early to Britain next week as snow is forecast for the north while the south will shiver in frosty sub-zero nights.
and:
Forecasters Positive Weather Solutions have already predicted a ‘white-out’ winter almost as harsh as last winter – with widespread snow, temperatures down to -4F (-20C) and transport chaos.

The Weather Outlook, which has an accurate seasonal forecasting record, warned the UK is now being gripped by a bitter series of winters comparable with the harsh 1939-42 winters which made conditions so horrendous during the Second World War.
This all flies in the face of the alarmist global warming forecasts made earlier. In 2008 the UK Telegraph reported that heat waves would become more common and kill more people.
…Britain was warned that climate change could lead to thousands of deaths during heatwaves and outbreaks of malaria.
A report said there was a “high risk” of a dangerously hot summer within five years that could kill 6,000 people. But these would be more than offset by milder winters leading to fewer deaths from the cold, currently 20,000 a year.
Germany’s Die Welt wrote just a few days ago that spring could start arriving already in late January in Germany by 2030, read here!
 
I’ll spare readers all the other loads of nonsense other major papers have written.
Perhaps journalists and AGW-believing climatologists will wake up some day and realise that climate is heavily driven by ocean cycles. For the first time in a long time, the PDO and the AMO are both entering in lockstep the cold phases of their respective 30-year and 60-year cycles. A low activity solar cycle on top of that could act to make it a triple whammy.
A number of scientists, yet a minority, have been warning of this leading to decades of harsh winters for some time now. But as science goes, the outsiders are usually right, and the “consensus” is often wrong. Indeed, science is about obliterating consensus.
And what does this coming winter look like for Europe and the world?
Winter and spring forecast 2010/11
Note the cold Arctic forecast for 2011. Might want to hold off planting them tulips early next spring – at least until after late January.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot only is flying ash over Europe causing air traffic disruptions, about 800 people have been forced to evacuate their homes around the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in southern Iceland because the flooding cut roads. A huge cloud of ash from the 2nd major eruption in less than a month blew eastwards and closed major airports more than 1700 km away in London. The volcano on the Eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted just after midnight on Wednesday.
The ash is about 8-10km in the air and cannot been seen from the ground. But experts say it’s a danger to jet engines and restricts visibility.

"One is a student engineer who became obsessed after watching an incendiary film about air pollution. The other is a 16-year-old who went on China’s first climate strike. Zhao Jiaxin and Howey Ou are part of a small but growing minority of young Chinese determined to press their country towards more radical carbon-cutting action. The pair are also China’s sole winners of carbon neutral “green tickets” the UN is providing to 100 young people around the world.  China is the world’s leading carbon emitter. It generates 60% of its electricity from coal-fired power and coal consumption and carbon emissions have risen for two years in a row after a plateau between 2014 and 2016. Emissions are expected to rise again in the figures for this year. Yet within the country, the positive half of the picture is more likely to be heard: how devoted the nation is to Xi Jinping’s goal of constructing an “ecological civilisation”, how China is a climate change leader compared with the US, and how much record-breaking renewable energy capacity it continues to install. Howey does not think this is enough. She conducted a public climate strike in front of government offices in Guilin in southern China for several days in late May – Greta Thunberg called her a “true hero” – before the authorities said she had to stop because she did not have a permit. The 16-year-old, who spends her spare time planting trees around her hometown, was nominated to travel to this week’s United Nations climate summit in New York by the youth activist group Earth Uprising and nearly had to back out of attending because her chaperone was worried she would not stick to the Chinese government script. “People in China don’t know the situation and think the Chinese government is doing a lot and is great,” she said. “The point is that people here can’t petition to protest and do something about the climate. Even if people want to change [things] they think activism in China will fail and the cost is too [high].” In a country where the party line controls the climate debate to the extent that a general apathy infuses the broader public, Howey and Zhao are the sudden, fresh young faces of environmental activism. There are some signs they are not alone. Young people and women living in cities are increasingly aware of global climate issues and China’s place at the centre of them, according to a recent study in the journal The China Quarterly. “In China, the good news is that compared to the population, younger Chinese tend to be more concerned about climate change,” said Liu Xinsheng, the lead author of the report from Texas A&M University. “The bad news is that overall, average Chinese climate change concern is low relative to many countries around the world.” Zhao’s passion for climate issues was triggered by the documentary Under the Dome, which he watched four years ago while studying engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The film inspired him to set up an NGO to raise awareness of the climate crisis on campus and create a platform disseminating information on the social media app WeChat. “I found something I could do for society,” Zhao said of his awakening after seeing the film. “In my last year [at university] I felt that if I did not communicate, did not advocate about what I thought was true, then powerful [other ideas] would dominate society.”  Under the Dome, an examination of the policy failures and personal effects of air pollution in China, appeared online for several days in February and was viewed by as many as 300 million people before being banned. It is unlikely there will be climate strikes in China on Friday like those being staged in the west. The country passed a law after the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 that imposed strict conditions on public gatherings and forced groups to register with the police if they want to stage a protest. Organisations connected to the government such as the China Youth Climate Action Network, founded in 2007, are one of the official routes young people can take to raise climate awareness. The group holds events and educational training to help raise awareness of climate issues among China’s young people. Zheng Xiaowen, CYCAN’s executive director, said: “I don’t think student protests are a helpful solution to the problem in China. Because of the unique cultural and political circumstances, Chinese people tend to resort to more moderate ways to voice their concerns. #FridaysForFuture I don’t have to stuck in the way of striking,I must do what I could do right now.If I keep‘preparing’,the time will lose.While the time is the most gracious thing to survive from climate crisis.Planted 6 trees in 13th,Sep.Starting #PlantforSurvive,This is WEEK1. pic.twitter.com/IFvFW0ypN8 “We need to advocate actions against climate change in ways that best suit China. For us, the best way is to work with the government and help come up with plans to tackle those issues together.” While small steps are being made, the lack of awareness of climate change in the country is alarming, Liu said, because China is the world’s leading greenhouse gas emitter and one of the countries that could be badly affected by extreme weather events and rising sea levels, with knock-on effects for the economy and health. “China has top-down policymaking,” Liu said. “It is hard to imagine without public awareness and concern for climate issues that the government policies will be successful.” No Chinese media outlets have signed up to a global pledge to increase coverage of the climate crisis in the week leading up to the UN summit on Friday, a pledge 250 media groups have agreed to including the Guardian and Bloomberg. The inertia bothers Howey, but she believes there is hope: “It is frustrating to me, but I’m still alive and have the passion for change.” Additional research contributions from Zhong Yunfan"
