Share this...FacebookTwitterYou’ll recall that WUWT reported here  a couple days ago on NASA’s warnings of “huge space storms” causing devastation in 2013 or so.  Well, one leading Russian scientist has something to say about it.The German edition of the online Russian RIA Novosti has a report today called: World Catastrophe in 2013? Russian Solar Scientist Is Sceptical. Astrophysicist Sergei Bogatchov told RIA Novosti yesterday:
Today there exists no scientific basis that allows the condition of the earth and the sun to be predicted over such a time period.
Mr. Bogatchov researches at the Laboratory for Solar X-Ray Astronomy at the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Scientists indeed expect a peak in solar activity in 2013, but nobody can say how strong it’s going to be.
Moreover RIA Novosti reports,
The current solar slumber extending to 2013 also cannot be excluded.
And adds background info for its readers:
In the past weeks the media quoted the Head of NASA’s Heliophysics Division, Richard Fisher, that unprecedented solar eruptions are to be expected. That could mean disruptions in satellites, shutdowns in navigation systems and power grids.
So there you have it. A leading Russian scientist is scratching his head wondering how NASA scientists could possibly come up with such a prognosis.
My guess is probably the same way they make their climate projections: Conjure up a catastrophe scenario, insist it withstands rigorous review, get the media and idiot politicians to believe it, and then get more funding!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Polarstern ice breaker of the government-funded Alfred Wegener Institute is now returning from a 7-month long expedition to the Antarctic, putting 37,000 nautical miles behind it. A total of 150 scientists from 15 countries have taken part in the Antarctic research expedition. here
Onboard in the ship’s cargo bays are 1000 meters of sediment cores, weighing 11 tonnes in total. These cores will now allow the researchers to extract climate information for the period from 400,000 to 4 million years ago.
There’s already considerable knowlege going back about 600,000 years.
But beyond that it starts to get awfully fuzzy. We do know that it has been trending colder over the last 5 million years.
The period from 400 thousand to 4 million years back is not well-researched, and so the sediment cores will certainly deliver key information on how the climate developed in leading up to the periodic ice ages, clues about ice behaviour, and ocean currents. Surely it’ll take some time to extract the data and digest them. We’re certainly looking forward to the first results.
Normally the AWI provides a translation of their press releases in English. I expect one will be out shortly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHaving received a request to cease and desist airing the famous self-made “Hide the Decline” G-rated YouTube political satire video, the Minnesotans For Global Warming have grown weak-kneed and decided to take down the video, which had been viewed more than half a million times on YouTube and was even featured on the Rush Limbaugh show (20 million listeners). But Michael Mann, the target of its satire, was not amused. And when the cat says meow, mice run.
Of course I’m not familiar with the details and legal fine points of the issue, but I have seen much worse go unchallenged. When George W. Bush was President, much worse videos were made. Barack Obama has to take the same treatment too – like all public figures.  Obviously the video had gotten under Mann’s thin skin. Mann, a professor at Penn State, creator of the phony, discredited hockey stick graph, a public employee as far as I know, has demanded that the M4GW stop practicing its right to free speech.
Personally I can’t believe the M4GW waved the white flag so quickly. I thought they had more guts than that. But I guess Beauregard’s French genes got the best of him. Now some goofball No Cap & Trade organisation will have to storm the beach and take the bullets.  M4GW have sent a disturbing message by cutting and running.
They ought to put the video back up and take Mann on like a man.
And what do I think of the NO Cap & Trade Hide the Decline II?  It’s crap. But I’m sure they’ll be enough dim bulbs out there who will accept it and think it’s cute.  Bring back the original!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe consensus was that global erosion of mountains and the Earth’s surface had been accelerating over the last 5 million years. Well, guess what? This once long accepted hypothesis has just been smashed by researchers at the GeoForschungsZentrum in Potsdam Germany. They present their results in the May 13 issue of Nature.  GFZ Potsdam (click English top right). They write:
The globally observed four-fold acceleration of sedimentation is an artifact of the observations. Important geological hypotheses that are based on this observation now require revision.
Artifact of observation? Gee, where can one see that today? Hansen, are you reading?
Erosion of rocks and the Earth’s surface over the last 5 million years could be found as sediment. Measurements of the sediment layers suggested that erosion had increased over the last 5 million years. The question was why? What caused the acceleration?
Hypotheses for the cause included the increased global growth of mountains by movement of tectonic plates which resulted in accelerated erosion, or the onset of the ice ages 3 million years ago – which accelerated erosion. But neither of these hypotheses was satisfactory. Another wrench in the the machine was CO2 –  it just didn’t pan out.
GFZ-scientists Jane Willenbring and Friedhelm von Blanckenburg appear to have solved the riddle.
They found that the increase in sedimentation rates is a so-called “artifact” of the observations: the more detail geologists observe, the more sediment they discover. In younger geologic time the observations get better than those made on sediment millions of years in age. This is so because not all sediment, once deposited, survives the passage of geologic time. The increase in sedimentation therefore is not real – it merely mirrors the better preservation of younger sediment.
Read the GFZ Potsdam report to see how they used isotope Beryllium-10 to solve the riddle.
Of course other scientists could claim that the consensus supports the old view, and that the GFZ researchers are just a couple of fringe scientists that can’t be taken seriously.

Share this...FacebookTwitterExtremist climatologists, with their wild global warming related doomsday predictions made earlier, are beginning to look more and more silly with every passing winter.
Remember when the once reputable CRU claimed that wintertime snow would be rare and exciting? Well, since that assertion was made, snows have been coming already at mid-autumn more frequently it seems, and winters have been increasingly harsher.
In fact Britain’s The Weather Outlook warned the UK is now being gripped by a bitter series of winters comparable with the harsh 1939-42 winters. Read more below.
Fall officially started only 3 weeks ago, and the official start of winter is still more than 9 weeks away. Yet, you wouldn’t know it looking at the latest weather forecasts throughout Europe which are calling for bitter cold and snow.
Germany’s online, English-written The Local reports snow forecast for the central and south Germany’s hilly regions for late this week:
On Thursday afternoon cloud cover will roll in, bringing rain to the north and the east – and possible snow in higher altitudes by Friday. Low-lying mountains in the Harz region, as well as the Fichtelgebirge in Bavaria and Saxony’s Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains, are all likely to see snow fly…
Great Britain’s online Telegraph reports today that snow is also in the forecast. We’re not talking about snowfall at the summits of tall mountains here, but down in the low hills. The Telegraph writes:
Winter will come early to Britain next week as snow is forecast for the north while the south will shiver in frosty sub-zero nights.
and:
Forecasters Positive Weather Solutions have already predicted a ‘white-out’ winter almost as harsh as last winter – with widespread snow, temperatures down to -4F (-20C) and transport chaos.

The Weather Outlook, which has an accurate seasonal forecasting record, warned the UK is now being gripped by a bitter series of winters comparable with the harsh 1939-42 winters which made conditions so horrendous during the Second World War.
This all flies in the face of the alarmist global warming forecasts made earlier. In 2008 the UK Telegraph reported that heat waves would become more common and kill more people.
…Britain was warned that climate change could lead to thousands of deaths during heatwaves and outbreaks of malaria.
A report said there was a “high risk” of a dangerously hot summer within five years that could kill 6,000 people. But these would be more than offset by milder winters leading to fewer deaths from the cold, currently 20,000 a year.
Germany’s Die Welt wrote just a few days ago that spring could start arriving already in late January in Germany by 2030, read here!
 
I’ll spare readers all the other loads of nonsense other major papers have written.
Perhaps journalists and AGW-believing climatologists will wake up some day and realise that climate is heavily driven by ocean cycles. For the first time in a long time, the PDO and the AMO are both entering in lockstep the cold phases of their respective 30-year and 60-year cycles. A low activity solar cycle on top of that could act to make it a triple whammy.
A number of scientists, yet a minority, have been warning of this leading to decades of harsh winters for some time now. But as science goes, the outsiders are usually right, and the “consensus” is often wrong. Indeed, science is about obliterating consensus.
And what does this coming winter look like for Europe and the world?
Winter and spring forecast 2010/11
Note the cold Arctic forecast for 2011. Might want to hold off planting them tulips early next spring – at least until after late January.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Max Planck Institute has an interesting article (in German) here When Man Engineers Climate concerning the international legal aspects of employing technical means to engineer climate change. Personally, I think there isn’t much man could do, unless all resources were focussed in doing so. But others think it’s possible and even feasible.Scientists are developing processes to counteract the alleged negative impacts of climate change. But employing these untested processes could very well lead to unexpected results instead. Do these technical processes – should they function at all – comply with international norms?
There are several techniques that may be used to influence climate on earth, or what some call climate engineering, or geo-engineering or climate therapy. But the impacts of climate engineering would be completely unpredictable, and could cause more harm than good for a region. Who would be liable for damages? Think of the technical legal complications in proving in an international court that a negative impact was caused, or could be caused.
There are basically two general technical methods to counter global warming:
1. Reducing solar radiation by using reflective aerosols.
2. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere.
No. 2 for example, uses iron fertilisation to promote the growth of algae. The algae then absorbs CO2, which would disappear at the seabed when the algae dies off.  The Alfred Wegener Institute even conducted a controversial experiment to see how well that would work: The Lohafex Experiment. The scientists dumped iron sulphate over 300 sq km in the South Pacific. But things did not go as hoped. The fertiliser did indeed promote the growth of algae, but swarms of small crabs descended and torpedoed the project with their large appetites. No extra CO2 was absorbed in the end.
No.1 can be achieved by cloud-making, which reflects sunlight back into space. This can be done through salt crystals or using sulfuric acid. Mt Pinatubo showed that this works as it spewed 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, which scientists say caused global temps to drop 0.5°C.
Engineering climate (doing climate-therapy) would likely lead to unpredictable consequences. According to legal researcher David Reichwein:
Nobody knows what consequences such experiments could have on the global climate and how these consequences would impact different regions in different ways.

google_ad_height = 200;

Reichwein adds:
A large-scale attempt to remove CO2 using iron sulphate to promote algae growth could have considerable negative impacts on ecological balance.
Climate therapy by using reflective aerosols could also lead to nasty side effects. For example a study based on a model conducted by Patricia Heckendorn of the Atmospheric and Climate Sciences Institute of the ETH Zurich showed that using sulfur aerosols in the stratosphere would likely lead to a considerable degradation of the ozone layer.
In Pinatubo’s aftermath, shifts in precipitation were observed. So a large-scale application by man could lead to devastating results, and thus would certainly be challenged legally.
The problem is that the impacts of climate therapy processes cannot be contained to a specific area. The threat of uncontrolled adverse impacts entail international law and human rights issues. Says Reichwein:
Geo Engineering up to now has yet to find a foothold in human rights treaties.
Employing geo-engineering processes will lead to the opening up of a whole new can of worms legally, let alone questions of technical feasibility.
In the meantime, hoards of companies, all with promises of delivering successful climate therapy, are lining up at the feeding troughs, which are filled by crooked politicians.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe dreamers of global warming calamity always have to find imaginative explanations for inconvenient truths and paradoxes. Today’s German papers are reporting on the recent study by Judith Curry and Jiping Liu, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology. The paper is an attempt to provide an explanation for the paradox of increasing Antarctic sea ice in a warming climate.You see, there’s a simple explanation for everything.
The latest explanation is a brainstormed hypothesis at most, and nothing more. Hypotheses are important in science of course, but they are only its very raw trial material. They are not fact.
Yet today, in climate science, we are expected to accept half knowledge and computer-generated scenarios as “finished” science. Folks, it’s a farce.

So just what is the Liu/Curry explanation? The German Sueddeutsche Zeitung here presents it as follows:
The ice in the south polar sea is still growing there because climate change means more precipitation, most of it as snow. This snow reflects part of the radiative warming back out into the atmosphere and thus prevents the ice from melting.
But if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase over the next decades as expected, then sea ice will eventually melt from underneath. In addition, precipitation will fall increasingly as rain, and not as snow. This means the radiative reflection will diminish and thus lead to acclerated ice melt at the surface from above.

Depending on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the decades ahead, the researchers calculate a shrinkage in Antarctic sea ice of 40,000 to 300,000 sq. km. per decade . The ice is expected to melt especially rapidly starting at the end of the 2060s.
40,000 to 300,000 sq km/decade? At the end of the 2060s? Really?
Recall this is all based on still really crappy climate models. It’s crystal ball science by fortune tellers. Don’t get me wrong. Science starts with wild hypotheses. But only in climate science do they seem to end there. Curry and Liu, your work is far from finished. You are a long way from being able to make such predictions with even minimal certainty. You get paid for that?
This is not the first time an attempt has been made to hastily explain, using dubious methods, why the Antarctic is not cooperating. Steig et al used dubious statistical acrobatics to produce a warming Antarctic graphic, i.e. it is cooperating! Read here.
The following NASA chart made before all this Orwellian history rewriting shows some parts of Antarctica indeed have warmed over the last decades, but most of the continent has cooled.
he Antarctic continet has cooled, not warmed.
Source: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=6502
And as long as it cools, the ice will expand, reflect more radiation out into space and…well, I’ll let the readers apply their own Curry-like hypotheses from there.

Share this...FacebookTwitterStarting tomorrow another Corona lockdown goes into effect in Germany
By A.R. Göhring
(Text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
The government factions and the Greens decided on a significant increase in CO2 price – from 10 euros per ton up to 25 euros. Not only heating and filling the gas tank will become even more expensive from January 2021, but other sources of energy as well.
In the “climate package” of Autumn 2019, a price of 10 euros per ton of emitted CO2 was agreed upon, but this was criticized by the German Greens and their affiliated Fridays for Future organizations and numerous editorial offices because a curbing effect would not result from the low price.
In plain language, it probably means that not enough money is coming in to pay the profiteers, and therefore the many green lobbyists put pressure to raise the carbon price significantly. And with success: the German Parliament decided to more than double the price to 25 euros per ton.
And since the lockdown has already ripped huge holes in the wallets of many employees and self-employed persons since March, the rising prices of consumer products across the board will put German citizens economically under even more pressure.
Although taxpayers saw some relief from the lowered  value added tax to 16%, it is of no use: the reduction expires already on New Year’s Eve.
But, the additional additional revenue from CO2 taxes is also aimed at reducing the burden on citizens, for example the EEG feed-in levy to promote green electricity will be lowered and the commuters will be given tax breaks. But this does not benefit producers, which is why the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce has demanded subsidies. Not without reason: Otherwise, our companies could migrate to nearby foreign countries where no fanatic climate activists are at work.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe last two years of minimal solar activity did not prevent the earth from warming, and thus shows that the theory that the recent abnormally low solar activity could lead to a little ice age is false, so writes German FOCUS magazine.
Online FOCUS magazine  here reports on how solar activity has awoken, and thus the prospects of a new little ice age befalling the planet are now excluded.According to FOCUS, the sun has been showing some “hefty” activity over the last weeks. The series of violent eruptions had started already back in early spring, and increased in frequency over the summer.
FOCUS here is hyping the current solar activity, making it sound like the sun is really firing up. Solar Cycle 24 indeed has started, but is still sputtering badly, see the following graphic:


Not only is solar cycle 24 way behind schedule, and that scientists have had to postpone its projected start a number of times, solar cycle 24 is still well behind even the latest updated projection, and it may have a hard time reaching 75 sunspots when it peaks. Yet, FOCUS writes:
The sun is proving, in the most impressive way, that its period of minimum activity is now over and is now powering ahead toward its maximum of its new cycle, which will be in 2013.
And:
The increasing activity not only settles the dispute of a new little ice age for good, But in interaction with the El Niño, which dominated in the Pacific until summer, it could also make 2010 the warmest year since records have been kept.
So FOCUS is claiming that the recent low solar activity couldn’t stop the hot 2010.  And because solar cycle  24 is is getting active, FOCUS now sees nothing getting in the way of more warming. Rising temperatures despite 2 years of little solar activity proves the sun is not the driver. Worries of a little  ice age were for nothing. So get back to worrying about global warming!

FOCUS makes this earth-shattering conclusion based on just a couple of years of observation. This kind of junk science is not unusual in the German media.
In the report FOCUS emphasizes how some scientists were concerned about the possibility of a new little ice age beginning, like during the Maunder and Dalton minimums. FOCUS writes:
Due to the recent reduced radiation by the sun, cooling of the planet was expected. Some scientists even prophesied a little ice age.
FOCUS explains how some solar scientists believe  solar activity effected global temperature in the past.
The cause of the devastating cold periods was the sun. During the entire Little Ice Age, it showed only very minimal activity, which was evidenced by the very small number of sunspots. In one 30-year phase of the Maunder-Minimum, only 50 spots showed up  – normal would be thousands.
FOCUS then dismisses the theory applies today, saying  the theory of the recent solar minimum causing cool temperatures has failed:
Some climate sceptics even announced a cooling of about 0,2°C, but that was a false conclusion, as 2009 was the 5th warmest year since temperature recording began. The months of January to July, 2010 were the warmest such period ever – even though the sun was still close to its low period of activity.
So even with 2 or three years of low solar activity, it still got hot, and so the theory is dead, FOCUS  tells its readers. FOCUS avoids mentioning the impact of the 2009/2010 El Nino. Finally, FOCUS concludes:
Nobody has to worry about another little ice age occurring. Even if the sun were to go into a protracted minimum, the rise in temperatutres brought on by GHG would compensate for it.
I wonder what FOCUS will write if Joe Bastardi’s forecast for the next few years pans out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI) WHO ARE THE SCEPTICS IN GERMANY?
The real “troublemakers” in Germany are:
1. Professor Hans von Storch of the GKSS (warmist, but scientific and welcomes debate).
2. Prof. Josef H. Reichholf of the Technical Univ. of Munich.
3. Hans H.J. Labohm (Dutch), journalist.
4. Prof. Augusto Mangini, U. of Heidelberg (maybe not a sceptic, but critical of AGW science).
5. Dirk Maxeiner, journalist German blog.
6. Matthias Storx, journalist.
7. European Institute for Climate and Energy EIKE blog.
8. Readers Edition blog.
9. Klimanews blog.
9. Die Welt newspaper, which sometimes publishes sceptical pieces.
10. Der Spiegel magazine, which sometimes publishes sceptical pieces.
11. Petition of 77 sceptical German scientists.
(And maybe some day this here blog may make it to the top 100!)II) WHO ARE THE ALARMISTS?
1. Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research PIK. Government funded.
2. PIK Director Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber – visionary of the Great Transformation (a dangerous social engineering experiment). He’s the no. 1 climate advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel (yikes!). Has tried to shut down debate read here.
3. Prof. Stefan Rahmstorf, gatekeeper, attack-dog. Notorious for efforts to stifle dissent and to marginalize sceptics. Calls sceptical media reports irresponsible and disinformation.
Famous for publishing alarmist scenarios just before climate conferences.
4. German media, almost unanimously. Perfect example here and here.
5. Munich Re Reinsurer, purveyor of catastrophic scenarios.
6. The German school system, which repeatedly shows AIT to children uncritically.
7. A host of well-funded environmentalist groups like BUND, NABU, WWF, Greenpeace, Germanwatch, etc.
8. An array of companies set to make tons of money in trading CO2 certificates.
9. A vast majority of politicians, conservatives and environmentalists alike.
III) HOW IS AGW VIEWED HERE?
Germany is a country that has a powerful green movement. Environmentalism has become a religion for many. Probably has something to do with atonement for past sins. Environmentalism is pounded daily into the German psyche by the public-funded media, the state school system and other institutions. What you as a person does to “protect the climate” is a measure of how good you are. It’s like Karma. (So, I’m quite the naughty boy here).
IV) ARE ATTITUDES CHANGING HERE?
Yes!  Thanks to the little but vital  information the media allowed to drip out about Climategate, the recent bitter winter and a small group of concerned but very active citizens, there’s been much success in educating the public. Recent polls have alarmed the massive Green Establishment. They’re in panic. The sceptics have the momentum. Indeed the dreaded “tipping point” may have been reached. Just a couple of years ago, the media promoted the notion of universal consensus, and Mann’s depiction of the last 1000 years as fact. Today they can no longer maintain that.
V) GERMANY’S POLITCAL PARTIES – HOW GREEN?
There are five significant parties in Germany.
1. CDU/CSU – center right. Equivalent to the US RINOS. Led by a centrist Angela Merkel. They like cap & trade and believe in AGW. Favour use of nuclear energy.
2. SPD – socialists. Equivalent to the US Democrats.
They love cap & trade, regulation and are in love with Barack Obama and the US Democrats. Against nuclear power. Led by Sigmar Gabriel – Fan No. 1 of Al Gore. He distributed 6000 copies of AIT to advanced secondary schools for indoctrinating university-bound children.
3. The Greens. Made up of enviro-zealots, treehuggers and elitists. Vehemently against nuclear power.
4. FDP – Free Democrats – libertarian. Supporters of free markets, nuclear energy. But pay much lip service to green alternative energy, but not real big supporters.
5. Die Linke – The communists.
They like anything that gives the state absolute power. Ought to be viewed as a threat to democracy.
Currently a coalition of the CDU/CSU and FDP are in power. But they are weakening. Elections may have to be called.
VI) WHAT IF ELECTIONS WERE HELD TODAY (June 20, 2010)?
– CDU conservatives- 33%
– SPD socialists – 32%
– Green treehuggers – 15%
– Die Linke communists – 11%
– FDP libertarians – 6%
That means there’d possibly be a Socialist/Green/Communist government, and thus a huge push by Germany for a global climate treaty. So, although there’s been much progress, there’s still much to do in Germany when it comes to educating the public.
Note: I’m sure I’ve forgotten some names and other information. Your tips would be welcome.

In yet another “we’re all threatened by climate change” piece, the German online FOCUS magazine presents here a piece on the desertification of the earth, of course all worsened by climate change. FOCUS quotes a source:
Almost 33.3% of the earth’s surface is threatened by so-called desertification.
Right off the bat I have trouble with that statement because we know that only 29% of the earth is land. Does that mean 4% of the Earth’s water surface is about to dry up?
FOCUS reports that poor nations of Africa are the most threatened by the spread of desertification. But looking at the Sahara, there’s scientific literature that shows the opposite is happening. For example a 2009 National Geographic report relies on scientific literature and says:
Emerging evidence is painting a very different scenario, one in which rising temperatures could benefit millions of Africans in the driest parts of the continent.
Scientists are now seeing signals that the Sahara desert and surrounding regions are greening due to increasing rainfall.

and
Images taken between 1982 and 2002 revealed extensive regreening throughout the Sahel, according to a new study in the journal Biogeosciences.
Sounds like good news to me. So why does FOCUS peddle something that’s so misleading? Well, just take a look at its source of information: Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit, in English: German Society For Technical Cooperation. It’s a private company owned by the German government, that promotes sustainanble development and…well, you get the picture.  Perhaps FOCUS should rely more on scientific literature in the future.
Finally, and interestingly, National Geographic also attempts to project future trends for the Sahara, but finds it’s a very difficult and complicated task.  It quotes Martin Claussen of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, who says:
Half the models follow a wetter trend, and half a drier trend.
And so much for the climate models!

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen the temperature sinks far below normal and people freeze to death, you hardly hear a peep from the media anymore.But as soon as the temperature rises a few degrees over normal for a day or more, the media explodes with headlines of “HEAT WAVE!” and “SCORCHING HEAT!”.
Thanks to the internet and a few media outlets, few and far in between, the inconvenient news of a devastating, protracted cold snap gripping much of south America is coming out. Read news24.com/World/News.
Here are some grisly statistics:
1. 175 dead in 6 countries
2. 112 people had died of hypothermia and flu in Peru.
3. 16 people froze to death and 11 died of carbon monoxide poisoning due to faulty heaters.
4. Thousands of cattle also froze to death on their pastures in Paraguay and Brazil.
5. In Bolivia, 18 people died, in Paraguay five and two each in Chile and Uruguay. Nine people died of the cold in southern Brazil.
How cold is it? Take a look at this post I put up three days ago. return-to-1970s-cold/, showing the 7 day outlook.
You’d think when they’re not too busy covering Zsa Zsa Gabor, the media would cover this.
In Germany, it seems the major news magazines are finding space and time to report the cold – along with the reports of the warm weather we’re having here, which will end in about 36 hours.
But Germany’s ARD Teklevsion has NOTHING. Same goes for ZDF television. Hmmm.
I couldn’t find much at the major US news services either. CBS – nothing. At CNN there’s a report that’s a day old with 17 deaths. Nothing at the right wing Fox either. Maybe others are better at finding big news.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Arctic had a steep last spurt of melt over the last week, sending the ice area below 5 million sq. km. That puts 2010 as the third lowest ice extent, or the 2nd highest in the last four years, spin it the way you want.

But the melt is now pretty much over, and temperatures in the Arctic have started their plunge. The Danish Meteorological Institute’s latest graphic clearly shows.


The Arctic forecast for the next 14 days shows things are going to get cold fast, with frost spreading south into Canada.
Source: http://wxmaps.org/pix/temp2.html
Colder than normal Arctic is in the forecast for the coming winter
But this happens every year of course. Unless winds play some tricks, the sea ice area is not going to get less. The volume reduction is over. So what can we expect for the coming winter? Joe Bastardi for example predicted we would finish at about where we finished this years, but then predicted a recovery over the next couple of years. We’re entering a cold PDO, and the NOAA forecast for the coming winter indicates a colder than normal Arctic.
NOAA NWS Chart 
Remember, NOAA and GISS are used to painting the Arctic red, and not blue. So, if the foreacst pans out, both poles will be colder than normal. That means thicker and more extensive ice. That’s why I made the WAG prediction a couple weeks ago of 5.75 million sq km for September, 2011. Maybe it’s a bit on the high side, but more likely than the once almost certain death spiral made by the experts a couple of years ago.

Share this...FacebookTwitter      Install solar panels, and save the planet! Well, not so fast. Solar cells are high-tech electronic products that contain hazardous materials. Mother Jones took a look at the solar industry, and what they found isn’t pretty. It cites a survey conducted by the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) with 25 solar cell companies, and this is what was found: http://motherjones.com/blue-marble/2010/03/are-your-solar-panels-toxic

 – Only 14 companies responded to the survey.
 – Six companies reported their products contain lead.
 – Three companies said their products contain cadmium, a known carcinogen.
 – One company uses nitrogen triflouride, a potent greenhouse gas 17,000 times more powerful than CO2.

       This is only on the production side, and does not look at how production is done in China, for example, where many cells are produced cheaply and with practically no environmental standards.
      Then there are the environmental hazards of disposing of used solar cells.
      Keep in mind that many are being replaced long before their 20 year lifetime is reached because the new ones are more efficient. California and Europe have exempted solar manufacturers from strict recycling laws. Solar panel manufacturers are barricading against any regulation that would require them to deal with the waste they produce. Indeed only eight companies said they would support “extended producer responsibility” laws that would require them to take back and recycle their waste.
So just how much waste is expected to be produced?
In the coming years, SVTC estimates that 1.5 billion pounds of solar panel waste containing 2 million pounds of lead and 600,000 pounds of cadmium will be disposed of in California alone. 
Now just throw in all those mercury-filled light bulbs, and you get your Green Revolution (For the toxic material industry, that is).

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve been following Joe’s forecasts here in Europe for about 2 years. At first I thought he was just another weatherman and didn’t put too much stock in what he said. Then I noticed his 3 to 6-month general forecasts were pretty darn accurate.
Back in 2008 he predicted a cold winter for Europe – and it panned out. Last fall 2009 he predicted a harsh winter for central Europe, and Germany got its worst winter in 46 years. Late last winter he predicted a hot summer – and bam! Hello hot summer.
Meanwhile, the Met Office, equipped with its monster-size, mega-million dollar super-computers, was not even able to do better than flipping a penny.
They’ve since given up issuing seasonal forecasts, yet still insist their 50 and 100-year forecasts will be correct because of the dubious “undisputed CO2-temperature correlation”. (If that’s so, why waste your money on a super-computer?)
Here’s the latest Joe Bastardi clip: Monday Morning Sea Ice Report,  which I’m sure you’ll enjoy. Tune in everyday. You’ll love his anecdotes and easy going attitude. I’ve added a direct link to Joe, along with my leading climatic indicators at my homepage. Check ’em out!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is in response to some good questions/points by reader Actually Thoughtful in my previous post.
Indeed environmental restrictions have made a contribution in cleaning up the environment. But technology, awareness and the overall continued path of progress have also made major contributions. And keep in mind that placing stifling regulation on industries at home often prompts them to move to countries where they are allowed to produce more pollution, and more cheaply. So the net result is MORE pollution, not less, and lost jobs. I guess we could impose rigid environemntal regulations on poor coutries like China, India, Mexico etc., but if you’re honest you have to agree that they just aren’t that far yet.
This reminds me a little of the bio-fuels debacle. Sure biofuels are renewable and can cut fossil fuel CO2, but we have seen the far greater unintended catastrophic consequence on food prices and accelerated deforestation. This is one example of the importance of thinking things through first.  Sending the masses and policy makers into an uncontrolled, panicked stampede won’t work. Best is to explain it over time, and step by step we’ll get there in an orderly way. Hard working people are capable of understanding.
On feeding the hungry, huge progress has been made thanks to great strides in agricultural technology, expansion of free market principles throughout the globe, improved transportation and logistics, refrigeration and information management. Adam’s Smith’s invisible hand has played a huge role. Indeed the environment does best in developed, free-market oriented countries.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMaybe tough talk has to do with surviving the coming midterm elections in the USA. When I watched the video posted here at the Guardian, I thought at first for sure Gov. Joe Manchin was some sort hard-right republican.
But no, he”s a West Virginian Democrat running for the Senate and now he’s acting like he means business. Of course it’s understandable that a Democrat from West Virginia would want to protect the economic interests of his own state, especially before an election.

The above clip is pretty emphatic – best anti-Cap & Tax clip I’ve seen in a long time. I admit I even felt myself bonding with Joe’s message. Susanne Goldenberg of the Guardian, however, is a little less enthusiastic about the ad, and writes:
A number of Democrats trying to hang on to their careers in these congressional elections are distancing themselves from Barack Obama, but only one, so far, is suggesting he would take a gun to the president’s energy policies.
Oooh, I do like that suggestion.
But I wonder if Manchin is just shootin blanks. And if not, can he shoot straight? Notice how the ad doesn’t show him hitting anything. That hole in the paper was probably put there by Sarah Palin, who I think can shoot a hell of a lot straighter than Manchin.
Many Democrats have a habit of talkin real tough when the GOP has the momentum, but then turn mushy later on (after the election). Right now Manchin is saying:
I sued the EPA and I’ll take dead aim at the cap and trade.
Well Joe, you got my vote – if you keep that promise. In Indiana Congressman Joe Donnelly is also in a tough race, and he’s running TV ads calling climate change legislation “Nancy Pelosi’s energy tax”. Howabout just taking dead aim at the Cap&Trade bill too, Mr Donnelly? And don’t forget to pull the trigger.
The question is: Can we rely on these possible phonies to follow through on their promises? Talk is cheap and thousands of jobs are on the line. Check their records to be sure how they really vote.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe April 21, 2010 German edition of the Russian news website RIA Novosti has a piece with a possible explanantion as to why Antarctic sea ice is expanding while the rest of the globe is warming. http://de.rian.ru/science/20100421/126005955.html
A Russian scientist believes it is due to the ozone hole over the South Pole. According to Alexander Klepikov of the Research Instritute for Arctic and Antarctic at the Conference Maritime Research of Polar Regions of the Earth in the International Polar Year:
Over the last 3o years of satellite measurement, the growth of the ice amount in the Southern Ocean which surrounds Antarctica was more than 4 percent.
Klepikov emphasised that sea ice growth around the Antarctic coast was irregular and occurred at different areas. There was an especially large amount of sea ice growth in the Ross Sea located in the western part of the Pacific sector. Klepikov says British researchers, using mathematical models and analysis of meteorological data, could attribute the increasing sea ice trend to the so-called ozone anomaly in the South Pole region.
Reduced ozone concentrations over the South Pole leads to cooling of the upper atmosphere, and eventually leads to a strengthening of the circumpolar circular flow – winds that blow along the Antarctic coast and protect the Antarctic zone against the effects of warmer air. The same mechanism has the opposite effect on the Larsen Ice Shelf, causing increased melting.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman professor, co-founder of modern environmental movement, says climate science is exaggerated, filled with fairy tales and believes the Paris Accord is “already dead”. 
In an interview with publicist Roland Tichy, Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt – one of the founders of Germany’s modern environmental movement – said we have in fact three generations time to revamp the world’s energy supply system to one that is cleaner and sustainable.
He rejects the Fridays For Future claim that there are only 12 years left.

Climate catastrophe not taking place
In the interview, moderator Tichy reminded that civilization began 7000 years ago, a time when it was “3°C warmer than today”, and Vahrenholt responded saying he expects civilization to continue for another seven thousand years. There was no tipping point back then, why would there be one today? “Warmth and moisture have always been good for mankind,” said Vahrenholt. “Cold has been man’s worst enemy.”
Plenty of time to move rationally
The German professor also said that the claimed catastrophe “is not taking place” and that policymakers are trying to use “panic and fear to get the people to act.”  Much of the warming measured since 1850 is the result of natural warming taking place due to the end of the Little Ice Age, he explained.
Germany’s green fantasy

Later the German professor of chemistry calls the belief that wind and sun are able replace fossil fuels “fantasizing” and that Germany, with its 2.3% share of global CO2 emissions, can rescue the global climate “a fairy tale”.
Meanwhile, the warming of the last 150 years is in large part caused by natural cycles. “In the 20th century the sun was more active than at any time over the past 2000 years.”
Economically, Vahrenholt believes that a frenzied rush to renewables will lead to “horrible” economic consequences from European industrialization.
On the topic of a scientific consensus, the German professor says this is a claim made by the IPCC, which run by the UN with an agenda behind it.
Electric cars a “crackpot idea”
Vahrenholt also believes electric cars powered by batteries is not a feasible technology, and that other experts quietly call it “a crackpot idea”, and don’t speak up for fear of losing research funding. The vast majority of funding comes from the German government.
“Paris Accord already dead”
The professor of chemistry, co-author of a recent bestseller, also describes Germany as a country in denial when it comes to the broader global debate taking place on climate science, and declared the Paris Accord as being “already dead”.
“The Accord is already dead. Putin says it’s nonsense. […] The Americans are out. The Chinese don’t have to do anything. It’s all concentrated on a handful of European countries. The European Commission in massively on it. And I predict that they will reach the targets only if they destroy the European industries,” said Vahrenholt.
He characterizes Europe’s recent push for even stricter emissions reduction targets to madness akin to Soviet central planning that is doomed to fail spectacularly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Klimazwiebel blog run by Prof. Hans von Storch brings our attention to a newly released Dutch report on the IPCC. The report is published by the Rathenau Institute and is titled:
Room for Climate Debate:
Perspectives on the interaction between climate politics, science and
the media,
It is written by Jeroen van der Sluijs, Rinie van Est and Monique Riphagen. It’s lengthy, but the abstract sums it up. You can read the abstract in full at von Storch’s site.

The Rathenau report looks at the interaction of science and politics. It concludes that politics has come to rely on science to tell it what to do. More science means more knowledge, and thus less uncertainty. The problem, however, is that this approach leaves little space for debate. As a result, the political debate moves to science, which in turn leads to politicised science.
The authors recommend more dissent be allowed in the process, which will certainly not be welcome by those who have hijacked the scientific process for the purpose of achieving political aims.
In the abstract the authors write:
To depoliticise science and offer more room for the political debate, more space should be given to dissent opinions, sceptic as well as alarmistic. More openness about uncertainties in scientific knowledge and more room for these dissent scientific views in the IPCC reports would restore the political debate and enhance societies’ capacity to deal with this uncertainty.
Keep in mind that the InterAcademy Council will publish its evaluation of the IPCC this month.  Climate science has come under heavy fire since Climategate and the discovery of mistakes, gaffes and alarmist exaggerations in the last IPCC report.
The IPCC process is broken, and needs to be overhauled. Will the InterAcademy Counciltake the Rathenau Institute’s advice and allow dissent, or will it be just another corrupt whitewash?
Both, politics and science can work only if they are open to dissenting view and opinions. Anything else is authoritarian.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI couldn’t help but to relish the story that follows.
The German European Institute For Climate and Environment (EIKE) brings our attention to a report by the publicly funded NDR German television news show Panorama concerning the state of climate science and politics today in Germany. If you’re a climate activist, things just couldn’t be worse.

NDR Panorama report on Germany”s mood with regards to climate change (in German).
In summary the topic of climate change in Germany has gone far beyond its shelf-life. It is used up and no longer draws a bit of interest from the public. As the clip shows, the German public has grown tired of the constant barrage of climate alarmism, and is now über-bored by it. Editors have since taken climate news off the front pages. The public doesn’t want to hear it anymore, editors fret.
At 0:36 of the clip, normal citizens are asked about climate change. The reaction:  they couldn’t care less about it. Indeed some even say warmer is better. Climate change? No worries at all!

The depth of public apathy has left climate activists and experts like Professor doom & gloom Hans Joachim Schellnhuber frustrated, depressed and resigned. Schellnhuber at the 1:39 mark:
Just a few years ago it was so that when a meteorological extreme occurred, the phones would be ringing off the hook. Today hardly anyone calls; climate change has quasi become taboo.

Nobody wants to talk about it. And after the disaster that was Copenhagen, neither do the political leaders. In Schellnhuber’s view, the optimism in achieving a climate treaty is gone. That was clearly visible at the recent UN Climate Conference in Bonn. Says Karsten Sach, leader of the German negotiating delegation:
Everyone knows we’ve reached a dead-end.
The media has lost interest in reporting on the constant failure by policymakers. At the 3.56 mark, accompanied by gloomy music, a chart shows how the number of reports on climate change appearing in three major centre-left newspapers has dwindled. The hype is over. The public is fatigued, fed up, and disinterested.
Editor Dagmar Dehmer of Berlin’s Der Tagesspiegel says somberly:
Editors know the topic is important, but it’s not topic no. 1 at the moment. Climate is no longer on the front pages, and is not viewed as an earth-moving topic.
The video clip then moves to a car-tuning meet, where one auto-tuning enthusiast says:
Nobody cares about it.
And what about Chancellor Angela Merkel? Climate change has become a thorn in her side. She associates the issue with failure and hopelessness. Says Tagesspiegel editor Dagmar Dehmer at the 5:38 mark:
Climate change has become a loser topic. And Angela Merkel wants nothing to do with it.
Yet, Merkel’s minister of environment insists that climate change is an important topic for the future.
For the future, yes.  But not for today. The report ends with relaxed vacationers chuckling when asked by the journalists about the threats of climate change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver at Sweden’s sceptic The Climate Scam, Jonny Fagerström writes how pro-wind-park organisation Swedish Wind Energy is lobbying to abolish the municipal veto in order to bypass public refusal of windparks. The public, whose landscape would be ruined, should not be allowed to have a say on whether or not a wind-park is to be installed in their area, read here: Wind Power Industry Threatens Democracy
Wind-park builders and operators find it a nuisance that pesky, stubborn residents refuse to have their local landscape industrialised and property values ruined. For the wind industry, permitting is proceeding much too slowly, and populations should just accept having the windmills forced down their throats, without any further ado.
Jonny writes the threat to strip citizens of their last democratic chance to have a say on their surroundings and life in general will seriously aggravate people, and thinks that politicians simply will not take this proposed abolishment of municipal democracy seriously, but adds:
You never know.
The wind industry has deep poskets, and politicians can be bought easily enough.
In Germany, according to the online Lübecker Nachricten, Citizens near the German port city of Lübeck are protesting a proposed wind-pack on an area of 750 acres that would be home to 14 turbines, each 170 meters tall. Read and see photo here.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe forcing uncertainties and lack of observational measurements in the top-to-bottom global ocean preclude an assessment that modern warmth is due to anthropogenic activities.
Key points from a new paper (Gebbie, 2021):
• 93% of the changes to the Earth’s energy budget, manifested as warming of the Earth system, are expressed in the global ocean. Just 1% of global warming is atmospheric.
• Even with the advent of “quasi-global” temperature sampling of the ocean since 2005 (ARGO), these floats “do not measure below 2,000-m depth.” This means that temperature changes in “approximately half the ocean’s volume” are still not being measured today.
• To detect the effects of anthropogenic forcing, it would require energy budget imbalance measurement precision of 0.1 W/m² at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). Uncertainty in the forcing changes affecting climate are ±4 W/m², meaning that uncertainty is about 80 times greater than an anthropogenic signal detection.
• Past changes in global ocean heat content, such as the last deglaciation, have been 20 times larger than modern changes.
• Ocean heat storage during the Medieval Warm Period (Medieval Climate Anomaly, or MCA) was much greater than modern. Modern global ocean heat uptake is “just one-third” of what is required to reach the levels attained during Medieval times.

One final point. Dr. Gebbie asserts that approximately 15% of modern global warming (ocean) can be attributed to geothermal heat fluxes through the sea floor that “persistently heat the ocean.” Interestingly, he also assesses that the value attained for geothermal heating of the ocean, 87 mW/m², is similar to that which is required to end a glacial period (melt ice sheets) and transition into an interglacial.

Images Source: Gebbie, 2021
Considering the ocean bottom waters warmed up 2°C from 19,000 to 17,000 years ago about 1,000 years before the surface warmed (and CO2 began rising) (Stott et al., 2007), and that Arctic bottom waters were 6-10°C warmer than today at the beginning of the Holocene about 10,000 years ago (Beierlein et al., 2015), geothermal heat fluxes could potentially explain a large portion of glacial-interglacial transitions – as well as millennial-scale global ocean temperature changes.

Watching some World Cup soccer, now taking place in South Africa, I’ve noticed fans have been attending the games wearing some pretty serious winter gear. Indeed it’s been awfully cold in South Africa. According to South African News24: 
Winter has struck with a vengeance in the Western Cape with some towns recording their first snowfalls in almost 20 years. 
The unusually wintry weather is causing traffic havoc too. 
The cold has also taken a heavy toll on penguins, killing 500 at Algoa Bay in the Eastern Cape, SA National Parks (SanParks). 
According to SanParks spokesperson Megan Taplin: 
 The chicks, aged between a few weeks and two months, are covered only with down feathers. They succumbed to the cold and wet weather that has hit Bird Island. 
Well, at least penguins would have nothing against a little warming.

It’s the latest for teaching German kids the end of the world is coming, unless…!

It’s the year 2500 and what’s left of mankind is on the verge of absolute extinction. Climate change has taken its toll. The planet in no longer hospitable. The few people left live in caves and tunnels. What’s left of the protective ozone layer is about to get wiped out by a solar storm.
It’s the climate meltdown, and we’re right in the middle of it!
Their time is running out, as shown at the 0:54 mark, where a sort of Mann’s hockey stick is used to illustrate this. Something has to be done!
So a group of courageous heroes find a rickety time machine and decide to risk it all to try and go back in time in an attempt to avert the man-made climate catastrophe. Only hero Fay makes it through the time machine and lands in the year 2050.

There she tries to convince the people of what they are doing to the planet – but damn those sceptics and deniers.
San Francisco under water? Tornadoes in Europe?
Finally, Fay end up meeting cranky climate scientist Bent Svensson and begs him to continue his research on his clean fuel, which he has abandoned because his wife died. Can Fay convince Dr Svensson and save the planet?
Now only you can rescue the planet!
This computer game is sure to provide kids with hours of entertainment and education on living responsibly.
Actually, I’m a bit surprised that the end of the world has once again been pushed back 490 years. Al Gore said it would come in 10 years and Prince Charles said 2 years. Now it keeps getting postponed and we have to wait half a millenium.
If Fay had been clever she would have gone back to at least  2000 and disposed of the “deniers” and the HadCrut hacker (if only we knew who he or she was). 2050 seems awfully late. I’d would interpret that as having at least 40 more years to think about the problem. What’s the rush?

The letter, drafted in 2009 by EIKE, continues today to gather signatures from scientists in Germany. Here is the German Letter with signatures, and here’s the English translation.
The open letter states:
…humans have had no measurable effect on global warming through CO2 emissions

More importantly, there’s a growing body of evidence showing anthropogenic CO2 plays little measurable role. Indeed CO2’s capability to absorb radiation is almost exhausted at today’s atmospheric concentrations. If CO2 did in fact have an effect and all fossil fuels were burned, then additional warming over the long-term would remain limited to only a few tenths of a degree.
The letter is also signed by more than 300 concerned citizens, many with doctorate, engineering and other professional titles.
Recently the online Franfurter Rundschau published some comments made by German über-alarmist Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and an advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel, implying that sceptics were hiding in anonymity and that scepticism was anti-scientific, saying:
Most of them [sceptics] operate from the safety of anonymity in the internet. They don’t try at all to do it successfully through a factual debate; rather they attempt to sow scepticism on science being an instrument to explain reality.
Perhaps the open letter will convince Herr Prof Dr Schellnhuber that the sceptics are not as anonymous as he would like to believe. Furthermore when it comes to debate, Schellnhuber employs the same tactic as Al Gore – running and hiding. Still, he is surely welcome to debate the issue at the  ICCC now taking place in Chicago. But don’t expect him to show up. He’s too busy scrambling to keep his science alive in Germany.

‘This novel fungus is worrisome because it appears to be a threat to otherwise healthy people,’ said Edmond Byrnes of Duke University in North Carolina, who led the study.
When I was reading this, I thought it’s just a question of time, maybe a few days, before someone claims it’s all because of climate change. Well I didn’t have to wait long. The last sentence of the report:
Freezing can kill the fungus and climate change may be helping it spread, the researchers said.
So there it is. Everytime something potentially threatening appears, the first suspect is automatically climate change. It’s gotten that bad.

Share this...FacebookTwitter12°F warming and 20 ft sea level rises over the next 100 years?  Yawn – how boring. That doesn’t scare anyone anymore. Boring, boring, boring.We need shock and awe. It’s time to get drastic and bury the needle, time to roll out the mothers of scare stories.
For the warmists it’s Hail Mary time.  The “”unless-we-announce-disasters, nobody-will-listen” gig has to be taken to a whole new unheard-of level. The populace is simply much denser than ever imagined. They just aren’t getting it. It’s not sinking in.
It’s time to bring in the super special effects. So leave it up to the German Die Welt online to do that. The normally respectable Die Welt online reports here on scientists studying the planet Venus and coming to the conclusion that Earth may end up like her hellish little sister planet, with surface temperatures of 875°F and atmospheric pressures of 1300 psi (90 times more than now on earth) and more.
This is not the first time a media outlet in Europe has ventured out to this extreme. But hey, things are desperate for the warmists – and especially for their vision of geopolitical and societal resurfacing.
The Die Welt piece starts with the title and introduction:
Hell Planet Venus Is Not So Different From Earth
875°F and sulphuric acid in the air: A climate of hell reigns on the planet Venus and scientists are now studying if those conditions are threatening the Earth.
Die Welt reports on what scientists said at an international Venus conference in Aussois, France. They have determined that inhospitable Venus is much more similar to Earth than previously thought.
Yes, be worried, be very worried. Die Welt writes the scientists believe that:
Venus in the past may have been very similar to Earth – with oceans – and even life. Then the climate changed, and the planet turned into red-hot desolation.
These claims, says Die Welt, are not just science-fiction fantasy, rather they are based on measurements from the European Venus Express probe launched in 2005, which is currently measuring and analysing Venus with an array of high-tech instruments.
Researchers from the Max-Planck-Institute for Solar System Research in Lindau and Germany’s version of NASA are also involved.
Even scientists like Colin Wilson of the University of  Oxford thinks it is probable that:
 In the past there had to have been a lot of water on Venus.
Just like Earth. But what really makes Venus interesting, says Die Welt:

 —is the fact that it is a prime example of a runaway greenhouse effect that may have started in a way that is feared to be now taking place on Earth.
Die Welt describes how things work on Venus:
Due to its thick cloud cover, only 20% of the solar energy reaches the planet’s surface. This 20%, however, cannot be radiated back into space because of Venus’s dense atmosphere, and thus leads to enormous heating of the planet.
Die Welt then adds:
The manmade pollution of the Earth’s  atmosphere – warns a majority of climatologists – could also lead to a runaway situation whose final result would be what we have on Venus today.
That is: 875°F and an atmospheric pressure over 1300 psi.
Scientists are interested in finding out if volcanoes could have erupted and disturbed the atmosphere on Venus early on, and thus led to a runaway greenhouse effect, The scientists at the conference in Aussois are trying to determine the cause of resurfacing on Venus.
To summarise, Die Welt is attempting to get its readers to believe we are creating a hell on Earth. It doesn’t get more cynical than that.
Meanwhile, just in the time it took to read this post, hundreds of people died worldwide because of malnutrition. But governments and the media couldn’t care less of the current, real tragedy, it seems. It’s more important to go all out and spend billions to cynically concoct new bogus future scare stories to frighten citizens, and ignore the messy problems of today.
Journalists and governments need to wake up and get back to doing what they’re supposed to do. Funding and supporting scientists in concocting ridiculous scare stories is not one of them. Indeed it’s willful neglect of the pressing problems we face right now on the planet today.
In Germany this behaviour is a violation of the law and is called Unterlassene Hilfeleistung (neglect to provide rescue assistance).
The world is not facing a climate catastrophe. Instead it’s dead in the middle of a leadership catastrophe. So much so that one could argue it’s bordering on crime.
Voters and consumers, it’s time to run these bums out-of-town.
Update: Craig Goodrich brings to our attention the following very useful link to a post by Steve Goddard at WUWT. http://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/05/06/hyperventilating-on-venus/, and Lubos Motl http://motls.blogspot.com/2010/05/hyperventilating-on-venus.html.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThanks to the Energiewende (transition to green energies), which is tantamount to a vegan energy diet, Germany’s electricity prices have soared 27% over the past decade to become the most expensive in Europe, if not the world, according to the STROM-REPORT.

Source: Infografik “Strompreise in Europa 2020”, STROM-REPORT.de, Creative Commons License CC-BY-ND
Taxes, surcharges and a catalogue of other fees make up 53.6% of Germany’s electricity price, only Denmark has a higher share at 67.8%. Only five European countries have seen electricity prices drop over the last 10 years.
Soaring prices in Latvia and Great Britain
No country has seen electricity rates rise more than in Latvia and Great Britain, where the price has risen a whopping 55% and 46% respectively over the past 10 years.
What’s behind the high electricity prices? According to the STROM-REPORT: “The biggest intra-European differences are caused by taxes and duties. The EU average is 36.6%. But the values vary from country to country and are highest in Denmark with 63.7%. In Germany, where the government-induced price components also account for more than half [52.3%] of the price, the EEG levy, which enables the expansion of renewable energies, is included at 21.5%.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn yesterday’s post I wrote about Deutsche Welle’s  letter to European Institute for Climate Energy (EIKE). where it denies being one-sided in holding an alarmist conference for journalists called: The Heat Is On – Climate Change and the Media, which has workshops like: How to professionally deal with climate scepticism. The conference’s own stated objective:
This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures. 
And the panelists at the conference warn: 
Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics at the expense of the basis of life. 
Despite the obvious one-sidedness of the conference, Deutsche Welle’s Intendant Erik Bettermann sent a letter to EIKE denying it completely. Remember that Deutsche Welle is a publicly funded broadcaster that is required by law to remain fair and balanced.
Now here’s a translation of EIKE’s response to Deutsche Welle’s denial:
Dear Herr Bettermann
Thank you for your reply dated 9 June 2010. You state at the start of your letter concerning the conference that: 
“…Deutsche Welle neither influences the global discussion on climate development in a one-sided manner, nor does it intend to, through its reporting or through the international convention: Global Media Forum..”

However your website announcement itself states: 
“Global warming presents grave problems for the world. Climate change not only has impacts on geo-political peace, regional conflicts, social well-being and human rights, it also impacts our very existence – whether or not the planet will be a hospitable place. Starvation, mass movement of refugees, flooding, lost harvests, extreme storms, droughts and pandemics weaken the foundation of our collective home. The Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum 2010 will put the main topics concerning climate change at the centre of focus and search for a practical way out of the current situation, whereby the role of the media at the international, national and local levels are considered. To prevent the catastrophe, drastic instruments and measures are required.”
This is indeed state doctrine that DW is describing. But it is factually false and moreover it involves the massive, forbidden influence of public opinion. Furthermore, you deny influencing of participants with seminar speakers. But the web announcement itself states, for example: “For journalists it is almost impossible to check over each and every statement for factual accuracy…,“ and: “Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics…This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.“ And further: “That’s why it simply cannot be said that Deutsche Welle is promoting in any way, within the framework of the Global Media Forum,  a one-sided view on the problem of climate development.”
That the single pages of the seminar cannot be called up does not change in any way the publicly made Deutsche Welle objective of influencing public opinion.
In addition you write:  “…through presentations, discussions and debates, the Global Media Forum is a conference for journalists, politicians, scientists and many others in dealing with the question of what role the media have in sharpening people’s awareness regarding the complex topic of climate change.” 
Yet, to the contrary, the stated objective of the conference is to sharpen the fear of climate catastrophe. That’s a big difference. 
You further confirm your denial of public fact, and contradict your own website announcement: 
“Deutsche Welle offers a forum for these discussions , and as a publicly funded broadcaster, does not represent a pre-decided opinion in one direction or another…”
For any normal German reader, it is obvious that the statements made in your letter are in direct contradiction to the publicly stated objective of the forum.  The forum Deutsche Welle is conducting does not in any way comply to the requirements for publicly funded media outlet, paid by the German taxpayer.
Thus we request once again that you cancel this one-sided, catastrophe-promoting conference. The public will be kept informed by us in the appropriate ways.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. H. Thuss,         Dipl. Ing M. Limburg, 
Präsident               EIKE Vizepäsident
Of course the conference began yesterday, and ends tomorrow. No word if some of the conference’s content has been removed in order to comply with the law. Don’t hold your breath. One can now safely say that one publicly funded media arm in Germany has officially gone from journalism to state-sponsored propoganda.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAgain the excellent Readers Edition here has an excellent piece on Pachauri, which I’ve written here in English. Pachauri became Chairman of the IPCC in 2002.The following is his little-publicised partial resume of some of the posts he’s held. Now if you look closely and squint your eyeballs really hard, you might see a conflict of interest here and there.

1981 director Tata Energy Research Institute in New Delhi
2001 general director of  The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI)
2005 founder of GloriOil, which developed TERI technology for exploiting remaining oil reserves of abandoned oil sources
2007 on the advisory committee of Siderian Venture Capital in San Francisco
2008 consultant to Credit Suisse on renewable and sustainable energy
2008 on the advisory committee of the Rockefeller Foundation
2008 on the supervisory board of Nordic Glitnir Bank which launched the Sustainable Future Fund
2008 Chairman of Indochina Sustainable Infrastructure Fund
2008 Director of the International Risk Governance Council in Geneva, which was founded by French power company EDF and German power company E.On
2009 strategy advisor for the New York based Pegasus Investment Fund
2009 Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Asian Development Bank
Head of the Climate and Energy Institute of Yale University, which is funded by millions of dollars from USA and private companies
Member of the Climate Change Board of Deutsche Bank
Director of the Japanese Institute for Global Environmental Strategies
Advisor to Toyota Motors
Advisor to the French state-owned SNCF rail
President of the Industrial Lobby TERI-NA which is funded by 130 government and corporate sponsors, which include the Rockefeller Foundation, Monsanto and the World Bank

Today, billions are being made trading paper called CO2 certificates. For example, Indian Tata moved its steel production of 3 million tonnes annually from England to India, and thus earned almost 2 billion euros in CO2 credits. Not only that, almost 2000 honest workers lost their jobs². India alone has 1455 emissions trading projects up and running with an estimated value of US$33 billion. Many are run by Tata.
Pachauri is also on the Advisory Committee of the Chicago Climate Exchange, the largest and most lucrative CO2-exchange in the world, which was supported by TERI. One director is Maurice Strong, former General Secretary of the UNCED, and head of Petro-Canada, and head of Ontario Hydro. In 2005 he had to step down because of his involvement in the UN Oil For Food scandal. Since then he’s been living in Peking, where he directs his oil business and advises the Chinese government on how to get rich with CO2 certificates – just like India is doing. (But don’t blame India and China – they are only accepting great offers. Who wouldn’t!).
Now one begins to see just how corrupt the UN climate policy is. People near its core are getting seriously rich. Now you know why Al Gore will say and do anything to keep the scam going. 
Pachauri also asked the EPA to limit CO2 emissions without waiting for Congress to act. The EPA took his advice and declared CO2 “dangerous to human health”. The EPA based all this on the bogus IPCC 2007 4AR. This alone  is going to cost industrial countries another estimated $45 billion.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany people around the world play at online casinos, and thats fine if its your only source of gambling. However, online casinos situs bola are nowhere near as close to the real thing when it comes to simulation. Take Craps for example. The casino determines what number rolls by using a random number generator. However, just how random is random? If you have been in a casino, you know that every single person at a table has a unique rolling pattern. Some stack the dice and casually vault them into the air. Others shake them up and rocket them to the back wall, while other frequently launch the dice off the table or fall short of the back wall. There are even players who change their rolling pattern every roll or point.
An online casino does not have the ability to simulate this. Sure, they can manipulate the random number generator, but theres still no way to accurately simulate table action. Having programmed, I know that a random number generator is not all that random. Worse, if the computer simply picks a number, it is not even a proper setup to being with. Lets keep looking at Craps. Does the casino have a random number generator that simply picks a number between one and twelve? If so, all the numbers have an even shot at coming out, which is against true probability. Perhaps they list out all probable combinations and then the computer selects one. This would be a little more accurate, probability wise, but it still lacks the real randomness of live actionand weird events are more likely to ensue.
What Im about to tell you is true and happens more frequently that one would imagine. A tester recently played at an online casino (Craps) to monitor number frequency in the field. Within the span of just 150 rolls, the computer rolled 11 non-field numbers in a row and then followed it up a handful of rolls later by rolling 12 non-field numbers in a row. Whats the big deal you ask? Well, first, the field has a 44.5% chance of winning on every roll and second; the probability of throwing 11 non-field rolls in a row is .0015%. The probability of throwing 12 non-field numbers in a row is .0008%. These events should happen once every 667 rolls and once every 1176 rolls respectively, yet both where seen within a handful of rolls from each other within the 150 rolls monitored.
But wait, theres more. Within these same, now historic, 150 rolls, a six was not thrown for 13-16 rolls 5 times. The probability of not throwing a six 13 times is 14.5% (9% for 16 rolls)this happened 5 times in 150 rolls. The same happened to the eightin factthere were two instances where an eight was not thrown for 18-20 times. The probability of this happening is 5-7% and it happened twice.
When you add all of these things together, you get a more accurate picture of just how unrealistic random number generators are for simulating real casino action. I am not trying to scare you away from playing. In fact, money can be made and fun can be had at online casinos. However, you need to realize that you are playing in a different environment with different rules. You cant go chasing bets thinking they are overdue, mathematically, to come in, because this is a different world with a different way of producing outcomes. Playing strategies that you would use in a real live casino might not be applicable in an online casino.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s an example of what dissenting opinions have to face here in what was once called the land of poets and thinkers. (In climate science Germany is more the land of dogmatists and intolerants, unfortunately. But as I’ve said, that’s slowly changing).
Yesterday I posted a piece “Climate Science” Now Questioned At German Universities about Professor Dr Werner Kirstein of the University of Leipzig and a seminar he held last June called “Where Is The Climate Change?”
Taking apart “climate science” is not a real achievement in itself. The science has been crumbling rapidly for quite some time now. Dr Kirstein’s real achievement in this story is, however, daring to speak up against the climate science religion. To do so in Germany, one has to expect multiple character assassination attempts. Georg Hoffmann attempts just that, ridiculing not only Dr Kirstein, but the University of Leipzig as well.
Kirstein’s seminar at the University of Leipzig did indeed upset the climate clergy, not surprisingly, and so they have sent out an underling, Georg Hoffmann, to attack, ridicule and attempt to slap down Kirstein and the University of Leipzig, and it should all serve as a reminder to anyone else who might dare to speak up. Hoffmann wrote his hit piece yesterday at his blog site. The title in English:
Climate Hack Of September 2010 – Professor Kirstein And the University of Leipzig.
The highly acclaimed Climate Hack Of The Month Award for September 2010 goes to Professor Kirstein and his employer, the University of Leipzig. The claim made by Kirstein that “Greenland was mostly ice-free during the Middle Ages” belongs to the Top Ten of probably the most senseless statements ever made on the subject of climate change. Congratulations from the jury.

Here we have a person childishly ridiculing a distinguished professor and an entire university. Seldom do we witness such hubris in Europe, except of course in “climate science”. This is precisely what “climate science” dissenters have to deal with regulary. And such attacks are generously funded by European governments.
I watched the entire Kirstein presentation, and everyone knows what he meant with Greenland. Hoffmann is simply hiding behind his computer in Paris, or wherever, and attacking from the safety of his hinterhalt, like a true coward. He nitpicks and takes things out of context. Of course he cherry-picks his data at every opportunity, and applies post-normal science throughout.
Yet, we all know that if called out to debate face to face in public, people like Hoffmann are the last to show up. Open debate for post-normal scientists is foreign, and it has proven to be nothing but disastrous in the past.
http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9082151
Before the debate
GW is a crisis:   Yes 57%  No 29%
After the debate
GW is a crisis:   Yes 42%  No 44%
Those were results at a time when belief in the climate religion was at its zenith. Today doubt is much higher. So expect more cheap shots to come out from the hinterhalts.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German GKSS research centre located near Hamburg has put out a press release that kind of baffles me. Early Warning System For Heat Waves Necessary.
The press release starts:
After a very cold winter, a heat wave has gripped Germany. All signs point to July being the hottest month ever since records have been kept. The heat wave hit us just as surprisingly as the past extreme winter. So far there have not been any reliable instruments for predicting extremes. The Climate Service Center of the GKSS ResearchCentre in Geesthacht recommends improving forecast models.
I’ve been living in Germany since 1990, and to me this has not been a really hot summer. We’ve had some hot days, but with cool weather in between over the last 4 weeks – whoopie. It’s being hyped and milked for all it’s worth.
But that is not what surprises me. What surprises me is the claim there are no reliable instruments for predicting heat waves and cold waves. The press release states:
Currently it is not possible to make reliable seasonal forecasts for Europe, and to sort of predict extremely hot summers or heat waves. This is urgently needed in order to be able to implement the necessary adaptive measures and thus reduce the negative impacts on man and environment.
I think that’s crap. There are number of organisations that have had pretty good track records in making seasonal forecasts. So where could the notion that there are no reliable forecasts come from?
The press release amply cites the NOAA.

Voila! There’s your answer. If you rely on dubious institutions for your information, then you can only reach the “no-reliable-forecasts” conclusion. And we also know that the Met Office, with their super computers, failed miserably in their seasonal forecasts, so much so that they became a laughing stock and have since given it up.
But to say there no reliable forecasts available for Europe is false. There are. For example, how is it that Joe Bastardi of Accuweather has consistently called them right? Joe not only predicted the hot summer back in February/March (early warning enough I’d say), but also forecast the cold winter back last fall. Contact him. Maybe his data sources and models are better – less corrupt.
I called Rüdiger Braun, GKSS press spokesman, and he was kind enough to explain that the target is to simply build upon the existing system and to improve it.
Sounds reasonable. My suggestion then is that they start by separating the bad forecast models from the good ones, and to take it from there.
Finally, it’s peculiar how climate scientists insist their 20, 50 and 100-year projections are spot on, while other scientists fret about the lack of reliable 3-month forecasts.
And finally here’s the forecast for my town here in Germany. 20°C is a heat wave, right?

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the German Readers Edition, Rudolf Kipp has a short write-up poking fun at Kevin Trenberth’s missing heat. http://www.readers-edition.de/2010/04/18/raetsel-geloest-globale-erwaermung-versteckt-sich-in-den-ozeanen/. I’d like to build further on that.
Kevin Trenberth is a devout believer in AGW. Unfortunately measurements haven’t been cooperating and they show the world hasn’t warmed up at all over the last years. Frustrated, Trenberth was unable to contain his exasperation in a Climategate e-mail:
The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t. 
If that weren’t bad enough, new studies now show the oceans, where most of the thermal energy is stored, are cooling. http://wattsupwiththat.com/2009/03/21/recent-ocean-heat-and-mlo-co2-trends/
Still, like a true believer, Trenberth denies it and insists the heat is there – somewhere. It’s just simply hidden. After all the climate models say the heat has to be there. And so he warns us:
The heat will come back to haunt us sooner or later.

In the meantime more signs are mounting that we should be preparing for cooling due to quiet solar activity, which some scientists are now realising there’s strong evidence of a link. http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/5/2/024001/fulltext   
In May 2008 Mojib Latif was one of the first established climate scientists to recognise cooling, writing that the missing heat was due to ocean oscillations and that it would last another 10 to 20 years. http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7191/abs/nature06921.html and http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17742-worlds-climate-could-cool-first-warm-later.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&nsref=online-news.
Meteorologist Joe Bastardi has also been beating the drums of a cooling period, saying the current El Nino is about to fizzle out and that we can expect a La Nina with a couple of cold years ahead. And recall that a recent survey showed that a large majority of meteorologists believe climate is driven by natural factors, and much less so by man.
Dr. Don Easterbook and others are convinced that the cooling will indeed be longterm. Kevin Mooney writes: http://www.sott.net/articles/show/206060-21st-century-global-cooling-trend-debunks-United-Nations-computer-climate-models
The momentum is now very much with researchers who have identified natural forces as opposed to human activity as the primary driving force behind warming and cooling trends. Ideally, they should find greater expression.
But devout believers will hear none of it and they continue to believe in the Hidden Heat. Stefan Rahmstorf even defiantly offered to bet “big money” that average temps will continue to rise through 2020. http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/05/global-cooling-wanna-bet/langswitch_lang/en.  Of course Rahmstorf would not be so careless as to forget a back-door escape clause, just in case:
 To be fair, the bet needs an escape clause in case a big volcano erupts or a big meteorite hits the Earth and causes cooling below the 1994-2004 level.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThanks to Tom Nelson for posting this. Thomas L. Friedman has earned a spot in my category: Lifestyles of the Rich and Alarmists. Normally I avoid riding on the coattails of other blogs,  but this time I’ll make an exception.If  Thomas Friedman walked around barefoot preaching his gospel like Kung Fu did, then I’d have a lot more respect for the guy. Now I have zero respect.  Like most environmental hypocrites, it’s: “do as I say, and not as I do”. But hey, they’re entitled to live like kings for all the important work they do in rescuing man and the planet.
The rest of us? Well we don’t really do anything important. All we do is impact the environment, and thus we ought to be relegated back to the mud and rice fields.
It never fails. Take almost any Hollywood star or elite left-winger, and you’ll see their environmental activism is invariably proportional to their wealth, A = kW. The same equation applies for their hypocrisy: H=kW, where k > 10.
Let’s take a look at some of the eco-features of his spread.
1. The pool looks to be about 30′ x 70′, no solar heating for it.
2. The asphalt 2-lane driveway is large and wide enough for a stretch limo to easily curve around.
3. No solar panels on the roof. The place is a virtual heat sink.
4. Judging from the angle of the sun and season, the house faces southwest, yet does nothing to take advantage of that. The south-facing windows are even modest in size.
5. Lots of carbon-storing trees were cleared away.
6. I count 3 chimneys – lots of heating.
7. There’s got to be at least 8 bathrooms in the place, who knows how many heated jacuzzis.
8. Even the white car parked outside doesn’t look like a hybrid.
It certainly tops Al Gore’s mansion (the one in Tennessee). But who knows, maybe he takes the hybrid once a week.

The nearly global acceptance of economically-devastating lockdowns as a mitigating response to the COVID-19 pandemic has inspired many to question the assumption humans drive changes in CO2 concentration.
As Drs. Koutsoyiannis and Kundzewicz  point out in their iconoclastic new study, “despite unprecedented decrease in carbon emission, there was an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, which followed a pattern similar to previous years.”

Image Source: Koutsoyiannis and Kundzewicz, 2020
Utilizing the obvious condition that causes precede effects, or that effects do not lead causes, the authors first point out that the paleoclimate record shows CO2 changes follow temperature changes by about 1000 years. Then they examine the sequential relationship between global temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration during 1980–2019.
While they find the causality direction for CO2 leading temperature (T) changes does exist, the results of their study clearly “support the hypothesis that the dominant direction is T → CO2,” not CO2 → T.
In fact, the statistical probability is so robust “the p-values in the direction T → [CO2] are always smaller than in direction [CO2] → T by about 4 to 5 orders of magnitude, thus clearly supporting T → [CO2] as dominant direction.” Temperature is shown to lead CO2 changes by about 6 months to a year.
Drs. Koutsoyiannis and Kundzewicz acknowledge the perspective “CO2 → T prevails in public, as well as in scientific, perception.” So they point out that an IPCC analysis has natural ground (soil) CO2 emissions reaching 114 to 119 gigatons of carbon (GtC) per year, whereas ground (fossil fuel) emissions from anthropogenic sources only amount to 8 or 9 GtC per year. Consequently, the “change in carbon fluxes due to natural processes is likely to exceed the change due to anthropogenic CO2 emissions” as the “the intensity of biochemical process increases with temperature [and] leads to increasing natural CO2 emission.”

This study is not without precedent. Another analysis of the temperature-CO2 phase relation for 1980-2012 (Humlum et al., 2013) indicated “changes in atmospheric CO2 are not tracking changes in human emissions” and “changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging 9.5-10 months behind changes in global air surface temperature.”

Atmospheric physicist Dr. Murry Salby authored a textbook highlighting the dependence of CO2 emissions on temperature. He insisted that “a significant portion” of the recent increase in CO2 “derives from a gradual increase in surface temperature” (pg. 253).
But there is also a “major inconsistency” in the currently accepted paleoclimate and straight-line (Mauna Loa) CO2 progressions, as they imply CO2 molecules do not respond to temperature like they are observed to do so chemically.
He concludes: “The two proxies of previous climate are incompatible. They cannot both be correct.”

Image Source: Salby, 2012
A critical analysis of the paleoclimate CO2 record (Jaworowski et al., 1992) suggests the assumption we can accurately determine the entire Earth’s CO2 concentration by examining ancient polar ice bubbles – 36 to 100% of which are contaminated by exposure to today’s air – is “shown to be invalid.”
In Holocene-era ice cores, CO2 reaches 2500 ppm, 2900 ppm, even 7400 ppm per measurements taken in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. These values were selectively rejected by those seeking to reach “consensus” that modern CO2 concentration values are unprecedented.

Image Source: Jaworowski et al., 1992
To further illustrate the currently accepted paleoclimate CO2 records are likely to be invalid, consider the fact that modern CO2 concentrations beneath snowpack in forests and meadows range from 600 to 1800 ppm and these concentrations can fluctuate by as much as 200 ppm within a period of just 4 days (Massman and Frank, 2006).
If this kind of flux can be observed for modern conditions, assessing the CO2 concentration beneath snowpack that is thousands of years old is little more than fanciful speculation.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn the surface, looking at warmist blogs and sites can be quite entertaining at times. But reading more closely between the lines, the entertainment always seems to turn into a surreal horror story.For the most rabid among the environmentalists, who strangely never seem to run out of funding, saving the planet means having to deny others life.
I happened to go to Al Gore’s site where he linked to a piece in Seed Magazine called Eating Away. It takes a look at growing human population, the agriculture needed to feed it, its consumption and impact on the planet.
Seed Magazine admits that the population growth rate peaked in the 1980s and that the world has gone from Baby Boom to Baby Bust, much of this trend owing to the education and empowerment of women, especially in developed countries.
But having population growth under control here and there is not enough. Poor countries still have exploding populations. Environmentalists worry about the extent the planet could sustain a population of 9 billion, projected to be reached by 2050.

Apocalyptic scientists fear that the CO2 emission resulting from a growing population will lead to a climate catastrophe. According to biologist E.O. Wilson of Harvard University:
A population growth to 9 billion people alone will add as much as 2 billion metric tons more of carbon dioxide to the greenhouse gas blanket smothering Earth.
In their view, the planet has become too small. So who should be the first to leave?
Target: USA’s 10,000-tonne children
Some already have a clear target in the crosshairs, for example reproductive biologist Roger Short of the University of Melbourne. Seed Magazine writes:

Short goes so far as to call for a halt to future population growth. After all, the most profound way a U.S. citizen can impact climate change is to have fewer children, since every American child born today will add almost 10,000 metric tons of CO2 to the atmosphere under current conditions—five times more than a Chinese child and 160 times more than a baby from Bangladesh.
Having one fewer child would reduce a family’s greenhouse gas impact 20 times more than driving a Toyota Prius, using Energy Star appliances and other environmentally friendly lifestyle choices combined, according to researchers at Oregon State University.
So it’s not really about the number of people on the planet, rather it’s more about who. Future American children have been degraded and reduced by the Greenshirts to grotesque 10,000-tonne planet-threatening monsters.
Andrew Bolt’s recent commentary looks at the psychopathology behind the radical green movement, read Totalitarian Itch.
Seed Magazine writes:
The world’s richest 500 million people produce half of global carbon dioxide emissions, while the poorest 3 billion emit just 7 percent.
Ultimately, the problem isn’t the number of people. It’s what those people do. The average American (just one of 309 million) uses up some 194 pounds of stuff—food, water, plastics, metals and other things—per day, day in and day out.
The poor 3 billion are not the problem. American parents and kids, they’re coming after you. The blood hounds have picked up your scent. You can hear them barking in a not so far away distance.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScientists often say that if you want to see the climate change signal, then look at the poles, especially the Arctic. How often have we seen the following red-coloured graphic, or similar, and thought: Oh my God!
Well don’t panic. Even with all the “hottest-ever-first-6 months” in 2010 belly-aching, temperatures are about to take a dive. I’m not talking about because of fall and winter are approaching, I’m talking temperature anomalies over the winter. They are projected to be far below normal.
The NOAA models predict a major cooling for the Arctic this coming winter. Indeed they show a significant cooling globally. These models have been converging on an Arctic deep freeze for a few weeks now. Already the mercury north of 80° latitude has taken a dip back down to the freezing point, see DMI chart:
Now lets look at the NOAA Arctic seasonal forecast for the period Aug/Sep/Oct 2010:
In the above chart, you can see that the Arctic above Scandinavia, Russia, Siberia has cooled to a slight negative anomaly. The Canadian Arctic is still on the warm side. But almost everything above the 80°N line is blue, meaning colder than normal.
Now take a look at the next NOAA graphic which shows the global temperature anomalies for the period Jan/Feb/Mar 2011 – the dead of winter (entire NOAA graphic series here):
Look at all the deep blue up in the Arctic indicating well below normal temperatures! Some readers may say: “Well, it’s only 1 or 2°C below normal, what’s the big deal?”  It is a big deal. Today warmists are screeching about global temperature anomalies of +0.5°C.  So 2.0°C in the Arctic is huge. The Pacific and the Antarctic coast are also frigid.
Keep in mind this this post was written just by looking at the leading Climatic Indicators I have listed on my homepage. Anyone can go there and take a look at the charts. The data are there, take a look at them yourself and draw your own conclusions. Do your own thinking.
How long will the cold last? That depends on the developing La Nina. Again the big climate institutes point to a good-sized La Nina.
So, to summarise, expect Arctic sea ice to get pretty low this year, and to hear lots of headlines about it, but then watch the ice recover next year. Joe Bastardi thinks it could reach near record highs. This of course depends on how reliable the NOAA seasonal forecasts are.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s what Joe says in his latest video. The PDO is now going into its cold phase and the current La Nina is going to be a bear – and quite possibly a polar bear at that.
The Pacific, the primary global climate driver, has been in its warm cycle since the late 1970s, and that’s coming to an end. That period was dominated by El Ninos, which kept the planet on the warm side. But now the Pacific has flipped and we’re now entering a cool phase, where La Ninas are expected to dominate.
I disagree with Joe when he says the brutal winters are going to start in 2013. In my view they’ve already started! So If Joe thinks the last couple winters have been mild, I sure hate to see what “brutal” is going to look like!

Joe thinks that brutal winters follow deep La Ninas. And because he thinks the next 2 years will be dominated by a major La Nina, then cold winters are expected to strike beginning in 2012-2013.
He’s getting bold with his predictions. But if he winds up being right, then the AGW theorists and their half-baked models are history. Joe says in the video:
Here we go. We spike this up. And now we’re into a major La Nina that’s going to last for the next couple of years. When we come out of that, there’s really good reason to believe the winter of 2012-13, and perhaps beyond, is going to be quite cold.
Then there are the wild cards, says Joe: solar activity and volcanoes, which impact the ENSO. Joe also mentions how the current La Nina has so far come on faster and harder than anything he can remember. You can see what he means looking at the following graphic:
Comparing this La Nina to the last one, this one is in a big hurry, and is shaping up to be a deep one. That all of this is occurring during a very slow solar cycle may be just a coincidence, but enough scientists are out there yelling “heads up!”
I myself am buying extra long-johns this fall for the months and years ahead. Last year’s pairs are already worn out.

Hachijojima is a volcanic Japanese island some 287 kilometers south of Tokyo, to which it belongs. 7,522 people live on its 63 km2 of area.

Image cropped from Google Maps.
What makes Hachijojima interesting climatically is its rural, non-urban features – in the middle of the ocean –  making station siting there less prone to factors that could corrupt the data, such as airports, asphalt, concrete, steel and other heat-sink-acting infrastructure.
Today we look at data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) going back almost 80 years. Hearing all the claims about a rapidly warming world from the media, many readers would think that there must be warming happening there as well. The data have a surprise in store.
Summer
Now that summer has ended, we plot the latest data to see if summers have indeed been warming at this island.

Data source: JMA
As the above data show, there has been virtually no trend at all over the past 80 years. Warming? Still no sign of it at all.

Winter
Next we look at the mean winter temperatures at this location since 1947:

Data source: JMA
Like summer, also winter has shown no long-term trend one way or the other. Where’s the bad climate change news here?
Annual
To round out the analysis and to summarize, we plot the annual mean temperature data recorded for Hachjojima:

Data source: JMA
Interestingly, the annual temperature behavior appears to follow a cyclic behavior that very much resemble some ocean surface temperature cycles we see from around the globe, like the PDO or AMO. Climate indeed changes, but what we see above it cannot be due to anything anthropogenic.

PCR test is a fraud
Over the years, Fuellmich has landed some awfully impressive trophies, among them Deutsche Bank and VW. Now he’s taking aim at Big Pharma and tech companies for what he considers to be crimes against humanity, mainly that the PCR test is a fraud. .
Designed to make people panic, submit to Big Tech
In a recent video he talks about how all the COVID-19 measures imposed, such as social distancing, wearing a mask, lockdown and quarantine are designed to “make people panic so that they believe without asking questions that their lives are in danger so that in the end the pharmaceutical and tech industries can generate huge profits from the sale of PCR tests, antigen and antibody tests and vaccines, as well as the harvesting of our genetic fingerprint.”
Hat-tip: Reader Sommer
Fuellmich sees nothing less than attempted crimes against humanity taking place.
What follows is his video on the subject, and well worth viewing.

It’s terrible what’s going on. People are made to believe that we are now bearers of dangerous pathogens and that we need to be continuously tested, drugged, covered up and controlled. We’re on the brink of what was once thought to be an unimaginable dystopia.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Australian Bureau of Meterorology has just released its latest ENSO Report. It starts out with:
The La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean has strengthened further over the past two weeks. All computer models surveyed by the Bureau predict the La Niña will last through the southern hemisphere spring, with the majority indicating the event will persist into at least early 2011.

The graphic above shows the 30-day moving SOI has reached a new high, even already surpassing the peak reached in January 2008. The following graphic in the BOM report shows sub-surface temperature from May-August, with the cool water progressing to the surface.
The BOM writes:
In the central Pacific, the sub-surface of the ocean is more than 6°C cooler than normal for this time of the year, on a weekly scale.

La Niña depresses average global surface temperatures, which will soon show up in the months ahead in the monthly temperature statistics. Dr Roy Spencer’s site here shows surface temperatures now dipping below last year’s level.
Forecasters are busy revising their projections
Meanwhile, forecasters have been busy revising their earlier projections. Here’s the forecast made back on July 16, 2010, i.e about 2 months ago. The blue line dips to about -1.7.
July 16, 2010 projections
Two months later, in their latest September 14 projections, the blue line now dips down to -1,9.
September 14, 2010 projections. Source: http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/people/wwang/cfs_fcst/images3/PDFcr_nino34SSTMonE120.gif
This La Niña is shaping up to be deeper than previously expected. Does that mean we’re headed for global cooling? No it doesn’t. This is just one ocean cycle. Maybe a few more EL Nino/La Niña flip-flops will tell us more, meaning we have to wait another 5 or 10 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve gotten into a bit of a squabble at Georg Hoffmann’s blog concerning Henrik Svensmark’s cosmic ray cloud-seeding hypothesis.
Hoffmann cites two recent papers that investigate Forbush decreases and their impacts on clouds, and thus climate. The two papers reach different conclusions.
The first paper is by Calogovic et al. (Jürg Beers Gruppe) in GRL, which analyses the 26 strongest Forbush events beginning in 1989 and compares them to ISCCP cloud data. This Calogovic paper finds nothing. No systematic changes in low cloud cover were associated with Forbush events.

The second paper by a German team, Rohs et al, appeared in the Journal of Geophysical Research and found a faint but detectable correlation that seems to contradict Svensmark’s hypothesis that low, earth-cooling clouds would be produced. Rather, Rohs et al finds that high, earth-warming type cirrus clouds are produced instead.
That would be astonishing because it would mean that periods of low solar activity would cause warm periods, and not cold ones, thus completely flying in the face of the Maunder and Dalton minimums.
The Rohs team used Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) data, which uses so-called limb-viewing of the atmosphere. Six Forbush events over 1.5 years were analysed.

Although Hoffmann admits that 6 Forbush events in 1.5 years is a scant amount of data, he can hardly contain his glee with Rohs’s findings and deems them sufficient enough to openly taunt proponents of Svenmark’s hypothesis. He even singles out the “usual suspects”:  THE HOCKEY SCHTICK and GREENIE WATCH, here and here respectively, for claiming Rohs’s paper supported Svensmark. THE HOCKEY SCHTICK and GREENIE WATCH did not mention that the clouds formed in the Rohs paper were of the high, warming kind.
Of course, in a reader comment, I asked why the long periods of long protracted solar inactivity during the Manunder Minimum and Dalton Minimum did not lead to warming. Why was it cold instead? Hoffmann replies with interesting speculation:
Concerning the Maunder Minimum. So IF the Rohs relationship turns out to be robust, it is in fact the wrong sign fo the suggested sun/climate relation. Then you have a couple of other possibilities: 1) Direct forcing (TSI) is sufficient to compensate the Cirrus effect. That means a comparably high climate sensitivity. 2) Volcanoes were mainly responsible for the Maunder Minimum and compensated the Cirrus effect 3) The target is not clear meaning there is no clear relationship between the sun and climate.
For the moment I tkink one has to wait for more MIPAS data. Svensmark idea is by any means not even close to something verfied.
I wonder if he realises what he is saying. If Rohs turned out to be robust ( I doubt it will), then it would turn climate science on its head. Now that would be most interesting.
Note: Georg Hoffmann is a researcher at the LSCE (Laboratory of Sciences of Climate and Environment) in Paris and focuses on various aspects of paleo-climatology. His area of specialty includes climate reconstruction of the last 1000 years and the coupling of carbon cycles to climate development on paleo-timescales.
——————————————————————————————————————————-
UPDATE: HOCKEY SCHTICK REPLIES:
1. The abstract says they only looked at mid and high altitude clouds, so nothing can be concluded from this study about low altitude clouds &amp; GCRs
2. The abstract says “a 15% increase in CNM would result in … an increase in cloud opacity,” so unless the abstract is worded incorrectly, there is no problem with the sign of the correlation. This would also be consistent with earlier statement of a “positive cloud-CNM correlation.”
3. The claim that high altitude clouds warm the planet because they “absorb more IR and reflect less sunlight” seems tenuous at best. Incoming solar energy is 45% IR, so these clouds absorb significant amounts of solar energy BEFORE it reaches the earth, thus acting as a sunshade. Furthermore, high altitude clouds at -18C or less are not capable of heating the earth at 15C because “a cold body cannot heat a warm body” from the 2nd law of thermodynamics.

Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann calls it “the dumbest energy and environmental policy ever”. Now, finally, after years of being warned, Germany’s mainstream media are finally showing signs of waking up to it.

Idiots and energy policy: Burning of “CO2-friendly” wood pellets driving mass European deforestation. Illustrative photo by P. Gosselin
Germany’s flagship ARD public broadcasting recently presented a report earlier today about how “CO2 neutral” wood burning is leading to widespread deforestation across northern Europe – a rather embarrassing development for the Europeans, who  recently expressed their condemnation over Brazilian forest policy.
Deforestation up 49%
The ARD’s “Das Erste” reports how satellite images show deforestation has risen 49% since 2016 in Sweden, Finland and the Baltic countries. The reason: “Because of the CO2 targets. That sounds totally crazy but precisely because of the trend to renewable energies is in part responsible for deforestation in Estonia,” says the Das Erste moderator.

Having spent some time working for the EU, Liiana Steinberg explains in the report how she recently returned to her native Estonia and was shocked to see how much deforestation had taken place over the recent years (2:25). “I discovered how the forests no longer exists here left and right.”
For “CO2-neutral” wood pellets
Where once massive hardwoods once stood now grows tiny fir trees. The harvested trees, the report says, were used for wood pellets – a form of renewable green energy. The trees, the pellet industry says, will grow back.
Not only are the forests taking a hit, but so is the wildlife that once inhabited in them. According to Ms. Steinberg, bird life has fallen some 25%. “It’s wasted. Now we have to start all over again.”
Idiots “follow the science”
Climate activists, including the media like ARD, have long insisted that burning trees was good for the climate and environment because the emitted CO2 would simply be recycled back into nature – “follow the science” they insisted again and again.  But they failed to understand that trees, depending on their age, acted as sinks and that some 100 years of stored carbon would be unloaded into the atmosphere in just a matter of hours if burned for heat.
It’s sad that they are just waking up to this (maybe).

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a story on how a publicly funded broadcaster in Germany has abandoned obeying the laws of the Land, and succumbed to the temptation of practicing activism instead of journalism (a violation of German law). All of this of course on the premise of the fantasized urgent need to rescue the planet.
On June 9 the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)  based in Germany sent a Letter of Protest to the Intendant of German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle demanding that it refrain from the illegal use of public funds by canceling its one-sided alarmist conference for journalists called: The Heat Is On – Climate Change and the Media.
Background here:
1. Journalism For Dummkopfs
2. From Journalism To Thought Control
3. Protest Begins To Mount!
4. EIKE Sends Letter Of Protest
Well, EIKE has received a reply from Deutsche Welle Intendant, Erik Bettermann, and the reply couldn’t have been more mind-blowing. Certainly makes one appreciate the frustration Steve McIntyre must feel at times.
First recall one workshop at the conference: How to professionally deal with climate scepticism, has the stated objective:
This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.
The panelists at the conference go on to warn:
Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics at the expense of the basis of life.
Obviously this conference has nothing to do with balanced journalism, rather just the opposite. So how did Intendant Bettermann respond to EIKE’s request they obey the law and return to balanced journalism?

Easy – Bettermann simply denied any one-sidedness, and asserted they are being fair and balanced. Bettermann’s letter starts with:
In response to your letter dated 9 June 2010, we would like to inform you that Deutsche Welle neither influences the global discussion on climate development in a one-sided manner, nor does it intend to, through its reporting or through the international convention Global Media Forum.
That’s a flat-out lie. And later writes:
As we have already mentioned, we enable representatives of a wide range of viewpoints and opinions to discuss in an international forum. And we will report on these discussions with our media in an honest, comprehensive and balanced manner.
That’s untrue as not a single non-alarmist view is included in the conference. He then adds:
In these discussions Deutsche Welle is only offering a forum and does not represent a decided point of view in one direction or the other.
Yet, just compare the contents of the conference announcement with the statements made by Bettermann. They could not be more diametrically opposed. The conference’s own program announcement is proof of its total one-sidedness, which means publicly funded Deutsche Welle is actively violating German law by not remaining balanced in its journalism.
Let’s be honest. Bettermann is no fool. He knows exactly what he’s doing. He has no intention of being fair and balanced on the climate issue. He’s hoping EIKE will give up trying to take on the state-funded Deutsche Welle and all its legal counselors, and simply go away.
Deutsche Welle has de facto gone rogue. It has long since abandoned journalistic principles. Rather, the broadcaster intends to shape political opinion and public policy in Germany. Now that’s real power! Boring journalism be damned.
But EIKE is not about to back down, and has sent a reply and intends to turn up the pressure. It’s a battle between David and Goliath. It’s a battle they will probably lose, but it’s certainly worth fighting. There’s simply too much at stake.
Tomorrow, EIKE’s reply to Bettermann’s denial.

The French sceptic climate website Changement Climatique has compiled a graphic showing the number of presentations given each month. I’ve posted it below.
Using complex Mannian statistical techniques, I’ve fitted a curve (red line) to the chart (sorry, code is not available). Conclusion: Al Gore’s TCP is headed for a crisis. He really needs to dramatically cut back his hot air emissions.

Probably the only 2 things performing worse are the all-but-defunct Chicago Climate Exchange and Obama’s Economy.
Changement Climatique describes Gore’s project situation as follows:
 The number of presentations reached a peak of 193 in October 2009, just before Copenhagen, but then went on an “unprecedented” and “irreversible” decline to a total collapse in the last few months.  At the moment, not a single presentation is scheduled for 2011, which bodes ill for future of the project. It’s a sure sign that “climatic fatigue” has struck the warmist movement.
Quelle misere.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German virologist Professor Hendrik Streeck is skeptical about a quick vaccine for COVID-19, reports t-online.de.

Virologist Prof. Hendrik Streeck. Image: Cropped here, University of Bonn. 
When asked in an interview why he was so skeptical, Streeck, director of the Institute of Virology at the University Hospital in Bonn, said
nobody can say exactly when the vaccine against Covid-19 will be available and thinks “a Covid-19 vaccine in the near future is unlikely”.
Currently several vaccine projects are currently in the final clinical trial phase on volunteers. Streeck told t-online: “It may be that the next vaccine will work wonderfully. But it may also be that all vaccines that are in Phase III do not work. This simply cannot be seriously predicted.”
To caution against a new vaccine, Streeck cites  a 1961 vaccine against RSV, where “everything went well” in initial tests on children. Later it turned out it could make the disease even worse. “As a result of the vaccine trials in 1961, two children who had previously received the vaccine died. We know the same phenomenon from dengue and other pathogens,” he told t-online.
He added another example: an AstraZeneca vaccine, which he says is likely to cause someone to become infected and so the ” virus can still be passed on”.
According to Streeck, it’s far too early to say when a vaccine will be ready and effective. “I’m just saying we don’t know.”
Streeck also criticizes the lack of coordination and cooperation in the research and some researchers are more concerned about their egos than getting good results. “The research is not done together, everyone tries to be the fastest for himself. This is a pity, because it is partly about delivering fast results, so that the individual distinguishes himself with a better publication,” Streeck told t-online. “A pandemic should lead to a distribution of tasks among all researchers. That is my vision for science, that we all work together – worldwide.”
Virologist Streeck is sure about one thing: ”There is no question that the number of infections will increase.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterStanford researchers dispel the belief that high yield agriculture, with its intensive use of fuel-guzzling machinery and chemical fertilisers, emits huge amounts of “dangerous” greenhouse gases. Read here.High yield agriculture has resulted in a savings of the equivalent of 590 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide.
The Stanford news release writes:
– The yield improvements reduced the need to convert forests to farmland, a process that typically involves burning of trees and other plants, which generates carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
– The researchers estimate that if not for increased yields, additional greenhouse gas emissions from clearing land for farming would have been equal to as much as a third of the world’s total output of greenhouse gases since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in 1850.
– The researchers found that without the advances in high-yield agriculture, several billion additional acres of cropland would have been needed.
and
The researchers also calculated that for every dollar spent on agricultural research and development since 1961, emissions of the three principal greenhouse gases – methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide – were reduced by the equivalent of about a quarter of a ton of carbon dioxide – a high rate of financial return compared to other approaches to reducing the gases.
I wonder if these results will lead activist environmental organisations to reconsider the use of gene-improved plants, which have the potential to greatly improve yield. You also have to ask if organic agriculture, with its non-use of chemical fertilisers and thus lower yields, is bad for the planet. And, the results of this study should tell governments  concerned about GHG that bio-fuels are a bad idea because they require millions of acres of extra farmland, in addition to that used for food production.

In the German edition of Ria Novosti, Russian scientist Oleg Pokrovsky of the Main Geophysical Observatory says the world should expect cooling – and not warming – and that this will interfere with Russia’s plans to exploit the Arctic’s rich resources. The climate has been cooling since 1998.
At a climate research conference for the Arctic and Antarctic in St. Petersburg, Friday, Pokrovsky said the Earth’s temperature fluctuates in 60-year cycles.
There isn’t going to be an ice age, but temperatures will drop to levels last seen in the 1950s and 1960s.
Pokrovsky adds:

Right now all components of the climate system are entering a negative phase.  The cooling will reach it’s peak in 15 years. Politicians who have geared up for warming are sitting on the wrong horse.
The Northeast Passage will freeze over and will be passable only with icebreakers.
Pokrovsky also claims that the IPCC, which has prophesized global warming, has ignored many factors. He also noted that most American weather stations are located in cities where temperatures are always higher.
We don’t know everything that’s happening. The climate system is very complex and the IPCC is not the final truth on the matter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe AGW religion in Germany is in deep trouble. Consensus is crumbling. the science is coming under attack.
It’s taken a awhile, but slowly and surely, Germany, once the premier power in science, is beginning to ask questions again. When lectures and seminars questioning climate science take place within academic circles and at German universities, then you know something is afoot.
Skeptic blog Readers Edition posted yesterday a clip of a seminar here by Professors Dr Klaus Landfried of Heidelberg and Dr Werner Kirstein of the Institute for Geography at the University of Leipzig before an audience at the University of Leipzig. The seminar is titled:
 “Where’s The Climate Change?”

Dr Kirstein opens the seminar and expresses his surprise that so many people are in attendance, some travelling from far away. The introductory part is then handed over to Professor Dr Klaus Landfried.
Professor Dr Landfried reminds us that a university is one of the few places in society where questions can be asked freely, where answers are searched, and then questioned again, and that without any restrictions, in an environment where debate is free.  Landfried says, “Religions have a hard time dealing with that.”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Landfried sets the tone of the seminar in no uncertain terms. This is a seminar that is absent of Rahmstorfian rules and Schellnhuber suppression.
At the 7:10 mark Dr Landfried slams any peer review process run by a good ol boys network.
In the world of science it is unavoidable, as humans are involved, that there are always attempts to portray truths as unacceptable, or to try to suppress them using methods that have nothing to do with science, and perhaps to even slander persons in an attempt shut them up. One method used here is to claim that everything that is good must go through peer review.
Dr Landfried delivers his speech forcefully, slamming peer review processes that involve a cartel of ideas, where some participants are excluded, and the others focus on concentrating their power. He reminds us that the misuse of peer review has always been a problem in science. Conflict in science is nothing new. For example, oncology has long been in bitter dispute.
At the 13-minute mark, Dr. Werner Kirstein starts his presentation. He addresses three main topics:
1. Are the IPCC model-based climate projections something to be taken seriously?
– uncertainties
– model deficiencies
– quotes Neils Bohr: “Prognoses are always problematic, especially when they look at the future.”
2. Sea level rise and glaciers
– Satellite photos show that Bangladesh is actually growing 20 sq km per year.
– Bangladesh land area is 44,000 sq km more than 10,000 years ago (4.4 sq km growth per year).
– Axel Mörner and Vincent Gray say the IPCC is corrupt.
– Rahmstorf projects 140 cm rise, Fred Singer 18 cm, the GFZ 2mm/yr, Mörner max. 20cm by 2100.
– North German coast: no detection of any acceleration in sea level rise.
– For the Pacific Micronesia, tectonics are at play.
– Islands on the Carolina Plate are sinking because the Carolina Plate is being forced down.
– Slams Rahmstorf’s and Schellnhuber’s Potsdam Institute for disinformation.
– Observations vs models, nature vs IPCC.
– Glaciers have retreated and advanced throughout time.
– In the last 10,000 years, glaciers have been smaller than they are today 2/3 of the time.
– Arctic ice is also within boundaries of natural variation.
3. The controversy and politics of climate change
Many meteorologists say about climate science: ” That’s political and has nothing to do with science.”
Dr. Kirstein: “Climate change? – That’s political and has nothing to do with normal science, it’s post-normal science.” With post-normal science, politics is at the forefront and science is just a tool to promote and drive “good” policy” by spreading fear and sticking to a dogma. In the early 1980s, “scientists” projected that all trees would die in Europe by 2005. Dr Kirstein then quotes Hans von Storch:
Climate science is not normal. It’s post-normal.
Post-normal science is always for a good cause or a political agenda. The target is to achieve de-industrialiasation – The Green Economy – The Great Transformation. The modus operandi: by spreading fear. Kirstein then quotes Maurice Strong, John Houghton, Stephen Schneider, and explains some of the recent and infamous PR scare campaigns. There’s even a Climate Change Hotel and tourism in Greenland where you can actually “see climate change taking place”.
After viewing Dr Kirstein’s presentation, it is absolutely no wonder that Hal Lewis called “climate science” the greatest fraud he’s ever seen. Dr Rahmstorf, Dr Schellnhuber, your sham is up.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHave you ever read something about yourself in the newspaper and thought: “Man, they got it wrong”?
Yesterday I summed up in English and posted a German-language piece put out directly by RIA Novosti (see post from yesterday) http://de.rian.ru/science/20100423/126040500.html.  Then a few hours later WUWT posted an English version of the same story released by the UPI. The two versions could hardly be different. It’s one thing to get some things wrong, but it’s quite another to write a whole new story.
1. The UPI opens with:
A Russian scientist says the Arctic may be getting colder, not warmer, which…
But the German version, direct from RIA Novosti, says:
Not warming, but cooling will impact the Earth’s climate over the next few years….

2. The UPI wrote:

An Arctic cold snap that began in 1998…

But the German version says:
The climate has been cooling since 1998…  
When translating, you’ll rarely get it 100% right. Translators try to get as close as possible. But here there really is no excuse for screwing up cooling will impact the Earth’s climate and writing instead: Arctic may be getting colder.  In no. 2 they translate “climate“ to “Arctic“!
The UPI then leaves out (censors?) a large portion of the text as well. For an issue on which the future of humanity hinges, one that is as grave as WWII, the UPI translation sure was awfully careless. It gets a failing grade. Readers – check your sources!

A huge cloud of ash from the 2nd major eruption in less than a month blew eastwards and closed major airports more than 1700 km away in London. The volcano on the Eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted just after midnight on Wednesday.
The ash is about 8-10km in the air and cannot been seen from the ground. But experts say it’s a danger to jet engines and restricts visibility.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to Die Welt online, a team of German physicists at the Freiburger Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems set a new world record by making a solar cell that can convert 41.1% of the sun’s light into electricity. Today’s typical silicium panels on homes don’t even reach 20%.
http://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/innovationen/article7498251/Weltrekord-beim-Strom-aus-Sonnenlicht.html
How did they do it? According to Die Welt, the solar cells have 3 layers stacked on top of each other, each converting a certain part of the sunlight.
In the first layer the visible light spectrum is converted into electricity. The thermal spectrum of sunlight passes through the first layer and is absorbed by a 2nd layer and converted into electricity. Especially longwave infrared light is converted by a third layer.
In addition to the three layers, which are made of elements such as gallium, germanium, indium and arsenic, the cells also have 22 micrometer–thin layers that perform special electrical functions. Physicist Frank Dimroth, who with his team worked 10 years to reach the record, says:
 It’s all horribly complicated.
There are other drawbacks. The cells are efficient only in intensive, direct sunlight, which means they will find only a use in dry equatorial regions and will have to be equipped with a sun-tracking system to follow the sun from morning until evening.
They are also very expensive. The manufacturing cost is 50 times more than today’s conventional solar cells. Still, Dimroth hopes that production costs can be brought down to earthly levels by mass production. There’s no mention in the report of recycling and disposal costs.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEIKE has a piece today called Super Expensive Energy. It perhaps could serve as a reminder for President Obama, who thinks passing cap & trade and stopping reliance on fossil fuels will somehow plug the hole. My feeling is that Obama is using the oil disaster as a political instrument to drive through a dangerous cap & trade law.
Cap & trade means subsidising industries. Governments can do this as long as they can afford it. But that’s rarely the case. Most often they cannot. Europe is a prime example for Obama to look at.
Take a look at socialist Spain, for example. Driven by a green ideology, and all the promises it brings, Spain went ahead and subsidised wind and solar energy with unbridled abandon, thinking it could create thousands of new green jobs and usher in the next economic wonder.
Well, it has. But not the kind of wonder a sane person welcomes. Today Spain is bankrupt and unemployment is at (twenty) 20%. Spain has since been forced to drastically cut its subsidies, and the solar bubble has popped. Spain is now begging other countries for a bailout.
Even in a country that has abundant sunshine, like Spain, solar energy still cannot compete on the free market without generous subsidies. Consumers prefer reliable and inexpensive energy.
You’d think that with solar energy being completely uncompetitive in a country where sunshine is plentiful, leaders in other countries with gray, rainy climates would avoid such a source of energy. Not Germany. Even with its gray dismal climate, leaders went full throttle ahead in subsidising solar panels and energy. They simply forced the power companies to buy up green power from people who have solar panels on their roofs at exorbitant prices.

The power companies of course simply pass the higher costs on to the consumers. Industry is among the consumers of power. Companies that have energy-intensive processes are moving operations, and the jobs that go with them, out to countries that have much lower pollution standards.
Cooking your own goose
State-guaranteed price for solar power in Germany is far above the actual sales price to the market. Such a method was used in former communist East Germany (the country that built a wall to keep its people from running away). For example, a person there could sell a goose they had raised in his backyard to the local markets at the state-guaranteed price of 30 East German Marks. A few hours later the same seller could go back to the market and buy the same goose for only 15 Marks, slaughtered and ready to cook. Today it’s the same with green power producers. They sell their power for 43 cents/kwh, and then buy it back for 22 cents. Does that make sense?
Only if you want to send the economy to hell in a handbasket, and quickly.
In Germany green laws have been passed that will cost hundreds of billions of euros over the next 15 years, all based on the bogus claim they protect the climate. According to EIKE:
These billions burden the economy in 2 ways: 1) They lead to higher electricity rates for producers, meaning their products become more expensive, and 2) lead higher energy bills for consumers, and thus less buying power. Eventually this will choke the German economy and its growth, which eventually will hit already strapped governments fiscally. Absolute foolery.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe array of strategies the green-outside, red-brown-inside activists keep plotting never ceases to amaze me.
The latest comments come from Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer in an interview with George Stephanopoulus, and provide a window to another page of the enviro-Mein-Kampf playbook.
In the interview, Stephanopoulos asks Breyer, on burning the Koran, if the First Amendment ought to be rethought: Breyer replies:
Holmes said it doesn’t mean you can shout ‘fire’ in a crowded theater. Well, what is it?  Why?  Because people will be trampled to death.  And what is the crowded theater today?  What is the being trampled to death? It will be answered over time in a series of cases which force people to think carefully.  That’s the virtue of cases.
So if Breyer had his way, the government would decide what a crowded theater is, and what gets trampled. Folks that would be a dangerous threat to free speech.

Keep in mind that the Supreme Court has already declared CO2 a pollutant that needs to be regulated. And now at least one Justice wants to declare certain types of speech as “pollutants”, and subject them  to regulation.
So what’s the next step? Skeptics is a crowded theater?
Next they’ll be calling the planet a “crowded theater”and its inhabitants “the trampled”, and that certain kinds of speech lead to trampling in the crowded theater, earth.  For example,  those of us who express skepticism, or produce inappropriate science, could be deemed making speech that leads to death in the crowded theater earth.
Without our speech, the planet could be saved, after all.
Sound crazy?
Well, we’ve already been called “deniers”, the scourge of the planet, even bastards that ought to face Nuremberg-type trials for climate crimes. Be warned.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith all the talk about heat waves and alleged record high global temps, one could be led to think that manmade global warming is real and that we’d better install the mercury lights made by Philipps and use electricity made by GE wind generators, and invest in green commodities packaged by Al Gore.
As the following graphic shows, it was a warm year globally. Careful though, some of them red dots are exaggerated in my view, as we know there are lots of instrumental issues and dubious computational methods involved (see  here).
And the media are still going wild with all the hype about heat waves. Is the globe really hot everywhere now?
And will it remain hot for the rest of the year? The answer is NO! 
The next chart shows the temperatures for the period July 4-11. Here, as Steve Goddard shows at WUWT here, 5% more pixels were cool than warm. The globe has definitely cooled over the last weeks, as it enters a La Nina phase.
The first six months were dominated by the recently fizzled out El Nino. Data now show we’ve entered a La Nina phase (see next chart), and models show with high certainty that we are now headed for a good cooling off, which means headlines of a record-setting 2010 were premature. Here’s the ENSO model forecasts for the next 6 months:
Now let’s look at the southern hemisphere. The following 3 graphics show the forecast for the week ahead, July 17 – 24. Do you see any heat waves in South America? I wonder if we’ll get any press releases on the extreme cold gripping South America? And have we heard anything about Antarctic sea ice almost reaching a record high?
And here’s the outlook for Africa, also more on the cool side:
Australia has reported record cold temps. What’s ahead for Australia in the days ahead? No heat-waves there either.
Okay, maybe I’m cherry picking. What’s ahead for the globe for the next 6 months or so? Here’s the global outlook according to NOAA:

To me it looks like a lot of cooling off going on. Again, all this hype about 2010 being the hottest is about to get doused with cold water. It was premature. I suspect this was known at NOAA, and so they rushed out their overheated press releases while they could. Don’t expect to see any more for quite some time. These headlines and press releases were to help Harry Reid (God forbid he gets his crap and trade bill through at the end of the month).
Joe Bastardi goes into the forecast at his European website here.  Here are some things he says:
The coming drop of global temperatures over the next year, to levels not seen since the 1990s, should put to an end to the AGW argument for good except for the most radical elements.
However, also coming is major drop of .5 to .7C in the global temps which will take us below normal for a time.
And Joe adds:
In addition, the reason for the drop will easily be linked with the cooling of the Pacific, which will remain in its cool stage for the next 30 years. Once the Atlantic, still warm, goes into its cool stage in 10-15 years, global temps will fall even further, back to where they were in the 1970s.
How cold was it in the 1970s? The link that follows is a clip that will tell you.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nprY2jSI0Ds&feature=related
It even includes Stephen Schneider as a young whippersnapper acknowledging the coming ice age, and displaying his complete ignorance of global commerce, thinking every country is isolated from each other like North Korea.
There you have it. We’ll find out soon enough who’s right, and who’s full of it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Die Zeit reports here that a Canadian court has ruled in favour of the Inuit Indians, forbidding a planned Arctic expedition by Germany’s alarmist Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in the Lancaster Sound. Reports show that the German expedition may have included Arctic oil and gas exploration.
The AWI’s Polarstern research vessel was ordered to pack up and leave. Now it’s off the coast of Greenland.
Die Zeit writes:
A historic victory will be celebrated in Nunavut. This is the first time a Canadian court recognises the cultural and territorial rights of the Inuits, says a pleased Okalik Eegeesiak, President of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association in Canada.
What makes the story interesting is that the German scientists were not only getting ready to conduct sea ice and water studies, but appear to have been commissioned to conduct oil and gas exploration.

Works were planned to study the rotation of Greenland plates in the Paleocene and Eocene, 40 to 60 million years ago, says Die Zeit.
Die Zeit writes that the fine print in the project description submitted to Canadian authorities in Ottawa for approval (which was granted) included investigating the potential for single sediment basins for the formation of hydrocarbons. 
Hydrocarbons?

Oops! Was the Alfred Wegener Institute getting ready to conduct oil and gas exploration work on behalf of Canada and Germany under the guise of Arctic research? They all deny it.
The Polarstern planned to use air gun blasts for taking seismic readings of the seabed. The Inuit saw this opening, and exploited it, claiming that blasts would drive the seals and Arctic wildlife away. They took it  to court, and won.
Die Zeit also writes that this one particular expedition was not overseen by the Alfred Wegener Institute, as is usually the case, but by the German Ministry for Geosciences and Natural Resources. This ministry is a subordinate of the Ministry of Economics and is responsible for securing the supply of natural resources to Germany.
Hmmm. And all this time I thought these scientists were out there measuring the ice. C’mon, just put 2 and 2 together.
For the German research team, which was in the Baffin Bay getting ready to start its studies when the ruling was made, it’s the first time in 28 years that it has been forbidden to conduct research there. Last year the Inuits had protested a Polarstern expedition, but were unsuccessful.
Sure the ruling is a blow for Arctic oil exploration, but it’s not like we were ever going to get it anyway. The Arctic ice is coming back.
At least now we’re pretty sure what it’s really all about for the goody-too-green Germans and Canadians – oil!

The Conference has begun – I’ll get right to the points.
1) How’s the mood going to be over there? Like a funeral?
LOL! Yeah, like dancing on the grave of your most bitter and hated enemy. I wish I could be there. It goes without saying, the mood will be festive, buoyant, and giddy. So much has happened since the last Conference back in June in Washington. Just 11 months ago who would have ever thought science would progress so much and that the ugly truths behind the CAGW science would be exposed like they have been?
2. What has changed since the last Conference?
The last 11 months in climate science have been like a millenium.  Huge seismic events have occurred, namely the scandal that was Climategate and the debacle that was the IPCC’s 4th Assessment Report. The report has been completely discredited. Chairmann Rajendra Pachauri surely will be forced to go. The CAGW science has been reduced to a heap of crushed ice.
3. What about the program there?
First of all, let the guys and gals celebrate a little. It’s good they are getting away from their laptops and blogs and coming together to talk face-to-face. As mentioned in Pt. 2, there’s a lot to talk about. This year the program is much bigger than last year’s.  The roster of speakers is second to none. There are other speakers I’d like to see, but I guess you have to draw the line somewhere.

4. What about inviting the warmists?
That’s been done. The sceptics don’t hide behind closed, locked doors. The doors are wide open and I’m sure the sceptics would even roll out the red carpet for the warmists. Note how the sceptics have no qualms about opening the Conference up to other points of view. That’s how science works. Compare that to how the warmists conduct their conferences, making sure no dissenting views are expressed. Personally I don’t know why people like Mann should be invited. He’s a climate science fraud and criminal. His hockey sticks have proven that. Others like Hansen, Gavin, etc. – okay. Red carpet’s waiting just for you!
5. What are they going to accomplish there?
It’s a chance  to spawn new initiatives and to communicate other points of view to the public. Sure the old washed up MSM won’t be there. But my view is: Who cares! I hope Talk Radio mentions it and maybe Fox News will do a story or two. Otherwise, the growing internet media will do the rest.
6. How do the warmists feel about the Conference?
They can’t stand it. Already many are peeing and moaning about how demoncracy doesn’t work anymore, and that the media gives the sceptics too much coverage, and that they are in a way aiding and abetting the “denialists”. Of course this shows what they really think of free speech and democracy. They’d prefer not have them. Yesterday I wrote about Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, IPCC lead author and Director of Germany’s Postdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who said:
They [sceptics] don’t try at all to do it successfully through factual debate; rather they attempt to sow scepticism on science being an instrument to explain reality. 
In Schellnhuber’s world, scepticism is anti-science. And if you doubt his science, then you are anti-science.
Well Schellnhuber, the doors to debate are wide open in Chicago. You only need the courage to walk through them.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThanks to reader ThomasJ, who provided this link to a Norwegian documentary about bird-killing windfarms. It might take a few moments to load. And although the clip is in Norwegian, the pictures themselves tell the story. The Norwegian windfarms are turning once majestic landscapes into a nightmare. http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/klipp/282395
I’m also amazed at the number of websites, blogs, documentaries, reports, etc. popping up and casting light on this large-scale avarian slaughter by windmills. Expect resistance to this failed experiment to grow. The Green Movement is quickly proving to be an abject folly.
Aren’t all those windmills along Norway’s prestine natural coastline just lovely?
Update: No problem littering the landscape with bird-chopping windmills – but try putting up a new bridge. http://www.thelocal.de/society/20100513-27141.html
Update: More bird killing

Share this...FacebookTwitterA survey appearing in the Journal Global Environmental Change shows climate scientists fly more often than other researchers. 
On average, climate researchers travel by plane more often each year than other scientists, the large, international survey and experimental study of academic travel found.
Especially professors, fly more than other researchers.
The paper’s abstract follows:




Aviation is a fast-growing sector, releasing more carbon dioxide per passenger kilometre than other transport modes. For climate change researchers, work-related travel – including for conferences and fieldwork – is a major carbon-emitting activity. At the same time, many argue that climate scientists have an important role in curbing their own aviation emissions to align their practices with their assertions in relation to emissions reduction. We examine the tensions between competing professional demands in relation to flying; measure levels of flying by climate and non-climate researchers; assess influences on choices and attitudes; and consider how information provision and structural changes might enable changes in practice. Study 1 entails a large, international survey of flying undertaken by climate change (including sustainability and environmental science) researchers and those from other disciplines (N = 1408). Study 2 tests effects of varying information provision on researchers’ behavioural intentions and policy support to reduce flying (N = 362). Unexpectedly, we find climate change researchers – particularly professors – fly more than other researchers, but are also more likely to have taken steps to reduce or offset their flying. Providing information about the impacts of aviation increases behavioural intentions and support for institutional policies to reduce flying, particularly amongst more pro-environmental respondents. However, while attitudinal factors (e.g., personal norm) predict willingness to reduce flying, structural/social factors (e.g., family commitments, location) are more important in predicting actual flying behaviour. Recent initiatives to develop a low-carbon and more inclusive research culture within climate science and the broader research community thus need to be supported by broader policies and technologies to encourage and enable low-carbon and avoided travel.




More than 1,400 scientists from 59 countries are being asked how often they fly and why. Most respondents came from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Australia. Climate experts fly on average five times a year according to the study.
Experienced climate scientists fly 9 times a year
Also air travel becomes more frequent with increasing professional experience. Climate research professors fly nine times a year on average.
Lorraine Whitmarsh, environmental psychologist at the University of Bath, UK, who led the study, said: “These figures are pretty blatant and should be a wake-up call for the entire scientific community.”

Calamitologist Stefan Rahmstorf once defended his alarmist sea level rise scenarios by saying:
I can’t help it. It’s simply the laws of physics.
The question is: Whose physics?
No science has rewritten the laws of physics like climate science. In climate science, it works like this:
1. Develop a model that shows heating in the future.
2. Then compare the model projections with reality. If there’s a discrepancy:
3. Don’t change the models, instead go and change the measured data so that they agree with the models.
One way to do this is to go back and adjust the historical data, like GISS has done – GISS REWRITES HISTORY!
Another way is to modify your measurement methods and systems so that they put out only data that agree with the models. This involves closing down certain weather stations and then using data from urban-heat-island stations for filling in. GISS has done that too.
You may be able to fool the public this way, but you can’t fool the ice.
Joe Bastardi reports in his latest clip Ice Ice Baby how the Arctic ice simply refuses to melt, although we are told it’s getting warmer and warmer and warmer. Indeed look at total sea ice, north and south pole, here.
There we see a sea ice anomaly of ZERO! Global sea ice is right at normal.
Indeed the ice has been recovering over the last three years – even though we are told that it is getting hotter. This can mean only one thing. When it gets warmer, you get more ice.
We can’t help it, it’s simply the laws of climate physics.

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday’s global ocean temperatures hover around 15°C on average. About 400 to 500 million years ago, Earth’s ocean temperatures averaged 35-40°C and atmospheric CO2 concentrations were “5-10x higher than present day values” (Henke et al., 2018). During this period, the marine biosphere thrived (Voosen et al., 2019).

Image Source: Henke et al., 2018

Image Source: Voosen et al., 2019 and press release
During the last 5.4 million years, CO2 has varied between 180 and 500 ppm (Fletcher et al., 2019). During the Pliocene (5.4 to 2.5 million years ago), Arctic temperatures were said to have been 22°C warmer than today (Fletcher et al., 2017) and tropical ocean temperatures were 3-6°C warmer than present (Wycech et al., 2020).

During the peak of the last glacial (the Last Glacial Maximum) 19,000 years ago, the Southern Ocean was 2°C warmer than it is today even though CO2 levels were a dangerously low 180 ppm at this time. This was also the same period when the Earth’s bottom water temperatures warmed up by about 2°C 1,000 years before the oceans’ surface began warming and CO2 began to rise (Stott et al., 2007).

Image Source: Stott et al., 2007
As recently as 10,000 years ago, the Arctic Ocean’s bottom water temperatures were 6-10°C warmer than they are today (Beierlein et al., 2015).

Image Source: Beierlein et al., 2015
Global ocean temperatures were still warmer than today througout nearly all of the last 10,000 years (Rosenthal et al., 2017), including the Medieval Warm Period (Gebbie and Huybers, 2019).

In sum, paleoclimate research strongly suggests there is nothing unprecedented or even unusual about ocean temperature changes in the modern era.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI know the other uptown climate sceptic blogs don’t want to get anywhere near this red-hot potato of a topic, as the details are explosive, too sketchy and the sources are to some extent dubious. Caution has to be exercised  in drawing conclusions. It’s far too early for that.
But where there’s smoke, there’s fire.  I committed myself to keep people posted on the story. I’m not just going to sit here and “suck it up”. My hunch tells me it’s going to boil over. I may be wrong, but two more big puffs of smoke have just billowed up.
The National Enquirer, yes, a yellow journal, has reported that two more lady masseurs have come forward, claiming Al Gore behaved very inappropriately, read NY Post report.
In the first case that came to light late June, masseur Molly Hagerty said in a 2009 police report that she felt Gore had done this many times before, meaning other women had probably endured the same. If Hagerty was just a fraud, then no other women would come forward.
Now 2 more women are reported coming forward and claiming abuse by Gore.
One incident took place at a Beverly Hills luxury hotel when Gore attended the Oscars in 2007. The second allegedly occurred a year later at a Tokyo hotel. This would confirm Hagerty’s suspicions.
I read the entire police report made by Hagerty, and it seemed to me implausible that someone would make up such an elaborate story.

And although tabloids like the National Enquirer are known for untrustworthy stories, would they go after someone like Gore without having real substance? You can screw up a story on a Hollywood diva, but wouldn’t you make damn sure you have your facts straight if you go after the former VP of the United States, Nobel Peace Prize,  Oscar winner, a figure with that kind of influential muscle?
The New York Post writes:
The probe threatens to engulf Gore deeper into a sex scandal once thought unthinkable for the Nobel prize winner who built up an image as a doting husband and family man who fell in love with his wife at the high school prom and lived happily ever after.
Another reason I think the story has substance is because of what Gore has said and done in the past. AIT was carefully crafted to deceive, and so it says a lot. His words say a lot. This is not a man playing with a full deck, in my view.
Who really betrayed the country?
Eventually these things have a way of getting out of control. Global warming is already having enough trouble surviving Climate-gate. This Gore story could put the whole damn thing away for good.
Will more women step forward?

Share this...FacebookTwitterI noticed Google today had a graphic up, as it often does, that you can click on. What’s the occasion today? Oh! It’s Earth Day!
Earth Day was started by Gaylord Nelson, the Democratic senator from Wisconsin. It was the single largest national demonstration in American history. 20 million Americans participated in the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970.
What did Earth day preach back in 1970? Here are some examples from washingtonpolicy.org:
• By 1995, “…somewhere between 75 and 85 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.” Sen. Gaylord Nelson, quoting Dr. S. Dillon Ripley, Look magazine, April 1970.
• Because of increased dust, cloud cover and water vapor “…the planet will cool, the water vapor will fall and freeze, and a new Ice Age will be born,” Newsweek magazine, January 26, 1970.
• The world will be “…eleven degrees colder in the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an ice age,” Kenneth Watt, speaking at Swarthmore University, April 19, 1970.
• “We are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,” biologist Barry Commoner, University of Washington, writing in the journal Environment, April 1970.

• “By 1985, air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half…” Life magazine, January 1970.
• Paul Ehrlich predicted that in 1973, 200,000 Americans would die from air pollution, and that by 1980 the life expectancy of Americans would be 42 years.
• “It is already too late to avoid mass starvation,” wrote Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes, The Living Wilderness, Spring 1970.
• “By the year 2000…the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America and Australia, will be in famine,” Peter Gunter, North Texas State University, The Living Wilderness, Spring 1970.
Sound familiar? Of course these prophets of doom were wrong – spectacularly wrong. Today things are much better by almost every measure. Four decades later the apocalypse has been pushed back 50 or 100 years, and this time it will be caused by manmade global warming.  This time, they insist, they are certainly right. You see, now they’ve got computer models!
The circus continues.

My wife and I are spending a few days at the Baltic Sea near Kiel, and so blogging will be a little on the light side.
I wanted to do some deepsea fishing yesterday, but the boats didn’t go out – not enough customers. They plan to go out tomorrow. Hopefully I can land that big one. It’s a bit disappointing as I wanted to be out on the sea for days, and not just one.
I’m having some technical difficulties picking up my e-mails (some of you have sent ). My son is going to reroute them over to me and so I’ll answer them as soon as I can. Sorry for the delay.
Hope to post something this evening!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe blogosphere has started to buzz about alleged proposals in the European Parliament in Europe to criminalize climate science scepticism. Science progresses through scepticism and rigorous testing of hypotheses. Criminalising scepticism would be the same as criminalising science. It would be a going back to the Dark Ages.
Lubos Motl wrote a piece at his blog on these proposals and so I listened to the audio he has available. In the audio a name of an International Academy of Environmental Science http://www.iaes.info/ came up, and whose president is a Professor Abrami. I tracked this down and this is what I found:
Abami is invited to the EU in Brussels:
The European Parliament invited Abrami to explain his proposal at a meeting on July14th in Brussels.
The European Parliament Invitation written by Jo Leien to Professor Abrami of the International Academy of Environmental Science: http://www.iaes.info/pdf/Prof.%20Abrami% 20let.pdf. Excerpt of the invitation:
Dear Professor Abrami,
I am writing to thank you very much for your letter of 13th May 2010 in which you set out the background to the interesting proposal of the International Academy of Environmental Sciences for the creation of an International or European Environmental Criminal Court.
I would like you to present the proposal to the Environment, Public Health, and Food Safety Committee at its meeting on Wednesday 14th July at 4.30 pm in the European Parliament in Brussels, and thereafter to participate in an exchange of views with the members of the Committee…blah blah blah
 
The Meeting’s Agenda
Now here’s the agenda for the 14th July meeting: http://www.iaes.info/pdf/ordine%20giorno%2014-7-10_EN.pdf. The meeting agenda includes topics on biodiversity, and the notorious Pt. No. 14:
14. Presentation of a proposal for an International or European Environmental Criminal Court
Exchange of views with Professor Antonino Abrami, acting President of the International Academy of Environmental Sciences (IAES)

So here we see the EU wants to clamp down real hard with environmental regulation. It’s gaming to set up a dictatorship through environmental regulation. But readers can interpret this how they wish.
Abrami’s Hearing: What is he calling for?
What function could such a court have? Here is the link to the Professor Abrami hearing at ENVI Committee http://www.iaes.info/pdf/ENVI_REL_EN_%20HEARING_DOC2.pdf. Professor Abrami outlines the function of such a proposed court, and an overview of the projects and the urgency of its realization. 
According to Abrami, there’s:
– A growing need for a coherent and coordinated body of legal regulations, bringing more restrictive limitations  in human activities that are inherently dangerous for the ecosystems.
– The adoption of transnational investigations and jurisdictional instruments meant to enforce environmental protection.
Abrami says:
It is necessary to consider the development of the “thirst” for knowledge of preventive and repressive measures within a system of Justice that prescribes effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.
Among other things, he asks:
Whether, and in what terms, great environmental disasters which destroyed eco-systems and /or human lives can fall under the category of Crimes Against Humanity?
I guess that means; “you mess with them bats, then you’re messing with the EU Justice”. That’s pretty radical. I certainly would not want to be that poor bloke who messed up on that BP platform.
Abrami is definitely calling for a draconian, radical clampdown for environmental protection. But in the hearing’s record I see no mention of clamping down on scepticism. I’m not a lawyer and I didn’t dissect the text. Maybe someone else will find something I missed.
In the meantime, I guess I can keep blogging without feeling like a criminal.

Last Friday the German edition RIA NOVOSTI Russian news agency reported that there were five clusters of sunspots on the sun, leading some scientists to believe that the sun’s unusual lull may be over for good.
Scientists have been observing sunspots for hundreds of years. Many believe solar activity has a major impact on the earth’s climate on a decadal scale.
As a rule, the number of sunspots is considered to be the main criteria for solar activity: the higher the number of sunspots, the higher the activity.
But Sergei Bogatchov of the Lebedev Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences says that this correlation is not exact. Over the last 10 years, the highest number of sunspots occurred on January 24, 2002 – 19 clusters of spots were registered. Yet these sunspots led to only three weak solar eruptions. The most powerful solar eruption in recent history occurred on November 4, 2003 when only 4 clusters were present on the sun, reports Ria Novosti.
Last February there were 22 eruptions – 4 were powerful. Since then the sun has been in a stupor. According to Bogatchov the current sunspots show very little energy.  Today’s sun image, see above, is again relatively inactive.
When will this solar cycle reach it’s maximum?

Ria Novosti writes that according to Bogatchov, this cycle’s maximum was already pushed back to mid 2013 earlier this year, meaning the cycle is extended from 11 to 12 years. Bogatchov says:
If nothing happens in the next months ahead, then the expected maximum will have to be pushed back once again.
Source: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SolarCycle/
Source: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SolarCycle/
Judging NOAA’s latest sunspot tracking chart above, pushing back the date of the expected peak will likely happen sooner than later, and the length of the current cycle will be thus extended well beyond 12 years. Compare it to their original prediction back in 2007:

Now that’s quite a difference. We were projected to be at about 100 by now. But we’re only at about 20, well below their low projection! Scientists and policymakers really ought to start taking notice, as the chances that they are planning for the completely wrong scenario are becoming inescapable.
Recent studies have shown that Europe’s winters are especially harsh when solar activity is low. If that holds, get ready for some tough winters ahead. Last winter may have been just a preview of what’s coming. Stay tuned for more details on this elsewhere!

Calamitologist at work.
Last week I asked readers to submit their own essays: Wanted! Readers As Guest Writers. Well, I’m happy to present the first one! Ed Caryl observes that skeptics tend to have more training and real life experience in the art of forecasting than warmists do. So who should we believe? Yeah, it’s a tough question. 
   
Chicken Little Was A Calamitologist 
By Ed Caryl 
Many writers have been unsatisfied with the terms used to classify the two sides of the climate debate. Warmist and skeptic seem unsatisfying for the first, and demeaning for the second. The warmist label is also a bit narrow, in that those on that side also preach ocean rise and acidification, severe storms, floods and droughts (on alternate days), and other disasters. Many of these predictions take on a “the sky is falling” tone. The warmists call themselves climatologists, but that term is a job description, not a degree. A better description would be calamitologist – one who envisions climate calamities. Let’s look at a few resumes of some famous calamitologists. 
Dr. Michael Mann: received his Doctorate from Yale, the Department of Geology and Geophysics in 1998. His undergraduate degrees are in Physics and Math.
Dr. Phil Jones: holds a BA degree in Environmental Sciences from the University of Lancaster, and a Masters and PhD from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
Dr. James Hansen: holds a BA degree in Physics and Mathematics, an MS in Astronomy, and a PhD in Physics, all from the University of Iowa. Early in his career he spent almost 20 years studying Venus. His calamitologist creds are based on that work.
Dr. R. K. Pachauri: studied at North Carolina State University, where he obtained an MS in Industrial Engineering in 1972, a PhD in Industrial Engineering and a PhD in Economics, a native of India.
Dr. Gavin Schmidt: BA (Hons) in Mathematics at Jesus College, Oxford University, PhD in Applied Mathematics at University College London.

The calamitologists, we notice, tend not to be trained and experienced in the actual science of forecasting. Just the seasonal forecast track record of the Met Office says it all. 
What about the other side, the skeptics?
Many among the “skeptics” are meteorologists who, unlike most calamitologists, are formally trained in forecasting and have gathered years of experience doing so. Some examples: 
Dr. Roy Spencer: B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Michigan; M.S. and Ph.D. in Meteorology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
Joe Bastardi: BS in Meteorology from Penn State University, a practicing meteorologist with AccuWeather.
Anthony Watts: practicing meteorologist, AMS Seal holder.
Joe D’Aleo: Weather Channel founder, practicing meteorologist.
Dr. Richard S. Lindzen: Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A.B in Physics, S.M. in Applied Mathematics, Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Harvard 
These are just a few of the names known in this controversy, but can you see the trend? Although the calamitologists have advanced degrees, usually in natural sciences, they lack training and experience in forecasting. That’s probably the reason why they often forecast long-shot calamity scenarios. 
On the other hand, the meteorologists are real forecasters, and their success depends on the accuracy of their forecasts. Every time they make a forecast, they put their reputations on the line. Sure, some will argue, weather forecasting is not the same. But if you can’t forecast a week or two ahead, can you reliably forecast 50 or 100 years ahead? Be honest. 
Indeed the more a person is trained in the science of forecasting, the more skeptical they appear to become of the AGW hypothesis and the ability for models to predict longterm climate. Real forecasters seriously doubt CAGW. 
Perhaps in the future we ought to refer to the two sides as calamitologists and real forecasters.

1. Models run too hot and yield “unrealistically high” estimates of the climate’s sensitivity to CO2 forcing.
McKitrick and Christy, 2020
“All model runs warmed faster than observations in the lower troposphere and midtroposphere, in the tropics, and globally. On average, and in most individual cases, the trend difference is significant.”
“[W]e present evidence that the distribution of ECS [equilibrium climate sensitivity] values across the model is unrealistically high.”
2. Models can’t decide if cloud feedbacks are positive or negative. Half think they’re positive, the other half negative.
Block et al., 2020
“Very intriguing is however, that 7 out of 13 models show positive ΔR [cloud feedbacks] in the Arctic while the other 6 have negative values. This implies that half of the models analyzed here simulate local runaway climate systems in which the gain of energy is larger than the loss of energy if advection is not taken into account. These models increase the initial radiative perturbation rather than to reduce it. On the other hand, models exhibiting little warmings tend to be dominated by the negative Planck feedback and can be brought back to radiative balance without the contribution of advection.”
3. Long-term climate (rainfall) projections are “dubious” and almost “non-informative,”  calling into question their “theoretical and practical relevance.”
Iliopoulou and Koutsoyiannis, 2020

“A relevant case study by Lee and Ouarda (2010) concluded that predictions of decadal streamflow extremes using the NAO as a covariate were impacted by large uncertainty to the point of almost being non-informative.”
“From a systematic investigation of long-term rainfall records, corroborated by simulation results, we have verified that local trends have poor out-of-sample performance, being outperformed in their predictions by simpler models, as the local mean. This empirical finding suggests that the large inherent variability present in the rainfall process makes the practice of extrapolating local features in the long-term future dubious, especially when the complexity of the latter increases. This in turn questions the theoretical and practical relevance of projections of rainfall trends and the grounds of the related abundant publications.”

4. Contrary to climate model claims that warming induces perpetually rising positive feedbacks with water vapor, producing even more warming, the observed “buoyancy effect” suggests higher atmospheric water vapor means outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is enhanced, not reduced. This negative water vapor feedback stabilizes the Earth’s climate and prevents runaway warming.
Yang and Seidel, 2020
“We propose that the vapor buoyancy effect can increase Earth’s OLR and helps stabilize Earth’s climate by regulating the atmosphere’s thermal structure. Figure 1 shows the temperature and virtual temperature (buoyancy) fields in the moisture space from 2°S to 2°N using NASA AIRS data. In the free troposphere (p < 850 hPa), buoyancy is horizontally uniform because of the small Cori olis parameter and efficient gravity waves (Charney 1963; Bretherton and Smolarkiewicz 1989; Sobel et al. 2001; Yang 2018a). However, temperature increases toward dry columns due to the vapor buoyancy effect. Moving toward the dry columns, moisture and its associated vapor buoyancy are reduced. To maintain uniform buoyancy, temperature has to increase.”
“Although there is no such constraints in the boundary layer, we can assume that ∆T = 0 at the surface temperature because of the uniform sea surface temperature (SST). We, therefore, require ∆T equals ∆TW BG in the free troposphere but smoothly decays to 0 at surface: ease with climate warming due to increasing atmospheric moisture, leading to enhanced OLR over the dry area. This is a negative feedback which can help to stabilize Earth’s climate.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA survey on climate science views conducted at Hans von Storch’s blogsite klimazwiebel has yielded some interesting results. Though the survey sampled only a small group of persons and not conducted scientifically, the klimazwiebel claims to be: “the only site which is almost equally well attended by skeptics and warmists, etc. Another factor that may help retrieve quite useable data is the good geographical distribution of survey attendees.”
Some findings:
1. The survey showed only a weak correlation between belief in AGW and political orientation.
2. Of all those counted, more than three quarters were non-alarmist, i.e. either lukewarmer, sceptic or denier.

The online Manure Manager Magazine (essential literature when debunking anthropogenic global warming science) reports here that the Pacific Legal Foundation has filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas “endangerment” finding under the Clean Air Act because the agency did not submit the proposed finding to independent scrutiny by its Scientific Advisory Board.
Excerpts of the Pacific Legal Foundation release now follow:
The SAB is a panel of top scientists from universities, research institutions, and other highly regarded organizations, empowered by federal law to review any new “criteria document, standard, limitation, or regulation” that EPA proposes to issue under the Clean Air Act.

At issue is the EPA’s finding, announced in December, 2009, that “greenhouse gas” emissions from automobiles pose a danger to public health and welfare.
Even though courts have held that endangerment findings are ‘regulations’ – and therefore must be reviewed by the Scientific Advisory Board – EPA dismissed PLF’s request and refused to allow review of its CO2 endangerment finding,”said Hadzi-Antich, attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation.
Hadzi-Antich adds:
The purpose of this lawsuit is to force EPA to obey the law and to ensure the integrity of the regulatory process. EPA cannot be allowed to evade the scrutiny and accountability that federal law requires.
EPA’s cavalier approach to regulation is especially outrageous when the economy is struggling and unemployment is at the highest levels in decades.
The greenhouse gas ruling could unleash a torrent of command-and-control regulations across the economy. Potentially, every activity that emits CO2 could be subject to new federal restrictions – from a steel manufacturing facility to a neighborhood pizza shop, and everything in between.
EPA cannot be allowed to impose a crippling burden on the economy by ignoring checks and balances, and shielding its regulatory process from legally required outside review.
————————————————————————————-
Expect the EPA to get lawsuits from all sides, as it should. This is an overzealous power-grab by an out-of-control regulatory agency. It’s time  to rein it in. Contact the: Pacific Legal Foundation.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany people In Europe are now installing ground surface lights in their gardens to add a little flair to their evening patio parties. But now one German blog called Frischer Wind  (fresh wind) is a bit upset about it, calling such lights senseless and useless.
After all, all they do is throw light up into the dark night sky.

You see, these lights are already widely used in pedestrian zones, parks and plazas. They also provide much architectural flair to mansions, like around the swimming pool. They look great.
Unfortunately, a lot of regular folks are now picking them up at home centres and hardware stores and installing them in their humble backyards – because they too also want a taste of what it’s like to live as the rich and wealthy do. You know, like how Hollywood and elitist activists live.
Well, we can’t have all these regular folks doing that, now can we?
According to Christian Reinboth at Frischer Wind blog, it’s all a big waste that’s getting out of hand. This type of lighting contributes nothing except for illumination pollution. That’s right – there’s now too much lighting at night. To prove his point, he sets up a DIALux simulation series to demonstrate the inefficiency of these lamps by measuring ULRs (upward light ratios).

In the simulation, the illumination of a light mounted on a mast is supplemented by five 70-watt ground-surface lamps space 1 meter apart. The finding:
  The 5 ground-surface lamps contribute quite exactly nothing to the illumination of the area.
Horrors! In another scenario Reinboth determines:
…only 0.5% of the light emitted by the lamp serves as illumination – the rest is wasted directly into the night sky.
So be warned. Get them while you can. Already Edison’s light bulb is on the verge of being banned in the USA. In Europe everything 60W and above is already banned, and in a few years all incandescent bulbs will be illegal (I’ve stashed a good number of them away, so there!).  Next it’ll be the “senseless and useless” ground-surface lights, no matter what type they are. After all, they only consume energy and pollute the night skies with light.
There’s no end to possible illumination regulation. Lights can do so many horrible things. If the light colour is wrong, they attract and endanger poor little night insects, or they can cause glare, and they consume energy, which leads to climate change. The regulation is only beginning. The Dark Ages are about to return.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUpdate: Der Spiegel (English version) has a report on the US elections. This news magazine, which believes in the junk science of manmade global warming and the sustainability of socialism, now says:
German editorialists digested the news on Thursday and warned that both Republicans and Democrats were right to feel uneasy.
In the elitist established medía in Germany, “digested” is not the right word, Better and more accurate would be “vomited”. They are utterly horrified of and shaking at the thought of the American tea party movement and pro-life Palin.

After hearing Karl Rove out himself and his GOP Establishment yesterday, I realise that the GOP is still that snobby country club after all. Rove didn’t hold back attacking Christine O’Donnell for her financial problems and crapping all over her. Egads, voters – she’s like the rest of you other struggling Americans! You want her to represent you!
The GOP Establisment is hardly better than the condescending millionaire elitists on the Democrats side, Hollywood, James Cameron, Wall Street, Al Gore, media etc. – all preaching us to sacrifice, while they themselves live high on the hog.
Well, I’ve got a message for BOTH SIDES:

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is global warming, says the NOAA
Remember all those reports about how snow in the wintertime would be so seldom that it would be exciting, permafrost would melt, and palm trees possibly spreading to northern Europe? This all due to AGW. Well, according to the prominent online Sueddeutsche Zeitung (South German News), there’s been some, errr, adjustments to climate models, or something. Forget all them warming scenarios. The Suddeutsche Zeitung reports today the following:
Climate change could lead to especially cold winters to precisely large industrial nations in Europe, North America and Asia. The cause of all this is the irreversible disappearance of Arctic ice, says James Overland of the American weather adminstration NOAA.
and Overland is quoted as saying:
Cold and snowy winters will become more the rule than the exception.
Overland made these comments last Friday at a conference at the end of the International Polar Year in Oslo. Last winter was just a taste of what could possibly happen in Europe and in the USA.
Overland says that a warmer Arctic polar region leads to the development of stable cold highs in the north, which in turn pump cold Arctic air down to the middle latitudes, which include Germany, Great Britain and France.
Normally European countries are supplied with warmer, more moist Atlantic air that keeps winters on the mild side. But in the future, cold will predominate.
So take note all you tree-hugging Europeans: global warming means cold harsh winters. Don’t forget we told you so! It all fits with catastrophic AGW. Yes, it sounds crazy, but that’s what it is. So If some wacked out denialist brings up cold winters as an argument to refute AGW, then just tell them that to the contrary, it just proves AGW!
Update:
One Süddeutsche Zeitung reader Reinhard Boesch reacts, like many others, as follows:
I’ve been reading for 20 years now in the science section of your paper about the climate catastrophe, the greatest catastrophe in human history. This was fully supported by Graßl, Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf, with your editors prophesising red-hot summers, rainy winters and the end of skiing below elevations of 1500m. The fundamental science underpinning these claims was beyond doubt (settled) and anyone who dared to challenge the science was first labelled as a climate sceptic, then as a denier, and finally marginalised as a flatearther. But now it’s going to get colder because it’s getting warmer. Perhaps we should handle science reports like stock reports – ignore them and just take them as they come.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLockdowns lead to major collateral damage. 
Dr. Ulrich Keck called in on a German ARD public television talk show to express his views on the new lockdown that has just been imposed across Germany.

According to the German dentist (65), the lockdowns are causing more harm than the disease itself due to the added massive poverty they are causing globally.
He claims the “collateral damage” is being completely ignored.
“For example, 15,000 children die of hunger every day on the planet, now it’s 30,000 because the paths to supply them have been interrupted,” says Keck. He characterizes the German lockdown as completely unnecessary because the country has plenty of intensive care beds available. Keck then pleads for an end to the panic spreading.
At the end Keck concludes: “When you sacrifice freedom for security, you end up with neither.”

Share this...FacebookTwitter{Note 15 August 2010: Joe has replaced his Penn State post with a new post, and so you can no longer read it.]Anyone who reads this blog knows that meteorologist Joe Bastardi is one of my favorites. Yesterday he wrote a scathing piece at his European blog about his alma mater Penn State for the way it whitewashed the Michael Mann affair, and other things.
Joe Bastardi is a graduate of Penn State, receiving a degree in Meteorology and is a leading Accuweather meteorologist. His seasonal forecasts almost always far outperform those of “climate scientists”. It’s because Joe knows what he’s talking about, the “climate scientists” don’t. A Penn State investigation of Michael Mann, author of the infamous hockey stick graph, led to his exoneration, much to the protest of the scientific community. Many called the investigation a whitewash. Bastardi agrees. At his blog he writes:
Though I have a degree from the once proud and great meteorology department, it was EARNED during its glory day, when we graduated 2/3rds of the worlds meteorologists, and were the envy of other schools. That was yesterday, and yesterdays gone.
and says:
Penn State has lost its way.
I will no longer refer to myself as a Penn State grad, nor promote the university in my appearances.
That’s pretty heavy. And if you still don’t think Joe is ashamed of Penn State, read on:

One cannot imagine the betrayal I feel at the hands of this university. AND THAT SAYS IT ALL.
The fact is the university I busted my tail for, and defended all these years, is complicit in not only advancing an agenda driven matter in the name of “science” but also trying to suppress freedom of independent, rational thinking. Its that simple.
Joe is not alone. Many share his opinion. He writes:
And believe me, there are many.. legion, that graduated PSU through the 90s that feel the same way I do.
Joe will no longer remaim silent, and that’s good. We need more figures like Joe to speak out and express a dissent that is more necessary now than ever.
I also feel a little bit that way about my own alma mater, the University of Arizona, where one of Mann’s colleagues is a professor – but thankfully not at the College of Engineering and Mines, where I studied and got my Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering. I can imagine that this has got to be really tough for Joe to do.
Write to Joe to express your support: bastardi@accuweather.com. I think he’ll appreciate it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe future for the backbone of the German economy is looking bleak. A look at the impacts of climate policy on the German car industry.
===============================================
By AR Göhring at EIKE
(Text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
Not only at Daimler, Volkswagen and others, but elsewhere the working people have to fear for their jobs after Brussels and Berlin have declared war on Germany’s most important industry. Now the automotive supply chain is also being hard hit.
Berlin, Brussels tighten the screws
The value-adding industry has already been badly shaken by the exaggerated, simply senseless corona measures of the Merkel IV government. Now the Brussels EU government (including former German minister Ursula von der Leyen) are tightening the screws even more as they love to ban internal combustion engines completely. The EU has just tightened the rules for limiting CO2 emissions. Not only the well-known car manufacturers are under pressure, but also their suppliers, hardly known by name, such as Mahle from Stuttgart.
Mass job losses

The globally producing parts manufacturer still has around 12,000 employees in Germany (72,000 globally). In the country, 2,000 workers are expected to lose their jobs, globally 7,600, and this despite a partial switch to e-car parts. It’s not enough, says a works council member, because there is no concept for the domestic combustion engine factories to convert over to electrical parts.
E-mobility not economically feasible
Why should there be, one might ask, since hardly anyone is buying e-cars anyway? Significant sales figures can only be achieved through massive tax incentives, but the government cannot keep this up forever. In other words, a complete “transformation” to e-mobility cannot be economically feasible.
It would make sense to downsize existing locations and let them settle for the winter. Only develop and produce burners in climate fanaticism-proof countries like Russia, Mexico and possibly the USA. As soon as Merkel’s energy transition in Germany crashes for all to feel and a rationally acting government comes to the helm again, the locations could be rebuilt and production could be brought back.
Highly skilled workers risk going idle
The problem is that machines and buildings are only a part of the company portfolio. The most important factor of a medium-sized manufacturer, however, is its skilled workforce, whose skills, acquired and honed over decades, are not so easily exported or imported. So Mahle and Co. would have to send their Swabian skilled workers with good programs and a lot of money to a safe foreign country for a few years. Is that possible? With difficulty. Home, mortgage, children, school, friends, family … skilled workers are people.
Mahle is unfortunately not the only supplier who is being needlessly driven out or exiled by the misguided caste of the political media. Well-known companies such tire manufacturer Continental will also have to take massive hits – Continental plans to cut 30,000 jobs worldwide.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA couple a days ago I reported on how the German media has hardly been reporting on global warming. Read here.
That should be no surprise because it’s been cold in Germany over the last 3 months, and so reporting on warming planet would only draw chuckles from the public. After all, August was cool and September in Germany was a 0.9″ C colder than normal – the 26th coldest September since 1900, according to the German Weather Service. Many have been heating their homes for 2 months already.
October is looking even worse. Already we’ve had widespread light frost and many places have already gotten snow, You hear nothing about this in the German lamestream media, though. Winter is weeks early.
At the online German Auto Reporter Net, Wolfram Riedel pokes fun at the climate panic purveyors and their deafensing silence.
Silence is everywhere in the media, not a warmist is stirring. All the excitement caused by the climate madness has taken a break. And why? Because the real-life weather which we’ve been experiencing over the last several weeks simply isn’t suitable for spreading global warming panic through the population.  September and October have been colder than normal, and even the first snow has already arrived.
There were some hot days last summer, and so the climate panic purveyors had an easier time painting the devil on the wall, who happens to be surrounded in a cloud of evil CO2.
And how do the coming months look? Also very cold.
The German media reported yesterday that towns and cities are stockpiling road salt because, says the media, “meteorologists are forecasting a harsh winter”.
Last year, having relied on the “rare and exciting winters” forecasts of  made by climatologists, towns ran out of salt already in early January. This year they’re listening to real forecasters – meteorologists.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite all the media über-hype about this year’s “weather extremes”, which are normal to begin with, and the upcoming Cancun Conference, the German index of public interest on climate protection fell yet again during the 3rd quarter of 2010, from 56 to 55, according to the co2online GmbH, a program set up by the German Ministry for the Environment.
Public interest in climate protection continues to wane in Germany.
The reason for the drop was due to the lack of interest by the media in reporting on climate change. The public is bored by the topic.
The Climate Barometer is published every quarter and is based on the evaluation of 4 indicators, which are converted to form the Climate Barometer index.
Experts complained about the continued wane in public interest. Thomas Hirsch of the organisation: Bread for the World:

In the energy debate, climate protection is an issue that was very much overshadowed by the recent issue of nuclear power in Germany.

Prof Dr Stefan Rahmstorf, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research:

Flooding in Pakistan and heatwave in Russia brought the topic in the media, but incredibly little. There is hardly any discussion on the causes of such extreme events.

I can’t help Mr Hirsch, but perhaps I can give Dr Rahmstorf, Prince of Panic, some background on extreme weather events and their causes.
Source: http://www.coaps.fsu.edu/~maue/tropical/global_running_ace.jpg
Cyclones globally are near record lows and have been falling 20 years. Thus it can’t be because of global warming. So get a life Dr Rahmstorf. You’re fooling no one.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThings have really gotten desperate for the CAGWists also here in Germany. That’s what a little Climategate and Germany’s coldest winter in 46 years can do to a junk-science theory.
Dirk Maxeiner brings up a piece appearing in the German online Frankfurter Rundschau titled: Campaign of Lies McCarthy Style Click here!
The piece describes how more than 250 scientists, among them 11 Nobel Prize recipients, have expressed their outrage in a letter published in Science claiming they’ve been the targets of McCarthy-like attacks. The Frankfurter Rundschau says the attacks are coming from “Konservative Think-Tanks” and “Republikaner”, among them the Heartland Institute, and James Inhofe, all designed to “torpedo the urgently needed climate protection measures”, and blah blah blah.
The tone of the piece of course is that sceptics are bad and the warmists are good. The piece also heavily bemoans the rapidly eroding public concerns of AGW as an issue, and asks: Who’s behind all that irresponsible scepticism?
Prof Hans Joachim Scellnhuber, an IPCC lead author, explains it for them. Here’s the text in German, then followed by the translation in English:

Der Potsdamer Klimaforscher Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Mitunterzeichner des Science-Briefs, hält den Einfluss der Skeptiker in Deutschland für geringer als in den USA. Es handele sich dabei um sehr unterschiedliche Gruppen, sagte der Präsident des Instituts für Klimafolgen-Forschung der FR. Die meisten operierten ‘aus der sicheren Anonymität des Internets heraus. Sie versuchen erst gar nicht, bei einer sachlichen Debatte erfolgreich zu sein, sondern vielmehr grundsätzliche Zweifel an der Wissenschaft als Instrument der Wirklichkeitserklärung zu säen.” Damit fänden sie große Sympathie “bei vielen antiaufklärerischen Kräften’.
In English:
Potsdam climate researcher Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, a signatory of the Science Letter, thinks the sceptics in Germany have less influence than in the USA. They involve very different groups, the Director of the Institute for Climate Impact Research told the Frankfurter Rundschau. Most of them ‘operate from the safety of anonymity in the internet. They don’t try at all to do it successfully through a factual debate; rather they attempt to sow scepticism on science being an instrument to explain reality.’  This is how they gain much sympathy ‘from the many forces of anti-science’.
In Schellnhuber’s world, scepticism is anti-science. And if you doubt their science, then you are anti-science.
Oh, by the way, let’s not forget that reality and science for them are doctored up iStock polar bear photos and manipulated temperature curves. And who are the ones who keep running and hiding from debate?
What about the polar bear photo in the Frankfurter Rundschau piece? The caption reads: “Polar bears searching for food”. But at least that photo, as far as I can tell, hasn’t been doctored.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier this year in spring, the WMO and others warned of another record hot summer and drought. The German media went bonkers in response warning that 2020 could even be hotter and drier than the 2018 and 2019 summers.
But now that the meteorological summer (June 1 – August 31) has ended, the data show that these earlier predictions were WRONG.
Germany’s DWD national weather service, having tabulated data from some 2000 stations nationwide, has issued its preliminary report for the summer of 2020. The results: a near normal summer.
Only 1°C warmer than normal
According to the DWD,  the summer of 2020 was often variable, seeing only short periods of heat and that it was not until August that the midsummer “turned up the heat” for a spell of about 10 days.
With a mean of 18.2 °C, the summer of 2020 across Germany was was 1.1 C above the mean of the 1981 to 2010 period. In July, many locations did not see the thermometer reach even 30°C.
Only in August did a heat wave lasting several days see temperatures over 35°C.

Overall near normal rainfall
With an average of around 230 liters per square meter (l/m²) of precipitation nationwide, summer 2020 fell only slightly short of its long term mean of 239 l/m², the DWD reports. Thus the projection of a continued extreme drought such as seen in 2018 and 2019 failed to appear.
Some regions, such as the Uckermark, the Leipzig lowland bay, Saarland and along the Rhine, saw less than half of the typical rainfall. At the same time, there were continuous rainfalls, such as in early August in Upper Bavaria with up to 150 l/m² in 24 hours, which also brought flooding. In total, over 700 l/m² were measured in the Alps over the summer.
10% more sunshine (hence a bit warmer)
At around 675 hours, the sunshine duration in summer exceeded its long-term mean of 614 hours by around 10 percent. The coastal regions recorded over 700 hours of sunshine. In the western low mountain ranges, however, the DWD measured only 500 hours.
“Summer 2020 was completely normal”
Die kalte Sonne here summarizes Germany’s summer of 2020: “Summer 2020 was completely normal in terms of precipitation, including regional differences. One could have wished for an abnormally humid one after the dry years 2018 and 2019, but weather is not about wishful thinking. When it comes to precipitation (which is first and foremost decisive for drought), there has been no remarkable trend. Everything else you hear is not based on facts.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterA heat wave in Russia, a flood in Pakistan and a calving glacier in Greenland were enough to trigger mass hysteria in Germany. The warmists pulled out their hair, socialites fainted, re-insurers went bezerk and the German media screamed bloody climate murder. Really.
Meanwhile the rest of Germany relaxed on their long holidays and yawned. So it’s only fitting that somebody step up and offer a message of calm to the bedwetters.
German online Die Welt has a piece by Ulli Kulke titled Enough with the Panic Slogans of Climate Chaos. It’s an attempt to deliver a message of calm and reason, one that is sorely needed by Germany’s irrational media.
First he explains that this year was a warm one, but so was 12 years ago – 1998, due to a strong El Nino effect. And he points out that the blazing heat in the northern hemispehere strangely could not stop Arctic sea ice from increasing in size compared to the years before. The Antarctic sea ice is growing too.

But, writes Kulke, has a lot to do with other factors other than temperature, namely precipitation and wind conditions, Kulke writes:
The Arctic ice is not a suitable instrument as a thermometer for measuring global climate, for warming or cooling.
Also Kulke points out that the media already proclaiming the year to be the hottest on record, long before it’s finished, has become an annual media event in Germany. Kulke writes:

When you look back at the archives, you’ll find that a lot of years were declared the all-time warmest already when just one or two especially warm months were measured. At the end of the year, of course, they turned out not to be the hottest. That has occurred year after year since 1998, which, according to measurements, was the hottest in over 100 years. This has contributed to warming inflation in the minds of the people.

And what about all the natural catastrophes occurring this summer? Is there a connection with climate change? Kulke rightfully points out that there’s no statistical evidence of this when one looks back at decades of records. It was not long ago, 2005, when many claimed hurricanes like Katrina were proof of global warming. Since then hurricanes have been almost off the radar.
Concerning the Russian fires, Kulke writes:

Also the fires in Russia were not examples. Their extent this year was not more than in previous years. To the contrary, the only (deadly) difference: this year the fires occurred near metropolis Moscow and thus got more interest from the international media.

Even in famous magazine New Scientist climate scientists have shown that solar activity was responsible for the blocking weather patterns that led to the extremes in Russia and Pakistan. Kulke writes:

In fact, the situation in Pakistan actually contradicts the popular version of climate scientists. They’ve always claimed that monsoons were especially weak in South Asia during El-Nino years, with droughts even occurring. This year that’s not the case, as is clear looking at the awful images shown on TV every evening. No drought there this El Nino year.

Finally Kulke advises those looking for weather records to go to Ham Weather, where you’ll find that weather records, hot and cold, occur every day, every week, every year…after year, after year, after year. That’s nature.
But don’t expect a change from the German media. Words of reason probably will not cure their incontinence.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a just published 43-page paper, leading scientists and professors are calling for a completely new direction in climate policy after what they call “The Crash of 2009”. http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/mackinderProgramme/pdf/HartwellPaper07052010.pdf
This was made public this morning by Dr Reiner Grundmann, one of the paper’s authors, at http://klimazwiebel.blogspot.com.
In its Executive Summary, the paper states that climate policy “has failed to produce any discernable real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years”, adding:
…UNFCCC/Kyoto model was structurally flawed and doomed to fail because it systematically misunderstood the nature of climate change as a policy issue between 1985 and 2009.
In my view this paper reveals that many scientists and policymakers are now realising what many of us already knew: Radical regulation and taxation of carbon is not going to work. The paper proposes a much watered down version of what governments, interest groups and activists were previously pushing for. Its authors are still calling for a tranformation in energy supply and consumption, but in a more measured and targeted approach using low taxes and through the development of unsubsidised energy sources.
The authors say of their paper:
It explains radical and practical ways to reduce non-CO2 human forcing of climate. It argues that improved climate-risk management is a valid policy goal, and is not simply congruent with carbon policy.
Well at least governments now have an option: they can continue to allow energy policy to be formulated and driven by zealots, or they can hand the job over to the lukewarmers, who are promising a less painful approach, one that respects human dignity.

I remember seeing Gallup polls listing Global Warming and Environment separately, and almost always near the bottom on the list of concerns. But I don’t ever recall GW being relegated to obscurity – but maybe I’m wrong here. Anyway the “climate crisis”, as Gore likes to call it, is not even among the top 10  concerns for Americans. Here are the latest Gallup poll results.

Maybe global warming has been lumped in under Environment, along with air and water pollution, littering, lawnmower noise and plastic bags.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his latest video , Joe Bastardi gives his latest hurricane forecast.
Joe compares 2010 with 1950, a year the hurricane season started off late, but then did so with a vengeance. It produced 8 major hurricanes in 6 weeks. He sees 2010 having very similar conditions, and so he predicts the same pattern as 1950.
Joe also explains his theory that with global warming, the tendency will be less tropical storm activity because there will be less of a need to redistribute heat and pressure to the higher latitudes. That’s what hurricanes do.
So far for this year, Joe says:
Yet, we’ve had globally the weakest start to a hurricane season, Pacific basin and Atlantic basin, through the month of August so far. It’s just astounding how quiet it’s been – so far.
Joe doesn’t expect it to stay quiet. He’s telling you to fasten your seatbelt, because we are very likely in for some rough riding.

The press frets: Where are the hurricanes?

Meanwhile the generally sceptic Austrian online Die Presse has a story called Weather: Were Are The Hurricanes?  (Notice how when the hurricanes don’t show up, it’s called “weather”. Die Presse quotes the NOAA:
There are no tropical cyclones at this time.
What can the alarmist media do without the promised hurricanes and the calamity they deliver? Die Presse writes:
They should have arrived a long time ago. The hurricane season goes from June 1 until November 30, and the fanfare from the US press was shriller than usual back in May: It’s the five-year anniversary of Katrina, the storm that devastated New Orleans. ‘The 2010 hurricane season could be a monster, warned Time on May 26.
Die Presse explains that weak hurricane activity last year was due to the El Nino blocking effect. But this year La Nina is developing, and so the coast is clear for the hurricane parade. But the media so far has fretted:
Now El Niño is out of the way, La Niña rules and clears the path for hurricanes. First came one, Alex, in June, followed by Bonnie in July, which did not even reach hurricane status, and Colin in early August, which also amounted to nothing.
But the media ought not fret too much. If Joe is right, the chasers of destruction in the media will get plenty to hyperventilate about soon enough. Then they’ll be categorising hurricanes under “climate”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Krüger of Readers Edition has a post on Germany’s first offshore Alpha Ventus windpark located in the North Sea, 30 miles from shore. Alpha Ventus has 12 5-MW wind generators. The electricity will have to cost 7 – 8  US-cents per kwh just to cover the construction costs. That’s about the price electricty is traded at on German commodity markets. But then you have to add the operating, maintenance and dismantling costs after the expected 20 years of operation. Also the added cost of expanding the electrical grid to accommodate the wind parks has to be added in.
In general windparks cannot compete against conventional power plants. That’s why the German government subsidizes windpark operators and guaratees them 19 US cents per kwh. The higher costs are of course borne by the consumers and industrial customers.
Contribution to “climate protection”. So what is the consumer getting for his money? Using IPCC data and forcings, Krüger calculated how much Alpha Ventus will help to reduce the global temperature:
Without the assumed positive feedbacks: 0.000001°C,  with the assumed positive feedbacks 0.000005°C.
That’s right – a whopping few millionths of a degree! Boy can you feel it already?
Protest: The offshore windparks also kill a considerable number of migratory birds, and so environmentalists are already protesting the planned construction of 11 additional offshore parks. Indeed a Folks’ Initiative protest against wind energy is taking place in Berlin this coming weekend: http://www.volksinitiativewindrad.de/.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe reduction in phytoplankton is not due to oceanic warming, but instead to overfishing. Guest writer Ed Caryl digs into the subject of phytoplankton.

The Phytoplankton Are Starving
By Ed Caryl
A recent press release from Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, announced an article published in Nature (behind a pay-wall) that we’ve been losing 1% of our phytoplankton each year dating back to 1899, meaning 40% since 1950. The article blames it on ocean warming. The article was discussed in July on WUWT and here. Let’s pull our heads back a bit more and look beyond warming.
Why are phytoplankton important?
Phytoplankton or algae are single-celled, photosynthesizing creatures at the “bottom” of the ocean food chain. They take in sunlight and CO2 and produce carbohydrates, just like plants do on land. They are the source of the biomass that all larger animals and fish feed upon. Without them, life in the ocean would not exist. Yet, much of the literature makes no mention of any dependence in the other direction, i.e. phytoplankton depend on the creatures higher up in the food chain.

Phytoplankton are a hybrid of plant and animal. Some have locomotion capability as if they were single-celled animals. They need the same nutrients as all plants: CO2, nitrogen (as nitrates or ammonia), and phosphorus (as phosphate); iron, zinc and manganese are also needed in trace quantities. When there is an excess of these nutrients, such as in agricultural runoff, “blooms” can occur where runaway reproduction produces so many that during the night when they are not photosynthesizing they can consume all the dissolved oxygen in the water, and thus suffocate themselves and the fish.
Why are phytoplankton disappearing in deep ocean areas?
In the deep ocean, away from nutrient-feeding rivers and streams, the phytoplankton population is generally low. This can be seen in the graphic above from satellite data where blue indicates low chlorophyll.
Upwelling from the deep-ocean delivers nutrients from the bottom and increases the population in areas close to shore where waters are shallow, and where rivers and streams bring nutrients from land. The phytoplankton population seems to have increased in shore areas in recent years, probably due to nutrient runoff from agriculture, while the mid-ocean gyres are still seeing population decreases.
The questions then are:
1) Why is the mid-ocean so generally poor in phytoplankton?
2) Why has the overall phytoplankton population dropped?

Let’s discuss the possibilities: Is increasing CO2 in the atmosphere causing it?
This is unlikely for three reasons. First, CO2 started increasing in a significant way many years after the reduction in phytoplankton started. Second, CO2 is a nutrient that should stimulate growth, not inhibit it. Three, the recent inshore population increase seems to go against the CO2 influence.
Is ocean warming the culprit?
Note that planktons are plentiful in very warm equatorial waters where nutrients are available. Even though the far north and south seem to have more phytoplankton, warm temperatures do not seem to be the limiting factor. Phytoplankton are not a single monolithic species. There are thousands of species of phytoplankton, adapted to various environments, including temperature.  Some phytoplankton also diurnally move vertically in the water column through large temperature gradients.
So, what could be limiting phytoplankton? The likely culprit is the limitation of nutrients. Phytoplanktons are starving in the mid-ocean. Why?
The oceans are mostly a closed ecosystem. Inputs to the system are sunlight and nutrients from rivers and streams. 95% of the biomass in the ocean is phytoplankton. Everything else in the ocean depends directly or indirectly on phytoplankton. Zooplankton: copepods, krill, and shrimp eat phytoplankton. Small fish, such as herring, sardines, and menhaden eat the zooplankton. Large fish eat the small fish. At the top of the food chain are: squid, tuna, salmon, sharks, whales, porpoise, etc…and finally us humans. But remember, this is a closed system. Except for what man removes, everything else recycles in the ocean. Everything in the ocean lives, excretes, dies, or is eaten by something. Even if it falls to the bottom, bacteria, worms, and crabs consume what is left. Only the non-digestible mineral skeletons and exoskeletons remain in the ocean-bottom sediments. Except for what man removes, the nutrients remain in the ocean. And when man does remove those nutrients, it’s forever.
Man’s removal from the oceans
The problem is that we have fished out the oceans. Only 10% of the large fish found in the oceans in 1950 remain. And we have been over-fishing the oceans far longer than just the last 60 years. Even backe in 1950, people were already noticing a reduction in stocks of whales, salmon, cod, halibut, and other fish. We probably have less than 10% of the large fish and whale stocks that were present before we began harvesting the seas in earnest.
Where does the nitrogen that phytoplankton require come from? At the the mid-ocean levels, some comes from nitrogen fixing bacteria, but the rest comes from excrement in the form of urea and ammonia from bacteria breaking down protein as carcasses decompose. Iron, molybdenum, and phosphates come from the same sources. But remember we are removing large amounts of fish protein from the ocean, especially whale, tuna, shark, and other large fish. 90% of what was there is now gone. We are removing more every year. The fish products are no longer available to the phytoplanktons. Their food supply has diminsihed. They are starving.
What does that mean for the carbon cycle?
Why is this important? If we have lost 40% of our phytoplanktons, then we have lost a significant part of the photosynthetic biosphere. Photosynthesis binds 100 to 115 million metric tons of carbon each year. Phytoplanktons are responsible for half the photosynthesis that occurs on the planet. If we have lost 40% of the phytoplanktons, then we have lost 20% of our total photosynthesis capability, or the conversion of more than 20 million metric tons of carbon per year, in carbon dioxide, into oxygen and water. This is a huge loss, but it pales in comparison to a larger loss.
Phytoplanktons have silica and calcium carbonate skeletons. Phytoplanktons are eaten by copepods and other zooplankton, which also have calcium carbonate skeletons and exoskeletons. 40% of the carbon is converted into calcium-carbonate shells and excreta that sink to the bottom, and 60% to dissolved organic carbon originating from flesh. In 1950 planktons were sequestering 16.6 billion metric tons of carbon. Today, planktons convert 10 billion metric tons of carbon. If we have lost 40% of the phytoplanktons since 1950, i.e. 40% of the carbon sequestration capability, then 6.6 billion metric tons of carbon should appear in the atmosphere.
Currently we are adding more than 5.5 billion tons of carbon yearly to the atmosphere from fossil fuel and cement production (here). In 1950, we were adding more than 1.5 billion tons of carbon per year. That’s a 4 billion ton increase. Four billion tons a year is the yearly average atmospheric carbon-in-CO2 increase. But if in that same period, 40% of plankton have starved out, they are no longer sequestering 6.6 billion tons of carbon. These figures don’t agree. This is probably because the plankton loss is not quite 40%, but somewhat below 30%. Still, the plankton loss alone can account for the rising atmospheric CO2 levels.
Maybe it’s time we curtailed eating fish for a while, and focus on consuming poultry, pork or beef.
