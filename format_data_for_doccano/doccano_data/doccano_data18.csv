 **Burn, Hollywood, Burn**  
A regular review by John Black



With the recent release of _Rambo: Last Blood_ and its critical mauling for daring to feature a violent and vengeful 73 year old man (the _Guardian_ called it an ‘enlarged prostate of a movie’; imagine if someone had called _Thelma and Louise_ a ‘diseased uterus of a movie’), I have decided to share my ‘Top 5 Grumpy Old Man Revenge Movies’ as a general ‘up yours’ to such ageist misandry.



My only criteria have been they must feature an old guy (at least 60 years old when the movie was released) with attitude and seeking vengeance of a violent nature. If you have your own suggestions, please let me know in the comments below.



5\. MACHETE



Let’s start with pure popcorn. Danny Trejo was 66 and a jobbing actor with a face like a dropped meat pie when he got his first starring role as ‘machete’ a real mean motor scooter who kills people …with a machete. But only after they really pissed him off by killing his wife in front of him…with a machete. Steven Seagal and (surprisingly) Robert De Niro play the bad guys.



Best moment of old bugger bad arsery: Machete using a guy’s intestinal tract to abseil down a building.



4\. THE LIMEY (1999)



The only one in my list that could be confused with an art film. Former swinging sixties ace face Terence Stamp plays the enigmatic Wilson, a Brit gangster who travels to L.A. to find those responsible for his daughter’s death. Peter Fonda is Terry Valentine, the record producer sleaze whom Wilson thinks is responsible. It’s directed by Steven Soderberg who somehow finds the dark corners of the ever sunny L.A landscape. By the end Wilson is consumed by anger for the person really responsible for his daughter’s death – himself. Won praise at that year’s Cannes – but don’t worry it’s still worth a watch.



Best moment of old bugger bad arsery: Wilson throwing Valentine’s heavy off a hilltop balcony.



3\. THE EQUALIZER



After his prostitute friend Alina is badly beaten by the Russian mafia, retired military intelligence officer McCall (Denzel Washington) takes them apart one vodka swilling goon at a time. That’s it basically. _Very_ loosely inspired by the famous Brit TV series.



Best moment of old bugger bad arsery: in the climactic scene set in a hardware store McCall gets very creative with a nail gun.



4\. HARRY BROWN



Michael Caine is the titular Harry, an ex-royal-marine who takes it personally when his fellow old codger and best mate Len gets it from some yoof on a London housing estate. Harry then sets about his civic duty by gunning down the vicious hoodlums who infest his neighbourhood. The Bill ain’t too happy about that. And neither are the gangsters. Controversial at the time because of Sir Michael’s real life championing of the law and order message of the film – as a former ‘sarf’ Londoner, he was shocked at how the area had declined. Some on the Left were [suddenly of the opinion that actors should keep out of politics](https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/nov/16/michael-caine-ukcrime) – an opinion they seemed to have gotten over since Brexit, Trump, Climate Change etc. and all the luvvies being applauded for following the lefty line. 



Best moment of old bugger bad arsery: Harry giving a drug dealer a lecture on weapon maintenance (‘You have failed to maintain your weapon…son.’) before blowing him into next Thursday.



1\. GRAN TORINO



The platonic ideal of grumpy old men, Clint Eastwood, is Walt Kowalski, a hard-arse retired auto worker alienated from his family and aghast at all the ‘gooks’ moving into his neighbourhood. 



Walt, a Korean vet ends up defending the ‘gook’ family next door when they come under attack from gangbangers. He gives the wayward young man of the house, Thao, a crash course in manliness and together they make a stand against the hoods.



Probably the least violent of my pics but not if you accept the ‘language = violence’ concept of the radical Left. The film is brimming with pretty nasty ethnic slurs – mostly from Walt. There is a hilarious scene in a barber shop where Walt instructs Thao how to relate to other men using egalitarian ethnic jibes that every woke leftist should be forced to watch on a loop until they start voting for Trump. The radical ideas of the movie being that actions matter more than words and that rough working class men can actually be decent blokes. Shocking.



Why is it number one? Because Clint ‘Dirty Harry/The Man With No Name/The Unforgiven’ Eastwood, directed and starred in it, that’s why.



Best moment of old bugger bad arsery: the final confrontation with the gang.

"With kosher and halal food an increasingly common feature of the British high street, a top vet has called for reform of their slaughter practices, calling them inhumane.  These alternative methods of animal slaughter rightly provoke a heated debate about the welfare of farm animals and the ethics of killing them. But is there a humane way of killing animals at all and, if instituted, what would the effects of a ban be in the UK? Research has indicated that, from an animal welfare perspective, the most adverse conditions at the time of killing (pain and stress) can be avoided with the stunning of animals prior to their throats being cut. This requires the correct use of restraining methods and good handling of the animals. Most animal welfare scientists seem to agree that the risk of animal suffering is higher in slaughter without stunning. But there are animal welfare scientists who argue the opposite. Temple Grandin, one of the most eminent animal welfare scientists, asserts that the welfare risks in kosher slaughter (which doesn’t allow stunning) can also be reduced with correct restraining and handling methods.  The recent EU regulation on the protection of animals at the time of killing defines the conditions for “humane killing” for food production. It states that all animals should be made unconscious via stunning before the cut of the throat – with an exemption made for religious slaughter. Currently, the human right of practising religion takes priority over the welfare of animals.  While the stunning of animals before slaughter is incompatible with shechita (the methods approved by Jewish religious authorities), halal slaughter can be performed after the stunning of animals, as long as the stunning is reversible. This is an important distinction because in the UK the demand for halal meat is much bigger than the demand for kosher meat and nearly 80% of all halal certified meat comes from animals that have been stunned prior the cut of the throat. A ban on religious slaughter without stunning in the UK would only mean  more animals will be killed without stunning in other countries and  imported to the UK. From an animal welfare perspective this option can hardly be seen as an improvement. There are other options that could be explored domestically, such as the imposition of post-cut stunning, or, better, the development of techniques of stunning that are compatible with the Jewish religion.  Stunning methods have their disadvantages, a number of issues can occur in the process, including possible miss-stuns, which can be very painful. There is a need for research to develop alternative, ideally non-invasive, stunning methods. Magnetic stunning is one option. Based on passing a large current through a copper coil by which an intense magnetic field is generated, the coil is placed close to the head of an animal to knock them out.  If fully developed, it is a potential technique for stunning animals that could be accepted both in halal and schechita slaughter and could be used in future. Another issue is bridging the gap between animal welfare advocates and religious groups. This is the main area where an effort is needed. The recent EU-funded Dialrel project was dedicated to establishing a dialogue between religious minorities in Europe and scientific authorities in animal welfare. After nearly four years of research and exchange, they listed the best practices for different species that would minimise the stress and pain of animals at time of killing.  These recommendations propose to focus on the most risky aspects of religious slaughter, either performed without stunning or with pre/post-cut stunning. At the end of the project this document was endorsed by a significant number of both Muslim and Jewish religious groups across the continent. It could represent a starting point for further developments in terms of new technologies and better communication between those involved in this debate. But this call for a ban on religious slaughter raises questions about relevance and the proportion of attention it’s getting. Is religious slaughter without stunning the most pressing animal welfare issue in the UK? How does it compare with the prolonged suffering of common conditions such as lameness and mastitis in dairy cows, feather pecking in laying hens and tail biting in pigs? Given the number of animals involved it’s hard to consider religious slaughter as the main animal welfare problem the UK faces. Indeed it is quite remarkable the level of attention that this phenomenon is attracting and, in contrast, the silence surrounding the number of animals in all year round indoor confined systems for food production. While this constantly grows around the world and is expected to more than double between now and 2050, the attention given to religious slaughter without stunning seems somehow out of proportion.

"Russia will almost certainly be barred from this summer’s track and field world championships, global officials for the sport said Monday, citing the nation’s response to its doping scandal, which they called inadequate. The officials met in Monaco on Monday and voted unanimously to maintain the ban on Russian athletes, outlining a timetable under which the nation would not be cleared to compete until November. Until then, individual Russian athletes with robust histories of drug testing may petition to compete as neutral athletes, unassociated with any country, in the world championships, which will take place in August in London, as well as other global events. Officials agreed to exempt Russia’s youngest athletes from the blanket ban, allowing for those under 15 to compete as neutral individuals without filing a special application. Citing a number of issues  —   including ”unhelpful comments” by Russia’s deputy prime minister, Vitaly Mutko limited and problematic drug testing within the country and evidence that an implicated coach had continued to train athletes in spite of having been suspended  —   Rune Andersen, the chairman of a global task force overseeing Russia’s reform, said the nation had not yet met the conditions for reinstatement. Among those conditions is that Russia’s national antidoping agency be fully recertified by the World   Agency, the global regulator of drugs in sports. That agency has suggested it may grant Russia partial certification in May, track officials said Monday, and full certification in November. Only after that point, Mr. Andersen said, would track and field authorities consider restoring Russia to good standing. “The criteria were very clear,” said Sebastian Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, track and field’s global governing body. “They were unambiguous. They were not suffused in politics. ” Mr. Coe and Mr. Andersen said there had been some progress in Russia in recent months, including the election of a new president of Russian track and field, Dmitry Shlyakhtin. They said they had been reassured that Russia would cooperate with France’s continuing criminal investigation, which focuses on bribery and corruption in global track and field, and that the Russian government would provide financial support to national antidoping operations without interfering in them. Mr. Mutko, Russia’s deputy prime minister and former sports minister, has acknowledged broad problems with doping but denied a   system of cheating. Since his promotion by President Vladimir V. Putin last fall, Mr. Mutko has grown increasingly defiant in responding to the mountain of evidence that Russia has systematically doped with government assistance, most notably at the 2014 Sochi Olympics  —   where Russia’s longtime national antidoping lab chief, Grigory Rodchenkov, said he substituted   urine with clean urine. In December, after WADA laid bare the results of a   investigation, Mr. Mutko went so far as to say that female Russian hockey players who competed at the Sochi Games had been found to have male D. N. A. in their urine samples because they had had sex. Scientific experts dismissed that explanation as impossible, calling it clear evidence of sample tampering. Another condition of Russia’s reinstatement highlighted on Monday in Monaco was that the nation’s leadership accept, or credibly rebut, the extensive evidence of   cheating, including the involvement of the sports ministry and Russia’s federal security service, or F. S. B. “The question of apologies is one that we have raised every time we have been to Moscow,” Mr. Andersen said Monday. “In general, I wouldn’t pinpoint any specific person that needs to say apologies,” he said. “But we expect that the Russian community is acknowledging that they have a problem, because only when you acknowledge you have a problem can you do something about it. ” In December, several Russian sports officials told The New York Times they were no longer disputing the cheating schemes that had been uncovered, though they insisted top government officials had no part in them. “Of course it was an institutional conspiracy, but not ” said Anna Antseliovich, the acting director general of Russia’s national antidoping agency. While Russia remains barred, 35 Russian athletes have so far petitioned to participate in global competitions in 2017, track officials said Monday. They include Yuliya Stepanova, a   runner and   who helped ignite the Russian doping scandal and who is living in hiding in the United States. Ms. Stepanova ran as a neutral athlete in a global indoor competition in Boston late last month. “There have been some subtle shifts, and I think there is a recognition that this clearly has been a very disfiguring episode in Russian sport,” Mr. Coe said. “I’m encouraged, but I’m not cavalier about the amount of work that there still remains to be done. ” Also on Monday, Mr. Coe announced a freeze on nationality transfers, seeking to protect athletes  —   especially those from Africa, he said  —   from changes in allegiance before a new set of rules was in place. “What we have is a wholesale market for African talent open to the highest bidder,” Hamad Kalkaba Malboum, a track and field official representing Africa, said Monday. “Our present rules are being manipulated to the detriment of athletics’ credibility. ”"

With the election over, pressure is sure to build on President Trump to submit the Kigali Amendment on hydrofluorocarbons to the Senate. It is an amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. HFCs are currently the refrigerants of choice, appearing everywhere from your home heat pump to your car’s A/C.



On June 4, 13 Republican senators sent a letter to President Trump urging him to submit Kigali to the Senate for ratification. They said it would result in a lot of HVAC sales. Together with the 49 Democrats, that would leave the amendment only five votes short of the 67 needed to ratify or amend a treaty.



Kigali is no gain and all loss for almost everyone. The effect of HFCs on stratospheric ozone has been estimated from very slim (a theoretical reduction of 0.035 percent is too small to measure) to none. But the effect on wallets will also be stratospheric.





Kigali is a big wealth transfer from the people of the U.S. to Honeywell, Dupont, and big machine producers like Carrier. That’s not exactly Making America Great Again.



While HFCs are out of patent and cost a mere $7 a pound, their patented replacements, branded as Solstice (Honeywell) and Opteon (Dupont) go for around $71 a pound. They are known as Hydrofluoro‐​olefins (HFOs). The raw material cost (not including labor and installer markup), to fill a new residential HVAC system will be about $1,000 more than the cost of HFCs. Your existing unit likely cannot use HFOs, so you’re going to have to shell out several thousand more for a new heat pump, along with the installation cost. All of this will be required when your old HFC‐​driven system goes on the fritz.



Recognizing the virtually nonexistent ozone‐​depletion potential of HFCs, proponents of Kigali switched to global warming, saying banning HFCs will prevent 0.5°C of dreaded global surface heating. That’s an awful lot more than the mere 0.1 degree that the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that continued use of HFCs will cause this century.



This was also mirrored by Andrew Jones, who runs the policy‐​tracking firm Climate Interactive. He told _Science_ magazine that “I’m not really buying it”, meaning the 0.5°C saving, and also noting the IPCC figure.



A Senate ratification is likely going to be on the fast track to the Supreme Court. Because the ozone‐​depleting effects are, at most _de minimus_ , and the (purported) climate effects are, relatively speaking, orders of magnitude larger, the Kigali Agreement is about global warming. It should therefore be an amendment to the 1992 United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change, not the Montreal Protocol.



The 0.5&degrees; warming, absent an effective Kigali Agreement, is predicated upon the notion that there will be, in the words of the four scientists who calculated the outlier number, a “complete market saturation” with HFCs by 2050, which continues as population and air conditioning demand increases to the year 2100. It seems hard to believe that refrigeration technology will be so stagnant. If the same applied to automobiles, all U.S.-built economy cars would be Ford Pintos and Chevrolet Vegas.



The June 4 letter from the Republican Senators projects dramatically increased sales of HVAC equipment as a result of Kigali. Given that the average home unit lasts around 15 years, after that time each replacement will be a much more expensive chiller run on a refrigerant costing ten times as much as what it replaces. Owners, employees, and stockholders of the big HVAC companies will no doubt be very happy with Kigali—and the rest of us, well, not so much. Kigali is a big wealth transfer from the people of the U.S. to Honeywell, Dupont, and big machine producers like Carrier. That’s not exactly Making America Great Again.

"Although aviation emissions contribute only 3-5% of the total impact on the planet’s climate, this is steadily growing and is a surprisingly intractable problem to solve. As prosperity around the world increases demand for flights is rising much faster than our technical ability to curb the pollutants from aircraft engines. With many other sectors such as power generation and manufacturing having to clean up or curb their emissions, legislators are increasingly pressing the aviation industry to fall into line. In a 2011 White Paper, the European Union set a target of 60% reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from transport based on present-day levels by 2050. Three ways to reduce the climate impact of aviation industry are commonly suggested. The first is to change the way we use the aircraft we have, by flying more efficient routes, reducing congestion, or taxiing on the ground with only a single engine. The second is to reduce demand, perhaps by offering attractive alternatives such as high-speed rail. However, this can come at significant economic cost. The third is to make use of new aircraft technologies, materials, or fuels. There are many constraints on what technological methods can be used in an aircraft, much more so than for a road vehicle for example. The industry rightly makes safety its first priority, which means that any new technologies must be subject to rigorous testing and meet stringent certification before they can be used. Nevertheless there are technologies in development, such as open rotor engines and blended wing body aircraft, which could cut a flight’s emissions by 30% or more. This is a substantial gain in an industry where an emissions reduction of a few percent is considered a major achievement. But the problem is exacerbated by the long lives of aircraft. A typical airliner may remain in service for 30 years or more before being replaced by a newer model. Factor in the time to develop, test and manufacture new aircraft technologies, and the time from initial concept to widespread use can be many years. This means that even significant new developments in engine and airframe technology take a long time to enter widespread use, which means the emissions of current aircraft fleets are far higher than they would be if equipped with newer models.  In fact, according to our research in a new paper published in Transport Policy, global aviation emissions could be cut by 10% just by upgrading all fleets to newer models, and this saving could be increased if those technologies and aircraft designs still under development could be used. While this is neither practical nor feasible, speeding up the aircraft replacement cycle could help reduce emissions and meet climate targets. The challenge of phasing out older, high-emissions technology is not unique to aviation. Many governments have employed scrappage schemes in which drivers of older vehicles are paid an incentive to scrap their old and dirty car or van and buy a new, cleaner replacement. Could a similar scheme work for aviation? To find out, we used a computer model of the global aviation system, AIM, which simulates the interaction of passenger behaviour, airport capacity, airline routing and scheduling, policy and emissions. We assumed the scrappage scheme would be funded within the industry through a carbon tax, which would provide a further incentive to reduce emissions, and examined what impact it could have up to 2050. Our model suggests that with a scrappage scheme emissions would be about 30% lower by 2050 than without, brought about by a combination of wider adoption of cutting edge technology, fewer old aircraft in the fleet, and higher fares putting people off travelling. That’s better than nothing, but is it enough? It misses the EU’s goal of a 60% reduction for transport emissions. In fact, emissions from aviation in 2050 are higher than present-day levels, just lower than they would have been without the policy. This, and the political and financial cost of implementing such a scheme suggests that it’s unlikely to happen. So how can we tackle this problem? The EU targets are ambitious, and opinion is divided over whether they should be binding or only aspirational. Dramatic changes will be needed in the aviation industry for its emissions in 2050 to be lower than at present. This will mean changes in attitudes to flying, unforeseen technological breakthroughs, or punitive taxes. In the absence of these, an approach that aims for small improvements in many different aspects (flight routing, maintenance, flight load, fewer flights each carrying more passengers, alternative fuels…) is likely to be the most successful. Even then the airline industry may miss its targets, which would mean greater reductions in other forms of transport to meet the shortfall."

Guest post b y Bob Tisdale
As we’ve seen in numerous model-data comparisons, there are few similarities between modeled and observed surface temperatures and precipitation.  See here, here, here, here, and here for examples.  We’ve compared satellite-era sea surface temperature to model outputs in past posts (examples here, here and here), but we used model outputs from climate models stored in the CMIP3 archive, which was prepared for the 2007 4th Assessment Report from the IPCC.  In this post, we’re using the outputs of newer CMIP5 models, prepared for the IPCC’s upcoming 5th Assessment Report.  Scenario RCP6.0 for the CMIP5 models is presented because it most closely matches the climate forcings of the scenario called SRES A1B, which was widely cited in the past.
Preliminary Note: We’re looking at the multi-model ensemble mean (the average of all of the individual simulations in the respective archives) because the model mean is the best representation of how the models are programmed and tuned to respond to man-made greenhouse gases. Phrased another way, if the sea surface temperatures were warmed by greenhouse gases, the multi-model mean presents how those sea surface temperatures would have warmed, according to the models. That’s what we’re interested in seeing.  More on this later.
A QUICK LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CMIP3 AND CMIP5 OUTPUTS
In general, the multi-model mean of the CMIP5 simulations of global sea surface temperature anomalies have a slightly higher linear trend than the CMIP3 models.  See Figure 1. The CMIP5 models have a stronger and more prolonged dip in response to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. They also have a curious additional warming from 2000 to 2010 that almost appears to be an over-response, a kind of excessive rebound, from that volcano.

Figure 1
Two notes:  First, now consider that the observed trend in global sea surface temperature anomalies is almost half the trend shown by the CMIP5 models.  That’s a major difference, suggesting that researchers haven’t yet figured out how and why sea surface temperatures warm.

Second, when looking at the sea surface temperature outputs of climate models, keep in mind that different radiative forcings have different impacts on the oceans. First, let’s discuss downward shortwave radiation.  It’s also known as visible sunlight and penetrating solar radiation, the latter because sunlight penetrates the oceans to depths of 100 meters, decreasing in strength with depth. The dips and rebounds seen in Figure 1, beginning in 1991, are caused by the sun-blocking aerosols spewed into the stratosphere during the explosive volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo. They are related to downward shortwave radiation. Downward shortwave radiation from the sun is not to be confused with downward longwave radiation, infrared radiation, from manmade greenhouse gases. Infrared radiation can only penetrate the top few millimeters of the ocean, and that’s where evaporation takes place, leading some oceanographers and physicists to believe that the increases in manmade greenhouse gases could not have caused the oceans to warm.  The data supports that.  In summary, the observed and modeled sea surface temperatures both show dips in responses to volcanic eruptions, which are responses to decreases in sunlight, but that doesn’t mean the modelers are correct in their assumptions that infrared radiation from greenhouse gases caused the warming of sea surface temperatures.
OCEAN BASIN TREND COMPARISONS ON A ZONAL-MEAN (LATITUDINAL) BASIS
Figures 2, 3 and 4 are model-data trend comparisons of sea surface temperature anomalies for the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively.  But they aren’t time-series graphs.  Looking from left to right along the horizontal (x) axis, “-90” represents the South Pole, “0” the equator, and the North Pole is at “90”. The units of the vertical (y) axis are degrees C per decade—based on the calculated linear trend.  Each data point represents the linear trend in degrees C per decade for a 5 degree latitude band, where, for example, the data point at -82.5 (82.5S) latitude represents the linear trend of the latitudes of 85S-80S. The data points representing the trends then work northward in 5 degree increments, 80S-75S, 75S-70S, and so on, using the same longitudes. The average temperatures of latitude bands are called the “zonal mean” temperatures by climate scientists, hence the use of that term in the title blocks.
Figure 2 shows the observed and modeled sea surface temperature trends for the Pacific Ocean (longitudes of 125E-90W) on a zonal-mean basis.  At and near the equator, observed sea surface temperatures cooled since November 1981, the start of the dataset. And the highest observed warming in both hemispheres occurred at the mid-latitudes of the Pacific.

Figure 2
The observed warming trends at mid-latitudes, with no warming near the equator, suggest that warm water was distributed poleward by ocean currents.  In the Pacific, that happens when El Niño events dominate, which was the case during this period, causing the excessive distribution of warm water toward those latitudes. Refer to this comparison of Pacific trends on a zonal-mean basis for the periods of 1944 to 1975 and 1976 to 2011.  It’s Figure 8-32 from my ebook Who Turned on the Heat? From 1944 to 1975, El Nino and La Niña events were more evenly matched, but slightly weighted toward La Niña. During that period, less warm water was released from the tropical Pacific by El Niños and distributed toward the poles. But from 1976-2011, El Niño events dominated, so more warm tropical waters were distributed to the mid-latitudes.
In looking at the unrealistic trends presented by the models, consider that climate models do not simulate the processes of El Niño and La Niña properly. See the discussion of Guilyardi et al (2009) here.
To overcome those failings, the sea surface temperatures in climate models have to be forced by greenhouse gases to create very high warming trends in the tropics, where observations show little warming.   Now consider that the Pacific Ocean stretches almost halfway around the globe at the equator and you’ll understand the magnitude of those failings.
Sunlight is intense in the tropics, and logically the sea surface temperatures (absolute) are warmest there. (That linked illustration is Figure 2.5 from Who Turned in the Heat?) And because sunlight is less intense at the poles, the sea surface temperatures are cold at high latitudes, to the point where the sea surface freezes at the poles. It almost appears as though the climate models show significant warming in the tropical Pacific over the past 31 years because the sea surface temperatures (absolute) are warm there.
Again on a zonal-mean basis, Figure 3 shows the modeled and observed trends in sea surface temperature anomalies for the Atlantic Ocean (longitudes 70W-20E).  The models overestimate the warming in the South Atlantic and underestimate it North Atlantic, especially towards the high latitudes.   In fact, the models show just about the same warming trends from 40S to 70N, while the trends of the observations change greatly over those latitudes.

Figure 3
The last trend comparison on a zonal-mean basis is for the Indian Ocean (20E-120E), Figure 4.  Basically, the models show too much warming at most latitudes.

Figure 4
GLOBAL TIME–SERIES MODEL-DATA COMPARISON
Note: The base period for anomalies is 1971-2000, the standard at the NOAA NOMADS website for the Reynolds OI.v2 data.
For the rest of the model-data comparisons in this post, we’re resorting to standard time-series graphs for the monthly anomalies, with time in years as the x-axis and sea surface temperature anomalies in deg C as the y-axis.
As illustrated in Figure 5, the models inidicate that if greenhouse gases warmed sea surface temperatures, they should have warmed globally at a rate that’s almost twice the observed warming.  In the Northern Hemisphere, Figure 6, the sea surface temperatures warmed faster due to multidecadal variations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific (Figure 10 from this post), so the models are exploiting the natural variations to acquire a better match.  But the sea surface temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere warmed at a much lower rate, Figure 7, so the disparity there is much greater.  Apparently, the modelers still have no idea how to simulate the warming of the oceans.  This will be even more obvious in individual ocean basins that follow.

CLOSING
About 70% of the planet Earth is covered by water: oceans, seas and lakes. As illustrated in this post, the manmade greenhouse gas-forced component (the multi-model mean) of the climate models prepared for the IPCC’s upcoming 5th Assessment Report shows no similarity to the warming of the sea surface temperatures exhibited by those oceans over the past 31 years.  In other words, the models show no skill at being able to simulate the sea surface temperatures of the global oceans for the past 3+ decades—and since the start of the 20th Century, that’s the period when climate models perform at their best.
One of the biggest problems facing the climate science community is the fact that ocean heat content and satellite-era sea surface temperatures indicate the oceans warmed naturally. This was illustrated and discussed in detail in my essay titled “The Manmade Global Warming Challenge”.  The introductory blog post is here and it can be downloaded here (42MB). This was also presented in my 2-part YouTube video series titled “The Natural Warming of the Global Oceans”. YouTube links: Part 1 and Part 2.  And it was illustrated and discussed, in minute detail, in my ebook Who Turned on the Heat? which was introduced in the blog post “Everything Your Ever Wanted to Know about El Niño and La Niña”.   Who Turned on the Heat? is available for sale only in pdf form here.

ON THE USE OF THE MODEL MEAN
We’ve published numerous posts that include model-data comparisons. If history repeats itself, proponents of manmade global warming will complain in comments that I’ve only presented the model mean in the above graphs and not the full ensemble. In an effort to suppress their need to complain once again, I’ve borrowed parts of the discussion from the post Blog Memo to John Hockenberry Regarding PBS Report “Climate of Doubt”.
The model mean provides the best representation of the manmade greenhouse gas-driven scenario—not the individual model runs, which contain noise created by the models. For this, I’ll provide two references:
The first is a comment made by Gavin Schmidt (climatologist and climate modeler at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies—GISS). He is one of the contributors to the website RealClimate. The following quotes are from the thread of the RealClimate post Decadal predictions. At comment 49, dated 30 Sep 2009 at 6:18 AM, a blogger posed this question:

If a single simulation is not a good predictor of reality how can the average of many simulations, each of which is a poor predictor of reality, be a better predictor, or indeed claim to have any residual of reality?

Gavin Schmidt replied with a general discussion of models:

Any single realisation can be thought of as being made up of two components – a forced signal and a random realisation of the internal variability (‘noise’). By definition the random component will uncorrelated across different realisations and when you average together many examples you get the forced component (i.e. the ensemble mean).

To paraphrase Gavin Schmidt, we’re not interested in the random component (noise) inherent in the individual simulations; we’re interested in the forced component, which represents the modeler’s best guess of the effects of manmade greenhouse gases on the variable being simulated.
The quote by Gavin Schmidt is supported by a similar statement from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). I’ve quoted the following in numerous blog posts and in my recently published ebook. Sometime over the past few months, NCAR elected to remove that educational webpage from its website. Luckily the Wayback Machine has a copy. NCAR wrote on that FAQ webpage that had been part of an introductory discussion about climate models (my boldface):

Averaging over a multi-member ensemble of model climate runs gives a measure of the average model response to the forcings imposed on the model. Unless you are interested in a particular ensemble member where the initial conditions make a difference in your work, averaging of several ensemble members will give you best representation of a scenario.

In summary, we are definitely not interested in the models’ internally created noise, and we are not interested in the results of individual responses of ensemble members to initial conditions. So, in the graphs, we exclude the visual noise of the individual ensemble members and present only the model mean, because the model mean is the best representation of how the models are programmed and tuned to respond to manmade greenhouse gases.

The Democrats in Philadelphia aren’t doing any better than the Republicans at promoting an image of unity. So far no one can make it through a speech without interruption from the Sanders supporters. The clash between Clinton and Sanders has for the most part been framed as disagreements over economic and welfare policy. But one overlooked division stems from a rising dissatisfaction with the foreign‐​policy vision of Clinton and other Democratic elites.



These divisions matter in the short run in Clinton’s campaign against Trump but also in the longer run for the course of a potential Clinton White House and the Democratic Party. Those vying for influence within Democratic ranks are essentially split three ways over the direction of foreign policy.



The first group is called the liberal internationalists. Their motivating ethos is that the United States is, in former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’swords, the “indispensable nation.” This group believes that the United States must play a decisive leadership role on all fronts—military, economic and diplomatic—with the rest of the world.





Those vying for influence within Democratic ranks are essentially split three ways over the direction of foreign policy.



Hillary Clinton, of course, is the current torchbearer for this group, which is composed primarily of well‐​educated and well‐​to‐​do Democrats and includes most Democratic elites and party leaders. Like Clinton, this group of Democrats supports the vigorous use of military force both to confront terrorism and to defend and promote human rights. As evidenced by Clinton’s strong defense of NATO in response to Trump’s recent comments questioning the U.S. role in Europe, liberal internationalists believe American security is closely linked to the security of its allies around the world and that the global alliance system is central to the pursuit of a wide range of American foreign policy goals.



As Clinton told the Veterans of Foreign Wars this week, “I believe in standing with our allies because they are part of what makes us exceptional.” This group is also supportive of American leadership and international cooperation in other arenas such as climate change and global health. On the economic front, these Democrats strongly favor free trade and view globalization in a generally positive light.



In contrast, restrained internationalists support the cooperative and economic aspects of American foreign policy but hold a much stronger preference for the use of diplomacy over the use of force. Some in this camp are supportive of limited military efforts to prevent humanitarian disasters, but this group includes the sizeable number of dovish Democrats who have opposed most major military actions since Vietnam. Though like other Democrats they view terrorism as a threat, restrained internationalists worry about going too far in the fight against terrorism and getting entangled in endless wars abroad while eroding civil liberties at home.



Finally, the Sanders campaign has provided a huge boost to the isolationist‐​protectionists, who believe that the United States needs to focus its energies inward. Rejecting claims that the United States is the indispensable nation, this group believes that the United States does too much to help other countries solve their problems at the expense of critical domestic priorities.



Unlike the liberal internationalists, isolationist‐​protectionists tend to have less education and lower incomes. They are the people most affected by the death of American manufacturing and the restructuring of the economy. Given this, isolationist‐​protectionists view globalization and the global economy with great suspicion and overwhelmingly oppose free trade deals. In an op‐​ed condemning the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership, Sanders argued, “One of the major reasons why the middle class has been in a forty‐​year decline: poverty has been increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else has been growing wider and wider due to our disastrous trade policies.”



Finally, thanks to this laser focus on domestic issues, isolationist‐​protectionists tend to be the least supportive of the use of force whether the issue is terrorism, defending allies, or protecting human rights.



Despite general agreement with Clinton on the need for U.S. leadership on global issues like climate change and for working with allies, Bernie Sanders is not a liberal internationalist and his surprisingly successful campaign revealed two fault lines at work dividing the Democratic Party on foreign policy. The first fault line was the question of military intervention. Where Clinton has supported every major American military action since the 1990s, Bernie Sanders—and many Democrats—opposed them. The second fault line was international trade. Like her husband before her, Clinton was a champion of free trade while serving as Secretary of State. Sanders, of course, along with many Democrats, fiercely opposed the Obama administration’s trade deals.



In highlighting these fault lines the Sanders campaign energized the two insurgent camps within the Democratic base, uniting them under a banner bearing eerie similarities to the one promoted by Donald Trump, a vision combining economic protectionism and an emphasis on domestic issues over foreign affairs. The appeal of populist and nationalist rhetoric made it difficult for Clinton to beat Sanders, continues to make it hard for her to consolidate her base, and has blunted what was expected to be her significant advantage over Trump on foreign affairs.



Longer term this year’s campaign suggests that liberal internationalism’s days as the Democrats’ undisputed foreign policy platform are numbered. The battle between Clinton and Trump may temporarily paper over the Democrats’ internal struggles, but in fact Donald Trump’s success only reinforces the danger of assuming Americans have the stomach for ambitious foreign policies. As a recent survey from the Pew Research Center found, 57 percent of Americans think the United States should deal with its own problems and let other nations manage on their own, more think that involvement in the global economy is mostly bad than mostly good, and 70 percent of Americans want the next president to focus on domestic policy, not foreign policy.



Like it or not, Clinton and other liberal internationalists will need to do more to persuade Democrats that the United States can and should continue to engage the world as deeply as it has for the past generation.

"TUNIS  —   Since their revolution in 2011, Tunisians have tussled among themselves to define their new identity after successive dictatorships. Belatedly, they have started reclaiming their history as well. Dictatorships have a way of manipulating historical narratives. So alongside any of the most pressing issues of the day, the past, too, is in play. The struggle to shape the past, and give it new authenticity, can be witnessed all around the Tunisian capital. Last summer, the Tunisian government restored a statue of Habib Bourguiba, the founder and first president of the republic, to its original place on the capital’s main avenue. The famous symbol of Mr. Bourguiba  —   astride his horse, arm aloft rallying Tunisians to independence  —   had been banished to a seaside neighborhood in 1987, after he was ousted by his prime minister, Zine   Ben Ali. (Mr. Ben Ali was himself overthrown decades later during the Arab Spring uprising.) The current president, Beji Caid Essebsi, who served in Mr. Bourguiba’s cabinet, was the main driver behind reinstating the statue, which he said was intended to reinforce his call for national unity and a strong state. Mr. Bourguiba’s statue had replaced a humiliating symbol of colonialism: an image of the colonialist politician Jules Ferry with a Tunisian woman at his feet proffering an olive branch, he reminded Tunisians. “That used to be the symbol of colonialism, and Bourguiba is the symbol of freedom, of independence and of the modern state,” he said at the unveiling. Many Tunisians do indeed respect Mr. Bourguiba as the father of the independent nation, yet he was also a dictator who imprisoned his opponents and clung to power for over 30 years. The young revolutionaries who spearheaded the Arab Spring uprising greeted the return of the statue with a flurry of jokes on social media about the waste of money. Far from cementing his reputation, moving the statue opened a new debate around Mr. Bourguiba’s legacy. “People talk of a ‘new Bourguibism,’ but it does not exist,” Med Dhia Hammami, a journalist and activist, said. “There are no ideas coming out of that. ” With the new freedom gained since their revolution, some of Mr. Bourguiba’s victims are being given a chance to set the record straight at public hearings of the Truth and Dignity Commission. One of them, Hamadi Ghars, 85, a journalist in the independence movement, gave a damning portrayal of Mr. Bourguiba at the commission’s first public hearing. Mr. Ghars described how Mr. Bourguiba had betrayed thousands of his fellow   fighters when he accepted an interim deal with the French government that allowed the colonizers’ security forces to continue controlling the country. “We were happy with independence and were waiting for reconciliation,” Mr. Ghars said. Yet Mr. Bourguiba then ordered them to surrender to the French, who bombed the fighters in the mountains. “They killed hundreds of young Tunisian men,” he recalled. “I don’t doubt that their bodies are still in the mountains and rivers today. ” Mr. Ghars was captured and sentenced by the French to 20 years imprisonment and 10 years hard labor, which he served under Mr. Bourguiba. “They destroyed a dream of unity,” he said. “Usually history is written by the victors, but this is the opposite,” said Adel Maizi, the president for preservation of memory at the commission. “These testimonies will reveal the truth. ” “Dictatorship always tries to keep things secret,” he explained. “These kinds of testimonies are against forgetting. They will preserve memory for the country and serve as a way to guard such things happening in the future. ” Tunisians are discovering other forgotten chapters of their past that the two dictators tried to obscure. Crowds have flocked in recent weeks to an exhibition on the opulent, and at times profligate,   reign of tribal princes when Tunisia was part of the Ottoman Empire. The exhibit is housed in the   Ksar   palace. Once a royal residence, it was used as a barracks and a hospital and has been shuttered since the 1980s, its collection of French paintings and Ottoman magnificence hidden from view. For a year, the Rambourg Foundation has been restoring a part of the palace and its collections to unveil the history of Tunisia between 1830 and 1881, the period when princely rulers known as beys ruled the country before it was colonized by France. Ridha Moumni, a curator of the exhibit, insists it is not political, but a matter of history. Yet he is displaying events that Tunisia’s dictators sought to suppress. “We have a very rich heritage that no one knew about,” Mr. Moumni said. “Our goal was to show that Tunisian modernity did not start with independence or colonization. ” The exhibition offers many Tunisians their first glimpse of the   court through royal portraits and rich costumery. More important, it provides a history lesson on the significant reforms of the era  —   the founding of the army, the drafting of a constitution and development of diplomatic relations  —   that helped forge a nation. Among the original documents on display, one abolished slavery in 1846  —   before the United States did so, Mr. Moumni pointed out. Others include a constitution drafted in 1860 that recognizes the rights of all citizens, including Christian and Jewish minorities, and census registers, in Hebrew and Arabic, belonging to Tunisia’s ancient Jewish community. Students and a university teacher touring the exhibition said it was the first time they had seen images of Tunisian royalty. Another discovery is the diversity of Tunisia’s leaders  —   from the Christian foreign minister, Giuseppe Raffo, to a Circassian general, Kheireddine Pasha, and the former slave Mustapha Khaznadar, who married into the royal family and rose to become the bey himself. One of the most popular displays  —   in the throne room, and beside the very table upon which it was signed  —   is the Treaty of Bardo, under which the beys, facing a crumbling dynasty and mounting debts, surrendered to become a French protectorate. The beys were subsequently blamed for clearing the way for seven decades of French rule and were condemned to obscurity by Mr. Bourguiba after Tunisia’s independence. “He wanted to erase this from the national memory,” Mr. Moumni said."
"Two weeks of campaigning to raise awareness of Fairtrade products have come to a close. But coffee farmers around the world face an ongoing crisis that the Fairtrade Foundation has done little to mitigate and more must be done to address the problems they face of plummeting prices.  Fairtrade is based on a vision to provide marginal farmers with a sustainable livelihood. Yet, farmers are not protected by Fairtrade in the current coffee price crisis and they are struggling to meet the basic costs of production, never mind make a living. Fairtrade started as an effort to mitigate the crises caused by crashes in commodity prices, such as coffee, helping farmers in the developing world to live a decent life. The Fairtrade Foundation claims that it covers the average costs of production, thereby ensuring a sustainable livelihood for the farmers and their families. It hopes to provide a degree of financial stability to the farmers through long-term trading relationships that provide access to pre-finance access to credit, enabling the farmers to plan their production and invest in the necessary agricultural inputs. Our fieldwork, undertaken in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and India since 2009, tells a different story. In these countries, some farmers are leaving the Fairtrade scheme since it does not always cover the basic costs of production.  To redress this criticism, in 2011 Fairtrade increased its floor price from 
US$2.64/kg to US$3.08/kg and also doubled the Fairtrade premium to US$0.44/kg of coffee added to the price. This must be seen in the context of the fall in coffee price on the international market from around US$6.77/kg in 2011 to US$2.55/kg at the end of 2013. Fairtrade “producer prices” are prices paid to a co-operative of farmers. To be viable for the farmers, they should cover not only the costs of production of the individual farmers, but also the cost of operating the Fairtrade co-operative. This also relates to the processing of coffee beans to enable their export to Fairtrade markets. These costs do not decrease when the international market price of coffee drops. In one of the co-operatives that we studied, their cost of production in 2012-13 was US$6.54/kg plus an overhead cost of US$3.27/kg for export-ready coffee while the price on the international market for this was only US$2.13/kg. Hence, there is a limited relationship between the actual costs and the market price. Even with the Fairtrade floor price and premium, the price would usually be no more than about $3.50/kg which would still not cover the costs of production. This premium must be invested by the co-operative in various projects to improve the lives of its members and their communities, which is a good thing. But, since most of this money is spent at the community level, it does not provide enough income to individual farmers. To supplement this, co-operatives might join a plethora of other organisations with their own requirements for accountability. All of these different systems with their additional costs must then be maintained by the co-operative. Despite a variation among coffee growing countries in terms of their labour, input and living costs, the Fairtrade floor price and premium are the same worldwide as determined by the Fairtrade Foundation. This ensures that the Fairtrade retail partners have a guaranteed price irrespective of the coffee’s origin. This emphasis of the Fairtrade market on export seems to perpetuate a dependency relationship with Northern buyers. Co-operatives that have given up on Fairtrade certification are using the resources that have been freed up to focus on diversifying their sources of income, growing other crops as well as coffee. This is a positive change where farmers are more independent and have been able to develop local markets for their produce. To remain relevant, Fairtrade needs to acknowledge these issues. It has an opportunity to be more accountable to southern farmers and fulfil its rhetoric of providing them sustainable livelihoods. If this does not happen, then farmers around the world will continue to say: “Fairtrade is not Fair!” (Mercado Justo no es Justo!)"

Share this...FacebookTwitterVeteran meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls of the European Institute Climate and Energy (EIKE) has sent over some slides from a presentation showing Germany’s mean temperature has been cooling over the last decades.
A couple of days ago a certain reader named Neville (Warming-In-Our-Time) (or was it Neven? whatever…) was complaining that the Eastern Alps were not representative of Europe and thus the data there showing colder winters meant little for Europe, let alone the northern hemisphere. The first slides Klaus Puls sent are  data charts for snow cover for the entire northern hemisphere and mean winter temperatures for Germany.
The first chart below shows snow cover in square kilometers for Europe and Asia, where we see an upward trend over the last quarter century. This is not something you’d expect in a warming world.

It just happens that global temperatures have dropped slightly over the last 10 years, and haven’t risen in 17 years. So the trend in snow cover is no mystery to those who know the data.
If Europe and Asia are not enough to convince you, Puls’s next chart shows that 5 of the 6 top northern hemisphere snow coverage extents occurred in the last 6 years!

The trend over the last 47 years is upward. The mean for the last 10 years is at a record high.
The next chart shows the trend for mean sonw coverage for the northern hemisphere for the fall season since 1967.

Here also the mean autumn snow coverage trend has risen almost half a million square kilometers in 45 years. Again a surprise that flies in the face of a warming planet (one that hasn’t warmed in almost 2 decades).
The next chart shows that winters (DJF) in Germany have gotten “considerably colder over the last 26 years,” Puls says.

The above chart uses data from the German Weather Service (DWD).

"LINCOLN IN THE BARDOBy George Saunders343 pages. Random House. $28. George Saunders’s   first novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo,” is like a weird folk art diorama of a cemetery come to life. Picture, as a backdrop, one of those primitively drawn   mourning paintings with rickety white gravestones and   monuments standing under the faded green canopy of a couple of delicately sketched trees. Add a tall, sad mourner, grieving over his recently deceased son. And then, to make things stranger, populate the rest of the scene with some Edward   ghosts, skittering across the landscape  —   at once menacing, comical and slightly   . “Lincoln in the Bardo” takes, as its   point, the death of Abraham Lincoln’s beloved    son, Willie, who succumbed to typhoid fever on Feb. 20, 1862, and the   president’s visits to the crypt where his son was interred at the Oak Hill Cemetery in nearby Georgetown. Saunders intercuts facts and   (culled from books and news accounts) in a   narrative with some ghost stories of his own imagining, allowing a chorus of disembodied spirits to describe Lincoln’s visits, while babbling on about their own regrets and misplaced dreams. “Bardo” is the Tibetan Buddhist name for a transition period between death and rebirth and seems to indicate, in this case, the bizarre purgatory inhabited by these ghosts. The supernatural chatter can grow tedious at times  —   the novel would have benefited immensely from some judicious pruning  —   but their voices gain emotional momentum as the book progresses. And they lend the story a choral dimension that turns Lincoln’s personal grief into a meditation on the losses suffered by the nation during the Civil War, and the more universal heartbreak that is part of the human condition. The ghosts are a motley lot, reminiscent of the dispossessed and disenfranchised characters in Saunders’s short stories. They include a soldier, a murderer, a disgraced clerk, a rape victim, a hunter who’s killed more than 30 bears and hundreds of deer, an aggrieved scholar, a mother of three girls, a young man who tried to kill himself after the man he loved spurned his affections, and an older man who was struck in the head by a falling ceiling beam and died before he could consummate his marriage to his pretty young wife. Together, these voices create a kind of portrait of an American community  —   not unlike the one in Edgar Lee Masters’s 1915 classic, “Spoon River Anthology,” which was set in a fictionalized version of a small Illinois town. The poems in “Spoon River” were narrated from beyond the grave by the dozens of souls “sleeping on the hill” in the local cemetery. One of those characters was Anne Rutledge, rumored to have been Lincoln’s first love, and whose untimely death  —   reportedly of typhoid at the age of 22  —   was said to be a source of his often melancholy outlook on the world. The similarities between “Spoon River” and Saunders’s new novel extend well beyond the Lincoln association and the graveyard confessions. Like Sherwood Anderson’s “Winesburg, Ohio” (1919)  —   itself a notable influence on Saunders’s early short stories  —   and Thornton Wilder’s “Our Town” (1938) “Lincoln in the Bardo” appropriates Masters’s multivoiced approach, using it to create a story that unfolds into a meditation on the dreams and disappointments of ordinary people, longing for connection but often left feeling isolated and alone. Saunders’s short stories  —   “CivilWarLand in Bad Decline,” “Pastoralia,” “In Persuasion Nation” and “Tenth of December”  —   tend to vacillate between two impulses: satire and black comedy, reminiscent of Nathanael West and Kurt Vonnegut and a more empathetic mode, closer to Anderson and William Trevor. Though there are moments of dark humor in some of the ghost stories here, “Bardo” definitely falls into the more introspective part of that spectrum. In these pages, Saunders’s extraordinary verbal energy is harnessed, for the most part, in the service of capturing the pathos of everyday life  —   as experienced by the spirits of the dead, remembering missed opportunities by Willie, as his life slips away and he enters the limbo of the bardo and by Lincoln, as he struggles to come to terms with his son’s death and the devastation of a war that is ripping the country apart. Saunders’s novel is at its most potent and compelling when it is focused on Lincoln: a grave, deeply compassionate figure, burdened by both personal grief and the weight of the war, and captured here in the full depth of his humanity. In fact, it is Saunders’s beautifully realized portrait of Lincoln  —   caught at this hinge moment in time, in his own personal bardo, as it were  —   that powers this book over its more static sections and attests to the author’s own fruitful transition from the short story to the   form of the novel. “His mind was freshly inclined toward sorrow,” Saunders writes of Lincoln, “toward the fact that the world was full of sorrow, that everyone labored under some burden of sorrow that all were suffering that whatever way one took in this world, one must try to remember that all were suffering (none content all wronged, neglected, overlooked, misunderstood) and therefore one must do what one could to lighten the load of those with whom one came into contact that his current state of sorrow was not uniquely his, not at all, but, rather, its like had been felt, would yet be felt, by scores of others, in all times, in every time, and must not be prolonged or exaggerated, because, in this state, he could be of no help to anyone and, given that his position in the world situated him to be either of great help or great harm, it would not do to stay low, if he could help it. ”"
"Lady Gaga went for one big, glittering, diverse party with her Super Bowl halftime show. “We’re here to make you feel good,” she declared  . At her N. F. L. news conference, she had promised a statement of “inclusion,” an upbeat and uncontroversial stance, and she made good on it as she began her set, singing a few lines each of “God Bless America” and “This Land Is Your Land” and reciting the “one nation indivisible” conclusion of the Pledge of Allegiance. Wearing a shiny, silvery,     bodysuit and matching   boots, with a glittery mask painted around her eyes, Lady Gaga was lowered through the air, on suspension cables, into NRG Stadium in Houston, showing off a   flip. And she started belting her hits, with a nod to the local audience: “Poker Face” announced, “I want to hold ’em like they do in Texas. ” One of those hits was “Born This Way,” her   anthem of   for all kinds of people. “You’re black, white, beige, chola  ’re Lebanese, you’re orient,” she sang, and later, “No matter gay, straight, or   transgendered  ’m on the right track   was born to survive. ” It was doubtless the first time the word “transgendered” had been sung at a Super Bowl halftime show. Dozens of dancers of multiple skin tones and genders joined her, matching her moves in exultant line dances and embodying her message of empowerment as a shared celebration. But most of the show was simply about   pop fun: songs like “Telephone,” about dancing at clubs, and “Bad Romance,” about falling in love and lust. It was a megamix of her songs spanning her career, from her 2008 debut single, “Just Dance,” to “Million Reasons,” the power ballad from her 2016 album, “Joanne. ” She sang “Million Reasons” from a piano as people waving orange electric torches made patterns that radiated across the football field that was her relatively still point in a fiercely athletic performance. “The Super Bowl is what champions are made of,” she declared as “Bad Romance” revved up. Lady Gaga has proudly presented herself as the continuation of generations of    showbiz troupers, a tradition of fervent effort and   spectacle delivered with joy. She sang with hardworking gusto throughout the set, even as she covered considerable yardage strutting and kicking, prancing and gesticulating, pumping her hips and shaking hands with fans. It was a show of shiny costumes and big smiles, of a huge group of dancers all sharing the same moves, an outpouring of energy that was eager to please everybody. Lady Gaga ended it with one last strut, up a ramp, and a   gesture that has been used by both rappers and an  : a microphone drop, earned with sweat."

This is from Real Climate, who played the “he who must not be named” game again in not pointing out criticisms. Gavin dissapoints.
UPDATE: McIntyre responded earlier today with The Marcott Filibuster
Marcott et al have posted their long-promised FAQ at realclimate here. Without providing any links to or citation of Climate Audit, they now concede:
20th century portion of our paleotemperature stack is not statistically robust, cannot be considered representative of global temperature changes, and therefore is not the basis of any of our conclusions.
Otherwise, their response is pretty much a filibuster, running the clock on questions that have not actually been asked and certainly not at issue by critics. For questions and issues that I’ve actually raised, for the most part, they merely re-iterate what they already said. Nothing worth waiting for.

I repost the Marcott FAQs here for discussion.
Summary and FAQ’s related to the study by Marcott et al. (2013, Science)
Prepared by Shaun A. Marcott, Jeremy D. Shakun, Peter U. Clark, and Alan C. Mix
Primary results of study
Global Temperature Reconstruction: We combined published proxy temperature records from across the globe to develop regional and global temperature reconstructions spanning the past ~11,300 years with a resolution >300 yr; previous reconstructions of global and hemispheric temperatures primarily spanned the last one to two thousand years. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to quantify global temperature for the entire Holocene.
Structure of the Global and Regional Temperature Curves: We find that global temperature was relatively warm from approximately 10,000 to 5,000 years before present. Following this interval, global temperature decreased by approximately 0.7°C, culminating in the coolest temperatures of the Holocene around 200 years before present during what is commonly referred to as the Little Ice Age. The largest cooling occurred in the Northern Hemisphere.

Holocene Temperature Distribution: Based on comparison of the instrumental record of global temperature change with the distribution of Holocene global average temperatures from our paleo-reconstruction, we find that the decade 2000-2009 has probably not exceeded the warmest temperatures of the early Holocene, but is warmer than ~75% of all temperatures during the Holocene. In contrast, the decade 1900-1909 was cooler than~95% of the Holocene. Therefore, we conclude that global temperature has risen from near the coldest to the warmest levels of the Holocene in the past century. Further, we compare the Holocene paleotemperature distribution with published temperature projections for 2100 CE, and find that these projections exceed the range of Holocene global average temperatures under all plausible emissions scenarios.
Frequently Asked Questions and Answers
Q: What is global temperature?
A: Global average surface temperature is perhaps the single most representative measure of a planet’s climate since it reflects how much heat is at the planet’s surface. Local temperature changes can differ markedly from the global average. One reason for this is that heat moves around with the winds and ocean currents, warming one region while cooling another, but these regional effects might not cause a significant change in the global average temperature. A second reason is that local feedbacks, such as changes in snow or vegetation cover that affect how a region reflects or absorbs sunlight, can cause large local temperature changes that are not mirrored in the global average. We therefore cannot rely on any single location as being representative of global temperature change. This is why our study includes data from around the world.
We can illustrate this concept with temperature anomaly data based on instrumental records for the past 130 years from the National Climatic Data Center (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cmb-faq/anomalies.php#anomalies). Over this time interval, an increase in the global average temperature is documented by thermometer records, rising sea levels, retreating glaciers, and increasing ocean heat content, among other indicators. Yet if we plot temperature anomaly data since 1880 at the same locations as the 73 sites used in our paleotemperature study, we see that the data are scattered and the trend is unclear. When these same 73 historical temperature records are averaged together, we see a clear warming signal that is very similar to the global average documented from many more sites (Figure 1). Averaging reduces local noise and provides a clearer perspective on global climate.

Figure 1: Temperature anomaly data (thin colored lines) at the same locations as the 73 paleotemperature records used in Marcott et al. (2013), the average of these 73 temperature anomaly series (bold black line), and the global average temperature from the National Climatic Data Center blended land and ocean dataset (bold red line) (data from Smith et al., 2008).
New Scientist magazine has an “app” that allows one to point-and-plot instrumental temperatures for any spot on the map to see how local temperature changes compare to the global average over the past century (http://warmingworld.newscientistapps.com/).
Q: How does one go about reconstructing temperatures in the past? 
A: Changes in Earth’s temperature for the last ~160 years are determined from instrumental data, such as thermometers on the ground or, for more recent times, satellites looking down from space. Beyond about 160 years ago, we must turn to other methods that indirectly record temperature (called “proxies”) for reconstructing past temperatures. For example, tree rings, calibrated to temperature over the instrumental era, provide one way of determining temperatures in the past, but few trees extend beyond the past few centuries or millennia. To develop a longer record, we used primarily marine and terrestrial fossils, biomolecules, or isotopes that were recovered from ocean and lake sediments and ice cores. All of these proxies have been independently calibrated to provide reliable estimates of temperature.
Q: Did you collect and measure the ocean and land temperature data from all 73 sites?
A: No. All of the datasets were previously generated and published in peer-reviewed scientific literature by other researchers over the past 15 years. Most of these datasets are freely available at several World Data Centers (see links below); those not archived as such were graciously made available to us by the original authors. We assembled all these published data into an easily used format, and in some cases updated the calibration of older data using modern state-of-the-art calibrations. We made all the data available for download free-of-charge from the Science web site (see link below). Our primary contribution was to compile these local temperature records into “stacks” that reflect larger-scale changes in regional and global temperatures. We used methods that carefully consider potential sources of uncertainty in the data, including uncertainty in proxy calibration and in dating of the samples (see step-by-step methods below).

Q: Why use marine and terrestrial archives to reconstruct global temperature when we have the ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica?
A: While we do use these ice cores in our study, they are limited to the polar regions and so give only a local or regional picture of temperature changes. Just as it would not be reasonable to use the recent instrumental temperature history from Greenland (for example) as being representative of the planet as a whole, one would similarly not use just a few ice cores from polar locations to reconstruct past temperature change for the entire planet.
Q: Why only look at temperatures over the last 11,300 years?
A: Our work was the second half of a two-part study assessing global temperature variations since the peak of the last Ice Age about 22,000 years ago. The first part reconstructed global temperature over the last deglaciation (22,000 to 11,300 years ago) (Shakun et al., 2012, Nature 484, 49-55; see also http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~shakun/FAQs.html), while our study focused on the current interglacial warm period (last 11,300 years), which is roughly the time span of developed human civilizations.
Q: Is your paleotemperature reconstruction consistent with reconstructions based on the tree-ring data and other archives of the past 2,000 years?
A: Yes, in the parts where our reconstruction contains sufficient data to be robust, and acknowledging its inherent smoothing. For example, our global temperature reconstruction from ~1500 to 100 years ago is indistinguishable (within its statistical uncertainty) from the Mann et al. (2008) reconstruction, which included many tree-ring based data. Both reconstructions document a cooling trend from a relatively warm interval (~1500 to 1000 years ago) to a cold interval (~500 to 100 years ago, approximately equivalent to the Little Ice Age).
Q: What do paleotemperature reconstructions show about the temperature of the last 100 years?
A: Our global paleotemperature reconstruction includes a so-called “uptick” in temperatures during the 20th-century. However, in the paper we make the point that this particular feature is of shorter duration than the inherent smoothing in our statistical averaging procedure, and that it is based on only a few available paleo-reconstructions of the type we used. Thus, the 20th century portion of our paleotemperature stack is not statistically robust, cannot be considered representative of global temperature changes, and therefore is not the basis of any of our conclusions. Our primary conclusions are based on a comparison of the longer term paleotemperature changes from our reconstruction with the well-documented temperature changes that have occurred over the last century, as documented by the instrumental record. Although not part of our study, high-resolution paleoclimate data from the past ~130 years have been compiled from various geological archives, and confirm the general features of warming trend over this time interval (Anderson, D.M. et al., 2013, Geophysical Research Letters, v. 40, p. 189-193; http://www.agu.org/journals/pip/gl/2012GL054271-pip.pdf).
Q: Is the rate of global temperature rise over the last 100 years faster than at any time during the past 11,300 years?
A: Our study did not directly address this question because the paleotemperature records used in our study have a temporal resolution of ~120 years on average, which precludes us from examining variations in rates of change occurring within a century. Other factors also contribute to smoothing the proxy temperature signals contained in many of the records we used, such as organisms burrowing through deep-sea mud, and chronological uncertainties in the proxy records that tend to smooth the signals when compositing them into a globally averaged reconstruction. We showed that no temperature variability is preserved in our reconstruction at cycles shorter than 300 years, 50% is preserved at 1000-year time scales, and nearly all is preserved at 2000-year periods and longer. Our Monte-Carlo analysis accounts for these sources of uncertainty to yield a robust (albeit smoothed) global record. Any small “upticks” or “downticks” in temperature that last less than several hundred years in our compilation of paleoclimate data are probably not robust, as stated in the paper.
Q: How do you compare the Holocene temperatures to the modern instrumental data?
A: One of our primary conclusions is based on Figure 3 of the paper, which compares the magnitude of global warming seen in the instrumental temperature record of the past century to the full range of temperature variability over the entire Holocene based on our reconstruction. We conclude that the average temperature for 1900-1909 CE in the instrumental record was cooler than ~95% of the Holocene range of global temperatures, while the average temperature for 2000-2009 CE in the instrumental record was warmer than ~75% of the Holocene distribution. As described in the paper and its supplementary material, Figure 3 provides a reasonable assessment of the full range of Holocene global average temperatures, including an accounting for high-frequency changes that might have been damped out by the averaging procedure.
Q: What about temperature projections for the future?
A: Our study used projections of future temperature published in the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007, which suggest that global temperature is likely to rise 1.1-6.4°C by the end of the century (relative to the late 20th century), depending on the magnitude of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the sensitivity of the climate to those emissions. Figure 3 in the paper compares these published projected temperatures from various emission scenarios to our assessment of the full distribution of Holocene temperature distributions. For example, a middle-of-the-road emission scenario (SRES A1B) projects global mean temperatures that will be well above the Holocene average by the year 2100 CE. Indeed, if any of the six emission scenarios considered by the IPCC that are shown on Figure 3 are followed, future global average temperatures, as projected by modeling studies, will likely be well outside anything the Earth has experienced in the last 11,300 years, as shown in Figure 3 of our study.
Technical Questions and Answers:
Q. Why did you revise the age models of many of the published records that were used in your study?
A. The majority of the published records used in our study (93%) based their ages on radiocarbon dates. Radiocarbon is a naturally occurring isotope that is produced mainly in the upper atmosphere by cosmic rays. This form of carbon is then distributed around the world and incorporated into living things. Dating is based on the amount of this carbon left after radioactive decay. It has been known for several decades that radiocarbon years differ from true “calendar” years because the amount of radiocarbon produced in the atmosphere changes over time, as does the rate that carbon is exchanged between the ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere. This yields a bias in radiocarbon dates that must be corrected. Scientists have been able to determine the correction between radiocarbon years and true calendar year by dating samples of known age (such as tree samples dated by counting annual rings) and comparing the apparent radiocarbon age to the true age. Through many careful measurements of this sort, they have demonstrated that, in general, radiocarbon years become progressively “younger” than calendar years as one goes back through time. For example, the ring of a tree known to have grown 5700 years ago will have a radiocarbon age of ~5000 years, whereas one known to have grown 12,800 years ago will have a radiocarbon age of ~11,000 years.
For our paleotemperature study, all radiocarbon ages needed to be converted (or calibrated) to calendar ages in a consistent manner. Calibration methods have been improved and refined over the past few decades. Because our compilation included data published many years ago, some of the original publications used radiocarbon calibration systems that are now obsolete. To provide a consistent chronology based on the best current information, we thus recalibrated all published radiocarbon ages with Calib 6.0.1 software (using the databases INTCAL09 for land samples or MARINE09 for ocean samples) and its state-of-the-art protocol for site-specific locations and materials. This software is freely available for online use at http://calib.qub.ac.uk/calib/.
By convention, radiocarbon dates are recorded as years before present (BP). BP is universally defined as years before 1950 CE, because after that time the Earth’s atmosphere became contaminated with artificial radiocarbon produced as a bi-product of nuclear bomb tests. As a result, radiocarbon dates on intervals younger than 1950 are not useful for providing chronologic control in our study.
After recalibrating all radiocarbon control points to make them internally consistent and in compliance with the scientific state-of-the-art understanding, we constructed age models for each sediment core based on the depth of each of the calibrated radiocarbon ages, assuming linear interpolation between dated levels in the core, and statistical analysis that quantifies the uncertainty of ages between the dated levels. In geologic studies it is quite common that the youngest surface of a sediment core is not dated by radiocarbon, either because the top is disturbed by living organisms or during the coring process. Moreover, within the past hundred years before 1950 CE, radiocarbon dates are not very precise chronometers, because changes in radiocarbon production rate have by coincidence roughly compensated for fixed decay rates. For these reasons, and unless otherwise indicated, we followed the common practice of assuming an age of 0 BP for the marine core tops.
Q: Are the proxy records seasonally biased?
A: Maybe. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of the paleotemperature records are biased toward a particular season rather than recording true annual mean temperatures. For instance, high-latitude proxies based on short-lived plants or other organisms may record the temperature during the warmer and sunnier summer months when the organisms grow most rapidly. As stated in the paper, such an effect could impact our paleo-reconstruction. For example, the long-term cooling in our global paleotemperature reconstruction comes primarily from Northern Hemisphere high-latitude marine records, whereas tropical and Southern Hemisphere trends were considerably smaller. This northern cooling in the paleotemperature data may be a response to a long-term decline in summer insolation associated with variations in the earth’s orbit, and this implies that the paleotemperature proxies here may be biased to the summer season. A summer cooling trend through Holocene time, if driven by orbitally modulated seasonal insolation, might be partially canceled out by winter warming due to well-known orbitally driven rise in Northern-Hemisphere winter insolation through Holocene time. Summer-biased proxies would not record this averaging of the seasons. It is not currently possible to quantify this seasonal effect in the reconstructions. Qualitatively, however, we expect that an unbiased recorder of the annual average would show that the northern latitudes might not have cooled as much as seen in our reconstruction. This implies that the range of Holocene annual-average temperatures might have been smaller in the Northern Hemisphere than the proxy data suggest, making the observed historical temperature averages for 2000-2009 CE, obtained from instrumental records, even more unusual with respect to the full distribution of Holocene global-average temperatures.
Q: What do paleotemperature reconstructions show about the temperature of the last 100 years?
A: Here we elaborate on our short answer to this question above. We concluded in the published paper that “Without filling data gaps, our Standard5×5 reconstruction (Figure 1A) exhibits 0.6°C greater warming over the past ~60 yr B.P. (1890 to 1950 CE) than our equivalent infilled 5° × 5° area-weighted mean stack (Figure 1, C and D). However, considering the temporal resolution of our data set and the small number of records that cover this interval (Figure 1G), this difference is probably not robust.” This statement follows from multiple lines of evidence that are presented in the paper and the supplementary information: (1) the different methods that we tested for generating a reconstruction produce different results in this youngest interval, whereas before this interval, the different methods of calculating the stacks are nearly identical (Figure 1D), (2) the median resolution of the datasets (120 years) is too low to statistically resolve such an event, (3) the smoothing presented in the online supplement results in variations shorter than 300 yrs not being interpretable, and (4) the small number of datasets that extend into the 20th century (Figure 1G) is insufficient to reconstruct a statistically robust global signal, showing that there is a considerable reduction in the correlation of Monte Carlo reconstructions with a known (synthetic) input global signal when the number of data series in the reconstruction is this small (Figure S13).
Q: How did you create the Holocene paleotemperature stacks?
A: We followed these steps in creating the Holocene paleotemperature stacks:
1. Compiled 73 medium-to-high resolution calibrated proxy temperature records spanning much or all of the Holocene.
2. Calibrated all radiocarbon ages for consistency using the latest and most precise calibration software (Calib 6.0.1 using INTCAL09 (terrestrial) or MARINE09 (oceanic) and its protocol for the site-specific locations and materials) so that all radiocarbon-based records had a consistent chronology based on the best current information. This procedure updates previously published chronologies, which were based on a variety of now-obsolete and inconsistent calibration methods.
3. Where applicable, recalibrated paleotemperature proxy data based on alkenones and TEX86 using consistent calibration equations specific to each of the proxy types.
4. Used a Monte Carlo analysis to generate 1000 realizations of each proxy record, linearly interpolated to constant time spacing, perturbing them with analytical uncertainties in the age model and temperature estimates, including inflation of age uncertainties between dated intervals. This procedure results in an unbiased assessment of the impact of such uncertainties on the final composite.
5. Referenced each proxy record realization as an anomaly relative to its mean value between 4500 and 5500 years Before Present (the common interval of overlap among all records; Before Present, or BP, is defined by standard practice as time before 1950 CE).
6. Averaged the first realization of each of the 73 records, and then the second realization of each, then the third, the fourth, and so on, to form 1000 realizations of the global or regional temperature stacks.
7. Derived the mean temperature and standard deviation from the 1000 simulations of the global temperature stack.
8. Repeated this procedure using several different area-weighting schemes and data subsets to test the sensitivity of the reconstruction to potential spatial and proxy biases in the dataset.
9. Mean-shifted the global temperature reconstructions to have the same average as the Mann et al. (2008) CRU-EIV temperature reconstruction over the interval 510-1450 years Before Present. Since the CRU-EIV reconstruction is referenced as temperature anomalies from the 1961-1990 CE instrumental mean global temperature, the Holocene reconstructions are now also effectively referenced as anomalies from the 1961-1990 CE mean.
10. Estimated how much higher frequency (decade-to-century scale) variability is plausibly missing from the Holocene reconstruction by calculating attenuation as a function of frequency in synthetic data processed with the Monte-Carlo stacking procedure, and by statistically comparing the amount of temperature variance the global stack contains as a function of frequency to the amount contained in the CRU-EIV reconstruction. Added this missing variability to the Holocene reconstruction as red noise.
11. Pooled all of the Holocene global temperature anomalies into a single histogram, showing the distribution of global temperature anomalies during the Holocene, including the decadal-to century scale high-frequency variability that the Monte-Carlo procedure may have smoothed from the record (largely from the accounting for chronologic uncertainties).
12. Compared the histogram of Holocene paleotemperatures to the instrumental global temperature anomalies during the decades 1900-1909 CE and 2000-2009 CE. Determined the fraction of the Holocene temperature anomalies colder than 1900-1909 CE and 2000-2009 CE.
13. Compared global temperature projections for 2100 CE from the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for various emission scenarios.
14. Evaluated the impact of potential sources of uncertainty and smoothing in the Monte-Carlo procedure, as a guide for future experimental design to refine such analyses.

 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **Whau Ward**



It’s been a wild ride, but now we approach the final ward contest. 



There are 5 candidates contesting the Whau ward. The two-term incumbent is Ross Clow from Labour.



[ **Ross Clow – Labour Party $$$**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=fd4215ff-c988-47ed-ae33-5ce7f1459f6c&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Whau%20Ward)



Prior to the Super City amalgamation, Clow was on Waitakere Council serving as finance chairman. He narrowly lost to Noelene Rafills in 2010 but was successful in his second attempt in 2013. Phil Goff appointed Clow Chair of the Finance and Performance Committee.



Clow is also President of the Portage Licensing Trust which administers a monopoly over liquor sales in West Auckland and chairman of The Trusts Community Foundation which runs pokie machines in the trusts’ outlets around NZ and in some parts of West Auckland. That alone demonstrates why Clow doesn’t deserve to be a Councillor, but I’ll return to that in the final rating articles to come in a couple of days.



Clow’s voting record in the 2013-16 term includes some good



But mostly bad



Voting against intensification and for maintaining minimum floor sizes does far more to hurt housing affordability than token requirements to build affordable houses which are simply subsidised by higher prices in the rest of the development.



Ross Clow was naturally the first port of call when [The Spinoff](https://thespinoff.co.nz/local-elections/27-08-2019/can-we-find-a-single-councillor-who-supports-john-tamiheres-rates-freeze/) asked him what he thought of Mayoral candidate John Tamihere’s plan to freeze rates for three years. Clow didn’t seem to have a clear idea of how that saving would be achievable. Neither did Desley Simpson surprisingly, considering she has been vocal about saving $260 million over the past two years through her ‘Value for Money’ programme, on top of the $62 million in efficiency savings the Council has budgeted for over the next three years. Tamihere’s rates freeze is expected to cost $180 million.



On the other hand, Clow was part of a minority of councillors who voted to give Eden Park a no-interest loan, with no end date for payment, worth $53 million, payable if the Eden Park Trust is wound up and the land sold. Unfortunately, that vote was won by 12 councillors who elected to give Eden Park a no strings attached grant instead. I’d prefer the Council finally dealt to Helen Clark and her obstructive neighbours who must take some responsibility for the economic unviability of the stadium.



Clow is also pragmatic when it comes to managing the Council’s portfolio, in clear contrast to ideologues such as Mike Lee. In April, the Council sold its Graham Street offices in Auckland CBD for $58m. It is expected the sale will also save the Council $117m in maintenance costs over the next decade.



However, when it comes to Mayor Phil Goff, Clow is firmly in his corner. Whether that is due to being appointed Chair of the powerful Finance and Performance Committee is for you to decide. In 2018 he rated [Goff an 8/10 for his performance, saying](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12153375) “Introducing comprehensive water quality and environmental programmes, that will achieve in 10 years what previously would have taken 30 years, may well be the Goff legacy”.



[ **Paul Davie – Community Independents**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=908cf97d-d271-4d5e-838a-c4b5799c74f6&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Whau%20Ward) ****



I first came across Paul Davie when the Free Speech issue became hot in New Zealand, following Phil Goff’s false claim that he was stopping Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern being permitted to hire the Bruce Mason Theatre. I’ve regretted doing so ever since.



I spoke in favour of free speech because I believe it is impossible to preserve our liberal democracy without it. Davie spoke because he actually supports Molyneux and Southern. 



Davie has previously been a candidate for the Conservative Party in 2014, earning a perfect score in [Family First’s Value your Vote survey](http://valueyourvote.org.nz/2014-general-election/candidates/paul-davie) and in 2017, quoted as saying New Zealand was “God’s land not Maori land,” but left to form a breakaway party because the Conservatives weren’t Conservative enough. That resulted in the founding of One New Zealand which split into two One New Zealand Parties when the majority of the party board kicked [Davie and some other reprehensible creatures out](https://www.rightminds.nz/articles/paul-davies-statement-one-new-zealand-controversy).



Davie describes himself as steadfastly independent, serving no political master. Yet, he belongs to a ticket called Community Independents. You’re either independent or you’re on a ticket. Community Independents is a ticket.



Paul and Kathryn Davie lost their jobs as real estate agents for Ray White after historic comments about Muslims, Africans, Australian Senator Fraser Anning, multiculturalism and a warning by Kathryn that “civil war was coming” over the issue of teaching Te Reo in schools that were screenshotted and spread by far-left radical groups.



Don’t vote for him. Seriously…just don’t.



[ **Anne Degia-Pala – Independent**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=b0e67abe-a197-417f-b211-75c44943d233&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Whau%20Ward) **$$$**



Degia-Pala stood in the 2016 election, finishing fourth with 12.2% She is also one of the few Council candidates to sign the Auckland Ratepayers Alliance pledge to never vote for a measure which will result in rates increasing more than 2%



Degia-Pala has also been a [candidate for New Zealand First](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/96124428/seeing-first-home-buyers-outbid-led-a-tearful-degiapala-to-run-for-parliament), her candidacy announced by “the Maestro himself.” She is a Fijian-Indian who moved to New Zealand 30 years ago and switched from Labour after witnessing a young couple being out-bid at an auction next door by an Australian purchaser who owned seven other properties.



In 2017, a controversy brewed over a planned visit by prominent ex-Muslim speaker Ayaan Hirsi Ali, which was shortly cancelled due to fears for Ms Ali’s safety. [Anne Degia-Pala is Muslim](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2017/04/freedom-of-speech-under-attack-at-new-zealand-universities.html) and said while Ali’s talk may be interesting it isn’t representative of everyone’s experience. She disagreed with Ali’s views but agrees the threats go too far.



Anne is a board member of Drowning Prevention Auckland, NixCrew Road Safety Trust and a committee member of the National Lottery Outdoor Safety Committee. Previously she has held the roles of Waitakere Ethnic Board President, Auckland Council People’s Panel and Generosity New Zealand.



Her priorities should she be elected include upgrading footpaths and cycleways, financially responsible and accountable for debt reduction, supporting partners in environmental groups for healthy waterways and sustainable living programs and accessible public transport to ease traffic congestion and reduce emissions.



[ **Jessamine Fraser – Green Party**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=12d3c3df-5ba4-4feb-84b3-48511c7a0354&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Whau%20Ward) ****



Oh dear. It’s unicorns and rainbows should Fraser be elected. Her priorities include addressing housing issues whilst retaining accessible public spaces and protecting the unique environment. That translates to throwing your money at social housing (not a Council function), causing the waiting list for social housing to explode because if you fund it, they will come.



She wants to make Whau climate resilient by reducing waste through addressing the volume of “stuff wrapped around goods.” If she’s referring to produce sold in plastic bags, she is ignorant of the significant extension in shelf-life plastic packaging delivers and clueless about the impact removing “stuff wrapped around goods” will have on the poor as food waste and prices increase.



She wants income-linked Council housing expanded ensuring people aren’t forced out of their communities by development and rising house prices. The dingbat doesn’t understand that development, increasing the supply of housing on the market, relieves the pressure on house prices.



Fraser is excited by the strong sense of political engagement in the area (this was written pre-lowest voter turnout ever) and wants to be part of realising the potential that carries for grassroots action for arts, culture and heritage. She’s gonna splash your cash at artists producing crap nobody would willingly purchase.



[ **Tracy Mulholland – C &R – Communities and Residents**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=3aaaa2ad-450c-484f-84c6-2027d84049f3&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Whau%20Ward) **$$$**



Mulholland is the current Chair of Whau Local Board, though no longer a member of the Labour Party. She is also the New Lynn Business Association Manager.



While Chair Whau Local Board, she was involved in delivering a new Avondale Community facility and library, playgrounds and town centre upgrades. She also mentioned $105m for the Whau Pool and Recreation Centre, though a figure that high doesn’t come from local boards alone.



Whau Local Board is the first in Auckland to launch a specific plan for its ethnic population. A bit ignorant when you consider there are over 100 ethnicities in Whau, though not all will be considered ‘ethnic.’ I think this virtue signalling treads a dangerous line.



The only reference I can find to the reasons for Mulholland’s switch to C&R is hidden behind a Herald paywall.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermans Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Frank Bosse took a look at the July 2014 Arctic sea ice data. They found astonishing results. What follows is the Arctic sea ice part of the story I reported on here.
=====================================
The Sun In July 2014 And Arctic Sea Ice In Mid Summer
By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Every summer over the past years Arctic sea ice has been the subject of much public interest. Especially after 2006 there have been years (recall 2007 and 2012) when a large part of the Arctic ice cap melted away and all the talk was about the “Arctic death spiral“.
Since 1979 we have been collecting really good, validated and homogenized data from satellite observations that look at two important magnitudes: 1) the sea ice cover area in square kilometers, and 2) the so-called ice extent in square kilometers², i.e. that is at least 15% ice covered. The linear trend of this is indeed downward since observations began:

Figure 4: July sea ice extent since 1979. 
The excitement at the start of the melt season in May/June is always big. How many millions of square kilometers will still be left in September? Estimating this value is no easy task because upward deviations from the trend line have occurred time and again (like in the 1990s and early 2000s), and downward deviations (2007, 2011, 2012).
But last year and the year before the Arctic sea ice ended up close to the trend line. Every year the Sea Ice Prediction Network conducts a survey of educated guesses of sea ice extent expected by mid-September. This is what it looks like this year:

Figure 5: Forecast for September 2014 sea ice extent, from various sources and methods. Source: arcus.com.
For comparison, last year’s (2013) figure of 5.4 million km² is added in the chart. The mean value of this year’s estimates made in June is 4.8 million km², i.e. far above 2012’s record low value of 3.6 million km².
Also a co-author of this article participated; his forecast made in early July was 5.0 million km². He used the heat content of the Arctic basin and the existing ice volume at the end of the winter. There are many decisive factors that are impossible to know so early on, e.g. the weather (foremost the currents from warmer land and wind), and other natural factors.

We already know that every prediction is difficult, especially those dealing with the future. Having observed the development so far until the end of July, it is highly probable that we will see a repeat of 2013, which would mean that the mean of all those submitting a forecast will be approx. 0.6 million km² too low.
Only 5100 km³ melted in July 2014
The sea ice could turn out to be more robust than previously assumed. That has to do with a magnitude that is not visible in satellite images: the thickness of the ice – or its volume. Here we are left to rely on models. One that is often used is PIOMAS. It provides daily data on ice volume and the latest July value yields the following chart over the years:

Figure 6: Ice volume (1979 = 100%) as to PIOMAS for July 31 of each year, eight-year smoothed non-linear trend. 
July is a very important month during the melt season: In the Arctic the sun shines 24 hours per day, irradiance there exceeds that of the tropics as a result. The sun is also high above the horizon and so only about 15% of the sun’s radiation in the water is reflected. The open water absorbs large quantities of energy, which can melt the ice from the side and from underneath. And this year something completely unusual happened: while since 1979 approx. 6500 km³ melted in July, this year only 5100 km³ melted.

Figure 7: July ice volume loss plot since 1979. Shown are also the limits depicting 2 standard deviations (bold black lines). Source: psc.apl.washington.edu/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/data/.
The very low melt in 2014 is a 3-sigma event!
A negative record – since 1979 – that is unparalleled. The relatively steady decline shown in Figures 4 and 6 is deceptive – the ice of the current year is decisively determined by the previous year. To a great extent the series is auto-correlated. One sees the true development much better with the Figure 7 loss diagram.
Baffled experts
Something seems to have happened during the peak of summer to lead to a stopping of the downward trend. It was internal natural variability within our climate – it certainly was not the weather. All experts are currently baffled. This year the weather resembles more that of the year 2012, and back then there was a low point in ice volume development.
Over the last years natural variability has been increasingly used in climate science to explain away over-hasty predictions of greenhouse effects. Also the observations of the Arctic ice are adding to the scramble for explanations. If you are interested how the Arctic sea ice will finish in September – then stay tuned!

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline engineering news magazine Ingenieur.de here writes how Germany’s largest offshore wind park, Bard 1, hasn’t delivered any power since March due to “baffling faults” in the power transmission system.

The sub-heading states:
Baffling faults in the transmission systems have shut down Germany’s largest wind park in the North Sea. Since March experts have been searching for the bugs in the unreliable electrical technology, with no success up to now.”
Eighty 5 MW turbines sitting idle
Experts believe the problem could be in the HVDC transmission, which could be fault-prone. Ingenieur.de writes that the mega-sized wind park Bard 1 consists of 80 units 5-MW turbines. The immense losses incurred due to the shutdown with each passing aren’t difficult to fathom.

Ingenieur.de adds that the engineers don’t appear to be anywhere close to a long-term solution:
Up to now no one knows the cause of the transmission problems. The windpark hasn’t been delivering any power since March.”
The engineering magazine writes that the power generated offshore by the 80 turbines first flows to a collector station, where it is transformed to 380,000 volt AC power and sent to the BorWin 1 Platform before being sent onshore as 150,000 volts HVDC. Ingenieur.de writes: “However, this is not functioning.”
If the problem is indeed rooted in the HVDC technology, then Germany’s dream of supplying its demand with wind power will be in serious jeopardy. Ingenieur.de writes that should this be the case, “then the complete concept of the power providers, producers, grid operators and the German government is in danger.”
Poorly engineered
Ingenieur.de writes, however, that it is unlikely that the problem has to do with the HVDC technology, as it is successfully being used all over the world. The engineering magazine believes the problems likely stem from the technology that is placed just before the HVDC platform, which “was designed by Bard itself, and not by an experienced company like ABB, Siemens or General Electric.” (One can almost sense the schadenfreude).
Ingenieur.de notes that Bard is now financially insolvent, and that in the meantime grid operator TenneT is scrambling to find a solution, hoping the faults will be rectified in August.
Anyone following Germany’s man-on-the-moon-scale offshore windpark project will tell you that it is currently quite a huge mess. So much so that things can only get better.

 _Presented in association with[The Unshackled](https://www.theunshackled.net/). Trans-Tasman Talk (TTT) is hosted by Tim Wilms from Melbourne and Dieuwe de Boer from Auckland. The show debuts every Tuesday at 9pm New Zealand time and 7 pm Melbourne time. Episodes are broadcast live on Youtube via [Right Minds](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFcFU3Qv9lKc9rHEIqWd6Dw) and [The Unshackled](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHfXKg-zg-VrSVIu6AK5R0Q)_ and starting next Tuesday _[The BFD](https://thebfd.co.nz/)_



Both sides of the Tasman have switched over to daylight savings, and both the hosts are very much enjoying the instantaneous climate change it created. Extinction Rebellion protests kicked off this week, but are they Green or are they Red? This “rebellion” has the same anti-capitalist and pro-globalist message of all socialist action movements that came before it. There were dozens of arrests made throughout Australia and New Zealand, but the police were generally very soft and no charges were laid. PM Jacinda Ardern did not have any kind words for the “rebels” while in contrast, the leader of the opposition egged them on.



PM Scott Morison made another anti-globalist speech last week, and this one was endorsed by deputy PM Winston Peters. He’s sounding like his old nationalist self again, could he be gearing up the the 2020 general election? NZ First MP Shane Jones has threatened utu (revenge) against the forestry industry if they don’t vote NZ First. “I’ve shown you the money, now show me the votes,” he was reported to have said. He has been reprimanded by the Prime Minister, but not lost his portfolios.



New Zealand’s local elections conclude this week, and the media seems to have picked two front-runners for races throughout the country without any supporting polling at all. Avi Yemini, an Australian alt-media personality, faces the courts this week for charges related to his independent campaign in a state election.



It’s been 250 years since Captain Cook re-discovered New Zealand, but the event has not been marked with much celebration as the elites have been pushing a campaign to discredit the great explorer. Don Brash called for the resignation of the UK’s High Commissioner after it announced that there would be an apology for deadly confrontations between the Maori and Cook’s men.



Don Brash was the best prime minister New Zealand never had, a long-serving Reserve Bank governor, and is now a campaigner for racial equality and free speech. He remains a popular figure that the media can’t ignore.



Just before we went live there was an announcement that a database of NZ First members, with all the personal details, has been leaked to the media and opposition parties. There have been a number of other leaks related to NZ First over the past week, showing how disgruntled the membership is, and there is clearly a staffer or candidate with an axe to grind against Winston.



Finally, there was some good news to share: New Zealand will no longer be making donations to the Clinton Foundation — a policy which has seen both National and Labour governments give around $10m to the Clintons.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFritz Vahrenholt’s and Sebastian Lüning’s Die kalte Sonne website here directs our attention to a story appearing at the www.zukunft-skisport.at website.
It writes that by every measure winters in the European Alps have gotten “considerably colder” over the last 26 years.

Alps have gotten colder and snowier over last 26 years, data show.
Not long ago, “renowned scientists” were predicting that much of the ski industry would soon be disappearing in the European Alps and that vineyards would be moving in their place. Other scientists predicted that snow in the winter would soon be “a thing of the past“.
But according to data presented by zukunft-skisport.at, precisely the opposite is actually taking place.
Figure 1 at their site shows winter temperatures at the Hahnenkamm station at Kitzbühel (1790 m). Clearly the trend here is dramatic cooling (7.5°C per century) taking place over the last 20 years! Moreover 8 of the coldest winters occurred in the last 11 years alone.
Figure 2 shows the development of winter temperatures at the Ostalpen (East Alps) summit since 1970/71. The chart is the average of three stations: Säntis, Zugspitze and Sonnblick. Here as well the trend since 1988 is sharply downwards, thus causing global warming scientists’ eyebrows to hit the ceiling. In fact there hasn’t been any warming in 43 years, i.e. almost half a century!
Well, maybe the data being used are not really reliable. Banish the thought. Zukunft-skisport.at writes:
The measured data come from each of the official national institutions: ZAMG (Austria), DWD (Germany) and MeteoSwiss (Switzerland).”
And as many of us know, nobody measures things more precisely than these guys and gals do.
Figure 3 shows the temperature development for Ostalpen since 1988. On temperatures, Zukunft-skisport.at summarizes:

All measurements show that it has gotten colder in the mountains of the Ostalpen over the last 26 years. Emeritus Univ. Prof. Dr. Michael Kuhn, for years on the board at the Institute for Meteorology Innsbruck, formulated in a personal interview: ‘The fact is that winters in Tirol have gotten colder over the last 15 years.'”
No change in snow amounts in over four decades!
Not only temperatures have been rapidly declining. Also snow amounts in the European Alps have been rising, thus contradicting claims of warming. Zukunft-skisport.at:
Analogous to winter temperatures, also the snow amounts in the last 4 decades have not changed significantly, as they had been predicted to do.”
Figure 4 shows the development of snow depth at Saalfelden (800 m) since 1970/71. Year-to year variation is substantial. The 30-year moving average shows a slight decline. However, a substantial increase is shown since 1998.
Figure 5 shows the development of ski-lift operation days at Kitzbühel since 1992/93. Here as well we see a trend of more ski-days. The last two years have set new record highs!
Zukunft-skisport.at asks what should we expect for the future, and reminds its readers:
Currently 97.4 percent of the climate model simulations cannot correctly reproduce global climate reality. The ZAMG (2013, www.zamg.ac.at) therefore concludes in its essay ‘Temperature-Hiatus’: The research results of the last years are showing us more and more often that natural fluctuations in climate are considerable. The current temperature hiatus shows that the climate system is still not understood with regards to its full complexity and that the global climate models are still not adequate.“
So much for the myth of warming in the Alps of Europe. Global warming scientists have got to be embarrassed and humiliated. You couldn’t be more wrong if you tried.
=======================
EIKE here also pointed out last year that temperatures in Germany have been cooling over the last quarter century.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Justice Department urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump’s travel ban, arguing that a judicial block endangered national security and violated the separation of powers. Whatever the coming ruling, it will almost certainly be appealed to the Supreme Court. The legal and political backlash from the rollout of the order and other missteps have Mr. Trump and his top staff rethinking their improvisational approach to governing. We got an inside look at the confusion within the White House, where aides sometimes confer in the dark because they can’t figure out the light switches. Above, a protest after the ban was announced. _____ 2. With the ban blocked, dozens of Syrian and Iraqi refugees boarded a plane in Amman, Jordan, and headed to the U. S. full of hope but also some trepidation. “Goodbyes are difficult,” said one man. “But we are going where there will be a future for us. ” _____ 3. With the Senate already hinting it could work through the weekend, expect another busy week at the Capitol. Vice President Mike Pence could be called upon break a   tie in the Senate over the nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, could be confirmed this week, along with Scott Pruitt as head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Today’s episode of our new podcast, The Daily, focuses on Mr. Trump’s changes to   financial rules. Listen here if you’re on a computer, here if you have an iOS device or here for an Android device. _____ 4. Ajit Pai, the new head of Federal Communications Commission, wasted no time. His first target was net neutrality. He released about a dozen actions in the past week, many buried on the agency’s website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. _____ 5. Israel’s Parliament passed a provocative law that would retroactively legalize Jewish settlements on privately owned Palestinian land. It was an assertive move by the right wing  —   but the law will likely be struck down by the country’s high court. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on his way back from a meeting with Britain’s leaders as the law was being debated. _____ 6. Queen Elizabeth II’s sapphire jubilee, marking 65 years on the British throne, brought new coins, a stamp and gun salutes. The only thing missing? The queen, 90, who spent a private and reflective day out of the public eye. _____ 7. A    Syrian refugee in Germany whose selfie with Angela Merkel ended up on fake news websites is suing Facebook. The fake news articles linked him to terrorism, and he’s seeking to prevent Facebook from allowing users to repost the image. “Many people hate me, but all I did was take a selfie,” he said. _____ 8. Some remarkably good public health news: Researchers may have found the tools to stop cholera, the global pandemic that rose from the swamps of Bangladesh two centuries ago. Not only are there extremely effective treatments, but a vaccine accepted by the W. H. O. is being stockpiled for epidemics. And soon, there may be enough to begin routine vaccination in countries where the disease has a permanent foothold. _____ 9. The story of Ona Judge, a slave held by Martha Washington, the wife of George Washington, reveals a great deal about the harsh reality of slavery under a founding father often praised for having freed his slaves upon his death. Hearing that she was to be given away, Ms. Judge escaped from the presidential residence in Philadelphia in 1796, embarrassing the Washingtons. She got to New Hampshire, where she evaded George Washington’s dogged, sometimes illegal efforts to recapture her. “It’s saying, ‘Whatever I might think about slavery in the abstract, I should be able to do what I want with my property,’ ” one historian observed. Above, Erica Armstrong Dunbar, the author of a new book about Ms. Judge. _____ 10. What a game, huh? The New England Patriots made a comeback for the ages (and the record books) in the fourth quarter of the 51st Super Bowl. No team had ever come back from such a gaping deficit in the big game. But there has never been anyone like Tom Brady, either. Our columnist calls him “unbelievable and unforgettable,” even if as many people seem to despise him as love him. And while he set the stage for a ratings bonanza, early numbers indicate the game was less watched than last year’s. _____ 11. Americans may be divided, but some things still bring them together. Like meatloaf. Two Times writers, the   columnist Frank Bruni and the Congressional correspondent Jennifer Steinhauer, were able to bypass all kinds of societal fractures as they collected material from celebrity chefs and politicians for a book of 50 meatloaf recipes (including a vegetarian one) and related ruminations. Paul Ryan “was much more interested in talking to me about meatloaf than he was the earned tax credit,” Ms. Steinhauer said. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

"In late September, a group of tech leaders started a   effort to raise $100, 000 for Hillary Clinton. In flush Silicon Valley, that is spare change. But by the time the election was over, the campaign had pulled in only $76, 324. For all its visceral dislike of Donald J. Trump, the tech community did not worry too much about him being elected or, once in office, carrying through with his program. Lulled by favorable polls, distracted by its own destiny, Silicon Valley was above all else complacent. No longer. After President Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order restricting immigration,   has gone   political. Companies are being pushed by their employees, by their customers and sometimes by their ideals. They are trying to go far enough without going too far. Nearly 130 companies, most of them in the technology field, filed an amicus brief late Sunday in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which declined to reinstate the travel ban after a lower court blocked it. The brief, which was signed by an unusually broad coalition of large and small tech companies that included Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, Uber and Intel, said Mr. Trump’s order “violates the immigration laws and the Constitution. ” “Silicon Valley is stepping up,” said Sam Altman, who runs the valley’s most prominent   incubator, Y Combinator. “The companies are working on three fronts: They are vociferously objecting to the Trump policies they think are bad, they are trying to engage with him to influence his behavior, and they are developing new technology to work against policies and political discourse they don’t support. ” It is an improvised and complicated strategy. The companies are among the richest and most popular of American brands, which means they have a good deal of leverage. Yet they are also uniquely vulnerable  —   not only to presidential postings on Twitter and executive orders, but to the sentiments of their customers and employees, some of whom have more radical ideas in mind. Many of the companies initially placed their bets on engagement after an upbeat meeting with the   in December. That modest approach, which even the most   executive can endorse, showed its limits last week. After widespread customer defections,  Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, was forced to step down from one of the administration’s advisory councils. “People voted with their feet, and Travis listened,” said Dave McClure, who runs the 500 Startups incubator and started the Nerdz 4 Hillary group that tried to raise the $100, 000. “We need to hold the other tech leaders accountable in the same way. ” Resistance, Mr. McClure said, begins at home. “You don’t have a voice with the president if you didn’t vote for him,” he said. “But employees and customers have a voice with the tech companies. Silicon Valley should be demonstrating at the front doors of Google, Facebook and Twitter to make sure they share our values. ” Several factors are propelling Silicon Valley to the front lines of opposition to Mr. Trump. Some have been widely noted: The companies are often founded by and run by immigrants, which made the executive order on immigration offensive and a threat to their way of doing business. Tech companies frequently stress the importance of talent from other countries to their businesses. Less remarked on has been the political homogeneity of tech workers. “It’s not like you have 60 percent of the employees on one side and 40 percent on the other,” said Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “They all have the same leanings. ” Mr. Trump does have some support in Silicon Valley, most notably the venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Yet another factor pushing the companies is the perennially tight job market in technology. Executives cannot afford to alienate a large bloc of workers. Beyond this, there is the mythology of Silicon Valley, which holds that the work being done there is building a better future. Google’s former slogan “Don’t be evil” is the most forceful expression of this. “If you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through,” Mr. Shotts said. Since the executive order was issued, the companies have struggled to keep on the same page with their employees. Microsoft, for instance, initially made relatively muted comments that mostly celebrated immigration.   hours later, it was much blunter, calling the order “misguided and a fundamental step backwards,” and saying it would create “much collateral damage to the country’s reputation and values. ” At an   meeting at the beginning of the week with the chief executive, Satya Nadella, who was born in India, Microsoft employees expressed their concern. The company did not file a formal declaration supporting Washington State’s effort to block the order the way Amazon and Expedia did, but its public comments assisted the effort, Bob Ferguson, the state attorney general, said. The immigration battle is in Microsoft’s  .   of its employees were affected by the order, the company said. Some in Silicon Valley have more expansive hopes for the tech companies there. “In 2016, we saw how technology could be used to polarize ourselves to extreme levels,” said Mr. Altman of Y Combinator. “The most important thing we could do is figure out how to use technology to depolarize the nation. ” Mr. McClure of 500 Startups said it was ridiculous “for the chief executives of the valley to suggest things like hate speech and bullying speech aren’t solvable problems. Google has been solving the problem of spam for the last 10 years. No reason they can’t fix the monetization of fake news. ” Perhaps the companies just need a little push. On Sunday night, the Super Bowl was in overtime and a dreary winter rain was falling in San Francisco. That was not enough to deter more than 100 tech workers from showing up for a meeting of a new group, Tech Solidarity, that hopes to tackle some of these issues from the bottom up. Maciej Ceglowski, the organizer, canvassed the crowd. How many of you are immigrants? How many work for big tech companies? How many work for big tech companies that attended the Trump tech summit in December? In each case, numerous hands went up. Under the rules of the meeting, participants were not identified. It was a very geeky event. Much of it was a   for three legal aid groups that have been working to assist travelers caught in the ban. The speaker for the Council of   Relations was asked what she needed. She replied that she was having trouble with her customer relationship management software. “I’ve actually been pretty obsessed with C. R. M.s lately,” said a woman in the audience, volunteering to help. Mr. Ceglowski is a software engineer who runs the     Pinboard. He was visiting the United States in 1981 with his mother when martial law was declared in their native Poland. He is now an American citizen.   in tech circles as a caustic critic of the large tech companies and their attitude to issues like privacy, he took on the activist mantle shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. Since then, Tech Solidarity has held rallies in Portland, Ore. New York Seattle Boston and other cities. He talked about Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, the author of “Lean In,” which asks women, “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?” Mr. Ceglowski noted that Ms. Sandberg found time to go see Mr. Trump, but not to go to the women’s march on Washington. The crowd laughed. Ms. Sandberg has said that she had a personal obligation that kept her from the march. When Facebook employees did their own protest last week, he pointed out, it was done in secret so no one knew about it. “We have to protest in public,” he said. The event raised $30, 000 for the legal aid groups. “It looked like   of the room were newcomers,” Mr. Ceglowski said after the event was over. Unlike the great Silicon Valley companies, which seemed to blossom overnight, he said he knew progress here would be slow. But he was hopeful that some of the attendees were previously apolitical folk who had taken their first steps to engagement. “I want pressure from below to counterbalance the pressure management is already feeling from above,” he said. “We have to make sure we’re pushing at least as hard as Trump is. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the weather craziness of the week story.
Officials of the German town of Reutlingen have voted to allocate 50,000 euros in a bid to tame the bad weather that typically occurs during thunderstorms. The plan is to hire an airplane to spray silver iodide into storm clouds with the hopes of reducing the size of hail, and so reduce property damage on the ground.
Hat tip meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann at Twitter.
The Reutlinger General-Anzeiger writes:
Exactly one year since the devastating hailstorm over Reutlingen, local politicians indeed want to support the use of a hail plane. On Monday evening the county council voted by a wide majority to allocate 50,000 euros for this, a spokeswoman said.”
They actually believe this is going to work!
In response, high-profile Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann writes at Twitter: “Now it’s out: Germany’s dumbest politicians are located in the Reutlingen legislature.”
Mr. Kachelmann has written before on the topic of using the bright yellow “weather-making” chemical, claiming that the method has a very low success rate and that certain conditions have to be right on the borderline for it to work. Overall Kachelmann characterizes the practice as “nonsense”.

Kachelmann also notes with sarcasm that the process seems to work especially after weathermen have already forecast the desired effect is going to take place anyway. Wow, the hailstones were pretty small this time. The silver iodide spraying worked!
I’ve also inquired with veteran meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls of the European institute of Climate and Energy (EIKE). He also agrees that the spraying is nonsense, writing that “over the decades there have been serious! attempts time and again and entire projects devoted to this. All of them failed and were stopped.”
Citizens demanding politicians do something about the bad weather
Not only might the dumbest politicians be found in Reutlingen, but also the dumbest citizens, too. The Reutlinger General-Anzeige writes:
Lately in Reutlingen the call from citizens and companies for hail defense has gotten increasingly louder. In Stuttgart and in the Black Forest hail planes have been in use for years to prevent damage.”
Apparently the citizens of Reutlingen really do believe their local government has power over weather. Moreover, these citizens appear no longer able to take steps on their own to protect themselves – seemingly unaware that there are other options available to them, like insurance, or carports. Like the German government is expected to save the world’s climate, the citizens of Reutlingen also expect their local politicians to save them from bad weather.
If you happen to have a Brooklyn Bridge to sell, go to Reutlingen!

"Many Australians enjoy a glass of homegrown wine, and $2.78bn worth is exported each year. But hotter, drier conditions under climate change means there are big changes ahead for our wine producers. As climate scientists and science communicators, we’ve been working closely with the wine industry to understand the changing conditions for producing quality wine in Australia. We created a world-first atlas to help secure Australia’s wine future. Released today, Australia’s Wine Future: A Climate Atlas shows that all 71 wine regions in Australia must adapt to hotter conditions. Cool wine regions such as Tasmania, for example, will become warmer. This means growers in that state now producing pinot noir and chardonnay may have to transition to varieties suited to warmer conditions, such as shiraz. Our research, commissioned by Wine Australia, is the culmination of four years of work. We used CSIRO’s regional climate model to give very localised information on heat and cold extremes, temperature, rainfall and evaporation over the next 80 years. The research assumed a high carbon emissions scenario to 2100, in line with Earth’s current trajectory. From 2020, the changes projected by climate models are more influenced by climate change than natural variability. Temperatures across all wine regions of Australia will increase by about 3℃ by 2100. Aridity, which takes into account rainfall and evaporation, is also projected to increase in most Australian wine regions. Less frost and more intense heatwaves are expected in many areas. By 2100, growing conditions on Tasmania’s east coast, for example, will look like those currently found in the Coonawarra region of South Australia – a hotter and drier region where very different wines are produced. That means it may get harder to grow cool-climate styles of varieties such as chardonnay and pinot noir. Some regions will experience more change than others. For example, the Alpine Valleys region on the western slopes of the Victorian Alps, and Pemberton in southwest Western Australia, will both become much drier and hotter, influencing the varietals that are most successfully grown. Other regions, such as the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, will not dry out as much. But a combination of humidity and higher temperatures will expose vineyard workers in those regions to heat risk on 40-60 days a year – most of summer – by 2100. That figure is currently about 10 days a year, up from 5 days historically. Grapevines are very adaptable and can be grown in a variety of conditions, such as arid parts of southern Europe. So while adaptations will be needed, our projections indicate all of Australia’s current wine regions will be suitable for producing wine out to 2100. Australia’s natural climate variability means winegrowers are already adept at responding to change. And there is much scope to adapt to future climate change. In some areas, this will mean planting vines at higher altitudes, or on south-facing slopes, to avoid excessive heat. In future, many wine regions will also shift to growing different grape varieties. Viticultural practices may change, such as training vines so leaves shade grapes from heat. Growers may increase mulching to retain soil moisture, and areas that currently practice dryland farming may need to start irrigating. The atlas enables climate information and adaptation decisions to be shared across regions. Growers can look to their peers in regions currently experiencing the conditions they will see in future, both in Australia and overseas, to learn how wines are produced there. Agriculture industries such as wine-growing are not the only ones that need fine-scale climate information to manage their climate risk. Forestry, water management, electricity generation, insurance, tourism, emergency management authorities and Defence also need such climate modelling, specific to their operations, to better prepare for the future. The world has already heated 1C above the pre-industrial average. Global temperatures will continue to rise for decades, even if goals under the Paris climate agreement are met. If Earth’s temperature rise is kept below 1.5C or even 2C this century, many of the changes projected in the atlas could be minimised, or avoided altogether. Australia’s wine industry contributes $45bn to our economy and supports about 163,000 jobs. Decisions taken now on climate resilience will dictate the future of this critical sector.

"Animal welfare is a term that frequently pops up in headlines, most recently in the debate over how animals are killed for kosher and halal food. But the concept of animal welfare is often misunderstood, as recently illustrated by the public response to the euthanasia of Marius the giraffe.   A simple and widely used definition of animal welfare is that it is the quality of life an animal experiences. The problem is what we mean by quality of life. Even within the same social group, individuals can have very different ideas about this. I, for example, most highly value being able to travel and experience new cultures with my family. Whereas, for others quality of life comes from the security of owning a home and having possessions. What this tell us is that animal welfare and indeed human welfare are concepts that need to be measured on the individual level: there is no one size that fits all. To illustrate how difficult it can be to measure animal welfare on an individual level, let us look at an example. I am terrified of rollercoasters. My sister loves them. Imagine my sister and I are sat side-by-side on a scary rollercoaster. If during the ride, someone were to measure our physiological responses, blood pressure and stress hormone release, they would be identical.   Our blood pressures would soar and our adrenal glands would start to release the flight or fight response hormones. At the end of the ride, my sister would be there with her arms in the air wishing to go again, whereas I would be kissing the ground in happiness that I had survived.  This highlights how animal welfare is about how an individual feels about a situation. Thus, simple physiological parameters on their own, such as stress hormones, do not illuminate much about animal welfare. We need also to measure what an animal feels about a situation – this is a significant challenge to science. There are many misconceptions about animal welfare and some of the most common ones are associated with death and longevity. This should not surprise us since some of the greatest human achievements in the last century have involved increasing human lifespan. The innate fear of death in humans often drives the public to equate well-being with longevity; for example, annually members of the international media celebrate the birthday of the world’s oldest person.   Humans often believe that animals in captivity must live long lives to experience a good level of welfare. But, if I were to offer people the choice of living to 120 years old as a very poor person or 60 years old as a very rich person, most would choose the second option because, in general, wealth equates with quality of life (though not necessarily happiness). It may shock some people to know that the life of many farm animals is incredibly short, your Sunday roast chicken was only forty something days old and the bacon in your morning sandwich about nine months old when slaughtered.  From an animal welfare perspective, this is not a problem if they had a good quality of life before they died. Why do animal welfare scientists think this way? Because for them, death is not a welfare issue, providing it is humane. A humane death is one where the animal immediately loses consciousness through either instantaneous death or effective stunning. There is little evidence that species other than humans or, perhaps, apes have a concept of death. I remember watching a video of free-range pigs – highly intelligent social animals – being slaughtered humanely (electrically stunned) in a field and being impressed by how they did not respond to the death of a littermate killed by their side.  The Scottish poet, Robert Burns, captured the problem of the human condition when compared to most animals in his poem “To a mouse”, where he relates the words of a ploughman apologising to a mouse whose home he destroyed: Still thou are blest, compared wi’ me!
The present only toucheth thee:
But Och! I backward cast my e’e
On prospects drear!
An’ forward, tho’ I cannot see,
I guess an’ fear!   In this last verse, Burns identifies the key point that we should not project human thoughts or feelings on to animals, but accept them as they are.   Not having a concept of death is not necessarily a bad thing for animals, the ability to think about the future leads us humans to think about our own mortality and for many people this a considerable source of angst. Humans are of course able to hold and rationalise apparently incompatible views such as accepting the infanticide on their dinner plate while protesting about the euthanasia of a giraffe. Why should we be bothered about animal welfare? From an ethical standpoint, society has already determined that we are responsible for animals being in captivity and so we are responsible for their well-being. From an economic perspective, good animal welfare makes sense – it enables us to produce better quality meat. Considering more than 50 billion farm animals are slaughtered annually for food production, good animal welfare makes good business sense, which perhaps goes beyond fulfilling our moral obligations."

Dear Editor



I am going through a pessimistic stage over the future of New Zealand. I can see Western civilisation being defunct in about 20 years and climate change has nothing to do with it.  
The problem as I see it is a combination of immigration, declining European birth rate, these stupid socialists and their tax-everything approach and the undue influence of the Muddy browns (What you get when you cross green with red: the Greens). 



These idiots are succeeding in alienating the petrochemical industry and persecuting farmers. There is undue pressure to change to renewable resources (even though the generation capacity is doubtful), the alienating of social groups – think legal gun owners and now the abandonment of Christian values. There is the Islamisation of our society, the failure of ministers to supervise their portfolios and their obvious lack of business acumen. Then there are the scandals swept under the carpet, the foreign journalists’ adulation of a totally inadequate figurehead for our country, the abandonment of reason and the death of common sense and the weaponisation of our young people by those in their 40s.



And that is only a start. **Seriously, I think Western society has had its day.** Even Trump can’t hold the Dems in check and roll out his MAGA policies. Europe is stuffed, Soros with his countries without borders and uncontrolled immigration has seen to that. Britain has no future without separating from the French influence.



Cheerful little fellow, am I not?

 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with $ being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **Waitemata & Gulf Ward**



Waitemata & Gulf is one of the smaller Council wards, stretching from Western Springs in the west, stopping at Parnell in the east including the CBD area. It also includes Waiheke and Great Barrier Island. I had a crack at it in 2013 getting narrowly beaten by blank votes. Mike Lee has been a councillor since 2010 and was widely expected to retire but is putting himself forward for a fourth term.



Most recent voter turnout figures show that voting is down 19.6% on 2016 and the Waitemata local board area is 24.5% behind.



[ **Pippa Coom – City Vision**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=29e1d0f3-cc64-4360-94c5-2d443552df93&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Waitemat%C4%81%20and%20Gulf%20Ward) ****



Pippa topped the voting totals in Waitemata Local Board elections in 2016 and probably viewed herself as heir apparent for the ward seat until Mike Lee decided to run again. Pippa has been on the local board for 3 terms and is currently the Chair.



Coom is on the radical left end of the spectrum; a cycle lanes and bus fanatic with a commitment to social justice and ownership of public assets. She will continue the anti-car mantra of former Auckland design champion Ludo Campbell, seeking to slash urban speed limits, increase traffic-free zones throughout the CBD and try to [achieve the UN Agenda 2030 goals](https://www.pippacoom.co.nz/news/call-for-vision-zero-to-be-adopted-for-nz-to-bring-down-road-toll/). She is also on the steering committee for Grey Lynn 2030, preparing Auckland for the challenges of [peak oil and climate change](https://good.net.nz/article/pippa-coom).



Climate Action features very highly on Pippa’s priorities saying “A just transition to a low-emissions and climate-ready city; every decision of Auckland Council must contribute to fighting the climate and ecological crisis.” Unfortunately, there is very little impact she can make on the climate but she is determined to make a horrendous economic impact trying. Worse, whatever the condition of Auckland’s climate in a decade, there is no way of knowing if she succeeded or didn’t try hard enough. Whatever the result she will put her foot to the floor, full speed ahead as long as Auckland keeps electing her.



[ **Mike Lee – Independent**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=9eb2938f-19f2-4d1c-8995-e8462fd9ca2e&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Waitemat%C4%81%20and%20Gulf%20Ward) **$**



After 27 years in local body politics, starting with being elected to the Auckland Regional Council in 1992 and representing Waitemata & Gulf for 9 years, Lee has decided there is still life in the old bugger yet and wants another term. Mike is a bit of an enigma, far-left politically but stubbornly independent and outspoken. He ditched the City Vision grouping several years ago, opposes Phil Goff’s Mayoralty and is critical of the Council’s wasteful spending culture.



Lee is also a heritage-warrior, advocating stronger protections on heritage scheduled buildings and historic townscapes, caring little for the property rights of the owners. It is incredibly arrogant and totalitarian to think that subjective opinions on kilometres of views justify onerous regulations on what you can do with your own home.



Mike Lee opposes the current plan for trams to the Airport, he wants heavy rail to the airport instead! The wasteful Wynyard waterfront tram system, which is isolated from the rest of the rail network should also be linked to Britomart according to Lee. I’d rather send it to the scrapyard.



Mr Lee also opposes the sale of any and all council ‘assets, including the asbestos riddled, Category A heritage-listed Auckland Council Civic Administration Building. Asbestos removal alone is forecast to cost $5-10m and the heritage status that Lee is such a big proponent of makes it a very expensive building to modify. Phil Goff believes the building could cost the ratepayer $80m to refurbish. Panuku Development Auckland is flicking it off for $3m which is ridiculously cheap for an office block and land in the middle of the CBD. Perhaps they should scrap the heritage status to improve the price.



He has his good sides though, especially regarding AT’s [ideological transport crusade,](https://twitter.com/greaterakl/status/960284306370211840?lang=en) and the [predictable cost blowout](http://cubic.co.nz/mike-lee-city-rail-link-billion-dollar-blow-out-twyford-goff-asleep-at-the-switch/) building the CRL. But I’m hesitant to think that good is enough to offset the bad.



Lee says of his decision to stand for a fourth term, “I am dismayed at the situation Auckland is in. I firmly believe the ‘Super City is the worst thing that has ever happened to Auckland.



“The people of Auckland have to endure an arrogant, overbearing council/CCO bureaucracy, appalling financial mismanagement and waste.”



The Super City has got that way on your watch, Mike. You’re not doing anyone a favour hanging around longer.



[ **Allan Matson – Independent**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=1a5645cf-acca-4bc2-accf-25a7fa388771&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Waitemat%C4%81%20and%20Gulf%20Ward) ****



Ladies and Gentleman, radical left candidate number 3. If this was an episode of Blind Date, you’d be poking both eyes out. I don’t quite recall the name or face, but seeing the candidate photo alone was enough to detect pretentious, nosey, central planner. I guess tan jackets must be their unofficial uniform. I’ll never wear one again.



Matson was a merchant banker for 10 years but I guess it didn’t make him feel sufficiently important so he retrained as an architect and has worked the last 15 years as a heritage consultant. Mike Lee and Pippa Coom are the sort of politicians that sustain people like Matson, who appreciates “the complexity of dealing with Council processes, but somehow I have developed the patience for it.” 



Matson is standing for Council because “I love Auckland and do not want its future growth to be characterised by ugly development.”



Who the hell does he think he is? Who defines ugly and why is their opinion more important than the person who owns and pays for it?[ As far back as 2004,](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3565774) Matson has been interfering in other people’s business driven by a zealotry that is as dangerous as it is self-important. If he values these buildings so much, the right thing to do is stump up his own cash and do nothing with them. 



Allan’s entire reason for standing is to stop you doing what he doesn’t like on your property. He has no other policies. Few politicians could possibly be any more morally empty or parasitical. 



Matson is so self-absorbed that reading his pitch for your votes is far more damaging than anything else I could say about him.



 _“I think I could usefully bring my considerable knowledge and experience to the table, and further more my membership of Council’s Heritage Advisory Panel and various boards including the former NZ Historic Places Trust have provided me with insights and governance experience that would also be useful._



 _“After living here for 25 years, studying architecture and specialising in heritage, I’ve built up a great knowledge of the fabric of the city and the fascinating stories that reside in the environment built up here over the years.”_



[ **Will Maxwell-Steele – Independent**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=4ed02ad8-b655-4dbf-a4cf-1603f5354691&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Waitemat%C4%81%20and%20Gulf%20Ward) **$$$$**



If you’ve driven around the CBD, you may have seen some small red signs with a cartoon of Trump on them but no time to read anything else as you continued on your journey. Will is the candidate behind those signs, pointing out Trump’s victory in the Presidential elections was the result of 47% of Americans not voting.



Will has a few things to learn about retail politics, such as the KISS principle. (Keep it Simple Stupid). Will probably despises retail politics, having been a self-employed contractor most of his life before joining the family property investment and development business. He is standing out of pure frustration at dealing with the Council. 



_“The Council hired a fire engineer to sign off work, who ran a competing fire engineering business, based in Christchurch, and only came to Auckland one day a month! The manager’s reply when I questioned this… “I know it’s a conflict, but what can you do?”_



I think I’m going to like Will. Have a look at Will’s[ website](http://www.waitemata.co.nz/?fbclid=IwAR22E-nr4epzodLwNmw9VqfCVtdpTWQ0h9z2zzjFPeElDEiUds6TcI_ZrTk) because I think you will too. Will is also one of the few Council candidates to sign Auckland Ratepayer’s Alliance pledge promising not to vote in favour of rates increases exceeding 2%.



It’s unfortunate that he isn’t really a contender in this race. Hopefully, he has another shot at standing for Council and thrashes the 2022 incumbent



[ **Sarah Trotman – C &R – Communities and Residents**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=439641ff-d6ee-4198-9e49-979c6828d72d&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=Waitemat%C4%81%20and%20Gulf%20Ward) **$$$**



Trotman models herself as a no-nonsense CEO who won’t tolerate incompetence from bureaucrats but I’m not 100% convinced. While she has received a ONZM for services to business and the community in 2017, she has also been chair of AUT’s Women on Campus which hints at liberal wetness.



As Chief Executive of Business Mentors New Zealand, she supervises free business mentoring for over 3,000 small businesses. She also mentors young women under the YWCA Future Leaders Programme and is a supporter of the Auckland Foundation’s Women’s Fund.



Other projects Trotman has helped establish include the Lifewise Big Sleepout and Spend My Super, a charitable trust that facilitates wealthy retirees donating their unwanted super addressing child poverty.



Her candidate profile is big on her story but virtually policy-free. I suppose C&R are planning to get her elected based on her affiliation but I need to see more.



 **MY RECOMMENDATION:** You have one vote in this FPP contest

Thirteen Years of Greening from SeaWiFS – image from NASA Earth Observatory

Elevated carbon dioxide making arid regions greener
31 May 2013
AGU Release No. 13-24
WASHINGTON, DC—Scientists have long suspected that a flourishing of green foliage around the globe, observed since the early 1980s in satellite data, springs at least in part from the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere. Now, a study of arid regions around the globe finds that a carbon dioxide “fertilization effect” has, indeed, caused a gradual greening from 1982 to 2010.
Focusing on the southwestern corner of North America, Australia’s outback, the Middle East, and some parts of Africa, Randall Donohue of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Canberra, Australia and his colleagues developed and applied a mathematical model to predict the extent of the carbon-dioxide (CO2) fertilization effect. They then tested this prediction by studying satellite imagery and teasing out the influence of carbon dioxide on greening from other factors such as precipitation, air temperature, the amount of light, and land-use changes.

The team’s model predicted that foliage would increase by some 5 to 10 percent given the 14 percent increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the study period. The satellite data agreed, showing an 11 percent increase in foliage after adjusting the data for precipitation, yielding “strong support for our hypothesis,” the team reports.
“Lots of papers have shown an average increase in vegetation across the globe, and there is a lot of speculation about what’s causing that,” said Donohue of CSIRO’s Land and Water research division, who is lead author of the new study. “Up until this point, they’ve linked the greening to fairly obvious climatic variables, such as a rise in temperature where it is normally cold or a rise in rainfall where it is normally dry. Lots of those papers speculated about the CO2 effect, but it has been very difficult to prove.”
He and his colleagues present their findings in an article that has been accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union.
The team looked for signs of CO2 fertilization in arid areas, Donohue said, because “satellites are very good at detecting changes in total leaf cover, and it is in warm, dry environments that the CO2 effect is expected to most influence leaf cover.” Leaf cover is the clue, he added, because “a leaf can extract more carbon from the air during photosynthesis, or lose less water to the air during photosynthesis, or both, due to elevated CO2.” That is the CO2 fertilization effect.
But leaf cover in warm, wet places like tropical rainforests is already about as extensive as it can get and is unlikely to increase with higher CO2 concentrations. In warm, dry places, on the other hand, leaf cover is less complete, so plants there will make more leaves if they have enough water to do so. “If elevated CO2 causes the water use of individual leaves to drop, plants will respond by increasing their total numbers of leaves, and this should be measurable from satellite,” Donohue explained.
To tease out the actual CO2 fertilization effect from other environmental factors in these regions, the researchers first averaged the greenness of each location across 3-year periods to account for changes in soil wetness and then grouped that greenness data from the different locations according to their amounts of precipitation. The team then identified the maximum amount of foliage each group could attain for a given precipitation, and tracked variations in maximum foliage over the course of 20 years. This allowed the scientists to remove the influence of precipitation and other climatic variations and recognize the long-term greening trend.
In addition to greening dry regions, the CO2 fertilization effect could switch the types of vegetation that dominate in those regions. “Trees are re-invading grass lands, and this could quite possibly be related to the CO2 effect,” Donohue said. “Long lived woody plants are deep rooted and are likely to benefit more than grasses from an increase in CO2.”
“The effect of higher carbon dioxide levels on plant function is an important process that needs greater consideration,” said Donohue. “Even if nothing else in the climate changes as global CO2 levels rise, we will still see significant environmental changes because of the CO2 fertilization effect.”
This study was funded by CSIRO’s Sustainable Agriculture Flagship, Water for a Healthy Country Flagship, the Australian Research Council and Land & Water Australia.

"**A polythene bag manufacturer has been left with seven million items of personal protective equipment (PPE) after being ""dropped like a stone"", it has claimed.**
Polythene UK started making the aprons during the first lockdown.
Managing director James Woollard said its orders were cancelled ""overnight"" leaving it in a ""horrendous"" situation.
But the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said huge global demand had created a ""highly competitive market"".
Mr Woollard said the Witney-based company supplied the PPE packed loose, and was dropped once the NHS could get hold of PPE on a roll.
He said it was also impacted by cheaper PPE from overseas.
Mr Woollard first had the idea to start making aprons when orders for his regular products stopped during lockdown.
The company adapted a design used to make jackets for lambs, and soon had orders of 1.2 million.
He said: ""We started manufacturing these things as fast as we could.""
The company made 30 million items of PPE in total, but demand suddenly fell.
It has since given away a million items to care homes for free.
The company has already lost Â£160,000 because of the project, with pallets of PPE stockpiled ""as far as the eye can see"".
Mr Woollard said: ""We naively thought that because we were there when the pandemic hit that these guys would be there to help usâ¦ [but there was] no warning at all.""
Ian Hudspeth, leader of Oxfordshire County Council, called the situation ""unfortunate"".
He said: ""It's disappointing that he has been left with all this supply because he changed his production so he was able to step up and manufacture aprons which were massively needed at the time.""
A DHSC spokesperson said it received an ""extraordinary response"" to its call for PPE and ""all offers were prioritised based on volume, price, quality and lead time, with proper due diligence carried out on contracts"".

"**Hospitality staff in some level two areas of Scotland are facing a ""torrent of abuse"" when turning away central belt visitors, MSPs have been told.**
Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group, detailed instances of abuse directed at workers, which he described as ""frankly unacceptable"".
He said it was due to travellers going from level four to level two areas.
The Scottish government condemned such incidents and said all its decisions were aimed at keeping people safe.
People living in level three or level four local authorities - covering much of central Scotland - are currently not allowed to make non-essential journeys outside their own council area.
Different hospitality arrangements are also in place across the different levels.
Discussing his own hotel in Lockerbie, Mr Montgomery said: ""The weekend before last we were subjected to a torrent of abuse from people coming from the central belt - possibly going to the Gretna Gateway area to do some Christmas shopping.
""We had a protocol where we ask for a postcode and where they're coming from when people ring.
""Whenever you tell them you can't take the booking because of where they're from, the abuse staff are taking is frankly unacceptable.""
Mr Montgomery said both operators and customers had been left confused by the current system.
He said some staff in Dumfries and Galloway had also been subjected to abuse from people who had travelled from the central belt only to find they could not be served in pubs or restaurants.
He said there had been similar cases in the Scottish Borders and other areas in level two.
Giving evidence to MSPs, he said: ""We are faced with so many different tier systems that from one week we're open, next week we're not, we don't know where we are.""
He said that led to ""confusion"" for businesses and customers.
The Scottish government said it condemned any abuse of staff doing their part to ensure restrictions and guidelines were followed.
It said it had to balance measures to suppress the virus and protect lives with keeping businesses open and trading viably.
A spokesperson added it believed the current restrictions achieved that but it would continue ""constructive"" dialogue with the hospitality industry to listen to its concerns."

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s executive order on immigration has prompted a constitutional showdown that could leave a mark on the law for generations and seems likely to end in a landmark Supreme Court decision. A ruling by the court on Mr. Trump’s travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries could help answer some crucial legal questions: How much independent constitutional authority does the president have over immigration, and how much power has Congress given him? The likely answer to both questions: a lot. But other parts of the Constitution may temper or defeat that power. Among them are the due process and equal protection clauses and the First Amendment’s ban on government establishment of religion. Here is a look at the leading arguments in the case. Many trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump’s executive order. But none have issued an order as broad as the one by Judge James Robart, a federal judge in Seattle, who blocked the key parts of  the executive order, which had suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation’s refugee program. The case is now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. That court on Saturday declined to issue an immediate stay of Judge Robart’s order, but it indicated that it would weigh in soon after additional briefs were filed, with the last one due Monday afternoon. After it rules, an appeal to the Supreme Court seems likely. Judge Robart’s brisk ruling contained almost no reasoning. By contrast, Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, of the Federal District Court in Boston, issued a   decision on Friday refusing to block the program and discussing the legal arguments in detail. Judge Gorton also sketched out the broader picture. “The rich immigrant history of the United States has long been a source of strength and pride in this country,” Judge Gorton wrote. “Conversely, the public interest in safety and security in this   dangerous world is strong as well. ” The balance, he wrote, tipped in favor of Mr. Trump. Article II of the Constitution confers authority on the president, the Supreme Court has said, to conduct foreign affairs and address immigration. In their brief to Judge Robart, lawyers for Washington State, one of the two plaintiffs, along with the State of Minnesota, said there were constitutional checks on these powers. “While courts generally give more latitude to the political branches in the immigration context, this does not mean that the political branches can act with impunity,” the brief said. “Federal courts,” the brief said, “have no more sacred role than protecting marginalized groups against irrational, discriminatory conduct. ” In the Ninth Circuit, the Trump administration said judges were   to decide cases involving national security. “Unlike the president,” the administration’s brief said, “courts do not have access to classified information about the threat posed by terrorist organizations operating in particular nations, the efforts of those organizations to infiltrate the United States, or gaps in the vetting process. ” Noah G. Purcell, the solicitor general of Washington State, appeared to concede in court that there were areas in which Mr. Trump was entitled to act. But he asked the court to protect people whose lives had been changed by Mr. Trump’s order in a flash. “The focus of our claim,” he said, “is on people who have been here and have, overnight, lost the right to travel, lost the right to visit their families, lost the right to go perform research, lost the right to go speak at conferences around the world. And also people who had lived here for a long time and happened to be overseas at the time of this order, which came with no warning whatsoever, and suddenly lost the right to return to the United States. ” On Friday, defending Mr. Trump’s executive order in a Seattle courtroom, Michelle Bennett, a Justice Department lawyer, cited Youngstown Sheet  Tube Co. v. Sawyer, a 1952 decision in which the Supreme Court rejected President Harry S. Truman’s assertion that he had the authority to seize steel mills during the Korean War. The most famous part of the decision is a concurrence from Justice Robert H. Jackson, which set out a framework for considering clashes between presidential power and congressional authority. The president has the most power when he acts with congressional authorization, Justice Jackson said, and an intermediate amount when Congress is silent. The president’s power is at its “lowest ebb,” Justice Jackson wrote, when Congress has forbidden a particular action. Truman’s actions fell into the third category, Justice Jackson wrote. Ms. Bennett, by contrast, said Mr. Trump’s order was in the first category. “Here we have the president acting pursuant to power that Congress gave him, which means, under the Youngstown steel seizure case, he’s acting at the apex of his power,” she said. A key part of immigration law does give the president broad power. It says, “Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. ” But another part of the law forbids discrimination “because of the person’s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence,” but only “in the issuance of an immigrant visa. ” The Trump administration argues that the power to bar entry, the subject of the first law, is broader than the limits on issuing visas. Lawyers for Washington State have said that the executive order violates the First Amendment’s prohibition against government establishment of religion because its provisions on the refugee program favor minority religions. “President Trump and his advisers have made clear that the very purpose of this order is to tilt the scales in favor of Christian refugees at the expense of Muslims,” they wrote in their brief to Judge Robart. The Trump administration urged the Ninth Circuit to reject arguments based on religious discrimination, even though Mr. Trump has said he meant to favor Christian refugees. Judicial consideration of the president’s motives, the brief said, would violate the separation of powers. “The more searching inquiry envisioned by the states would create substantial    problems, by permitting probing of the president’s subjective motive in issuing the order,” the brief said. The states challenging the order face the initial hurdle of demonstrating that they have suffered the sort of direct and concrete harm that gives them standing to sue. Judge Robart ruled that they did, relying on a decision from the federal appeals court in New Orleans, which said Texas could sue to challenge President Barack Obama’s plan to defer the deportation of millions of unauthorized immigrants and allow them to work. “The executive order adversely affects the states’ residents in areas of employment, education, business, family relations and freedom to travel,” Judge Robart wrote. He said the states had been hurt because the order affected their public universities and their tax bases. In its Ninth Circuit brief, the Trump administration called the states’ asserted injuries “attenuated and speculative” and did not address the Texas decision. In court in Seattle on Friday, Ms. Bennett said the government disagreed with the Texas ruling."
"**The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved by the regulatory body, the MRHA for widespread use.**
About 25,000 doses are set to arrive in Northern Ireland from next week and vaccinations could begin shortly after.
That is a few days ahead of schedule from the original estimate of 14 December.
But what does the vaccine's arrival mean and how will the rollout of the vaccination programmes work?
BBC News NI understands vaccinators will be the first to get the jab, from 9 December.
After that, interim guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) states the first people to get the vaccine should be residents in a care home for older adults and their carers.
They would be followed by those aged 80 and over as well as frontline health and social care workers.
The JCVI is a committee set up specifically for the purpose of deciding the order in which vaccines will be given.
The NI Department of Health has confirmed it will be following the JCVI's recommendations.
The first delivery of the vaccine coming to the UK contains 800,000 doses, with 25,000 for Northern Ireland.
It is expected that mass vaccination will only become available from the summer of 2021, according to previous comments from the health minister.
Robin Swann said there would be ""no quick fix"" and that it would be ""many months before the vaccination programme is complete"".
Mr Swann said ""next summer would be the extent of their plans"" when talking about a timeframe for widespread vaccinations.
Patricia Donnelly, who is heading up the vaccine rollout programme in Northern Ireland, said the fact the Pfizer vaccine had to be stored at a very low temperature and came in large packs meant it was more practical to bring those receiving it to larger centres - seven of which have been identified, including leisure centres and hospitals.
Work has already been carried out on identifying and preparing vaccination centres.
The Ulster Hospital is one of the designated vaccine points, with 18 areas set up for administering the injection.
The facility will cater for mostly South Eastern Trust staff but people who live in the area but work for another trust can opt to receive their jab there.
The vaccine has been produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and was the first to be approved for use in the UK.
It has reported 95% protection against Covid-19.
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials.
The vaccine, which is made in Belgium, must be stored at about -70C and will be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge.
Patients are given two doses of the vaccine three weeks apart.
Patricia Donnelly, who is leading the vaccine delivery project in Northern Ireland, said the vaccines came in what she described as ""pizza boxes"".
In each box there will be 195 vials, each containing five doses. This means each box will contain 975 doses.
There are some other promising vaccines that could also be approved soon.
One from Moderna uses the same mRNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and offers similar protection. The UK has pre-ordered 7m doses that could be ready by the spring.
The UK has ordered 100m doses of a different type of Covid vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca. That vaccine uses a harmless virus, altered to look a lot more like the virus that causes Covid-19.
Russia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics.
Both work in a similar way to the Oxford vaccine.
Some people have mild symptoms, such as muscle aches or a bit of a temperature, after being vaccinated.
This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.
Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients will be listed."

In what can only be described as a hilarious troll of Democrat Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a woman urged her to adopt a new campaign slogan, **“we need to eat the babies”** in order to fight Climate change. A pro-Trump group called ‘LaRouchePAC’ have claimed credit for political stunt. 



To add to the fun Tucker Carlson later attacked Ocasio-Cortez for her completely inappropriate response to the “we need to eat babies” claim!

"ROME  —   When Stephen K. Bannon was still heading Breitbart News, he went to the Vatican to cover the canonization of John Paul II and make some friends. High on his list of people to meet was an archconservative American cardinal, Raymond Burke, who had openly clashed with Pope Francis. In one of the cardinal’s antechambers, amid religious statues and   walls, Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon  —   who is now President Trump’s   eminence  —   bonded over their shared worldview. They saw Islam as threatening to overrun a prostrate West weakened by the erosion of traditional Christian values, and viewed themselves as unjustly ostracized by    political elites. “When you recognize someone who has sacrificed in order to remain true to his principles and who is fighting the same kind of battles in the cultural arena, in a different section of the battlefield, I’m not surprised there is a meeting of hearts,” said Benjamin Harnwell, a confidant of Cardinal Burke who arranged the 2014 meeting. While Mr. Trump, a   president who has boasted of groping women, may seem an unlikely ally of traditionalists in the Vatican, many of them regard his election and the ascendance of Mr. Bannon as potentially   breakthroughs. Just as Mr. Bannon has connected with   parties threatening to topple governments throughout Western Europe, he has also made common cause with elements in the Roman Catholic Church who oppose the direction Francis is taking them. Many share Mr. Bannon’s suspicion of Pope Francis as a dangerously misguided, and probably socialist, pontiff. Until now, Francis has marginalized or demoted the traditionalists, notably Cardinal Burke, carrying out an inclusive agenda on migration, climate change and poverty that has made the pope a figure of unmatched global popularity, especially among liberals. Yet in a newly turbulent world, Francis is suddenly a lonelier figure. Where once Francis had a powerful ally in the White House in Barack Obama, now there is Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon, this new president’s ideological guru. For many of the pope’s ideological opponents in and around the Vatican, who are fearful of a pontiff they consider outwardly avuncular but internally a ruthless wielder of absolute political power, this angry moment in history is an opportunity to derail what they see as a disastrous papal agenda. And in Mr. Trump, and more directly in Mr. Bannon, some   “Rad Trads”  —   or radical traditionalists  —   see an alternate leader who will stand up for traditional Christian values and against Muslim interlopers. “There are huge areas where we and the pope do overlap, and as a loyal Catholic, I don’t want to spend my life fighting against the pope on issues where I won’t change his mind,” Mr. Harnwell said over a lunch of cannelloni. “Far more valuable for me would be spend time working constructively with Steve Bannon. ” He made it clear he was speaking for himself, not for the Institute for Human Dignity, a conservative Catholic group that he founded, and insisted that he shared the pope’s goals of ensuring peace and ending poverty, just not his ideas on how to achieve it. Mr. Bannon publicly articulated his worldview in remarks a few months after his meeting with Cardinal Burke, at a Vatican conference organized by Mr. Harnwell’s institute. Speaking via video feed from Los Angeles, Mr. Bannon, a Catholic, held forth against rampant secularization, the existential threat of Islam, and a capitalism that had drifted from the moral foundations of Christianity. That talk has garnered much attention, and approval by conservatives, for its explicit expression of Mr. Bannon’s vision. Less widely known are his efforts to cultivate strategic alliances with those in Rome who share his interpretation of a   “church militant” theology. Mr. Bannon’s visage, speeches and endorsement of Mr. Harnwell as “the smartest guy in Rome” are featured heavily on the website of Mr. Harnwell’s foundation. Mr. Trump’s senior adviser has maintained email contact with Cardinal Burke, according to Mr. Harnwell, who dropped by the cardinal’s residence after lunch. And another person with knowledge of Mr. Bannon’s current outreach said the White House official is personally calling his contacts in Rome for thoughts on who should be the Trump administration’s ambassador to the Holy See. During Mr. Bannon’s April 2014 trip he courted Edward Pentin, a leading conservative Vatican reporter, as a potential correspondent in Rome for Breitbart, the website that is popular with the   a   movement that has attracted white supremacists. “He really seemed to get the battles the church needs to fight,” said Mr. Pentin, the author of “The Rigging of a Vatican Synod?” a book asserting that Pope Francis and his supporters railroaded opponents. Chief among those battles, Mr. Pentin said, was Mr. Bannon’s focus on countering a “cultural Marxism” that had seeped into the church. Since that visit and the meeting with Cardinal Burke  —   an experience that Daniel Fluette, the head of production for Breitbart, described as “incredibly powerful” for Mr. Bannon  —   Mr. Trump’s ideological strategist has maintained a focus on Rome. Mr. Bannon returned to direct the documentary “Torchbearer,” in which the “Duck Dynasty” star Phil Robertson contemplates the apocalyptic consequences of an eroding Christendom. Mr. Bannon also reunited with old friends, including Breitbart’s eventual Rome correspondent, Thomas Williams. A former priest, Mr. Williams said that he used to have arguments with Mr. Bannon about whether the pope subscribed to a   brand of liberation theology, with Mr. Bannon calling the pope a “ . ” Mr. Williams said he usually defended the pope, but that recent statements by Francis convinced him “Steve turned out to be right. That happens more often than not. ” Mr. Bannon’s private thoughts about the pope have at times surfaced in public. On May 23, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Williams spoke about Pope Francis on the radio program Breitbart News Daily. Discussing a Breitbart article about the new mayor of London titled “Pope Hails Election of Sadiq Khan, Celebrates Mass Muslim Migration Into Europe,” Mr. Bannon suggested that the pope “seems almost to be putting the responsibility on the working men and women of Italy and Europe et cetera, that they have to go out of their way to accommodate” migration. Was the pope a global elitist, Mr. Bannon asked, “two or three steps removed from this?” Many critics of Francis express similar views, but they are often scared to express it for fear of retribution from the pope, who, they say, has eyes and ears all over the Vatican. Instead, the pope’s critics anonymously papered Rome over the weekend with posters of a   Francis above complaints about his removing and ignoring clerics and cardinals. “Where’s your mercy?” it asked. Conservatives and traditionalists in the Vatican secretly pass around phony   of the Vatican’s official paper, L’Osservatore Romano, making fun of the pope. Or they spread a YouTube video critiquing the pope and his exhortation on love in the family, “Amoris Laetitia,” which many traditionalists consider Francis’ opening salvo against the doctrine of the church. Set to the music of “That’s Amore,” an aggrieved crooner sings, “When will we all be freed from this cruel tyranny, that’s Amoris” and “It’s the climate of fear engineered for four years, that’s Amoris. ” Cardinal Burke  —   who has said that the pope’s exhortation, which opened the door for divorced Catholics remarried outside the church to receive communion, might require “a formal act of correction”  —   has been unusually outspoken in his criticism of Francis. Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon declined to comment for this article. Just weeks ago, the pope stripped Cardinal Burke of his remaining institutional influence after a scandal exploded at the Knights of Malta, a nearly    chivalrous order where he had been exiled as a liaison to the Vatican. The pope had removed the order’s grand master after he showed disobedience to the pope. There was a sense in the order that the grand master followed the lead of Cardinal Burke because he projected authority, a power that stemmed in part from his support by the Trump administration, one influential knight said. Cardinal Burke has become a champion to conservatives in the United States. Under Mr. Bannon, Breitbart News urged its Rome correspondent to write sympathetically about him. And at a meeting before last month’s   March for Life rally in Washington, Cardinal Burke received the Law of Life Achievement, or Nail award, a framed replica of the nail used to hold the feet of Christ to the cross. According to   Westen, the editor of Life Site News, who announced the award, the prize is awarded to Christians “who have received a stab in the back. ” Despite Mr. Bannon’s inroads in Rome, Mr. Burke and other traditionalists are not ascendant in the Vatican. The Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest who edits the   journal La Civilta Cattolica and who is close to the pope, dismissed their criticism as the stuff of a noisy but small “echo chamber. ” He also played down the effect of Mr. Trump’s ascent on the standing of Francis’ opponents in the Vatican, saying it was only on a “level of image” and “propaganda. ” The pope will maintain his direction and not be distracted by fights against those trying to undercut him, Father Spadaro said. “He moves forward, and he moves ahead very fast. ” He added that Mr. Trump’s ban on immigrants from certain Muslim countries was “opposite” to the pontiff’s vision for how to foster unity and peace. The pope, Father Spadaro said, is doing everything he can to avoid the clash of civilizations that both fundamentalist Muslims and Christians want. Indeed, the pope does not seem to be slowing down. Days after the election of Mr. Trump, in St. Peter’s Basilica, the Vatican officially elevated new cardinals selected by Pope Francis who reflected the pope’s emphasis on an inclusive church  —   far from the worldview of Mr. Bannon and Mr. Burke. “It’s not that he is just bringing new people in that think maybe like him,” Cardinal Blase Cupich, the influential new cardinal of Chicago, said after the ceremony. “He is transforming the church in making us rethink how we have done things before. ” That transformation was evident later in the evening, when the old conservative guard came to pay their respects to the new cardinals. João Braz de Aviz, a powerful cardinal close to the pope, walked around in simple cleric clothes, the equivalent of civilian dress among all the flowing cassocks. Asked whether the ascent of Mr. Trump would embolden Mr. Bannon’s allies in the Vatican to intensify their opposition and force the pope to take a more orthodox line, he shrugged. “The doctrine is secure,” he said, adding that the mission of the church was more to safeguard the poor. It was also, he reminded his traditionalist colleagues, to serve St. Peter, whose authority is passed down through the popes. “And today, Francis is Peter. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe world’s poor are refusing to be denied affordable, reliable fossil energy – like the rest of the developed world enjoys.
According to a new new peer-reviewed paper, during the last decade the world added more coal power than any decade before. A lion’s share of that increase was in developing countries, who understandably want to pull themselves out of agonizing poverty. This should be good news.
However, the opulent elite classes on the planet, which include jet-setting billionaires and Hollywood stars, are having a tough time accepting this and view it as a worrisome development. They expect the world’s underclasses to forego the blessings of cheap energy that they themselves enjoy profusely.
Fortunately the poor are flatly rejecting their demands and are refusing to return to dirt huts. They’ve waited long enough. The poor now know electric power can be produced very cheaply, is plentiful and is there for the taking, and they are now demanding unhindered access to it. Little wonder more coal power came online over the last decade in developing countries. And little wonder much more will be coming online over the next 10 years.
A recent story at the online India Today poignantly illustrates how the world’s poor are refusing to forego fossil fuel generated electricity: Bihar village clamours for real electricity.
The article describes how a village in India had been without electrical power for more than 30 years, and longed to get back on the grid. Greenpeace decided to use the village as an example to the world to showcase how communities can do just fine on renewable energy. Greenpeace India set up a “solar-powered micro-grid” to power the village and it was paraded before the media as a success. The whole world should follow Bihar’s example, Greenpeace and renewable energy activists bellowed. The project reaped lots of praise from the global elitists, and probably won lots of awards. There, you see! That’s how it’s done! 
Greenpeace India describes the project as follows:
The solar powered micro-grid is a comprehensive, first of its kind enterprise that provides electricity to more than 400 households and 50 commercial establishments. This includes 70 kW for electricity generation and 30 kW for 10 solar powered water pumping systems of three horsepower each. The 100 kW micro-grid also takes care of 60 street lights, energy requirements of two schools, one health centre, one Kisan Training Centre and 50 commercial establishments.”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




However, the story does not have a happy ending. There’s only one (huge) problem: The citizens of Bihar aren’t happy with part-time modernity. India Today writes:
The residents of Dharnai are far from satisfied to see lights for the first time in 33 years, courtesy a solar-powered micro-grid set up by the environment watchdog Greenpeace India.”
The India Today article goes on to describe how Bihar citizens “want asli bijli (real electricity) from the government” and that village youngsters were carrying placards demanding “real source of energy“, and “not the fake solar powered” one.
It’s obvious: Who needs the lights in the daytime? Lights are needed at night. The problem with the Greenpeace solar micro-grid is that you can’t power the lights at night. And what good is a fridge or freezer when it can be powered only 8 hours a day? Why should a developing country settled for part-time modernity when you can have it full time, and at a price that is less than half of the part-time “fake” energy? How can you run a factory or a hospital when the power is absent 14 hours a day?
Under pressure to quell the people’s anger over having a half solution thrust upon them, and being expected to just shut up and accept it, the government “eventually promised the villagers that ‘real electricity’ would be provided to them shortly.”
India Today writes that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has “instructed senior officials of the energy department to look into their demand for the real stuff“.
The world’s poor want asli bijli, and they aren’t going to settle for less. Hat-tip: Alex Epstein at Twitter.

Pope Francis’ new encyclical, _Laudato Si_ , advocates a new “ecological spirituality.” Yet this challenging call is diminished by the document’s tendency to devolve into leftish policy positions. The encyclical underestimates the power of market forces to promote environmental ends.   
  
There are serious environmental problems but _Laudato Si_ presumes rather than proves crisis is the norm. Moreover, nothing in Scripture or nature tells us how much to spend to clean up the air.   
  
Drawing environmental lines requires balancing such interests as ecology, liberty, and prosperity. One cannot merely assume that the correct outcome in every case is more of the first.   
  
Indeed, the Pontiff’s own goals conflict. He speaks movingly of the dignity of work and its importance for the poor. But the more expensive and extensive the government controls, the fewer and less remunerative the jobs.   
  
Perhaps most disappointing is how the Pope seemingly views capitalism, and especially property rights, as enemies of a better, cleaner world. Yet most environmental problems reflect the _absence_ of markets and property rights, the “externalities,” in economist-speak, which impact others.   




The best solution is to either create or mimic markets and property rights. For instance, public control rarely ends well.   
  
Garrett Hardin famously wrote about the “tragedy of the commons,” in which land open to everyone typically is misused by everyone. Federal range and forest land is badly managed, not because government officials are malign, but because the incentives they face are perverse.   
  
In contrast, a private owner bears both costs and benefits, and suffers when he misuses a resource. The owner may make a mistake, but his power to do harm is sharply limited.   
  
Pollution taxes and tradeable permits attempt to apply market forces to the great common areas, such as air and water. Yet _Laudato Si_ launches a perplexing attack on the use of emission credits to limit pollution. Properly designed they create an incentive for those who can control emissions at the least cost to control them the most.   
  
Although the Pope acknowledges “that honest debate must be encouraged among experts, while respecting divergent views,” _Laudato Si_ ignores the most sophisticated critiques of climate alarmists. For instance, many critics dispute the likelihood of catastrophic change and the best means to deal with the likely impact of any temperature increases.   
  
For years models failed to match climatic behavior. Peer-reviewed research increasingly suggests that warming will be modest. Moreover, any prediction today as to conditions decades in the future is a wild guess.   
  
These argue in favor of addressing specific problems rather than imposing arbitrary, draconian, and costly cuts in energy consumption. Economic analysis confirms that adaptation can achieve similar environmental ends at less expense.   
  
_Laudato Si_ criticizes wasteful, unnecessary consumption and worries about “the depletion of natural resources.” The Pope rightly asks, how should we use the resources entrusted to us by God?   
  
However, the encyclical offers no evidence for its sharp attack on consumption in developed countries, which of course produce more than they use. In fact, unowned or underpriced resources are vulnerable to abuse in any society.   
  
Where markets operate, resource depletion is largely a myth because prices signal consumers and producers to adapt. There now is more recoverable oil than ever.   
  
Markets typically are better than governments in protecting “future generations.” An individual landowner who misuses his property loses its value. The typical political time horizon is until the next election.   
  
As I point out for the Acton Institute: “Economic progress eases the impact of environmental problems on the poor. It also provides resources to enhance the environment, efficiencies to produce more using less, and technologies to better preserve ecological values.”   
  
Of course, markets are not perfect or enough. Perhaps the encyclical’s most important message is that “the emptier a person’s heart is, the more he or she needs things to buy, own and consume.” That is something no government program can fill.

Guest essay by Rob Bradley
Rice’s Baker Institute Climate Embarrassment (Sass’s ad hominem response to Rep. Smith)
“The Baker Institute has some truing up to do in the multi-disciplinary field of climate change. Playing to its strengths, Rice University and Baker should host its third climate conference, titled something like ‘New Developments in the Physical Science of Climate Change.’
[Professor] Ronald Sass in his recent op-ed called for an ‘open, national debate on climate change.’ May Rice University and the Baker Institute lead the way.”
The Houston Chronicle this week ran opposing opinion-page editorials on the climate-change issue, one by Lamar Smith of the U.S. House of Representatives and the other by Ronald Sass, Fellow in Global Climate Change at Rice University’s James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy.

Politician Smith politely makes multi-disciplinary arguments assuming the best intentions of his opponents. Academic Sass goes ad hominem on the Keystone XL pipeline issue and refers vaguely to a scientific consensus for his position.
This, unfortunately, is not atypical. Under gatekeeper Neal Lane, the Baker Institute has refused to allow fair, open debate about natural versus anthropogenic climate forces and has championed sky-is-falling government activism. For example, Lane/Baker:

Killed publication of the proceedings of a fair climate-change conference held in 2000 with, for example, Patrick Michaels and James Hansen participating;
Held a high-priced, widely publicized, assume-alarmist-science conference in 2008, Beyond Science: The Economics and Politics of Responding to Climate Change, featuring John Kerry and John Holdren on the political side.
Refused to host a climate forum/debate in 2010 between Gerald North (Texas A&M) and Richard Lindzen (MIT), which ended up being co-sponsored by Rice’s Shell Center for Sustainability and the Center for the Study of Environment and Society.

"International flights taking off from the UK must be taken into account in the government’s calculations on reaching net zero emissions as part of a “green” recovery for the airline industry, a transport thinktank has urged. The government has given loan bailouts to airlines totalling £1.5bn since the coronavirus outbreak, with no environmental conditions attached. Ryanair is the latest company to secure a £600m loan from the scheme, despite its chief executive, Michael O’Leary’s outspoken condemnation of such bailouts across Europe as uncompetitive state aid. British Airways secured a £300m loan and EasyJet received £600m. The thinktank Transport and Environment calculates that more than £30bn has been promised or given in bailouts to airlines across Europe due to Covid-19, and it said the recovery of the industry must be sustainable and tied to policies to cut carbon emissions. Among these, it said international aviation emissions must be included in the government targets to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. The Committee on Climate Change has recommended that emissions from international flights should be included in net zero calculations – at present they are not counted at all – but the government has yet to respond to the committee’s letter. “The government should ensure international aviation and shipping emissions are including within the net zero target,” said Greg Archer, the UK director of Transport and Environment. “The aviation industry is currently relying on buying cheap, unreliable offsets for its emissions. This is no solution to avoiding a climate catastrophe.” He said the recovery of the industry had to have conditions attached, including new aviation taxes to manage growth, a moratorium on new runways and terminals and a mandate on airlines to buy sustainable aviation fuels. “The tragedy of the coronavirus pandemic provides an opportunity to reset the aviation industry’s insatiable demand for fossil fuels and to place it on a sustainable future pathway,” Archer said. “Rather than a return to business as usual, aviation must now ‘build back better’ and initiate a green recovery. Aviation bailouts must be exclusively focused on ensuring a green recovery and supporting employees.” UK aviation emissions are estimated to be 13-15% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions. These include from international flights departing from the UK, and non-CO2 emissions associated with these flights. By 2050, if demand is unchecked, passenger numbers are predicted to rise by 70% and aviation will become the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. International aviation emissions could be calculated by including emissions of planes that take off from the UK. Archer said the UK could be a global leader and take responsibility for its share of international aviation emissions. “It is now clear the coronavirus pandemic is transforming the way we travel,” he said. “The pandemic similarly creates an opportunity for a reset in aviation and there should not be a return to business as usual but to create a recovery towards sustainable aviation.”"

Gosh, is there anything it can’t do?
People send me stuff. I would not have believed this unless I saw it from Al Gore’s Climate Reality Project, where I constantly wonder what sort of reality those people inhabit. See the yellow highlight. 

Maybe the guy is being tongue in cheek, maybe he’s dead serious, it is hard to tell. But, this sort of messaging is probably something that resonates with the caliber of people who would buy into Gore’s version of reality in the first place.
With messagaging like this, I think my first take on it still holds: Al Gore’s ‘Reality Drop’ is a bomb – so let’s give him a ‘hockey stick

"**What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales so far?**
We seem to be bombarded with different measures, but what do they mean and how does Wales compare with other parts of the UK?
Here, we try to answer some of the questions and explain what the different measures are and also give some of the most recent figures.
The south Wales valleys had been dominating for highest case rates, but had fallen back early in November. Now they have started to move up again,, albeit more gradually.
In the most recent comparable week, Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent and Neath Port Talbot have been among the 10 highest case rate areas in the UK.
**Blaenau Gwent** has seen cases continue to rise, if at a slower rate, currently 453.7 cases per 100,000 people.
**Torfaen** had the highest case rate in Wales but has eased off a little to 402.3 per 100,000 in the last week and its positivity rate is now below 20% again.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the positivity proportion of tests should be no more than 5% before areas come out of restrictions.
Only Pontypool currently stands in the highest case rates in Wales, broken down at a localised level, at 846.7 cases per 100,000 in the last week - 77 actual cases.
**Newport** has also seen its case rate increase to 307.7.
**Merthyr Tydfil** hit a peak of 769 cases per 100,000 people at the end of October, by far the highest rate in Wales, and was the hardest-hit area in the UK.
There has been an improvement in recent weeks but it has risen again to 331.5 cases per 100,000 people
Although there is a mass testing programme in the area, results from these tests have not yet been released and do not count in the Public Health Wales statistics.
**Rhondda Cynon Taf** (RCT) also has a case rate of 304.6 per 100,000 now, fairly steady, reporting 779 new positive tests in the past week.
Ferndale and Maerdy has the highest case rate in Wales, 941.8 cases per 100,000 - 54 cases in the last week.
**Cardiff's** case rate stands at just above 226.8 cases per 100,000, having stabilised after a fall in student cases, although it has nudged upwards in recent days.
There are only five cases a day on average among Cardiff University students in this period.
The positivity rate in Wales had been slowly falling but has stabilised to 13.2% on average and 10 council areas saw an increase, although mostly negligible.
Neath Port Talbot has the highest now, with Torfaen not far behind. Conwy has the lowest, just 2.5% of tests proved positive in the last week.
**Wrexham's** case rate has risen to 194.2 cases per 100,000 and has overtaken **Flintshire** again but case rates in north Wales are fairly stable.
The lowest case rates in Wales remain in north-west Wales across **Conwy** and **Gwynedd.**
You can see a steady climb in **Swansea** and also **Neath Port Talbot** (NPT), where Cimla has the highest localised rate in Wales currently at 920.1 cases per 100,000 - 47 in the last week. Cwmafan is also fifthhighest.
**Carmarthenshire** has climbed slowly to 215.1 cases per 100,000 while **Bridgend** is 228.5.
Meanwhile, **Ceredigion's** contact tracing team has warned of an ""alarming spread"" of cases in the Cardigan area, with 55 cases linking back to ""super spreader"" events such as parties and large social gatherings in pubs over the last fortnight.
The county's case rate as a whole has increased in recent weeks - at 145.8 it has been getting closer to the Wales average - and in the Cardigan area the local case rate has eased off to 642 per 100,000 in the last week but still the sixth highest in Wales.
Why do we look at cases per 100,000 going back about three days?
Because of a lag in results coming back, Public Health Wales (PHW) said the case rate figures it publishes daily on its dashboard can be an underestimate.
So, it is more accurate to wait for those late results to come in before looking at what the picture is - a bit like in football, waiting on a Saturday evening for all the final scores to come in before looking at the league tables.
The latest infection survey in Wales suggests that Covid-19 cases peaked at the end of October.
Along with case rates from tests results from Public Health Wales, it's a further indication that infections could be easing.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) takes throat and nose swab tests from more than 18,400 people at random in Wales over six weeks.
From the results, it can estimate that 16,400 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 21 November.
This is one in 185 people.
Last week's survey estimated that 18,400 people in Wales had coronavirus - about 0.61% or one in 165 people.
It says due to the sample size, results should be interpreted with caution.
Similar surveys suggest cases have levelled off in England (one in 85 people estimated to be infected) while falling back in Northern Ireland. Positivity rates in Scotland have increased in the most recent week, after appearing to have levelled off.
The highest Covid-19 positivity rates remain in north West England and Yorkshire and The Humber.
The highest positivity rates are seen among secondary school-aged children and older teenagers and young adults.
Local breakdowns are not possible within Wales.
The seven-day average in total daily admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases remains fairly steady, running at a daily seven-day average of 81 for confirmed and suspected Covid-19, the lowest for more than a month.
There has been a rise of Covid-19 infections within hospitals in recent weeks.
There were 203 hospital onset cases across Wales in the week to 22 November, according to official PHW figures.
But is a drop of the 269 in the previous week.
The biggest jump in the latest week has been in the Hywel Dda health board, with 42 ""probable"" and ""definite"" cases, more than double the previous week.
Apart from Cardiff and Vale, most other areas saw a decline.
This includes Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which reported 19 more deaths linked to hospital infections in the last week.
Over the summer PHW revealed hundreds of patients caught coronavirus while in hospital.
Early on the pandemic, there were high numbers of hospital infections in the Aneurin Bevan health board - which was a hotspot for Covid-19 in March - followed by Cwm Taf and Cardiff and Vale in April and in Betsi Cadwaladr over the summer
This followed analysis into ""probable"" and ""definite"" infections of patients, an issue particularly early on in the pandemic.
Overall, 94% of Covid-19 infections occur in the community - only 6% are caught within hospitals.
Health officials say we should also look at how many people are consulting their GP - as another indicator of how the virus is progressing.
This surveillance data involved about 400 GP practices.
PHW's data dashboard also shows consultations for flu and respiratory conditions. The most recent figures showed around 15 consultations per 100,000 people for suspected Covid-19, compared with about 1.1 per 100,000 for flu symptoms.
In Wales, there were 223 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in the week ending 20 November. This is 33 more deaths than the week before and 26.3% of all deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
There were 65 deaths registered across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area - 44 in hospital. There have been 177 deaths from Covid-19 infections caught in hospital outbreaks up to last week.
There were also 47 deaths in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, across all settings, 38 deaths in Swansea Bay, 21 in Betsi Cadwaladr and 23 in Cardiff and Vale.
There were 21 deaths in Hywel Dda - more than double the figure last week - and eight deaths involving Powys residents, five of them in hospital.
The total number of Covid deaths in Wales up to and registered by 13 November was 3,464 deaths.
When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there is a total of 3,536 deaths occurring up to 20 November.
RCT, with 503 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales. Cardiff has had 442 up to the latest week.
So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, are above the five-year average.
Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing.
In Wales, the number of deaths increased from 742 to 848 in the latest week, which was 195 deaths (29.9%) higher than the five-year average for that week.
In Wales, the number of deaths from all causes in 2020 up to 13 November was 32,059, which is 2,635 (9% ) more than the five-year average.
Of these, 3,240 (10%) mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate.
The mortality figures up to the end of October show the peak was on 8 April.
It has been estimated by ONS that 88.9% of deaths where doctors have mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, that it was the underlying cause of death.
So in October, 236 deaths were due to Covid-19. But there were another 49 when Covid-19 was involved and mentioned on the death certificate, and a factor in the death.
In Wales, 29,018 deaths from all causes had been registered by 7 November, which was 1,419 more deaths than the five-year average.
Covid-19 was the underlying cause of death in 2,629 of those deaths (9.1%).
Early on in the pandemic, the hotspot was in the Aneurin Bevan health board area of south east Wales.
Over the summer, Betsi Cadwaladr health board, in north Wales, showed more of a spike in Covid-19 deaths compared with health boards in south Wales.
But Cwm Taf Morgannwg, due to the hospital outbreaks, has now shown a rise in recent weeks.
RCT has 209.5 deaths per 100,000 people - the second highest rate across all local authorities in England and Wales.
This is followed by Merthyr (197.7 per 100,000, now ranked third for mortality rate involving Covid-19) and Blaenau Gwent (162, 30th).
Ceredigion now has the seventh-lowest death rate behind the likes of Isles of Scilly, Norwich, Hams and Hastings, with 31.5 per 100,000. Pembrokeshire is also in the bottom 20.
When looking at the highest death rates across England and Wales, Tameside in Greater Manchester is the highest, with the likes of Liverpool, Bury, Oldham and Sunderland also in the top 10.
Across England and Wales, north-west England again had the largest number of deaths involving Covid-19 (629 deaths) in the most recent week, which is nearly a third of deaths for the week.
Across the UK, there were 2,473 more deaths than the five-year average. Of 14,276 deaths from all causes, 3,038 involved Covid-19.
In the latest week, England had 2,471 deaths, followed by Scotland with 244 deaths, Wales with 223 deaths and Northern Ireland (100 deaths).
There have been a total of 851 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 20 November, making up 24.6% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales.
Meanwhile, Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) compiles its own figures, which showed they have been notified of 5,562 deaths among adult care home residents, from all causes, since 1 March.
This is 41% more care home deaths than notified in the same time period last year, and 35% higher than for the same period in 2018.
Of these, 934 deaths involved suspected or confirmed Covid-19, which makes up 17% of all reported deaths.
CIW is now updating its figures every two weeks.
There were 58 care home deaths in Wales where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate in the latest ONS weekly total in Wales, the highest number since mid May.
Eleven of the deaths were in care homes in RCT, nine in Neath Port Talbot and six in the Vale of Glamorgan.
The ONS said, across England and Wales, deaths involving Covid-19 in care homes as a proportion of all deaths in care homes rose in the latest week - to 18.9% of all care home deaths. Overall deaths in care homes were above the five-year average.
More than 1,600 extra deaths have occurred in people's own homes in Wales so far this year than average, according to analysis by the ONS.
Deaths from heart disease amongst men in their own homes were 22.7% higher compared with the five-year average - while there were more than 29% fewer deaths through this cause in hospital.
Deaths for women from dementia in their own homes almost doubled in Wales, while in hospitals they fell by 25.5%.
""While deaths in hospitals and care homes have dropped below the five-year average since the initial peak of the coronavirus pandemic, we've consistently seen deaths in private homes remain well above the five-year average,"" said ONS analyst Sarah Caul.
Unlike the high numbers of deaths involving Covid-19 in hospitals and care homes, the majority of deaths in private homes are unrelated to the virus.
Up to 11 September, there have been 7,440 deaths in people's homes in Wales, with 134 of these involving Covid-19. This was 1,624 deaths more than the five-year average for the same period.
Nearly two-thirds of these excess deaths came in the 70 to 89 years age group.
One expert has suggested these deaths would normally have occurred in hospital.
People may have been reluctant to go, discouraged from attending, or the services have been disrupted, Sir David Spiegelhalter of the Cambridge University said.
The ONS has published figures which suggest the mortality rate is nearly twice as high for Covid-19 deaths in Wales' poorest areas than its least deprived ones.
There were 151 deaths per 100,000 population in the period up to 6 November in the most deprived areas.
This compares with 73.8 deaths in least deprived parts, the ONS has said.
Wales on average has a mortality rate of 91.2 per 100,000, where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate.
The ONS has also developed a tool so people can see the number of deaths from the virus at a neighbourhood level.
Covid-19 was the biggest cause of death in Wales in both April and May, before dropping to third in June.
Over the summer it dropped significantly as a cause of death, but was back to being third leading cause of death in October, behind dementia and heart disease.
The age-adjusted mortality rate in Wales for deaths due to Covid in October was 81.9 deaths per 100,000 - significantly higher than in England (63.5 per 100,000) for the first time.
This was still was 83.5% lower than the peak in April.
For flu and pneumonia, there were 34 deaths per 100,000 - the seventh leading cause of death.
Meanwhile, so far this year, there have been more than twice as many deaths from Covid-19 than flu and pneumonia in Wales up to the end of August.
ONS said a smaller proportion (65.2%) of Covid-19 deaths in Wales occurred in hospitals and private homes (4.9%) compared with 2020 deaths due to influenza and pneumonia and the five-year average.
However, 28.6% of Covid deaths occurred in care homes, more than twice the proportion of deaths due to influenza and pneumonia so far this year.
More than 1.5 million tests had been carried out by 28 November, including 710,227 on key workers and care home residents.
The biggest proportion of positive tests - 60% - are women and the age group with most positive tests are those in their 50s.
A total of 14,985 people in their 20s have also tested positive - 1,282 more than the week before and the number has been steadily rising.
The proportion has also slightly grown over the month and this age group is now nearly 17% of all people tested so far.
Nearly twice as many children under 10 and 46% more children and young people aged 10 to 19 are also testing positive than a month ago.
Separate figures, now published weekly, show more than half of schools have been affected by the virus since September.
We can also see from more detailed PHW figures how many different key workers and others have been tested - and how speedily results are coming back.
Across Wales, 3,491 care home residents were tested in the most recent week and 302 (8.6%) were positive - exactly the same figures as the previous week. But it has dropped from the numbers we saw at the end of October.
Also, 134 care home workers tested positive but 96% of tests were negative.
Broken down, these included 85 positive tests among care homes residents and key workers in Torfaen, 79 in Neath Port Talbot and 70 in RCT in the most recent week.
The ""test, trace, protect"" system for contacting people with coronavirus and tracing contact has seen an improvement in recent weeks.
Of the 5,330 positive cases that were eligible for follow-up in Wales in the most recent week, 92% were reached, 80% within 24 hours of referral to the contact tracing system and 89% were reached within 48 hours - both improving times.
This equates to 87% of those successfully reached being reached within 24 hours and 96% within 48 hours.
Of the 17,637 close contacts that were eligible for follow-up, 68% were reached within 24 hours of being identified by a positive case.
The ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing.
The data is revised and PHW refines and verifies it and then each individual fatality is assigned to the date at which it occurred.
The graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from all the different data sources - and how there is a difference of up to 1,125 deaths.
The figure for total deaths being given by PHW has been consistently around 60% of what has turned out to be the total figure when including all registered deaths.
NHS Wales' chief statistician argues to look at the trend and the curve of the outbreak, it is best to focus on deaths on the day they have occurred rather than the daily PHW figures as they first appear, as these can be volatile.
So the chart above shows the daily deaths, as they have been adjusted, as well as a seven-day rolling average.
By 28 November, there was an average of around 17 deaths a day, with the 31 deaths occurring on 5 November, the highest daily figure since the last week of April.
Meanwhile, analysts at Johns Hopkins University in America have been looking at the global picture in detail, giving regular updates, and currently rank the United Kingdom third highest in terms of mortality rate for major countries in cases per population.
Getting accurate figures on how many people recover is difficult.
NHS Wales in early November estimated nearly 16,000 people had been discharged from hospital after being treated for coronavirus since the pandemic started.
Meanwhile, doctors are looking to the effects of ""long Covid,"" with one study estimating one in 20 people are ill for at least eight weeks.
Doctors at Wales' largest hospital, the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff in May said 30% of patients admitted to its intensive care unit with Covid-19 had died and said the road to recovery was long.
Another hospital in the valleys had a survival rate of 55% for those critically ill with suspected or confirmed Covid.
Analysis of more than 10,700 patients who had been in critical care units with Covid across the UK found 60% survived. Of those 6,460 who were transferred to acute beds, 91% recovered and were later discharged from hospital, 4.4% were still recovering in hospital and 4.9% died.
Further research into 856 critical care patients admitted from the start of September found 11.6% died and more than half were still in critical care."
"Construction is beginning on the world’s largest liquid air battery, which will store renewable electricity and reduce carbon emissions from fossil-fuel power plants. The project near Manchester, UK, will use spare green energy to compress air into a liquid and store it. When demand is higher, the liquid air is released back into a gas, powering a turbine that puts the green energy back into the grid.  A big expansion of wind and solar energy is vital to tackle the climate emergency but they are not always available. Storage is therefore key and the new project will be the largest in the world outside of pumped hydro schemes, which require a mountain reservoir to store water. The new liquid air battery, being developed by Highview Power, is due to be operational in 2022 and will be able to power up to 200,000 homes for five hours, and store power for many weeks. Chemical batteries are also needed for the transition to a zero-carbon world and are plummeting in price, but can only store relatively small amounts of electricity for short periods. Liquid air batteries can be constructed anywhere, said Highview’s chief executive, Javier Cavada: “Air is everywhere in the world. The main competitor is really not other storage technologies but fossil fuels, as people still want to continue building gas and coal-fired plants today, strangely enough,” he said. The UK government has supported the project with a £10m grant. The energy and clean growth minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “This revolutionary new facility will form a key part of our push towards net zero, bringing greater flexibility to Britain’s electricity grid and creating green-collar jobs in Greater Manchester. “Projects like these will help us realise the full value of our world-class renewables, ensuring homes and businesses can still be powered by green energy, even when the sun is not shining and the wind not blowing,” he said. The UK government is being urged to make the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic a green one. “We owe it to future generations to build back better,” said the prime minister, Boris Johnson, recently, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is reported to be planning a “green industrial revolution”. Alex Buckman, an energy storage expert at the Energy Systems Catapult group, said polluting gas power plants were the main way the UK electricity grid was balanced. But a net zero carbon system would need more than the 30% renewable energy of today and therefore more storage. “There is likely going to be a need for one or more of the medium-to-long duration electricity storage technologies to fill a gap in the market, and liquid air energy storage (LAES) is right up there as an option,” he said. Pumped hydro is limited by the need for a mountain reservoir, while gravity storage – where you raise a weight and then let it drop to power a generator – is less developed, as is large-scale production of hydrogen fuel from green energy. “The combination of being more developed and more scalable provides LAES with an opportunity to be competitive, if they can prove that they can reduce costs with increased scale,” Buckman said. The Highview battery will store 250MWh of energy, almost double the amount stored by the biggest chemical battery, built by Tesla in South Australia. The new project is sited at the Trafford Energy Park, also home to the Carrington gas-powered energy plant and a closed coal power station. The project will cost £85m, and Highview received £35m of investment from the Japanese machinery giant Sumitomo in February. The liquid air battery is creating 200 jobs, mainly in construction, and employing former oil and gas engineers, with a few dozen in the continuing operation. The plant’s lifetime is expected to be 30-40 years. “It will pass to the next generation,” said Cavada. Highview is developing other sites in the UK, continental Europe and the US, including in Vermont, but the Manchester project will be the first. “The first one is definitely the most important and this is why we really value the UK government’s bold move to use UK technology to solve UK problems and afterwards export the tech globally,” said Cavada."

Stefan Rahmstorf, German alarmist scientist and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research claims that it was briefly sighted by GISS last month. Yet upon closer inspection no global warming has been seen since way back in the 1990s.
Warming has also been completely absent from Germany as well. Die kalte Sonne site here presents the latest May data for Germany.

Mean May temperatures for Germany for the last 17 years, from the original data of the DWD German Weather Service. Chart shows a sharply declining trend. Chart by: Josef Kowatsch
But May is only one month. Better would be to look at the annual mean temperatures, and over a longer time period. The next chart shows the mean annual temperatures for Germany since 1990. No change!

Okay, I agree. Let’s stop playing around and look at the whole global temperature, and do so over a really meaningful time period. The next chart shows global mean temperatures for the last 3200 years.

 Chart source: EIKE.
Note the 1000-year natural periodicity and that there is no sign of man-made warming today. The overall trend is cooling, and that ought to be disturbing. The warming remains missing.
UPDATE: A reader has sent me the following UKMO chart. No warming seen in Central Europe!

"The global growth in demand for food is outstripping supply and by the middle of the century there will be about a third more mouths on the planet to feed. The world’s middle class is expected to rise by three billion over the next few decades, mostly in the Asia-Pacific region. As developing countries become richer, people eat more, and differently: meat and dairy consumption rises. But yields of agricultural staples such as wheat and rice are already failing to keep pace with demand and greater meat consumption will mean even more food must be turned over to feed livestock. Livestock already consume 36% of the world’s calories produced.  Added to this, the limited supply of productive agricultural land is being increasingly lost to development. To this system already under pressure, is the additional burden of climate change. The latest report from the IPCC Working Group II, which examines the impact of climate change and means to adapt to it, highlights some of the risks we face trying to feed the world. Food security rests on four pillars: food availability (is enough produced?), access (can people afford it?), use (how is it prepared and consumed?) and stability (is food there at all times?) The first three reflect the way the system functions or fails, while the last reflects its resilience to shocks.  As systems are pushed to their limits, small shocks can become amplified. The food system, with its imbalance between demand and supply, is clearly one under pressure. In 2007-8, for example, weather-related supply problems led to rapid food price inflation, whose effects were felt around the world – not least in sparking civil unrest in many countries, including as a contributory factor in the Arab spring.  What the IPCC report has concluded is that over the coming decades the impact on crop yields, without taking steps to counter it, will be predominately negative. Climate change will, on average, reduce yields by about 2% per decade. This is consistent with the impact on crop yields observed over the last few decades. The previous round of IPCC reports in 2007 (AR4) were fairly optimistic for agriculture at higher latitudes. The weight of academic studies indicates that that this optimism may be unwarranted. Given that a large proportion of the world’s calories are accounted for by a small number of staple commodity crops and the highest yields are in the higher latitudes, changing temperatures in these regions may have a significant impact on the world’s food supply. The IPCC concludes that, without taking steps to counter the effects, climate change of 2°C or more would have a negative impact on agriculture. This is not an “alarmist” conclusion as some have claimed: the underlying data show that even at 1°C –  for some situations, such as maize in temperate and tropical regions – the impact is noticeable. But this average overall impact masks two important issues. First, there is large variability between regions – the exact impact of climate change for any given location is difficult to predict with precision. For example, between 2030-2049, about 10% of projections predict improved yields of around 10%, while about 10% of projections indicate falling yields of more than 25%, mainly in the low latitudes.  Second, extreme weather has increased in frequency and magnitude over the last decade. Some of these, such as the 2010 heatwave in Russia and subsequent wheat crop failures, send clear signals suggesting an increasingly less stable and less predictable food supply. The IPCC’s projections suggest that yield variability will increase by between two to three times by the second half of the century, affecting the supply of food. Events like the Russian wheat failure are set to become more common. The future is one where the food system faces increasing climate-induced pressure on supply in the face of growing demand, and also increasingly variable weather. The implications are only just starting to sink in, and managing both will be a much greater challenge than either alone. The report’s conclusions are of concern. When demand is growing faster than supply, any break on increasing supply will push up food prices, affecting the poorest most. Across the world, the number of people who struggle to finance a healthy diet is growing: in the UK it is certainly a growing issue. While changing the type of crop and when it is grown can help, the limits to these simple adaptations signpost the need for a large-scale agricultural transformation. This is needed to limit the overall damage from a changing climate, but it will help in taking advantage of new agricultural opportunities. These will be very important for some: for example, for the first time since Roman times Scotland has recently become a wine producer. The global food system is increasingly more reliant on fewer crops than in the past. This is a double-edged sword: while food grown in one place can, via a global market, feed others if their weather has reduced production, at the same time an increased concentration of fewer crops poses the risk of putting all our eggs in one basket.  The implications of the IPCC’s results are that all four of the pillars of food security face mounting pressure. The effects of extreme weather especially has the potential to destabilise the food system, with the potential to undermine food security for many, and not just the world’s poorest. Managing the system to ensure greater resilience to shocks while maximising food production must now be an urgent policy aim."

Bishop Hill reports that Doug Keenan’s article about statistical significance in the temperature records seems to have had a response from the Met Office.
WUWT readers may recall our story here: Uh oh, the Met Office has set the cat amongst the pigeons:
===========================================
The Parliamentary Question that started this was put by Lord Donoughue on 8 November 2012. The Question is as follows.
To ask Her Majesty’s Government … whether they consider a rise in global temperature of 0.8 degrees Celsius since 1880 to be significant. [HL3050]
The Answer claimed that “the temperature rise since about 1880 is statistically significant”. This means that the temperature rise could not be reasonably attributed to natural random variation — i.e. global warming is real.  
…
The issue here is the claim that “the temperature rise since about 1880 is statistically significant”, which was made by the Met Office in response to the original Question (HL3050). The basis for that claim has now been effectively acknowledged to be untenable. Possibly there is some other basis for the claim, but that seems extremely implausible: the claim does not seem to have any valid basis.
=============================================
The Met office website text is here and there is a blog post here.

 ** _Introduction_**



Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Green, and distinguished members of the Committee, I thank you for the opportunity to testify in today’s important hearing.



I am Louise Bennetts, Associate Director of Financial Regulation Studies at the Cato Institute, a non‐​profit, non‐​partisan public policy research institute located here in Washington, D.C.



Before I begin, I would like to highlight that all comments I make and opinions expressed herein are my own and do not represent any official positions of the Cato Institute or any other organization. In addition, outside of my interest as a U.S. resident, consumer and taxpayer, I have no financial interest in the subject matter before the Committee today, nor do I currently represent any entities that do.



 ** _Background_**



Since 2008, commentators, industry professionals, regulators, and elected officials have made numerous, often contradictory, suggestions about how to deal with, or avoid, banking crises. These suggestions range from “bailing in” creditors, to making banks smaller (whether through size caps or limitations on acquisitions), to limiting the activities that banks undertake (the “Volcker Rule” and similar initiatives), to imposing ever more stringent regulations, in particular, on larger organizations. In addition, increasingly regulators are looking inward, trying to insulate their domestic banking sectors from external shocks.i



In the United States since 2010 we have seen the rollout of one of the most comprehensive “reform” agendas targeting the financial services industry both in the United States and abroad. The centerpiece of the reform agenda — the Dodd‐​Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act — has **394** associated rulemaking requirements and already has spurred thousands of pages of related rules.



But this is just the tip of the iceberg. As of February 2014, only 52% of the rules required by the Act have been finalized.ii Around 20% have yet to be proposed. And Dodd‐​Frank is but one component of a far greater regulatory reform agenda that includes a complete overhaul of the capital and liquidity rules imposed on the U.S. banking sector (the “Basel III” regime); a radical revision of the regulation of nonbank financial companies such as insurance firms and asset managers; changes in the regulation of the U.S. operations of foreign banks; changes in the regulation of consumer credit; imposing new monitoring and enforcement obligations on banks on behalf of the Federal government. All of these new obligations are only magnified for banks and financial service companies that operate cross‐​border. In addition, barely a month passes without a new initiative aimed at the financial services sector being proposed either in Congress or through the regulatory agencies.iii While most of these proposals will never see the light of day, they nonetheless impose a significant cost on the private sector in terms of the uncertainty they generate and the time and resources private firms must spend on evaluating the potential impact of such proposals.



The question before the Committee today is: how is this regulatory overhaul impacting the global competitiveness of the American financial services sector and, indeed, American consumers of financial services? To date, no assessment has been made and no studies have been undertaken to assess the cumulative impact or cost of all this regulation. To answer this question, in my view, we need to address two related issues:



Before I discuss these two key points with an analysis of some specific cases, I would like to make a few observations about the United States’ position in the global economy. **The United States is a net importer of capital and a net exporter of financial services and products**. Despite, or possibly even because of, its inauspicious and crisis‐​prone banking history, the United States has the world’s most vibrant capital markets and, currently, has the only well‐​developed debt market and short‐​term or overnight dollar funding market. Many foreign companies and banks raise a significant portion of their non‐​depositary short‐​term funding in the United States.



However, while the United States may have had a head start, one cannot assume a permanent state of dominance. Steps are being taken to develop high yield and other short‐​term funding markets in South East Asia, particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore as well as in Europe (although the European funding markets remain weak).iv In addition to the large European banks, several emerging markets, most notably China, are taking noteworthy steps towards the creation of worldwide banking conglomerates, by acquiring significant stakes in banks and financial companies in the developing, and to a lesser extent, the developed world.



 ** _The Costs of Regulatory Fragmentation within the United States_**



The United States’ financial services sector has long been subject to a fragmented regulatory regime, in part due to the structural spilt that historically characterized the market (between activities such as loan‐​making and underwriting) and the deep‐​seated American aversion to the “universal” banking model.v In most countries, banks and financial services companies report to a single regulatory authority. In the United States, even monoline financial firms such as commercial or investment banks must report to more than one regulatory agency and these agencies frequently have overlapping jurisdiction. This creates a competitive disadvantage for U.S. financial institutions as it increases the costs associated with regulatory compliance, decreases the efficiency of both the regulators and the regulated, opens the door for regulatory arbitrage and creates a lack of transparency as to who bears ultimate responsibility for regulatory oversight.



It could also result in the release of rules and regulations that are contradictory in nature, making it impossible for a regulated entity to be compliant with all rules at all times. The Dodd‐​Frank Act made this problem worse not better. Instead of streamlining the regulatory agencies responsible for the oversight of the financial system, the Dodd‐​Frank Act adds several new regulatory bodies — the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of Financial Research and the Financial Stability Oversight Counsel. It also gives overlapping jurisdiction to multiple regulators and carves up the regulatory “turf” in arbitrary ways.vi This has led to the situation where, for example, multiple versions of rules on the same topic have been released by more than one agency (such as was the case with the first release of the Volcker Rule proposal).



 ** _The Dangers of Financial Sector “Balkanization”_**



Several commentators and industry experts have drawn a parallel between the current climate in global financial regulation and the relations that characterized trade politics among the world’s largest economies in the early 1930s following the passage of the “Smoot‐​Hawley” Tariff Act, a situation known as “balkanization.”vii In this regard, particular attention has been paid to current measures that have protectionist implications or serve to encourage the further balkanization of financial services or the isolation of American banks, companies and individuals, (such as the Federal Reserve’s recent Foreign Banking Organization proposal or the FATCA legislation). I believe the comparison is well made.viii



In the two years following the passage of Smoot‐​Hawley, the volume of U.S. imports fell 40 percent. This was due, in part, to a decline in domestic demand, but scholars estimate that at least a quarter of this decline can be directly attributable to the act itself.ix In addition, retaliatory actions against the United States resulted in a decline of 60 percent in U.S. exports in the 1930s, and this discrimination against U.S. products persisted for decades. In addition, Smoot‐​Hawley encouraged other countries—most notably Germany—to institute retaliatory measures, leading to a worldwide trade freeze that exacerbated hardships for local consumers and almost certainly contributed to the increasingly Balkanized international environment in the period leading up to World War II.



Following a crisis, the natural inclination for any regional authority is to attempt to erect walls around local industries and operations to make it easier—at least, theoretically—to address problems at a local level. Usually this also serves to meet the demands of local interest groups harmed by the crisis. But for U.S. regulators, the lesson from the Smoot‐​Hawley experience should be clear: this approach may yield positive results in the immediate term only, if at all, and any positive outcomes are far outweighed by the negative effects of retaliation. As the world’s leading financial services economy, the actions of U.S. policymakers have a disproportionate effect on the global financial sector and are likely to spur retaliatory actions elsewhere in the world. When it comes to the regulatory “marketplace,” the United States is a “price‐​setter” and ought to lead by example.



Indeed, my great fear is that the response to the 2007-08 Financial Crisis in the United States may be a classic example of policymakers throwing the baby out with the bathwater. In this case it is global capital flows—as with global trade flows in the 1930s—that could potentially suffer a steep decline in the wake of the measures adopted to address the perceived problems in the financial services industry.



Although the increased size, depth, liquidity, and complexity of financial markets has received widespread criticism, including being labeled as a “cause” of the crisis, in my view this criticism is misplaced. It overlooks the significant global benefits that fluid and highly developed capital markets have accrued—benefits that have not come close to being wiped out even in the wake of the financial crisis.x



In the only detailed study released to date on the effect of post‐​crisis reforms on global capital flows, the McKinsey Global Institute (the research arm of the consulting firm McKinsey and Co.) found that since 2008, cross‐​border capital flows have fallen dramatically as banks and borrowers deleverage.xi **The firm estimates that cross‐​border capital flows have declined 60 percent since 2007**.xii Financial assets had been increasing by close to 8 percent per annum since the early 1990s, but they are now growing at under 2 percent.xiii At the same time, **government debt securities have increased by more than $15.4 trillion worldwide**. The authors note that “for three decades, capital markets and banking systems rapidly expanded and diversified, but now that process—called financial deepening— has largely ground to a halt.… Today, global financial markets are at an inflection point. One path leads to a more balkanized structure that relies primarily on domestic capital formation and concentrates risks within local banking systems.”xiv



The study also notes: “facing new regulations on capital and liquidity as well as pressures from shareholders and regulators to reduce risk, **many banks in advanced economies are winnowing down the geographies and business lines in which they operate. Since early 2007, commercial banks have sold off more than $722 billion in assets and operations, with foreign operations accounting for almost half of this total.** Regulators in many countries are moving to exert more control over the foreign banks that remain active in their jurisdictions, in some cases requesting that banks operate as subsidiaries rather than branches.”xv



Although the “Foreign Banking Organization” rule release last month by the Federal Reserve (discussed below) may stop short of requiring the full subsidiarization of foreign banks’ U.S. operations, the likely chilling effect on global capital is the same. The McKinsey Global Institute study concludes with the warning that regional differences in the availability of capital could emerge and that regions with high savings rates could find themselves with surplus capital and a shortage of good investment opportunities, while other countries could find themselves short of capital and facing lower growth.xvi



Undoubtedly, there are many factors contributing to the collapse of global capital flows post‐​2008, not least the European public debt crisis, the weaknesses in the Chinese financial sector, and a general lack of investor confidence worldwide. Nonetheless, any measures on the part of U.S. regulators that have the effect—whether intentional or incidental—of hastening the decline of such flows should be approached with extreme caution. This is especially true when it is unclear whether the measures will deliver their promised benefits.xvii



 ** _U.S. Regulatory Overreach and Potential Retaliatory Actions against American Banks and Financial Services Firms: The Case of the Federal Reserve’s “Foreign Banking Organization” Proposal xviii_**



The Federal Reserve’s FBO proposal represents a seismic shift in the regulation of U.S.-based subsidiaries and operations of foreign banks. Since the passage of the International Banking Act of 1978, foreign banks seeking to operate in the United States have been afforded considerable flexibility in the structuring of their U.S. operations.xix The Federal Reserve would now change this approach for important market players. This would require foreign banks to transfer their U.S.-based operations to an existing holding company or to a newly created one.xx Once this transfer is complete, the subsidiary would be required to comply with U.S. capital and liquidity standards as well as U.S.-specific requirements such as single counterparty credit limits, enhanced risk management practices, and early remediation requirements _in addition_ to meeting all home country requirements.xxi



At the macro level, the proposal interferes with the ability of global banks to allocate capital and liquidity in the manner they determine to be most efficient. The proposal would trap a material amount of capital and liquidity inside the U.S. subsidiary, rendering it unusable for the rest of the institution. Ironically, the Federal Reserve itself noted the benefits of its traditional approach to foreign bank supervision in the preamble to the FBO proposal: “[T]he structural diversity and consolidated management of capital and liquidity permitted under th[is] approach has facilitated cross‐​border banking and increased global flows of capital and liquidity.”xxii But the corollary is also true. If such flows stimulate economic growth, any reduction in those flows is likely to inhibit growth and prolong recessionary or sluggish tendencies. This seems a major drawback to a proposal introduced at a time when the Federal Reserve is engaged in unprecedented expansionary monetary policies to stimulate growth.



The Federal Reserve’s FBO proposal also contains a potential serious drawback for American banks and financial services firms, particularly those with significant cross‐​border operations. If foreign regulators use the same reasoning as the Federal Reserve, the FBO proposal would likely further encourage additional protectionist measures to be taken by foreign regulators. These measures could include retaliatory actions against U.S. banking organizations with significant international operations.



Many foreign supervisors raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s proposal during the public comment process, and they may well take more drastic actions if the FBO proposal is retained.xxiii Indeed, if the United States’ principal “systemic” regulator takes the position that ex ante ring‐​fencing of the U.S. operations of foreign banks is necessary to safeguard the U.S. financial system, why would other home country regulators not follow suit? And if they do, we will see a domino effect where host countries impose inefficient individual capital and liquidity requirements or move to requiring full subsidiarization.xxiv Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s FBO proposal _explicitly_ questions the principle of international cooperation that has been at the heart of cross‐​border bank supervision and regulation for decades



 ** _“Optimal” Levels of Capital and American Competitiveness_**



It is an article of faith that “well‐​capitalized” banks are safer banks. There can be no doubt that despite meeting existing regulatory capital requirements, many banks were under‐​capitalized and over‐​leveraged going into the Financial Crisis in 07/08. This increased the need for these institutions to rely on volatile short‐​term funding. While it is easy to suggest banks need to be “well‐​capitalized,” no‐​one seems able to agree on exactly what this term means, hence the difficulties associated with structuring global capital standards and the resulting complexity of the Basel III regime and related initiatives. In addition, there is a clear trade‐​off here: imposing very stringent capital requirements unavoidably reduces the funds available to banks to lend out or otherwise put to use in the broader economy. But there is also a more fundamental question: are high levels of capital and low leverage really a cure‐​all for financial crises?



Many commentators have noted — correctly — that smaller commercial banks, particularly those with assets of less than a billion dollars — operate with much higher equity capital reserves and far lower leverage than their larger and more diversified peers. Yet, in the United States, these smaller banks have a significantly higher rate of failure than larger banks. If capital were the only measure of stability, why should this be so? As we learn during every financial crisis, banks fail for one reason — undiversified risk.



We cannot eliminate risk from the banking system. Banking is nothing more than the pooling and management of risk. But if we view undiversified risk as the key cause of bank failure, then initiatives such as the Basel III risk‐​weighting system can potentially heighten the riskiness of banks even though the intention is to make banks better capitalized. This is because the regime uses advanced modeling techniques to determine which classes of assets are “safer” than others. It then incentivizes banks to hold assets in those “safer “classes, resulting in the assets held by banks becoming more concentrated not less — at both the firm and the industry‐​level.



 **I support the use of risk weighting models at the individual firm level. But, the industry‐​wide reliance on the same financial models is a recipe for a future crisis because all financial models, regardless of the complexity or sophistication, will contain some errors and when adopted by all industry participants, these errors can lead to a system‐​wide problem.** The same concerns can be raised about the C‐​CAR/​stress‐​testing process run by the Federal Reserve in which all major U.S. banks participate. While the models the Federal Reserve uses to determine whether banks are adequately capitalized are extremely sophisticated, they are nonetheless just that — models. And early indications are that U.S. banks have become increasingly focused on aligning their models with that of the Federal Reserve instead of focusing on their own concerns about market risk.



Some policymakers have proposed including a simple leverage ratio be used as a “backstop”. I should note that the proposed leverage ratio is an **additional** measure, _not_ a replacement. It is also an idea that has far greater traction in the United States — while regulators in Europe and Asia will adopt some leverage measure, it is unlikely to be especially stringent. Therefore, a proposal such as the one contemplated by some senior officials at the FDIC is an added burden on U.S. financial institutions and creates a competitive disadvantage because it is one that their foreign peers will not be subject to. Although a leverage ratio has the benefit of simplicity as a standalone measure and can be easily monitored and understood, it nonetheless does not cure the fundamental flaw in the risk weighting system — the tendency for concentration in certain asset pools. Therefore as an addition to the Basel III regime it is not especially helpful, in my view. It is clear that many of the proponents of the initiative view it not as a means to create safer institutions, but rather as a means to downsize large institutions (by forcing them to include derivative and other off‐​balance sheet activities in their liability calculations). The effect of this is to drive those activities into the unregulated sector or into single‐​activity shops, which may not be the most desirable outcome and may further segment the market. But this begs the question: if we are so concerned about leverage, why do we continue to incentivize banks and individuals to become over‐​leveraged in the first place? We have a system that heavily penalizes equity holders, while rewarding holders of debt with tax breaks and the like. Instead of imposing blunt tools that require expensive monitoring and enforcement on these institutions, we could begin by reforming the incentive structure that they operate under.



 ** _Differing Approaches to Regulation: Europe v. the United States_**



It may be worth highlighting that the United States and the European parliament have taken very different approaches to imposing the financial reform agenda and that this may further place U.S. institutions at a disadvantage. The recent passage of the final “Volcker Rule” in the United States (in particular the ban on proprietary trading) and its equivalent proposal before the European parliament is a useful case in point. While I should note that I disagree with the imposition of a ban on proprietary trading in any form as I consider it to be unnecessary, it nonetheless illustrates the differences in approaches taken by the United States and Europe. I should also note that the proposal before the EEC is in its very early stages and may never be enacted in its current form or at all).



The Europeans favor a “principle‐​based” approach, by outlining a simple prohibition. They do not impose extensive or costly compliance and monitoring obligations. They do not attempt to guess the intention of the trader or list and carve out every scenario that may conceivably lead to or indicate the presence of proprietary trading. If a bank can demonstrate that its trading activities are nominally in the client interest, it should fall comfortably within the rule. In contrast, the final Volcker Rule in the United States is an extremely poorly‐​drafted and highly‐​technical document that spans hundreds of pages and imposes an extremely complex and costly regime on banks and industry participants.



 ** _Conclusion_**



The time has come to acknowledge that we are at a crossroads — globally and domestically. One path leads to a system where American banks and financial services firms, buckling under the weight of excessive and contradictory regulations, become less diversified, less competitive globally, more inward looking and, in my view, potentially more unstable. This path leads to a sub‐​optimal outcome — one in which financial firms are less focused on market drivers and meeting the needs of consumers and more on pleasing local regulatory authorities. Another path begins with the recognition that we already may have gone a step too far. The time has come to ask ourselves, “what was the purpose of this all?” If the purpose is to make the United States banking sector less crisis‐​prone, safer and more competitive, we need a comprehensive and realistic assessment of whether all these regulations — given their significant costs — are achieving that outcome. I thank‐​you for the opportunity to testify today.

viii In June 1930, Congress passed the Tariff Act, colloquially known as “Smoot‐​Hawley” after its two Republican sponsors. Smoot‐​Hawley raised tariffs on approximately 20,000 imported products to unprecedentedly high levels. Ostensibly, the act’s purpose was to protect U.S. industries, workers, and prices in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929, but its medium‐ and long‐​term effects were dire. Although imports accounted for only 4 percent of U.S. gross domestic product at the time, Smoot‐​Hawley had significant, if concentrated, regional effects and in particular served to further weaken the United States’ already‐​struggling banking system.

 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **Orakei Ward**



I’ve lived in this area for several years, in Remuera and Meadowbank for 3 years before moving over to the Shore for work reasons. Returned to this side of the bridge last September, living in St. Johns. Really feels like being back home again.



Incredibly my voting papers are still sitting on the kitchen bench unopened, a change from my usual modus operandi which is to tear them open during the journey from letterbox to door. Couldn’t see the point in opening them until I’ve researched the Council race today and the Local Board contest tomorrow. I don’t know about everyone who follows this guide but I am literally waiting to read my recommendations before voting.



[ **Alan Barraclough**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/who-you-can-vote-for.aspx)– Green Party **$**



It’s not uncommon to see the Green party stand someone in this ward, with the exception of Cameron Brewer’s unopposed win in 2013. I wouldn’t have thought the party viewed Orakei as fertile territory. Interesting side-point from UN is the discovery that lifting people out of poverty has the unexpected consequence of being environmentally beneficial! Once community GDP breaches the US$5000 mark, individuals are sufficiently wealthy to start prioritising environmental improvements in their societies. Perhaps Alan is targeting the guilt-ridden wealthy liberal vote?



Barraclough believes there are more safety improvements that can be made on local roads for protecting children, pedestrians and cyclists. He has mentioned traffic islands along Remuera Road, a stretch that is generally slow and congested throughout the week anyway. Radical-leftists Generation Zero scored Alan Barraclough a B rating (that 75% for competence must have hurt).



Alan’s priorities if elected are:



[ **Mike Padfield**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=9cf532ef-47af-494c-8e7d-acf0ecf18797&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=%C5%8Cr%C4%81kei%20Ward)– Better Auckland **$$**



The Better Auckland ticket has Padfield and Carmel Claridge running for Council in Orakei and Maungakiekie-Tamaki respectively. Mike’s approach to city planning is a bit more rigid and narrow minded than his running mate.



Padfield lives in the area, owns a small business and has 20 years of involvement in Council and community issues. This is his second crack at winning Orakei; a tall ask considering the popularity of the incumbent. He was categorically thumped in 2016, finishing behind the Green candidate.



His priority is always Progress not Politics. Like those who cry People Before Profit who are left bereft of profit for the people, Mike will find it tough to make progress if he writes-off the necessary politics to achieve progress.



His biggest passion is enhancing parks, reserves and community facilities and begrudges the perceived ignorance of our neighbourhood by Council, despite the high rates paid in the area. He has a point though if the amount of rates paid was the main determining factor in where it is spent, wealthy local boards would be showered with cash while Otara-Papatoetoe has very little.



He is opposed to any selling off of parks and reserves, a mainstream local body viewpoint even in the very bluest of wards and says High Rise development in every street must stop. I think he is exaggerating a little but Auckland needs to remove the urban boundary to reduce land prices, building up and out. Protecting the property rights of existing home owners is my measure of appropriate development, not whether someone down the road is building a house that looks different to yours.



[ **Desley Simpson –**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=2bb58ea4-562f-43cc-9908-e5f401a916b0&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=%C5%8Cr%C4%81kei%20Ward)C&R – Communities & Residents[ ****](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=2bb58ea4-562f-43cc-9908-e5f401a916b0&srchtype=Ward&areavalue=%C5%8Cr%C4%81kei%20Ward)**$$$$$**



Simpson is world famous in Orakei and very popular with the locals. She was Chair of Orakei Local Board 2010-16 and succeeded Cameron Brewer as Councillor in 2016.



Desley received a red cross from Auckland Ratepayers Alliance this month for signing their 2016 pledge to keep rate increases capped at 2% but voting for a 3.5% increase onwards from now.



However, Desley claims that she has championed a new ‘Value for Money’ programme producing $260 million savings in the first two years. A Herald reporter questioned these figures on [Simpson’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/desley.simpson/posts/10156669081197709). Simpson doubled down in response to his claim that the Value for Money programme had saved $500k this year. She advised that Value for Money had realised $270m in savings over two years (Orsman claims 10 years) with an additional $69m saved on top this term…



I was somewhat sceptical and asked for evidence of the claims which Simpson provided:



In black and white, Value for Money programme reviews estimate $430 million in savings over ten years with $270 million already achieved. Desley Simpson is Chair of the Quality Advice Working Party, which has achieved a requirement that council agendas now contain headings including financial implications and risks.



I haven’t supported everything Desley has done while on Council. When Eden Park put out the begging bowl to Auckland Council, Desley voted with the majority to grant Eden Park $9.8 million rather than an alternative proposal to loan the money with no interest and no end date, only to be paid should the land be sold. I believe she aligned herself to the wrong side when supporting the implementation of Mayor Goff’s failed bed tax.



However when St.Heliers was under threat of wide-scale chaos being inflicted by Auckland transport on its roads, Simpson stood up for her ward against proposals to remove 40 car parks, build 12 additional raised zebra crossings, new traffic islands and extra cycle lane divisions.



It barely need be mentioned, but I suspect the Queen of the East will reign at least another three years.



 **MY RECOMMENDATION:** You may cast one vote in this FPP contest

This is a scathing and revealing comment from another scientist regarding the Marcott et al affair. The context of it all has an odor of hydrogen sulfide about it.

There are a few bad eggs, with the Real Climate mafia being among them, who are exploiting climate science for personal and political gain. Makes the whole effort look bad.
-Dr. Roger Pielke Jr. in a comment (#6) on his blog
The larger posting is also quite interesting where Dr. Pielke suggests that “misconduct” might be an applicable term.
Dr. Pielke writes:
=============================================================


In 1991 the National Research Council proposed what has come to be a widely accepted definition of misconduct in science:

Misconduct in science is defined as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism, in proposing, performing, or reporting research. Misconduct in science does not include errors of judgment; errors in the recording, selection, or analysis of data; differences in opinions involving the interpretation of data; or misconduct unrelated to the research process.
Arguments over data and methods are the lifeblood of science, and are not instances of misconduct.
However, here I document the gross misrepresentation of the findings of a recent scientific paper via press release which appears to skirt awfully close to crossing the line into research misconduct, as defined by the NRC. I recommend steps to fix this mess, saving face for all involved, and a chance for this small part of the climate community to take a step back toward unambiguous scientific integrity.
The paper I refer to is by Marcott et al. 2013, published recently in Science. A press release issued by the National Science Foundation, which funded the research, explains the core methodology and key conclusion of the paper as follows (emphasis added):
Peter Clark, an OSU paleoclimatologist and co-author of the Science paper, says that many previous temperature reconstructions were regional and not placed in a global context.
“When you just look at one part of the world, temperature history can be affected by regional climate processes like El Niño or monsoon variations,” says Clark.
“But when you combine data from sites around the world, you can average out those regional anomalies and get a clear sense of the Earth’s global temperature history.”
What that history shows, the researchers say, is that during the last 5,000 years, the Earth on average cooled about 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit–until the last 100 years, when it warmed about 1.3 degrees F.
The press release clearly explains that the paper (a) combines data from many sites around the world to create a “temperature reconstruction” which gives a “sense of the Earth’s temperature history,” and (b) “that history shows” a cooling over the past 5000 years, until the last 100 years when all of that cooling was reversed.
The conclusions of the press release were faithfully reported by a wide range of media outlets, and below I survey several of them to illustrate that the content of the press release was accurately reflected in media coverage and, at times, amplified by scientists both involved and not involved with the study.
…
Let me be perfectly clear — I am accusing no one of scientific misconduct. The errors documented here could have been the product of group dynamics, institutional dysfunction, miscommunication, sloppiness or laziness (do note that misconduct can result absent explicit intent). However, what matters most now is how the relevant parties respond to the identification of a clear misrepresentation of a scientific paper by those who should not make such errors.
That response will say a lot about how this small but visible part of the climate community views the importance of scientific integrity.

Given this concession in the recent Marcott et al FAQs:
20th century portion of our paleotemperature stack is not statistically robust, cannot be considered representative of global temperature changes, and therefore is not the basis of any of our conclusions.
It seems there is a lot of walkback to do not only for the people who did the study and pushed the press release, but those who reported on it as if that uptick was valid, when clearly if has been demonstrated to be nothing more than an artifact of statistical methods and data manipulations.
It seems a clear case of noble cause corruption by “the team” for “the cause”. Will the NSF do anything about it? I doubt it, as their herd circling has already begun over at Real Climate. Being institutionalized science, they’ll worry more about how to spin it up and down the climate food chain than to come clean about the issue in my opinion.
Perhaps the best way for regular folks like us to counter the damage done is that anytime Marcott et al is mentioned, to always refer to the Marcott et al graph as this version below, along with the quote from their FAQs since the uptick “is not statistically robust, cannot be considered representative of global temperature changes”:

I have to wonder, given the fact that Marcott’s thesis paper didn’t contain such an uptick, and then after being welcomed into the “climate syndicate” (or as Pielke Jr. calls them, “Real Climate mafia”) with all of the features, upgrades, and connections that membership provides, maybe this is simply a case of them making young Mr. Marcott an offer he couldn’t refuse.

"WASHINGTON  —   Emboldened by weeks of protests across the country, congressional Democrats are digging in as Republicans try to swiftly remake a government shaped by the Obama administration. Tensions over President Trump’s early efforts to deliver on a long menu of campaign promises have spilled into the halls of Congress, turning   debates into a proxy battle over a combative president. With the Senate already hinting it could work through the weekend, expect another busy week at the Capitol. Let us get you up to speed. ■ Vice President Mike Pence could well be needed to break a   tie in the Senate over the nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. ■ Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, could be confirmed by the end of the week. ■ Republicans in Congress will also vote to roll back   regulations. Mr. Pence may be summoned to the Capitol early this week to cast the 51st vote to confirm Ms. DeVos as education secretary over vociferous, now bipartisan objections. The Senate could vote on her nomination as late as Tuesday. Congressional trivia buffs, take note: It would be the first time that the vice president has been forced to cast a tiebreaking vote on a cabinet nomination, said Betty K. Koed, the Senate historian. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska thrust Ms. DeVos’s nomination into question last week when they became the first two Republicans to declare their opposition. Should the Democratic caucus vote as a bloc, their votes would set up a   tie that Mr. Pence would have to settle in his capacity as president of the Senate. The Capitol has been flooded with thousands of constituent calls and messages, many of them urging senators to vote against Ms. DeVos. Still, it looks unlikely that any more Republicans will defect, and that would be enough to confirm her. Once the Senate deals with the DeVos nomination, it will move on to the nomination of Mr. Sessions to be attorney general. First comes a procedural vote that sets the timer for up to 30 hours of debate before the final vote. That means Mr. Sessions’s confirmation vote should come later this week, at which point the Senate will start the process over with the nomination of Representative Tom Price of Georgia to be secretary of health and human services, followed by a vote on the nomination of Steven T. Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary. Of course, just because Democrats may not have the votes to block Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees does not mean they will go quietly. Having stacked up as many parliamentary roadblocks as they could find last week, Democrats are expected to take advantage of the mandatory debate time, probably to air their concerns about Mr. Trump’s picks as well as grievances against their Republican counterparts, who they believe have stymied a thorough examination of some nominees. That could be bad news for senators with plans on Saturday: Republican leaders may keep the Senate in session over the weekend to get the job done. After dusting off  the Congressional Review Act last week, the House will use that momentum to continue rolling back recently finalized   regulations. On Tuesday, the House is scheduled to vote to toss out three rules: an Interior Department rule intended to increase transparency and public input on the use of public lands an Education Department rule that spells out provisions of a recent education law regarding accountability and another Education Department rule that sets the parameters for gathering and sharing data on teacher training programs. The Senate began taking up these regulations between nomination votes last week, and it is likely to continue this week, voting after the House to roll back each rule one by one before it is sent to the president. Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the federal appeals court judge nominated by Mr. Trump for the Supreme Court, will continue his courtesy meetings with senators. Judge Gorsuch is expected to meet on Monday with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, after having sat down last week with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ms. Feinstein has expressed reservations about Judge Gorsuch, as has Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, who said Mr. Trump’s propensity for flouting “the rule of law” demanded “an independent jurist. ” Two weeks after congressional Republicans and Senate Democrats ducked out for their policy retreats, the House Democratic caucus will slip away on Wednesday for its summit meeting in Baltimore. While Republicans spent part of their retreat debating  —   and occasionally fretting  —   about how to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Democrats seem likely to strategize their response. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, has seized every recent opportunity to condemn Republican plans to get rid of the health care law, as Democrats continue to transmit a simple message across the aisle about the nation’s health care system: If you break it, you buy it."
"**Vaccines in general have saved more lives than almost anything apart from clean water. They have been shown to**pay for themselves and much more **.**
The easiest way to imagine the impact of an approved vaccine in economic terms is to imagine the board meetings happening in companies up and down the country right now.
Weary executives, finance directors in particular, will be signing off on investment plans for the fiscal year starting in April 2021.
The very basis of those calculations will now alter, with the reasonable chance that most of that year could resemble a situation more normal than abnormal, thanks to at least one approved vaccine.
It is the shot in the arm required for medium-term confidence, and could prevent a self-fulfilling spiral of negativity, closure and joblessness.
Nothing is certain, but those planning on the basis of some sort of normal, will feel confidence to take risks, that keep more people employed, and the economy growing. Clearly an approved, rolled out, effective and well-used vaccine will eventually reduce the need for lockdowns and severe social restrictions.
In a March study from the Resolution Foundation, which accurately predicted the double digit hit to the economy and the public finances from the pandemic, Covid-19 was best thought of as following the economic path of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa or Spanish flu in 1918-19, with multiple peaks and troughs.
We have never had a vaccine arrive in the middle of a pandemic before, so the benefits could be extremely large. It could be the equivalent of the East Asian countries' which, through effective public health measures (rather than a vaccine), dodged the long-term fiscal and economic impact of SARS in 2003, and Covid-19 over the past year.
In other words it could, in economic terms, make up for the relatively sluggish response at the beginning of the pandemic.
The author of that paper, Richard Hughes, is now the chief executive of the Office for Budget Responsibility.
This approval pushes the fate of the economy a little closer to the ""upside scenario"" set out in the OBR's forecasts for the UK economy last week. This assumers there would be ""widespread"" vaccine availability by Spring, bringing back a more normal economy at the time the furlough scheme is due to end, and therefore causing only a small increase in unemployment.
Two notes of caution. The very short-term impact might work both ways. The restrictions could stay in place, and perhaps be stricter than they otherwise would have been.
Also the key voluntary social distancing - where the public simply decides not to go to restaurants, pubs and shops - may be maintained at a higher level through to the spring.
Why? Because, as the government itself is advising, with the scientific cavalry on the way, and light at the end of the tunnel, why take risks right now? Also the early direct beneficiaries of vaccination will be concentrated among the most elderly and at risk, as well as health workers. It will not be the public at large.
Three months of patience might weigh on the social side of the economy at the same time as fundamental changes to trade affect the manufacturing and service sectors.
And then there is the fact that the success of the scheme is now baked in to asset prices. Any plausible deviation or setback, either to rollout or in the science, risks precipitating a quick downside for stock markets and house prices.
Risks aside, the development, approval and acquisition of an effective vaccine stands to offer an incalculable boost to people's lives, but livelihoods too, over the next year.
This is the first approved vaccine for human use for any coronavirus ever. It's also the first ever vaccine to be available in the middle of a pandemic. And that could offer an economic stimulus far greater than anything the Bank of England and HM Treasury could provide."

Barack Obama’s success at cultivating minorities, especially immigrants, seems to have caught the attention of Republican political strategists.



It isn’t clear how they missed the boat, since there are almost 40 million foreign‐​born people living in the U.S. — about 12.9 percent of the population. California has the highest percentage of foreign‐​born people (25.4 percent), followed by New York (10.8 percent), Texas (10.4 percent) and Florida (9.2 percent). Altogether, about three‐​quarters of foreign‐​born people live in 10 states.



How can Republicans appeal to immigrants now? Having talked so much about building electrified fences along our borders, denying jobs for unauthorized immigrants and deporting them, Republicans don’t have much credibility on this issue. “The GOP has a long history of fumbling immigration,” as Jason L. Riley put it delicately in his book _Let Them In_.



What are Republicans to do? Since they’re on a dead‐​end street, they must turn around, but they’ll have to do it convincingly — as if they like it and believe in it. Republicans since Ronald Reagan have generally supported pro‐​growth policies, so the most credible way to reach immigrants would be to aggressively promote an agenda that’s all about growth and opportunity.



A pro‐​growth agenda would look something like this: (1) cut taxes across the board, including taxes paid by investors and job creators; (2) simplify the tax code; (3) phase out regulations that make it more costly and difficult to create private sector jobs; (4) phase out regulations that throttle (or threaten to throttle) energy production; (5) phase out regulations that restrict trade; (6) stop politicians from trying to pick winners and lavish special privileges on political cronies; (7) no more bailouts — let the parties involved with a troubled company resolve issues in an established bankruptcy proceeding; (8) direct the Fed to protect the value of the U.S. dollar, so everyone can make plans for the future with more confidence; and (9) phase out immigration quotas.



Many Republicans might object to the idea of ending quotas that restrict the number of able‐​bodied immigrants who don’t pose national security risks. But Republicans believe in a market economy, and a market economy thrives when there’s free movement of people, goods and capital. Republicans sometimes seem to have forgotten about the free movement of people.



Consider that in the decade between 1900 and 1909, a near record 8.2 million immigrants arrived at our shores. About the only immigrants denied entry into the United States were those believed to have a disease or a criminal record. During this decade, the percentage foreign‐​born people in the population was at an all‐​time high. According to the Census Bureau’s _Historical Statistics of the United States_ , unemployment got down to 1.7 percent (in 1906) — the lowest recorded peacetime level in U.S. history.



How could this be? Well, when taxes are low, when there are few regulatory obstacles to enterprise, and it’s easy and inexpensive to start a business — entrepreneurs can create productive jobs fast, maintaining low unemployment even when the labor force expands rapidly.



Immigrants themselves create a substantial share of new jobs. Immigrants include the most entrepreneurial part of our population, because they take the very difficult step of leaving their homeland. By coming to America, they demonstrate that they’re open to new things and willing to work hard. The labor force participation rate of recent immigrants is reported as high as 94 percent, about one third higher than the general population.



A Kauffman Foundation study about Silicon Valley in the 1980s and 1990s pointed out that (1) immigrants accounted for about one‐​third of the scientists and engineers, and (2) Chinese and Indian entrepreneurs managed a quarter of the technology businesses. These businesses generated more than $16 billion of annual revenue and employed more than 58,000 people.



A 2007 study by researchers at Duke University and the University of California (Berkeley) analyzed high tech businesses started between 1995 and 2005. More than one quarter had at least one founder who was foreign‐​born. Their companies generated more than $50 billion of annual revenue and employed over 450,000 people.



A 2012 follow‐​up study by researchers at Duke University, the University of California (Berkeley) and Stanford University reported that “43.9 percent of Silicon Valley startups founded in the last seven years had at least one key founder who was an immigrant.” These companies generated more than $60 billion of revenue and employed some 560,000 people.



According to the National Science Foundation, during the last half‐​century, foreign‐​born students earned three‐​quarters of U.S. doctorate degrees in mathematics, engineering and computer science. Once they graduate, U.S. educated foreign students are awarded patents at a significantly higher rate than U.S.-born workers.



Moreover, economist Gordon H. Hanson, at the University of California (San Diego), reported in _The Cato Journal_ , “U.S. university departments that have more foreign graduate students produce more academic publications and have their work cited more frequently.”



Incredibly, U.S. immigration laws drive away many entrepreneurial immigrants, despite their immense contributions. The waiting list for a permanent resident visa (green card) has been as long as 10 years.



As a consequence, the Kauffman Foundation reported, the percentage of companies started in the U.S. by immigrants has begun to decline. Apparently this is because tens of thousands of immigrants have gone back where they came from to start businesses. About 80 percent of the Chinese surveyed and 70 percent of the Indians reported that the business climate is now better at home. This is a competitive world, and the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate.



MIT President Susan Hockfield noted that a quarter‐​century ago, the U.S. was _the_ place to be for technology innovators, but she warned that fewer foreign‐​born innovators are willing to put up with the “indignities” of our immigration laws. So much for immigration restrictions that harm us by driving away high‐​skill people.



What about low‐​skill immigrants? They’re people who commonly do farming, construction, maintenance, food service and household work.



First of all, these are often physically demanding jobs that most Americans don’t seem to be interested in. Also, many of the jobs are seasonal and require that workers move from place to place. Most Americans have more attractive options, in part because their English is better.



Second, some of the low‐​skill immigrant jobs — especially household work — enable high‐​skill people to spend more time on their professional work, particularly when such couples have children. Consequently, low‐​skill immigrants enable us to gain more benefits from high‐​skill people.



Third, the income people earn upon arriving in the United States is a poor predictor of future achievement. If we turned away every immigrant who didn’t have much money, we would have missed large numbers of people who became great successes. One need only recall the mass immigration of eastern European Jews who arrived destitute. They squeezed into New York City’s Lower East Side tenements, some 700 people per acre — reportedly more crowded than the slums of Bombay. Many of these people found work as day laborers, but their children became doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs.



Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Thomas Sowell reported that “immigrants begin economically below the level of existing members of their own ethnic group already in the country, but eventually rise to surpass them. The lengthy period required to equal the economic level of people of the same race or ethnicity born on American soil suggests the amount of human capital needed — experience, contacts, personal and institutional savvy.



However, the fact that immigrants eventually surpass their native‐​born counterparts also suggests that migration is a selective process, bringing the more ambitious or venturesome elements of a population.”



Beyond the economic benefits of immigration, there are enormous cultural benefits. New York and California are cultural capitals, in part, because they have high foreign‐​born populations. People tend to become more cosmopolitan when exposed to very different ideas about business, science, technology, art, music, literature, fashion, cuisine and all sorts of other things.



Immigrants probably first began to enrich our culture with their food. The overwhelming majority of foods we love are foreign‐​born — they originated someplace else.



Archeological evidence suggests that chickens were first domesticated in Pakistan. Sheep seem to have been first domesticated in what is now Iraq. Cattle, in Greece and Anatolia. The Egyptians were among the earliest people to cultivate wheat.



Apples are considered about as wholesomely American as anything can be, but the apple, _Malus pumila_ , seems to have come from central Asia. Pears and grapes are from central Asia, too. Oranges, peaches, apricots and Japanese plums are from China. Bananas, from India or Malaysia. Pineapples, from Brazil or Paraguay. Cherries, from northern Europe. Olives originated in the eastern Mediterranean.



As for vegetables, garlic and onions originated in central Asia. Scallions, sometimes referred to as Welsh onions, are from China.



The earliest green peas – _Pisum sativum_ – were cultivated around India, Ethiopia and the Near East.



Potatoes originated in the Andes, possibly Chile from which they were probably brought to Peru, then to Ireland during the 16th century, and Irish immigrants introduced potatoes to New England.



A meager‐​looking maize probably originated in Peru, then crossed with other varieties to emerge in Guatemala as flour corn which was brought to North America and hybridized into modern sweet corn during the 19th century.



Tomatoes originated in the Andes, but perhaps because they’re in the same botanical family as deadly nightshade, Americans avoided them until the 18th century, after Europeans showed they weren’t poisonous.



The American language became the richest in the world, because the settlers encountered so many different kinds of people.



From Native American languages came words like raccoon, possum, caribou, moose, skunk, squash, hickory, pecan, persimmon, moccasin and caucus. The names of most U.S. states are based on Native American words: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North & South Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming.



A surprising number of American words are from Arabic, like alfalfa, algebra, sofa, spinach, sugar, carat, coffee, candy, cotton, giraffe, safari, jar, racquet, guitar, hummus, lemon, lime, orange, magazine, mattress, mummy, tariff, tuna, assassin and zero.



Many American words come from Spanish, like chile, chocolate, oregano, banana, avocado, barbecue, cafeteria, mosquito, alligator, rodeo, mustang, burro, corral, plaza, cannibal, canoe, cargo, poncho, stampede, tornado, bonanza, armada, amigo and adios.



Among the French contributions to our language: portage, chauffeur, acrobat, action, biscuit, caramel, chowder, cache, bomb, blonde, caress, camouflage, prairie, chapel, gopher, beauty, bribe, bureaucrat, calendar, bogus, chute, depot, début, capitalist and résumé.



The Dutch gave us cookie, cruller, waffle, cole‐​slaw, decoy, filibuster, golf, iceberg, leak, pump, skate, smuggler, spook, stove, aloof, bamboo, booze, boss, bedspread, wagon, sled, yacht, tulip, Santa Claus and Yankee.



Italians gave us mainly words about good living — spaghetti, ravioli, pizza, arugula, artichoke, broccoli, chianti, minestrone, ciabatta, panini, coffee, latte and cappuccino, as well as vista, harmonica, piano and opera. Then there’s volcano, umbrella, bankrupt, mafia, fiasco and gonzo.



From the Chinese: chow‐​main, chop‐​suey, stir‐​fry, ketchup, flophouse, kowtow and tycoon. Soy‐​bean, sushi, tofu, kimono, futon, bonsai, karate, jiu‐​jitsu, honcho and sayonara come from the Japanese.



Words of Yiddish origin include bagel, lox, blintze, nosh, kosher, kibitz, klutz, tush, schlemiel, spiel and schlep.



Germans gave us frankfurter, hamburger, delicatessen, sauerkraut, noodle, pumpernickel, pretzel, kindergarden, dunk, dumb, loafer, bum, gabfest and slugfest.



One might add that before English settlers came to America, their language had absorbed words from many different places, too. Over time, immigrants and their descendants go into so many different fields that the cultural benefits of immigration multiply.



Consider the Germans. The long list includes astronaut Neil Armstrong, dancer Fred Astaire, _Wizard of Oz_ author L. Frank Baum, landscape painter Albert Bierstadt, brewer Adolphus Busch, singer John Denver, entertainment entrepreneur Walt Disney, physicist Albert Einstein, New York Yankee legend Lou Gehrig, condiment king Henry J. Heinz, hotelier Conrad Hilton, comedian David Letterman, novelist Thomas Mann, dishwasher entrepreneur Frederick Maytag, journalist H.L. Mencken, movie director Mike Nichols, _New York Times_ publisher Adolph Ochs, pharmaceutical entrepreneur Charles Pfizer, architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, slugger Babe Ruth, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, novelist John Steinbeck, piano maker Henry E. Steinway, blue jeans peddler Levi Strauss, real estate wheeler‐​dealer Donald Trump and electrical industry pioneer George Westinghouse.



To be sure, not every immigrant contribution to our culture is wonderful, but not everything that native‐​born people do is wonderful, either. We’re free to choose what we like.



One of the most serious concerns about immigrants is that they’ll come here for entitlement benefits. This is an inherent problem with welfare states: they try to take care of those in need, but if they’re too generous, they undermine incentives to work, and everybody is worse off. Immigrants could become resented as freeloaders, which has happened in Europe.



For the record, authorized as well as unauthorized immigrants are barred from receiving federal welfare benefits. On the other hand, all children, including the children of foreign‐​born parents, are required to attend school. In addition, Medicaid is available for the children of immigrants. Others are treated in hospital emergency rooms, often at public expense.



Of course, entitlement benefits undermine the incentives for native‐​born people to work, too. Increasingly, the United States is divided between those who receive more government benefits than they pay in taxes, and those who pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. This problem has little to do with immigration.



Many opponents of open immigration seem to believe that some immigrants are more supportive of a free society than others. Europeans, for instance. But Great Britain, where so many historic breakthroughs for liberty occurred, adopted forced labor during the late 1940s, and it has had a big welfare state ever since, as does France, Italy and the rest of Europe.



Many entrepreneurial immigrants come from India which has a socialist state and China which has a communist state. Meanwhile, we see Hispanics working hard almost everywhere.



Questions have been raised about Muslim immigrants who presumably came here to escape oppressive regimes in the Mideast, Asia and North Africa. It is disquieting, though, not to hear many moderate Muslims speaking out against radical Islam.



What about Obama’s effort to recruit more Democratic voters among immigrants?



He might encounter difficulties. People seem less willing to support other races, nationalities or ethnic groups, than they are to support their own kind. In Los Angeles, for example, Latinos have resented blacks who held a far larger percentage of municipal jobs than their percentage of the population. Blacks, the least entrepreneurially inclined, have resented Latino entrepreneurs who mainly hired other Latinos by word‐​of‐​mouth. Similarly, a Los Angeles hospital, intended to serve blacks, ended up primarily serving Latinos, because the neighborhood changed. Blacks also resented Koreans — the most entrepreneurial of immigrant groups — and during the Los Angeles riots of the early 1990s, reportedly about 40 percent of the businesses torched were Korean. The _Washington Post_ went so far as to suggest that the “biggest bigots” are often minorities.



Several studies have suggested that the United States, until now anyway, has had much lower levels of welfare state spending and taxation than Europe, because the United States is more ethnically diversified, and there are more people concerned that their taxes will benefit another group.



Phasing out immigration quotas could help promote ethnic diversity and have an unintended consequence of undermining the political consensus for entitlements. This would be a good thing from the standpoint of federal finances, since runaway entitlement spending is the most important single factor that drives federal spending, deficits and debt, making it harder to fund other governmental functions.



If Republicans can do a better job promoting the freedom philosophy and pro‐​growth policies, enabling entrepreneurs to create more businesses and jobs, then it might be perceived as the party of real opportunity, which would help it become politically competitive again.



Nothing, not even welfare state freebies, is likely to be as persuasive as freedom, growth, jobs and prosperity.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNorth Pole and South Pole Ice
By Ed Caryl
Why do the north and south polar regions seem to be opposites? Why is ice increasing around Antarctica, and decreasing in the Arctic Ocean?
The answer lies in the other ways that these two regions are opposites. At the South Pole lies a continent. The ice cap there lies over land, is up to two miles thick over rugged terrain, and can move (flow) only very, very, slowly, largely due to gravity. Only the sea ice can move rapidly, and that movement is at the whim of the wind.
At the North Pole, there is an ocean. There is (except for Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago) only sea ice, again moving at the whim of the wind. The difference is the large chunk of continental ice at the South Pole is surrounded by ocean, instead of (at the North Pole) a large ocean surrounded by land.
In order to visualize conditions, here is a diagram of the earth’s winds.

Figure 1 is a diagram of the winds and atmospheric cells over the earth. Source: NASA.
In general, there is rising air over the tropics, leading to low pressure, thunderstorms, and warm dry air moving north in the stratosphere to fall as high pressure at the “Horse Latitudes” over the northern and southern hemisphere deserts. This air then flows towards the equator and is turned toward the west by carioles force from the earth’s rotation, resulting in the trade winds. Tropical thunderstorms act as heat pumps, converting rising, warm, moist air into cool, dry air, allowing the heat to radiate to space at the top of the stratosphere, and the moisture to fall as rain. If there is more heat, there are more thunderstorms to get rid of it, and more moving air.
The falling air at the Horse Latitudes exchanges energy with the Mid-latitude cells, resulting in the mid-latitude westerlies, then, in turn, energy is traded to the Polar cells. This results in low pressure at the 60° north and south latitudes and high pressure at the poles. At the surface in each set of cells, heat is picked up from the surface and moved to the top of the atmosphere. At the top of the atmosphere in each set of cells, more heat is radiated to space. In the south, the mid-latitude cells are mostly over cold water and don’t pick up much heat. In the north, the mid-latitudes cells are more over land and pick up more heat. In the south, the Polar cell is over the high icecap, nearly in the stratosphere, and the polar high has very cold, dense, dry, air. In the north, the Polar cell is over ocean, the surface is at sea level, and the winds are still exchanging heat with the surface.
The result is, that as heat in the tropics increases, even slightly, the upper levels in these cells radiate more heat to space, the highs increase where colder air is falling, and the lows get lower where air is rising. At the South Pole, this results in lower temperatures and stronger winds at the surface. At the North Pole, because the ice is floating on Arctic Ocean, the winds tend to break up the ice, and more open water moderates the temperature. The higher the winds, the more the ice is broken up. The smaller ice area in the summer of 2012 was because a cyclone did an exceptional job breaking up the ice.
At the Antarctic coast, the increased wind and lower temperatures create more ice. The very cold winds blowing down hill off the continent blow the ice away from shore, creating polynyas. As the air is very cold, the open water immediately freezes, and the resulting slush (brash ice) is in turn blown into the downwind sea ice. As long as the wind is blowing, this is a continuous process. These polynyas are visible from space.

Figure 2 is a satellite view of the Antarctic coast and the mid-winter sea ice. The dark spots at the coast are wind-caused polynyas, open water where new sea ice is formed.
The outer edge of the sea ice is not where new ice is formed; it’s the inner edge. The outer edge is where the ice is melting. The outer edge is expanding in area because that part of the Southern Ocean is getting colder.

Figure 3 is the Southern Ocean sea surface temperature for latitudes south of 60°. Source NOAA, here.
If you look at absolute temperature, it is easy to see what is going on.

Figure 4 is the absolute sea surface temperature for the Southern Ocean south of 60°. The graph is from NOAA.
In Figure 4, note that since 2007, the Southern Ocean south of 60° South is now seldom above freezing. Saltwater freezes below -1.8°C, but ice does not melt until the sea surface is above 0°C.
To summarize, the polar winds are blowing harder because the tropics and temperate zones are warming. The southern ice is expanding because the winds are blowing harder and the Southern Ocean is cooling, again, probably because the winds are blowing harder. It is all part of the earth’s thermoregulatory system.

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump loves to set the day’s narrative at dawn, but the deeper story of his White House is best told at night. Aides confer in the dark because they cannot figure out how to operate the light switches in the cabinet room. Visitors conclude their meetings and then wander around, testing doorknobs until finding one that leads to an exit. In a darkened, mostly empty West Wing, Mr. Trump’s provocative chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, finishes another   day planning new lines of attack. Usually around 6:30 p. m. or sometimes later, Mr. Trump retires upstairs to the residence to recharge, vent and intermittently use Twitter. With his wife, Melania, and young son, Barron, staying in New York, he is almost always by himself, sometimes in the protective presence of his imposing longtime aide and former security chief, Keith Schiller. When Mr. Trump is not watching television in his bathrobe or on his phone reaching out to old campaign hands and advisers, he will sometimes set off to explore the unfamiliar surroundings of his new home. During his first two dizzying weeks in office, Mr. Trump, an outsider president working with a surprisingly small crew of no more than a   empowered aides with virtually no familiarity with the workings of the White House or federal government, sent shock waves at home and overseas with a succession of executive orders designed to fulfill campaign promises and taunt foreign leaders. “We are moving big and we are moving fast,” Mr. Bannon said, when asked about the upheaval of the first two weeks. “We didn’t come here to do small things. ” But one thing has become apparent to both his allies and his opponents: When it comes to governing, speed does not always guarantee success. The bungled rollout of his executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, a flurry of other miscues and embarrassments, and an approval rating lower than that of any comparable   president in the history of polling have Mr. Trump and his top staff rethinking an improvisational approach to governing that mirrors his chaotic presidential campaign, administration officials and Trump insiders said. This account of the early days of the Trump White House is based on interviews with dozens of government officials, congressional aides, former staff members and other observers of the new administration, many of whom requested anonymity. At the center of the story, according to these sources, is a president determined to go big but increasingly frustrated by the efforts of his small team to contain the backlash. “What are we going to do about this?” Mr. Trump pointedly asked an aide last week, a period of turmoil briefly interrupted by the successful rollout of his Supreme Court selection, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch. Chris Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and an old friend of the president’s, said: “I think, in his mind, the success of this is going to be the poll numbers. If they continue to be weak or go lower, then somebody’s going to have to bear some responsibility for that. ” “I personally think that they’re missing the big picture here,” Mr. Ruddy said of Mr. Trump’s staff. “Now he’s so caught up, the administration is so caught up in turmoil, perceived chaos, that the Democrats smell blood, the protesters, the media smell blood. ” One former staff member likened the aggressive approach of the first two weeks to   but said the president’s team had stormed the beaches without any plan for a longer war. Clashes among staff are common in the opening days of every administration, but they have seldom been so public and so pronounced this early. “This is a president who came to Washington vowing to shake up the establishment, and this is what it looks like. It’s going to be a little sloppy, there are going to be conflicts,” said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush’s first press secretary. All this is happening as Mr. Trump, a man of flexible ideology but fixed habits, adjusts to a new job, life and city. Cloistered in the White House, he now has little access to his fans and supporters  —   an important source of feedback and validation  —   and feels increasingly pinched by the pressures of the job and the constant presence of protests, one of the reasons he was forced to scrap a planned trip to Milwaukee last week. For a sense of what is happening outside, he watches cable, both at night and during the day  —   too much in the eyes of some aides  —   often offering a bitter    of critics like CNN’s Don Lemon. Until the past few days, Mr. Trump was telling his friends and advisers that he believed the opening stages of his presidency were going well. “Did you hear that, this guy thinks it’s been terrible!” Mr. Trump said mockingly to other aides when one dissenting view was voiced last week during a West Wing meeting. But his opinion has begun to change with a relentless parade of bad headlines. Mr. Trump got away from the White House this weekend for the first time since his inauguration, spending it in Palm Beach, Fla. at his private club,    posting Twitter messages angrily  —   and in personal terms  —   about the federal judge who put a nationwide halt on the travel ban. Mr. Bannon and Reince Priebus, the two clashing power centers, traveled with him. By then, the president, for whom chains of command and policy minutiae rarely meant much, was demanding that Mr. Priebus begin to put in effect a much more conventional White House protocol that had been taken for granted in previous administrations: From now on, Mr. Trump would be looped in on the drafting of executive orders much earlier in the process. Another change will be a new set of checks on the previously unfettered power enjoyed by Mr. Bannon and the White House policy director, Stephen Miller, who oversees the implementation of the orders and who received the brunt of the internal and public criticism for the rollout of the travel ban. Mr. Priebus has told Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon that the administration needs to rethink its policy and communications operation in the wake of embarrassing revelations that key details of the orders were withheld from agencies, White House staff and Republican congressional leaders like Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Priebus has also created a   checklist for the release of any new initiatives that includes signoff from the communications department and the White House staff secretary, Robert Porter, according to several aides familiar with the process. Mr. Priebus bristles at the perception that he occupies a diminished perch in the West Wing pecking order compared with previous chiefs. But for the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president’s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump’s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban. It is partly because he is seen as having a clear vision on policy. But it is also because others who had been expected to fill major roles have been less confident in asserting their power. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    occupies a central role in the administration and has been present at most major decisions and photo ops, but he is a father of young children who has taken to life in Washington, and, along with his wife, Ivanka Trump, has already been spotted at events around town. Mr. Bannon has rushed into the vacuum, telling allies that he and Mr. Miller have a brief window in which to push through their vision of Mr. Trump’s economic nationalism. Mr. Bannon, whose website, Breitbart, was a magnet for white nationalists and xenophobic speech, has also tried to reassure official Washington. He has been careful to build bridges with the Republican establishment, especially Mr. Ryan  —   whom he once described as “the enemy” and vowed to force out. He now talks regularly with Mr. Ryan to coordinate strategy or plot their planned overhaul of the tax code. Before he was ousted in November as transition chief, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, the Trump adviser with the most government experience, helped prepare a detailed staffing and implementation plan in line with the kickoff strategies of previous Republican presidents. It was discarded  —   a senior Trump aide made a show of tossing it into a garbage can  —   for a strategy that prioritized the daily release of dramatic executive orders to put opponents on the defensive. Mr. Christie, who agrees in principle with the broad strokes of Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, says the president has been let down by his staff. “The president deserves better than the rollout he got on the immigration executive order,” Mr. Christie said. “The fact is that he’s put forward a policy that, in my opinion, is significantly more effective than what he had proposed during the campaign, yet because of the botched implementation, they allowed his opponents to attack him by calling it a Muslim ban. ” In the past few days, Mr. Trump’s team has stressed its cohesion and the challenges of   an administration that few outside its group ever thought would exist. “This team spent months in the foxhole together during the campaign,” said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary. “We moved into the White House as a unified team committed to enacting the president’s agenda. ” As part of Mr. Trump’s Oval Office renovation, he ordered that four hardback chairs be placed in a semicircle around his Resolute Desk now heaped, in Trump Tower fashion, with memos and newspapers. They are an emblem of Mr. Trump’s    management style, but also a reminder that in the White House, the seats always outlast the people seated in them. But finding enough skilled players to fill key slots has not been easy: Mr. Spicer is serving double duty as communications director, a key planning position, in addition to engaging in    combat with the news media. Mr. Trump, several aides said, is used to quarterbacking his own media strategy, and did not see the value of hiring an outsider. An early plan was to give the communications job to Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and top TV surrogate, but the demands of the job would have conflicted with Ms. Conway’s other duties as a   adviser to Mr. Trump with Oval Office   privileges, according to one aide. Mr. Trump remains intensely focused on his brand, but the demands of the job mean he spends less time monitoring the news media  —   although he recently upgraded the   TV in his private dining room so he can watch the news while eating lunch. He often has to wait until the end of the workday before grinding through news clips with Mr. Spicer, marking the ones he does not like with a big arrow in black Sharpie  —   though he almost always makes time to monitor Mr. Spicer’s performance at the daily briefings, summoning him to offer praise or criticism, a West Wing aide said. Visitors to the Oval Office say Mr. Trump is obsessed with the décor  —   it is both a totem of a victory that validates him as a serious person and an   backdrop  —   so he has told his staff to schedule as many televised events in the room as possible. To pass the time between meetings, Mr. Trump gives quick tours to visitors, highlighting little tweaks he has made after initially expecting he would have to pay for them himself. Flanking his desk are portraits of Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. He will linger on the opulence of the newly hung golden drapes, which he told a recent visitor were once used by Franklin D. Roosevelt but in fact were patterned for Bill Clinton. For a man who sometimes has trouble concentrating on policy memos, Mr. Trump was delighted to page through a book that offered him 17 window covering options. Ultimately, this is very much the White House that Mr. Trump wanted to build. But while the world reckons with the effect he is having on the presidency, he is adjusting to the effect of the presidency on him. He is now a public employee. And the only boss Mr. Trump ever had in his life was his father, a   developer the president still treats with deep reverence. With most of his belongings in New York, the only family picture on the shelf behind Mr. Trump’s desk is a small    photograph of that boss, Frederick Christ Trump."

The CO2-Handel site is operated by “KlimAktiv® Consulting GmbH“, an “independent consulting company in the field of energy and emissions management“.

According to its website, KlimAktiv is “supported by the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Protection, Construction And Reactor Safety (BMUB) and is an UNFCCC approved NGO and observer of the World climate negotiations.” A number of the KlimaAktiv partners are listed here.
Not surprisingly the CO2 Handel site almost always presented reports promoting alarmism, the virtues of renewable energy, and the evils of fossil fuels.
Norbert Schmid und Stephan Schunkert of CO2 Handel write that the web portal began in 2005 as an “indefatigable fellow campaigner for climate protection” and that they “confidently look ahead, however, to the coming year and a global climate treaty in Paris“.
But the optimism seems to end there. Schmid und Schunkert write that in the early days they had been confident that CO2 emissions trading would play “an important role in national and international climate protection”, but reluctantly admit today: “These developments are taking place very slowly, if at all. Emissions trading in Europe is ailing.”
The end of CO2-Handel may be a sign that hard times are in the pipeline for the financing of global warming activism in Germany.

Since the beginning of the Great Uncertainty – the period that began with the “stimulus,” the auto bailout, the push for another major entitlement program, Dodd-Frank, the regulatory dam burst, the subsidies for favored industries, and the proliferation of distinctly anti-business rhetoric from the White House – President Obama has appeared puzzled by the dearth of business investment and hiring. Go figure.



Nonresidential fixed investment fell off a cliff in 2009, and has yet to recover even in nominal terms. As a share of GDP and relative to the trend in investment growth prior to the 2008 recession, the picture is more troubling still. If tomorrow’s wealth and living standards are functions of today’s investment – and they are – reversing the decline in investment should be the economic priority of U.S. policymakers.   
  
Instead, the administration has been cavalier about the problem and aloof to real solutions, choosing to view investment as a casualty of partisan politics, as though business is intentionally holding back to sully the economy on this president’s watch. Such narcissism has obscured the White House’s capacity to grasp the power of incentives.   
  
It’s not just domestic investment that is lagging. Foreign direct investment in real U.S. assets is also on the decline. The United States is part of a global economy, which means that U.S. and foreign based businesses can invest, hire, develop, produce, assemble and service almost anywhere they choose. And that means the United States is competing with the rest of the world to attract and retain investment. Of course, the implication of this – whether policymakers know it or not and whether they like it or not – is that globalization is serving to discipline bad public policy. Policies that are hostile to wealth creators chase them away, while smart policies attract them and harvest their fruits.   
  
Business investment is ultimately a judgment about a jurisdiction’s institutions, policies, human capital, and prospects. As the world’s largest economy featuring a highly productive work force, world-class research universities, a relatively stable political climate, strong legal institutions, accessible capital markets, and countless other advantages, the United States has been able to attract the investment needed to produce the innovative ideas, revolutionary technologies, and new products and industries that have continued to undergird its position atop the global economic value chain.   
  
The good news is that the $3.5 trillion of foreign direct investment parked in the United States accounted for 17 percent of the world’s direct investment stock in 2011 – more than triple the share of the next largest single-country destination. The troubling news is that in 1999 the United States accounted for 39 percent of the world’s investment stock.   




To some extent, this declining trend reflects inevitable and welcome demographic changes. Strong economic growth in developing countries has followed periods of political stability and economic liberalization, creating new opportunities and inspiring confidence that these formerly higher-risk bets are viable—indeed desirable—places to invest in productive activities. However, some significant decline in the U.S. share is attributable, not to increasing absolute advantages of investing in other countries, but to decreasing absolute advantages of investing in the United States.   
  
A deteriorating U.S. investment climate is making other countries relatively more attractive to foreign and U.S. headquartered companies alike.   
  
U.S. scores on a variety of renowned investment indices and business surveys measuring policy and perceptions of policy, including the OECDs _FDI Restrictiveness Index_ , the _Economic Freedom of the World Index_ , the World Economic Forum’s _Global Competiveness Index_ , and a survey of 10,000 Harvard Business School graduates about their companies’ investment location decisions, all reflect pronounced and growing concern about a U.S. business environment that continues to become less hospitable and, thus, a deterrent to investment. According to these surveys, perceptions about regulations, taxes, customs procedures, and the prevalence of crony capitalism have repelled foreign investment and chased domestic investment to foreign shores.   
  
Although some policymakers recognize the need for reform, others seem to be impervious to the investment-repelling effects of some of the laws and regulations they create. The most naive consider “American” companies to be tethered to the U.S. economy and obligated to invest and hire in the United States, regardless of the quality of the business and policy environments. Browbeating U.S.-based companies for parking profits offshore in response to a U.S. extra-territorial system that would tax those profits twice betrays a failure to grasp that these companies have no obligations to invest, produce, or hire in the United States.   
  
If they are to play a meaningfully positive role where the economy is concerned, policymakers should focus on creating an environment that is more attractive to prospective investors. Unlike ever before, the world’s producers have a wealth of options when it comes to where and how they organize product development, production, assembly, distribution, and other functions on the continuum from product conception to consumption. As businesses look to the most productive combinations of labor and capital, to the most efficient production processes, and to the best ways of getting products and services to market, perceptions about the business environment can be determinative.   
  
A proper accounting of policies that affect the business and investment climates, followed by implementation of reforms to remedy shortcomings, will be necessary if the United States is going to compete effectively for the investment required to fuel economic growth and higher living standards. Some of the problems and possible solutions are described in a forthcoming Cato study titled ""Reversing Worrisome Trends: How to Attract and Retain Investment in a Competitive Global Economy.""

"It’s rather tricky to reproduce if you’re stuck to the floor – unless you’re a coral. Their spectacular spawning events are a beautiful sight to behold. Once a year, they spill billions of sperm and eggs into the sea, peppering the deep blue with a palette of vivid reds, yellows, oranges, and whites. But according to new research, some corals are no longer reproducing with the same clockwork timing, adding yet another survival threat to the long list already befalling reefs. Corals are unlike any other animal on the planet. Thousands of polyps, each resembling an upside down jellyfish, live with each other in beds of limestone attached to the seabed. As they grow, they create the unified limestone skeleton we see as coral from the outside. Many of these coral colonies together create a complex three-dimensional reef structure that in turn creates a home for thousands of other plants and animals. To get around their firm attachment to the seabed, most coral species reproduce by the mass release of sperm and eggs directly into the water at the same time. This annual mass spawning is one of nature’s most iconic events – rising underwater snowstorms so thick that they create brightly coloured slicks on the sea surface, visible from high above. Astonishingly, corals synchronise their reproduction despite not having a brain, nor any direct way of communicating between colonies. Sperm and eggs can only survive in the water for a few hours, so in the vast ocean space this synchrony is essential for a good chance of fertilisation. Until recently, little more than this was known about the intricacies of coral reproduction. But in the context of rapid coral decline, researchers have started applying genetic and reproductive research techniques to understand how environmental conditions are impacting coral fertilisation.

      Explainer: mass coral spawning, a wonder of the natural world


 The new research monitored mass spawnings on corals reefs in the northern Red Sea. The researchers compared spawning timings of five coral species between 2015 and 2018 to results from two other studies conducted on the same species in the 1980s. In the species Acropora eurystoma, they also measured various reproductive traits, such as the number of sperm and eggs within a colony, the number of colonies reproducing in a given area and the size of coral colonies in the area – an index of their age. In the 1980s, all the coral species monitored had one or two well-defined periods of spawning, where eggs and sperm were released within a few days of each other. But by the 2010s, some species released them over as many as a couple of months. With a lower concentration of eggs and sperm in the water at any one time, fertilisation becomes much rarer. Although visually the coral reefs appeared in overall good health, the researchers found that the corals that weren’t spawning at the same time had no baby corals. This means that affected species can appear to be abundant, but in reality be nearing extinction through reproductive failure. This is the first study to compare current spawning behaviour with historical data, providing evidence of increased desynchrony over time. Of course, there are many, many more coral species than the five measured in the current study, so we must be cautious of drawing general conclusions at this stage. However, evidence (without historical data for comparison) suggests that the same may be happening in other parts of the world too. Unfortunately, it’s not yet known exactly what is causing the apparent decline in spawning synchrony, making it difficult to put forward a solution to the problem. Increases in light pollution from coastal development and hormone pollution from contraceptive pills have recently been shown to disrupt the natural triggers for coral spawning. The same is true of water temperature, which has increased by 1.2℃ at the test site since the 1980s. However, further research is needed to establish whether these factors are causing corals to reproduce out of sync with each other. While these new advances in the understanding of coral reproductive biology are worrying, they also present opportunities. If we can identify why some corals are reproducing well and others not, we may be able to innovate new conservation methods that protect corals before they show signs of dying off. Using selective breeding techniques, for example, we may be able to imbue corals with greater resilience to the factors causing spawning desynchrony.

      Heat-tolerant corals can create nurseries that are resistant to bleaching


 In the meantime though, all we can do to keep the glimmer of hope alive for reefs is redouble international efforts to tackle climate breakdown, and manage coastal areas responsibly. Without such intervention, these ecosystems rich in economic, ecological and cultural value will soon succumb to the multiple threats it faces."

What Stuff is doing is classic gas lighting. **Implying that people are mentally ill for disagreeing** with them. Unpleasant narcissistic behaviour. They are a disgrace as a Newspaper.



After reading SonovaMin and [Phil View’s ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/general-debate-76/#comment-4645065758)comments yesterday in General debate I just had to check out the offending _Stuff_ article for myself. **Just how bad was it?**



I was amused to see Stuff’s choice of photo to depict us **“Climate deniers.”** Apparently questioning man-made climate change means that we are ignoring the scientific consensus. (You know, the one that doesn’t actually exist – but I digress).



People are more likely t **o deny climate change** if they’re inclined toward hierarchy, have lower levels of education or are more religious. But the strongest predictor of denial is a person’s politics. 



In this opening salvo, they are attacking a straw man. So-called “Climate deniers” **do not deny that the climate changes.** They believe that Climate change is a completely normal and natural phenomenon. What they question is mankind’s ability to influence or change it in any meaningful way.



So the premise of their argument is completely meaningless even before they insult us by claiming that we do as we are told (hierarchy), are stupid and believe in a sky fairy.



**Why do people still think climate change isn’t real?**



At its heart, climate change denial is **a conflict between facts and values.** People deny the climate crisis because, to them, it just feels wrong.



[…] It could be that the idea of climate change is **a threat to**[ **our worldview**](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40984603) **.** Or it could be that we fear society’s response to climate change, the disruption created by the [transition to a low-emissions economy](https://www.bwb.co.nz/books/careful-revolution). Either way, climate change becomes such an “[inconvenient truth](https://grist.org/feature/an-inconvenient-truth-oral-history)” that, instead of living with and acting upon our worries, **we suppress the truth instead.**[ **** ](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news)



The writer is actually describing their own belief system not ours. _Stuff_ has publicly stated that they refuse to publish any facts that do not match **their world view** and values. They believe that only facts that support their values/belief system should be allowed airtime. **All other facts are to be suppressed** because it **feels wrong** to publish facts that don’t fit their values. They are the ones with the closed mind and the religious fervour for pushing only one point of view. 



The writer then goes on quite disgracefully to suggest that “Climate Deniers” are mentally ill as they are “negating reality.”



[…] In Western societies, political affiliation is the key factor, with conservative voters more likely to discount climate change. Globally, a person’s commitment to [**democratic values**](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2018.1512261) **** – or not in the case of deniers – is more significant. 



My goodness, the cognitive dissonance of this writer is huge! Which political affiliation believes in man-made climate change regardless of evidence to the contrary? That’s right, the belief in man-made climate change is left-wing doctrine. Conservatives are the ones that believe in freedom of speech for all and allowing all viewpoints to be heard and debated. **Conservatives therefore, are the ones most committed to democratic values.** They don’t want other viewpoints suppressed, they want them heard.



The article ends with the unproven claim that climate deniers are in the minority, as if that proves that they are wrong. The majority used to believe that the earth was flat but their believing that did not make it so. The **natural climate change deniers** should consider that for one minute – before they point the finger at those of us who see things differently to them.

Many WUWT readers have seen the famous bit of propaganda produced by John Cook at the antithetically named “Skeptical Science” website, where he creates a series of steps along the graph of global temperatures suggesting that every time climate skeptics see a “pause” they claim global cooling. Of course, that’s nonsense, but for Cook, it has propaganda value much like his 97% consensus meme which is now falling apart.
The problem with The Escalator from “Skeptical Science”, is that it doesn’t show the alarmist favored view of temperature rise, for example, these IPCC projections from the Third Assessment Report that rocket skyward.

Here at WUWT, we are happy to help with a new, more humorous visualization of “The Escalator”, which I call “The Rocket”.

Note: Some readers in comments apparently are just too serious, and miss the humor and satire tags along with the headline. Just laugh, it’s funny. When we get claims like “the oceans will boil” and temperature rises of 6C by the end of the century all you can do is make fun of it.

One of the coolest things to come out of the United Nations climate thingy was a new free trade deal between five small nations. Our media reported the following last week:



New Zealand will lead a five-way trade talks with Norway, Iceland, Costa Rica and Fiji to try to use trade to combat climate change by slashing fossil-fuel subsidies and abolishing tariffs on environmental goods. 



The whole thing is a bit funny as these nations [combined make up 0.31%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions) of the global greenhouse gas emissions. There’s something about the rankings amongst those five nations that made me raise my eyebrows.



We output 0.17% of global greenhouse gases, but Norway only outputs 0.10%. That’s a bit odd. We have a bunch of farting cows and the[ Norwegians produce 2% of the world’s oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production), to the tune of [over $40 billion](https://www.norskpetroleum.no/en/economy/governments-revenues/) in annual profits. They’re 15th in total production and 4th per capita.



All of that money goes into a sovereign wealth fund which pays out superannuation for Norway—and it’s [the wealthiest pension fund in the world](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/09/22/norways-sovereign-wealth-fund-hits-1-trillion-infographic/#7049bd9983c9) valued at over one trillion dollars.



With such a fat stack of petrodollars in the bank, **how do they have a lower carbon footprint than ours?**



Here’s the kicker: exporting oil doesn’t count towards your nation’s CO2 polluto-meter, so you can drill and sell as much of it as you like while staying clean and green.



Let’s kill two birds with one stone.



First, ramp up our production of oil, natural gas, and coal to the max.



Second, put all the money into our own sovereign wealth fund that will provide generations of New Zealanders with pensions—all without costing taxpayers a cent.



All that talk about raising the age of retirement is small thinking. The current system enslaves the current generation of workers to pay for the superannuation of the past. A system based on savings is urgently needed, and we have enough buried in the ground to make it happen.



While we’re at it, there’s one other great thing about Norway we could import during these trade talks: whale meat. Yum.

The world is aflame. Religious minorities are among those who suffer most from increasing conflict. Pakistan is one of the worst homes for non‐​Muslims. The U.S. government should designate that nation as a “Country of Particular Concern” for failing to protect religious liberty, the most basic right of conscience.



Religious persecution is a global scourge. Many of the worst oppressors are Muslim nations. Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Bahrain, Iraq, and Egypt are all important international actors. All also mistreat, or acquiesce in the mistreatment of, anyone not a Muslim. Some of them even victimize Muslims—of the wrong variety. (In Syria it is opponents of the government which do most of the persecuting.)



Islamabad is another frequent offender. The most recent State Department report on religious liberty in Pakistan noted that “The constitution and other laws and policies officially restrict religious freedom and, in practice, the government enforced many of these restrictions. The government’s respect for and protection of the right to religious freedom continued to be poor.”



Minority faiths face violent attack. Believers are killed, churches are bombed, buses are attacked, homes are destroyed, social gatherings are targeted. Warned the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in its recent report: “In the past year, conditions hit an all‐​time low due to chronic sectarian violence targeting mostly Shia Muslims but also Christians, Ahmadis, and Hindus.” Last year the Commission cited a spike in violence against Shiites as well as “numerous attacks against innocent Pakistanis” of other religions.





A state which fails to protect the right of individuals to respond to their belief (or unbelief) in God is more likely to leave other essential liberties unprotected.



Although Islamabad did not launch these assaults, it did little to prevent or redress them. Even when scores or more are killed at a time there often is no effective response. Explained State: “The government’s limited capacity and will to investigate or prosecute the perpetrators of increasing extremist attacks against religious minorities and on members of the Muslim majority promoting tolerance, allowed the climate of impunity to continue.” Indeed, top government officials have been gunned down for defending freedom of conscience.



The most common tool of persecution may be a charge of blasphemy. Said USCIRF: “The country’s blasphemy laws, used predominantly in Punjab province, but also nationwide, target members of religious minority communities and dissenting Muslims and frequently result in imprisonment.” Two years ago a mentally handicapped 12‐​year‐​old Christian girl was charged; after an international outcry even the authorities became embarrassed and the case was dismissed, an unusual outcome.



The blasphemy laws are made for abuse. Explained the Commission, “The so‐​called crime carries the death penalty or life in prison, does not require proof of intent or evidence to be presented after allegations are made, and does not include penalties for false allegations.” In fact, courts hesitate to even hear evidence, lest doing so also be considered another act of blasphemy. With evidence unnecessary, the charge has become a weapon routinely used in personal and business disputes, including a means to exact revenge for imagined offenses.



Between 1986 and 2006 695 people were charged with blasphemy. Today 16 people are on death row and another 20 are serving life sentences. Three Christians have been sentenced to death in the last few months. Many other Pakistanis are in prison waiting for trial, including English professor Junaid Hafeez, accused of blaspheming the Prophet Mohammed. Penalties are not limited to the law. Explained the group Freedom House: “Regardless of the motives behind their charges and the outcome of their cases, those accused of blasphemy are subject to job discrimination, ostracism from their communities and neighborhoods, and even physical violence and murder at the hands of angry mobs, forcing many to live in fear.” Since 1990 at least 52 people charged with blasphemy have been killed before reaching trial.



Judges who acquitted defendants and politicians who talked of reforming the blasphemy laws also have been assassinated. In May gunmen killed Rashid Rehman, a human rights lawyer who was defending Hafeez. Previously _fellow attorneys_ threatened Rehman, “You will not come to court next time because you will not exist any more.” A pamphlet circulated after the murder asserting that Rehman met his “rightful end.” He was the first defense lawyer killed. He probably won’t be the last.



Pakistan has jailed more people for blasphemy than any other nation, but it is not the only country which punishes religious free speech. An incredible 14 of 20 countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa criminalize blasphemy. Nine of 50 in the Asia Pacific, seven of 45 in Europe and three of 48 in SubSaharan Africa also do so. Eleven of 35 nations in the Americas have blasphemy laws. In the U.S. several states, including Massachusetts and Michigan, retain blasphemy laws, though they do not enforce them.



The group Freedom House published a detailed report on the detrimental impact of blasphemy laws on human rights. Put simply, these measures “impose undue restrictions on freedom of expression” and are “prone to arbitrary or overly broad application, particularly in settings where there are no checks and balances in place to prevent abuses.” Freedom House highlighted Algeria, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Poland, as well as Pakistan.



In March the Commission made much the same point, issuing a special report entitled “Prisoners of Belief: Individuals Jailed Under Blasphemy Laws.” Victims include three atheist bloggers in Bangladesh, numerous Iranian Bahai’s, Christians, and Sufi and Sunni Muslims, 63 Sunnis and Christians in Egypt, an atheist writer in Kazakhstan, scores of Indonesians, and a Saudi blogger. Even Greece and Turkey have charged people with blasphemy.



The Arab Spring was supposed to bring liberty to the Mideast, but it had the opposite effect in some countries. For instance, in Kuwait, perhaps the most liberal Gulf State, the Islamist‐​dominated Assembly elected in early 2012 voted to impose the death penalty on Muslims convicted of blasphemy. The Emir blocked the law and later changed the election rules, resulting in election of a more moderate legislature.



Blasphemy prosecutions have been initiated in post‐​revolution Egypt and even Tunisia, viewed as the most successful participant in the Arab Spring. USCIRF commissioners Zuhdi Jasser and Katrina Lantos Swett wrote: “Rather than giving rise to greater individual liberty, this trend could turn the Arab Spring into a repressive winter, with forces of intolerance and tyranny dashing hopes for genuine freedom and liberal democracy.”



Nevertheless, Pakistan remains a particular problem. The country’s founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, emphasized the importance of religious liberty. But Pakistan became more Islamic over time, a process accelerated by dictator Mohammed Zia ul‐​Haq. His government not only criminalized blasphemy, but, noted Freedom House, enacted new laws which imposed “harsh Shari’a punishments for extramarital sex, theft, and violations of the prohibition of alcohol.”



The impact of such laws fell most heavily on religious minorities and liberals. Discrimination, intolerance, and violence have become pervasive. Noted Freedom House: “it is clear that Pakistan’s blasphemy laws are used politically and applied disproportionately to non‐​Muslims. Although many other countries have laws against blasphemy, the situation in Pakistan is unique in its severity and its particular effects on religious minorities.” Intolerance has become the norm.



Unfortunately, there are spillover impacts from abusive blasphemy prosecutions. Blasphemy laws are bad in Western nations. They are far worse in the Muslim world. The problem is particularly severe in Pakistan. Warned Freedom House: “Pakistan’s blasphemy laws foster an environment of intolerance and impunity, and lead to violations of a broad range of human rights, including the obvious rights to freedom of expression and freedom of religion, as well as freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention; the right to due process and a fair trial; freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; and the right to life and security of the person.”



Obviously, there is little the U.S. can do directly about policy in Pakistan. However, the International Religious Freedom Act empowers the State Department to designate countries as Countries of Particular Concern. Noted USCIRF: “Pakistan represents the worst situation in the world for religious freedom for countries not currently designated” as CPCs. State should remedy that lapse.



For some, religious liberty is but an afterthought, an esoteric principle with little practical impact. However, the willingness of foreign governments to respect freedom of conscience acts as the famed canary in the mine. A state which fails to protect the right of individuals to respond to their belief (or unbelief) in God is more likely to leave other essential liberties unprotected. And a society in which the life and dignity of the human person is not respected is more likely to become a hothouse for violent ideas, beliefs, and actions.



As we see in Pakistan today. Rising religious extremism, exemplified by abusive blasphemy prosecutions, threatens the integrity of the Pakistani state—and the security of its nuclear weapons. Although outsiders cannot reform policy in Pakistan, they can highlight a problem that endangers people not only in that nation but ultimately in many others around the world, including America.

Paradox (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
Theories that can be easily tested should have a high degree of consensus among researchers. Those involving chaotic and less testable questions – climate change or economic growth, physiology or financial markets – ought to have a greater level of scientific disagreement. Yet this is hardly the case for climate science. In the Paradox of Consensus, we illustrate that the greater the level of consensus for certain classes of hypotheses (those that are difficult to test) the less truth we should assign to them.
Guest Essay By D. RYAN BRUMBERG and MATTHEW BRUMBERG
The moon is not made of cheese, the earth is not flat, and lightning may strike the same place twice. We believe these claims to be true, yet it is unlikely that most readers have personally confirmed each of them. Because it would be nigh impossible for anyone to verify all they take as true, most individuals arrive at their worldview by following the beliefs of others (often “experts”). While there can be good reason to accept an idea based on its popularity, this consensus heuristic must be used with care. There must be a sufficient number of others who did arrive (and continue to arrive) at the same conclusion through independent verification and testing. When this condition is not met, the results can be catastrophic (recall the Challenger disaster). Instead of independent observers arriving at the same conclusion, we risk an information cascade. This failing goes by many names—argumentum ad populum, groupthink, the “bandwagon effect”—but its function is the same: increasing numbers of people will buy into an idea simply because many others already believe it.  
Consensus, in and of itself, is not necessarily a bad thing. The more easily testable and verifiable a theory, the less debate we would expect. There is little disagreement, for example, about the sum of one plus one or the average distance of the earth from the sun. But as a question becomes more complex and less testable, we would expect an increasing level of disagreement and a lessening of the consensus—think: the existence of god, the best band since the Beatles, or the grand unified theory of physics. On such topics, independent minds can—and should—differ.
We can use a simple formula to express how an idea’s popularity correlates with its verifiability. Let us introduce the K/C ratio—the ratio of “knowability,” a broad term loosely encapsulating how possible it is to reduce uncertainty about an idea’s correctness, to “consensus,” a measure of the idea’s popularity and general acceptance. Topics that are easily knowable (K ~ 1) should have a high degree of consensus (C ~ 1), whereas those that are impossible to verify (K ~ 0) should have a low degree of consensus (C ~ 0). When the ratio deviates too far from the perfect ratio of 1, either from too much consensus or too little, there is a mispricing of knowledge. Indeed, in cases of extreme deviations from the perfect ratio, additional support for a concept with such a lopsided K/C ratio increasingly subtracts from its potential veracity. This occurs because ideas exist not simply at a single temporal point, but rather evolve over the sweep of time. At the upper reaches of consensus, there is less updating of views to account for new information—so much so that supporters of the status quo tend to suppress new facts and hypothesis. Government agencies deny funding to ‘sham’ scientists, tenure boards dissuade young researchers from pursuing ‘the wrong’ track, and the establishment quashes heretical ideas.

Consider the belief that the sun, moon, and stars circle the earth—a reasonable initial proposition. Yet, as additional facts became available (Copernicus, Brahe, Galileo), the dogmatic believers of the consensus condemned these observations as heresy. A world with a less skewed K/C ratio (lower level of consensus given low knowability) would have advanced to the heliocentric model sooner. Given that we know not the evolutionary stage for any current theory, we arrive thus at the unexpected conclusion that when knowability is low, as the level of consensus increases (without a commensurate increase in knowability), there should be a decrease in the probability assigned to the truth of the matter. While not always clear why the K/C ratio can become highly skewed, one interpretation is that more than just the search for knowledge is at play.
To see how this works in practice, we turn to the evergreen topic of climate change. Notwithstanding the underlying ecological threat of climate change itself, the debate about how to confront human-caused global warming has spawned unprecedented financial, political, and social risks of its own. Entire industries face extinction as the world’s governments seek to impose trillions of dollars of taxes on carbon emissions. The New York Times’s Thomas Friedman approvingly writes that Australian politicians—not to mention public figures through the world—now risk “political suicide” if they deny climate change. But if carbon dioxide turns out not to be the boogey-man that climate scientists have made it out to be, tens of trillions will be wasted in unneeded remediation. Much of the world—billions of humans—will endure a severely diminished quality of life with nothing to show for it. The growth trajectory of the world in the twenty-first century may well depend more on the “truth” of climate change ex ante than ex post.
With climate change, as in many areas of scientific complexity, we can (and do) use models to understand the world. But models have their problems. This is particularly true when dealing with complex, non-linear systems with a multitude of recursive feedback loops, in which small variations produce massive shifts in the long-term outcome. Pioneered by the mathematicians Edward Lorenz and Benoit Mandelbrot, chaos theory helped explain the intractability of certain problems. Readers of pop science will be familiar with the term the “butterfly effect,” in which “the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set[s] off a tornado in Texas.” The earth’s climate is one such dynamic, chaotic system and it is within the whirling, turbulent vortex of unpredictability that the modern climate scientists must tread.
And boldly have they stepped into the breach. The scope of agreement achieved by the world’s climate scientists is breathtaking. To first approximation, around 97% agree that human activity, particularly carbon dioxide emissions, causes global warming. So impressed was the Norwegian Nobel Committee by the work of the Inter-governmental Committee on Climate Change and Al Gore “for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change” that it awarded them the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. So many great minds cannot possibly be wrong, right?
Yet something nags us about this self-congratulatory consensus. Our intuition is that this narrow distribution of opinions yields a knowability to consensus ratio far removed from the perfect ratio of 1. To reach their conclusions, climate scientists have to (a) uncover the (historical) drivers of climate, (b) project the future path of these inputs and others that may arise, and (c) predict how recursive feedback loops interact over multi-decadal time horizons, all without being able to test their hypotheses against reality. When evaluating the causes of past climate shifts, for example, scientists cannot simply re-run history to test the impact of changing different variables. Similarly, although climate scientists can make testable hypotheses about the future, their short-term predictions have an embarrassing record (think post-Katrina predictions of a massive surge in US hurricanes or the failed attempts to forecast temperature changes for the 2000s), while the debate will be moot by the time we can test their long-term forecasts in the year 2100.
We would, therefore, expect this limit on empirical verifiability to birth widely divergent views on the path, causes, and consequences of earth’s future climate. In other arenas, only after a theory has been empirically verified has the scientific community coalesced around it. Even then, scientists continue to subject such theories to rigorous testing and debate. For example, consider the current state of theoretical physics: quantum physics, loop quantum gravity, string theory, super-symmetry, and M-theory, among others, all vie for acceptance. Albert Einstein’s general relativity itself did not begin to garner widespread support until four years after its publication, when Arthur Eddington verified its predictions during a 1919 solar eclipse. Even so, as illustrated by the rash of headlines in late 2011 announcing the (false) discovery of faster-than-light neutrinos, scientists continue to try to poke holes in Einstein’s theory.
Yet the expectation of a rich debate among scientists about climate change does not reconcile easily with the widely endorsed shibboleth that human activity will warm the globe dramatically and dangerously over the next one hundred years. As climate scientists are themselves fond of repeating, the vast majority have arrived at the exact same conclusions about both past warming and future trends. Any discussion that doubts the fundamental premises of climate change is dismissed by the mainstream media and climate scientists as pseudo-science conducted by quacks or ideologues. Thus, questions about observational biases in the location of temperature stations, changes in the earth’s albedo, the cooling effect of dust particles, shifting ocean cycles, fluctuating solar activity, correlation v. causation of historical warm periods and carbon dioxide, catastrophic model failure caused by chaotic interactions, and innumerable other theories—most of which are presumably wrong—are never properly mooted in the public debate.
In our view, the fact that so many scientists agree so closely about the earth’s warming is, itself, evidence of a lack of evidence for global warming. Does this mean that climate change is not happening? Not necessarily. But it does mean that we should be wary of the meretricious arguments mustered in its defense. When evaluating complex questions—from climate change to economic growth, physiology to financial markets—it is worse than naïve to judge the veracity of an idea merely from the strength of consensus. The condemnation of Galileo Galilei meant one man served a sentence of life imprisonment. His ecumenical accusers at least acknowledged a force greater than science drove their decision. The modern priests of climate change endanger the lives of billions as they wield their fallacy that consensus is truth.

"**""It was a massive step - it was scary. I thought the little one could be taken away from me.""**
When Beth sought help to flee her abusive partner before the first lockdown in March, she and her daughter were placed in a women's refuge.
But she fears women in that situation today might not get that as domestic abuse services warn a lack of capacity will lead to more people dying.
The Welsh Government said Â£1.3m had been spent to help accommodate victims.
Domestic violence services say they have struggled to cope with a surge in referrals since schools reopened in September, with many cases previously going unreported.
Charities NSPCC Cymru and Welsh Women's Aid say support services for children in Wales were already ""sparse"" and ""underfunded"", with people relying on a ""postcode lottery"".
""He was accusing me of sleeping with other people while I was working,"" said Beth, which is not her real name and is being used to protect her identity.
""He would say I wasn't a fit enough mother to look after his daughter. It was then becoming physical.
""He began to push me, shove me, kick me out of the bed. One day I had a bottle of Coke poured over my head because I was accused of not calling him when his food was ready.
""It was having an impact on the little one, she was hearing and seeing things.""
Beth, from south Wales, managed to flee and spent the next eight months living in a women's refuge with her 11-year-old daughter, who has complex needs.
Beth said she finally decided to call for help after her mother threatened to ring social services - but she had to wait for her partner to leave for work and her daughter to go to school.
She said making that initial phone call was the most difficult step.
""It's the not knowing where you're going to go after that phone call, who's at the end of the phone and who's going to help you,"" she explained.
Beth said social services managed to find her a refuge before she went to pick her daughter up from school that day.
""[My daughter] was all questions about why I hadn't brought my own car to pick her up,"" she recalled.
""I explained that we weren't going home and I remember her saying to me: 'We'll be ok now and we'll be safe, because daddy can't shout and do anything now can he?'""
A domestic abuse service in Powys says it has had to put a waiting list in place after a ""huge surge"" in cases, and feared the worst for those they could not support.
""We're really struggling with referrals and for the first time in my career, we've had to introduce a waiting list,"" said Kate Annison, who runs the children's service at Montgomeryshire Family Crisis Centre in Newtown.
She said referrals had more than doubled between August and October compared to last year, adding that children's support services often reveal more about the scale of the abuse taking place.
""The children are disclosing a lot of things that were happening over the previous lockdown or are still happening. There's been a huge surge in cases,"" Ms Annison said.
""We've had to put six people on the waiting list for support so far - that's four families.
""Making people wait even a short amount of time could mean that they get hurt really badly. These decisions we're making could ultimately result in a death.""
She said her team were already aware of a case where a family member died after being told there was not enough space in any refuges.
""We know they tried a few different services in a few different areas but failed to find any space,"" she said.
""Unfortunately, they then pulled out of trying to find somewhere and there was a fatality in that family.
""That victim was asking for support at the time they were able to, potentially when the perpetrator was not around.
""If we'd have had the capacity as a nation to put them into refuge then they would be safe now. Unfortunately, due to the lack of capacity, there is somebody who's died and young people are in care.""
Both NSPCC Cymru and Welsh Women's Aid said many services were underfunded and relied on charitable donations and grants to get by.
""What the pandemic has done has just exacerbated something that was struggling already,"" said Angelina Rodriques, of the Atal Y Fro refuge and support service in the Vale of Glamorgan.
""If a service hasn't got the finances or the resources, then all you're doing is holding women and children on waiting lists.
""Referrals are coming in every day and you can't keep up. We're doing the best that we can in this situation, but we're missing loads of people around the Vale of Glamorgan.
""It will result in people losing their lives, because they can't get the support at that time.""
Despite now feeling safe, Beth said she feared the long-term impact of the pandemic on victims of domestic abuse.
""I think it will be 100 times more difficult to reach out to those services now,"" she explained.
""If I was in the same position in March or April then I don't think I would have got out, I think I would still be there.
""You need to get out of there before that predator even knows anything about what's going on - you need to get out that door.""
A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""We recognise the extreme pressures facing women fleeing domestic abuse with children.
""This year we have invested over Â£1.3m for disbursed community accommodation for those for whom refuge might not be the right answer.""
She added it had provided local authorities with Â£50m for housing support, including for those fleeing domestic abuse, as well as other grants, guidance and training.

“Y’know you’re soaking in it; global warming that is”



 _“But Madge, it’s water. Global warming is carbon, or something.”_



“Carbon dioxide? No; it’s not. It’s dihydrogen monoxide. That’s just a fancy way of saying water. Water is responsible for the greenhouse effect on our little planet, anywhere from seventy to ninety five percent of all our wonderful warming is due to water, otherwise the planet would be unliveable, and we’d freeze to death. Water vapour actually; it’s a gas and makes up to four percent of our atmosphere; all the other warming gases, carbon dioxide, methane, and fluorocarbons, all of them combined only make up one-tenth of one percent.”



 _“Well, then why is everybody belting on about carbon?”_



“Beats me, I guess it would be completely stupid if ninety-seven percent of scientists droned on about reducing water emissions. They’d sound a right bunch of drongoes. Almost all water vapour is naturally produced by evaporation. Humans only contribute an extremely tiny amount: just a wee bit from irrigation, y’know like watering the lawn, and another bit from all our industrial activity and burning fossil fuels and what-not, but that bit’s even tinier than the irrigation bit. In total we make an awfully small impact on the amount of water vapour around us, less than one-hundredth of it.”



 _“But water evaporation makes clouds eventually, that’s what we learned at school, and somebody said they’re not much fun, they block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone.”_



“They do block the sun, they have high albedo”…



 _“Like my Murray?”_



“Not exactly; albedo is the ability to reflect solar radiation back to space, reducing the energy available to warm us here on Earth.”



 _“I get it – if the world warms up more evaporation happens, more clouds are formed and they cool us down again, like setting a thermostat. Madge, that’s so simple I don’t believe your water story. If it’s true then why aren’t scientists saying so?”_



“They are, even the IPCC says ‘ **Water vapour is the most abundant and important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere**. **However, human activities have only a small direct influence on the amount of atmospheric water vapour**.’ That’s straight from a chapter called The Physical Science Basis.”



 _“But what do they say about clouds?”_



“They fudge it; they say they don’t know”



 _“You’re joking. Madge, you’re pulling my leg, stop it!”_



“Nope. True story. Of course they don’t come right out and say y’know ‘we haven’t got a bloody clue’, they say it in their jargon – here, look at this:



“The modelling of cloud processes and feedbacks provides a striking example of the irregular pace of progress in climate science. Representation of clouds may constitute the area in which atmospheric models have been modified most continuously to take into account increasingly complex physical processes.”



 _“Well, blow me down with a feather, that does sound like a fancy way of them pretending they haven’t got a bloody clue_.



“ _Cough, ‘irregular pace’…too ‘complex’, it’s not complex, it’s so simple even I can understand it; more water, more clouds, more cooling, and if the models are so correct then why the hell do they have to keep continuously modifying them? They told us the science was settled! Cripes, my kids went on school-strike for that load of rubbish? I’m grumpy now.”_



“Don’t get grumpy, get even. Just ask the kids to tell you, since they’re so clued-up, what the most powerful and abundant greenhouse gas is, and tell them every time they get the answer wrong you’re confiscating their phones for an hour, that’ll smarten them up real quick, and calm them down a bit.”



 _“Madge, you’re a genius.”_



“I know.”

Yesterday Jim Hansen, now with Columbia University, and several of his colleagues released their summary of 2017 global temperatures. Their history, published by the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has constantly been evolving in ways that make the early years colder and the later years hot. I recently posted on how this can happen, and the differences between these modified datasets and those determined objectively (i.e. without human meddling).   
  
  
For a couple years I have been pointing out (along with Judith Curry and others) that the latest fad—which puts a _lot_ of warming in recent data—is to extend high‐​latitude land weather station data far out over the Arctic Ocean. Hansen’s crew takes stations north of 64⁰ latitude and extends them an astounding 1200 kilometers into the ocean.   
  
  
This, plainly speaking, is a violation of one of the most fundamental principles of thermodynamics, which is that when matter is changing its state (from, say, solid to liquid), a stirred fluid will remain at “freezing” until it is all liquid, whereupon warming will commence.   
  
  
This also applies in the Arctic, where the fluid is often stirred by strong winds. So if, say, Resolute, one of the northernmost land stations, is 50⁰F, and the Arctic is mixed water‐​ice (it always is), that 50 degrees will be extended out 1200 kilometers where the air‐​sea boundary temperature has to be around 30⁰F, the freezing point of seawater up there.   
  
  
Hansen et al. did pay some attention to this, noting this extension, which they normally apply to their data, was responsible for making 2017 the second‐​warmest year in their record. If they “only” extended 250km (still dicey), it would drop their “global” temperatures by a tenth of a degree, which would send the year down a rank. The result of all of this is that the big “spike” at the end of their record is in no small part due to the 1200km extension that turns thermodynamics on its head.   
  
  
There’s another interesting pronouncement in the NASA announcement; many people have noted that the sun is a bit cool in recent years, and that it continues to trend slightly downward. The changes in its radiance are probably good for a tenth of a degree (C) of surface temperature or so. Hansen et al. use this to provide covering fire should warming stall out yet again:   




Therefore, because of the combination of the strong 2016 El Niño and the phase of the solar cycle, it is plausible, if not likely, that the next 10 years of global temperature change will leave an impression of a ‘global warming hiatus’.



The significance of this will all fall out in the next year or so. If temperatures head back down all the way to their pre‐​El Niño levels, that will ultimately bring back the post‐​1996 “pause.” We’re going to guess they are going to remain a couple of tenths of a degree above that, based on what happened after the big one in 1998, where they settled a small amount above the pre‐​El Niño of the earlier 1990s.   
  
  
If the recent warming rate (adjusting for El Niño) continues, we’ll hear that it is doing so “despite” the sun. Given that one year (2018) can have little influence on a recent trendline, that copy may already have been written!   
  
  
All of this begs the question: Hansen notes in his release that the warming rate since 1970 has been fairly constant, about 0.17⁰C per decade, and didn’t note that the average of the UN’s climate models say it should be about twice that now. More lukewarming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust a couple of anecdotes today to illustrate how wacky the climate-change religion is getting.
First is a short blurb appearing at the online Linux Magazine bearing the title: “Mobile phones are climate killers“. This is for real.
Using your mobile phone and sending text messages apparently is contributing to bad weather and the death of the climate. Linux magazine writes:
The greenhouse gases coming from the recharging of mobile phone and tablets – this year already will be 6.4 megatonnes, about half of what is projected for 2019, – is equivalent to the emissions of about 1.1 million cars.”
Linux Magazine cites a study conducted by Juniper Research.
The other sign showing the climate trend is getting increasingly kooky that caught my eye today is a photo posted by Rudolf Kipp at Facebook.

Would you like your wine dry, sweet…or green?
I’m sure glad I drink Scotch instead. And when it comes to wine, I never liked Dornfelder anyhow.
And seeing how masses of people are stupid and gullible enough to accept all the nonsense hook, line and sinker, a little Scotch now and then certainly helps.
And a final word to all the distillers of Scotch out there. I warn you: If I hear or see any of this bio/sustainable madness with regards to the production of your products, then I’ll never buy another bottle from you again. I hope especially you Islay distillers take note.

In yet another climate change ‘save the planet’ rant, our dear friends at _Stuff_ and Nonsense have published an article about climate change Fake News in which, without a hint of irony, they publish fake news.



It begins:



A quick Google search often reveals that, yes, someone out there, somewhere, agrees with what we think, no matter how left-field our views.



So it proves with climate change.



One word change fixes that: “A quick Google search often reveals that, yes, someone out there, somewhere, agrees with what we think, no matter how left- ** _wing_** our views. So it proves with climate change.”



Then the fake news starts:



Despite the overwhelming scientific consensus – NASA **states 97 per cent of publishing scientists say humans are causing climate change** – some refuse to be shifted from their position of dissent. 



Way back in 2014 a [50 page paper](https://friendsofscience.org/assets/documents/97_Consensus_Myth.pdf) thoroughly debunked the “97%” myth. The _Stuff_ editors have had five years to read through these 50 pages, less than a page per month, and yet they persist in publishing fake news.



Here is a quick take-out summary from that paper:



 _Stuff_ goes on to criticise a regional council candidate for having a contrary position. Apparently he sent a video around which claimed that the World Meteorological Organisation secretary-general Petteri Taalas denied man-made climate change when he does not. I have not watched said video so cannot comment.



However, have _Stuff_ ever reported what Taalas did say?



 **The atmosphere created by media has been provoking anxiety**. The latest idea is that children are a negative thing. I am worried for young mothers, who are already under much pressure. This will only add to their burden. […]



While climate sceptisism has become less of an issue, now we are being challenged from the other side. Climate experts have been attacked by these people and they claim that we should be much more radical. They are doomsters and extremists; they make threats. Much more radical action is demanded by Extinction Rebellion movement. They demand zero emissions by 2025 and “honest” climate information from governments.[…]  
  
The IPCC reports have been read in a similar way to the Bible: you try to find certain pieces or sections from which you try to justify your extreme views. **This resembles religious extremism**.[…]  
  
We should consider critically, and with reservations, the thoughts of experts…” 



_The BFD_ is less than halfway through a [series](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fail-of-the-day-15/) on fake news that has been peddled by the climate reality denier media. **For 50 years the media have printed predicted doom scenarios** from the “97%” of climate scientists, and those predictions have failed every time. 



Surely the doomsayers should get at least one run on the board before we start worrying about their predictions?

Scott Morrison has delivered a stunning broadside at the globalist elite who fancy themselves the born rulers of a New World Order. In a speech that will certainly give the globalists a fit of the vapours, Morrison has reaffirmed the primacy of national sovereignty. Stand by for shrieks of “populism!” and “Trumpism!”



Scott Morrison is not only drawing a line in the sand on national sovereignty, but he is also reaffirming Coalition tradition and championing the “Forgotten People”, the “Quiet Australians” against the noisy elite.



Scott Morrison has declared his government will lead the charge in asserting the authority of ­nation states over unelected ­international ­institutions, such as the UN.



The Prime Minister, in a major foreign policy address…signalled Australia would seek to play a greater role in shaping a new economic and strategic world order.



Mr Morrison’s speech was aimed squarely at the push by the UN to set the global agenda on ­issues such as climate change and refugee policies.



As democratic nations increasingly band together to counter a rising China, Mr Morrison ­announced he would visit India and Japan early next year and ­Indonesia next month.



These are exactly the key allies, along with the US, that Australia and New Zealand should be [courting as a foil to China](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/how-should-we-defend-ourselves-against-china-pt-2/). All have a mutual self-interest against the rising dragon.



While Mr Morrison recognised the benefits the global economy had brought Australia, he declared that the ballot box should always be more powerful than international institutions.



This is the difference between globalisation and globalism. One is the natural, historical process of human communities sharing resources through trade, to their mutual benefit. It’s a process at least as old as the Silk Road from Europe to China.



The other, though, is the conceit that unelected international institutions can and should override national sovereignty. It’s an elitist doctrine that assumes that the “Guardian caste” are simply better, wiser and more entitled to rule than the hoi polloi with their ballot papers.



“Only a national government, especially one accountable through the ballot box and the rule of law, can define its national interests. We can never answer to a higher authority than the people of Australia.”



Scott Morrison has defined the type of globalisation he does not like.



The Prime Minister remains an advocate of free trade, low tariff barriers, a rules-based international order and all the rest, but in a powerful address to the Lowy Institute he has set out his conviction that effective international action on big global issues comes from nation states co-operating freely.



As he puts it, “individual, like-minded sovereign nations acting together with enlightened self-interest”.



As opposed to this, he rejects the arrogance of a “new variant of globalism that seeks to elevate global institutions above the authority of nation states to direct national policies”.



This kind of globalism, Morrison rightly argues, leads to “elite opinion and attitudes” that “become disconnected from the mainstream” in their societies.



This in turn produces an alienating era of “insiders and outsiders”.



Globalists are invariably the sort of modern leftist who reaps the benefits of wealth and privilege while espousing a hypocritical socialism-for-the-rich. Just as socialists are horrified by the thought of a free market unshackled from bureaucracy, globalists are terrified of a world without a global ruler – a dictatorship of the elite.



Morrison is not championing a heedless beggar-thy-neighbour nationalism. Rather, with admirable realism, he is sketching the only kind of international co-operation that ever really works, that of strong nations pursuing enlightened self-interest and co-operating on shared projects arising from shared interests and shared values. If Morrison had been making this speech in Britain, it would sound like a pro-Brexit speech.



In Australia’s context, the criticism he makes is more directed at the plethora of UN agencies, most of which have no public profile in Australia, which criticise Canberra policy on secure borders, refugee flows, climate change, aid budgets and the many weird contortions and inversions of human rights that UN agencies and their dependent NGOs promote.



The UN agencies take special delight in criticising nations such as Australia while avoiding criticism of the nations that routinely commit crimes against humanity.



The UN has steadily betrayed its own charter, for decades. The EU is desperate to stamp out people’s movements, from Brexit to the Yellow Jackets. The nomenklatura jealously guards its privilege. Stand by for the elites and their mouthpieces, from _The Guardian_ and _The Economist_ to arrogant, globalist politicians, to attack Morrison for all they’re worth.



 **Morrison’s next meeting with Jacinda Ardern ought to be interesting.**

"In the wake of controversy surrounding the shark cull in Western Australia, it is a pleasant change to hear some positive attention being given to the great white shark known as Lydia who has been tracked crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Recent studies have started to elucidate the movements of these enigmatic creatures and more is being learnt about the patterns of their different life stages. The hype surrounding the first shark to cross the mid-Atlantic ridge has been greatly misconstrued in some reports – it’s still a long way off the Irish and British coasts and has since veered westward away from the UK. But this shark is the first that we know of to cross the mid-way point of the Atlantic from the US and Lydia came within 1,000 miles of the Irish and Cornish coasts.  Every summer people are convinced great white shark dorsal fins akin to the Jaws movie are seen in coastal waters off the south coast of England. These reports tend to coincide with the migratory patterns of the Basking shark around the Cornish water or sightings of smaller cousins of the great white, the porbeagle and the shortfin mako. While we do not associate them with our waters, there is no reason why the seas that surround the UK and Irish coastlines are not suitable for great white sharks in terms of temperature. Lydia has actually spent the last few months in the cold waters off the coast of Nova Scotia. Great whites have a wide range from both temperate and tropical regions around the world. They are principally a predator of the central part of the sea, inhabiting both coastal and oceanic waters. Their movements seem to be principally linked to the diet in which they feed, travelling in sync with their appetites.  Depending on the size of a shark, the diet varies. Most sharks under 5m tend to feed off teleost fish. Larger sharks feed off seals, smaller species of shark, cephalopods such as squid and even whale carcasses. As predators at the top of the food chain, great whites play an important role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. Having been persecuted for a number of years, it’s important we learn more about these elusive creatures. Lydia has been tagged and tracked as part of the OCEARCH project, which is seeking to better understand great white shark movement. Representatives described Lydia as around 20 years old and sexually mature for only a short period of time. She is around 14 feet in length which puts her in the category of “sub adult”. Unconfirmed reports regarding the female being pregnant have resulted in some excited news reporting, but when Lydia was tagged in March 2013 she was reported as not being in a state of gravida. Due to there being no scientific foundation for this report it is hard to believe. Due to the longevity of a shark’s reproductive pattern (estimated at 11 months gestation) it should not be wholly dismissed.  Should Lydia be pregnant then there is evidence to suggest that female sharks of a certain age and maturity can reproduce with males from populations across the ocean. Many shark experts have debated about transoceanic movements of Great White sharks taking place and most likely the females return to their original location to give birth. If this is the case then Lydia has already travelled across the mid-Atlantic ridge on her unknown voyage to the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Another reason people may think why Lydia has taken this strange course is that the handling of her during the tagging process caused an adverse effect on her behaviour and migratory pattern. OCEARCH said that Lydia was only on the platform for 15 minutes, during which researchers extracted blood for analysis and performed an ultrasound examination, in addition to attaching the tags.  So the questions remain: surely the ultrasound would have revealed if she was pregnant? And, where has she been tracked since her tagging that could have shown evidence of reproductive activity? One year on from her tagging, what is potentially a major breakthrough in the understanding of migratory habits of the great white shark is nearing. Could this be a common occurrence with this species that we are only just learning more about, or can this just be put down to another case of human intervention gone wrong and a confused Lydia does not know where she is going or what she is doing? On the bright side, it puts great white sharks in the press for a positive reason and that can only be a good thing."

From Penn State
English: Ozone Depletion comparison in North America from 1984-1997. Contrary to popular belief, the Ozone depletion does not affect exclusively the south pole. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Depletion of Antarctic ozone is a more important factor than increasing greenhouse gases in shifting the Southern Hemisphere jet stream in a southward direction, according to researchers at Penn State.
“Previous research suggests that this southward shift in the jet stream has contributed to changes in ocean circulation patterns and precipitation patterns in the Southern Hemisphere, both of which can have important impacts on people’s livelihoods,” said Sukyoung Lee, professor of meteorology.

According to Lee, based on modeling studies, both ozone depletion and greenhouse gas increase are thought to have contributed to the southward shift of the Southern Hemisphere jet stream, with the former having a greater impact. B, but until now, no one has been able to determine the extent to which each of these two forcings has contributed to the shift using observational data.
“Understanding the differences between these two forcings is important in predicting what will happen as the ozone hole recovers,” she said. “The jet stream is expected to shift back toward the north as ozone is replenished, yet the greenhouse-gas effect could negate this.” Lee and her colleague, Steven Feldstein, professor of meteorology, developed a new method to distinguish between the effects of the two forcings. The method uses a cluster analysis to investigate the effects of ozone and greenhouse gas on several different observed wind patterns.
“When most people look at ozone and greenhouse gases, they focus on one wind pattern, but my previous research suggests that, by looking at several different but similar patterns, you can learn more about what is really happening,” said Feldstein.
In their study, the researchers analyzed four wind patterns. The first wind pattern corresponded to an equatorwarda shift of the midlatitude westerlies toward the equator. T; the second pattern also described an equatorward shift, but included a strong tropical component. T; the third pattern corresponded to a poleward shift of the westerlies toward the South Pole with a weakening in the maximum strength of the jet; and the. The fourth pattern corresponded to a smaller poleward jet shift with a strong tropical component.
In addition to their novel inclusion of more than one wind pattern in their analysis, the scientists investigated the four wind patterns at very short time scales.
“Climate models are usually run for many years; they don’t look at the day-to-day weather,” said Feldstein. “But we learned that the four wind patterns fluctuate over about 10 days, so they change on a time scale that is similar to daily weather. This realization means that by taking into account fluctuations associated with the daily weather, it will be easier to test theories about the mechanism by which ozone and greenhouse gases influence the jet stream.”
The researchers used an algorithm to examine the relationship between daily weather patterns and the four wind patterns. They found that the first wind pattern — which corresponded to an equatorward shift of the midlatitude westerlies — was associated with greenhouse gases. They also found that the third pattern — which corresponded to a poleward shift of the westerlies — was associated with ozone. The other two wind patterns were unrelated to either of the forcings. The researchers found that a long-term decline in the frequency of the first pattern and a long-term increase in the frequency of the third pattern can explain the changes in the Southern Hemisphere jet stream.
“Ozone had the bigger impact on the change in the position of the jet stream,” said Lee. “The opposite is likely true for the Northern Hemisphere; we think that ozone has a limited influence on the Northern Hemisphere. Understanding which of these forcings is most important in certain locations may help policy makers as they begin to plan for the future.”
In addition to finding that ozone is more important than greenhouse gases in influencing the jet-stream shift, the scientists also found evidence for a mechanism by which greenhouse gases influence the jet-stream shift. They learned that greenhouse gases may not directly influence the jet-stream shift, but rather may indirectly influence the shift by changing tropical convection, or the vertical transfer of heat in large-scale cloud systems, which, in turn, influences the jet shift. The researchers currently are further examining this and other possible mechanisms for how greenhouse gases and ozone influence the jet stream as well as Antarctic sea ice.
The results will appear in the Feb. 1 issue of the journal Science.
“Not only are the results of this paper important for better understanding climate change, but this paper is also important because it uses a new approach to try to better understand climate change; it uses observational data on a short time scale to try to look at cause and effect, which is something that is rarely done in climate research,” said Feldstein. “Also, our results are consistent with climate models, so this paper provides support that climate models are performing well at simulating the atmospheric response to ozone and greenhouse gases.”

Thanks largely to the Laffer Curve, there are some impressive examples of failed tax increases in countries such as the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. But if there was a prize for the people who most vociferously resist turning over more of their income to government, the Italians would be the odds-on favorite to win.   
  
When they're not firebombing tax offices to show their displeasure, they're taking to the high seas to escape.   
  
Here are some excerpts from a report in the UK-based Telegraph about runaway yachts. 



Thousands are weighing anchor and fleeing with their gin palaces to quiet corners of the Mediterranean to escape a tax evasion crackdown – part of efforts by the government of Mario Monti, the prime minister, to tackle Italy's €1.9 trillion public debt. ...in the ports and marinas they are going after the owners of luxury yachts. Uniformed officers of the Guardia di Finanza, or tax police, are performing on-the-spot checks, boarding boats and checking owners' details against their tax records. ...The unwelcome attention has led many yacht owners to flee Italy's marinas for friendlier foreign ports, from Corsica and the Cote d'Azur in the west to Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro and Greece in the east. Others are heading southwards, to Malta and Tunisia - where they can access their boats on low-cost budget flights from Italy for a fraction of the tax bill they might otherwise face.



Not surprisingly, a lot of middle-class people are suffering because of lost business. 



  


![Media Name: Italian-Yacht.jpg](/sites/cato.org/files/styles/pubs/public/wp-content/uploads/Italian-Yacht.jpg?itok=PizFFLVL)



Around 30,000 yachts have fled Italy this year, costing €200 million in lost revenue from mooring fees, port services and fuel sales, according to Assomarinas, the Italian Association of Marinas. ""We've lost 10 to 15 per cent of our regular customers,"" said Roberto Perocchio, the president of Assomarinas. ""This is the worst crisis in Italian boating history. The authorities are using scare tactics and creating a climate of fear."" ...Plans for a further 30,000 new berths have been put on hold. Business is down by more than a third in many marinas, with some half empty compared to last summer. ""We've lost 40 boats in the last few months, all between 20 and 25 metres long,"" said Giovanni Sorci, director of a marina at Rimini, on the Adriatic coast. ""Most went to Slovenia – in fact it is so popular that there's now barely a berth to be had there. ...At Porto Rotondo in Sardinia, Giacomo Pileri, the general manager of a 700-berth marina, said at least 150 boats had fled to nearby Corsica. ...A steep new tax of up to €700 per day on the largest yachts mooring in Italian ports, introduced by the Monti government in December, was watered down in March to exclude foreign-owned boats. But it has further fuelled the exodus of Italian boats abroad.



And it's not just yachts that are being targeted by a revenue-hungry government. Here's a remarkable report from Reuters on what's happened to the luxury car market (h/t: suyts space). 



Italians spooked by rising car taxes and highly publicized tax fraud spot checks cut back their purchases of Fiat's high-end sports car brands Ferrari and Maserati in the first quarter of 2012, an industry body said on Tuesday. Ferrari sales slumped 51.5 percent, in Italy, and Maserati sales plummeted by 70 percent, said Italian car dealers group Federauto in a statement. Prime Minister Mario Monti's government has stepped up its fight on tax evasion with spot checks on supercar drivers, as well as higher taxes on large cars. ""These figures show how the choices made by the government are literally terrorizing potential clients,"" said Federauto chairman Filippo Pavan Bernacchi.



I assume those awful sales numbers are partly because the economy is weak, but well-to-do Italians obviously don't want to attract attention from the tax police.   
  
The moral of the story is that Italy's government should try a new strategy. The politicians need to understand that taxpayers don't meekly acquiesce, like lambs in a slaughterhouse. 





Heck, even the folks at the International Monetary Fund (a crowd not known for rabid free-market sympathies) have acknowledged that excessive taxation is the leading cause of the shadow economy.   
  
So rather than trying to squeeze more blood from an unwilling stone, maybe the Italian government should junk the current tax code and adopt a simple and fair flat tax.   
  
To conclude, here's Part II of the three-part video series on the Laffer Curve, which focuses on historical evidence (including what happened to the yacht market in the U.S. when politicians went after the ""rich"").   




Sort of makes you wonder why politicians never seem to learn from their mistakes - especially when thoughtful people like me give them free lessons about the relationship between tax rates, tax revenue, and taxable income.   
  
P.S. While I'm very happy to defend tax evasion in cases where government is excessive, venal, and/or corrupt, I suspect that Italians would evade even if they lived under a Hong Kong-style fiscal regime. If that ever happened (don't hold your breath), even I wouldn't get upset about crackdowns on yacht owners and Maserati drivers who aren't declaring any income.

"**A Covid vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNtech has been approved for use in the UK.**
But how does it compare with other vaccines under development?
The vast majority of people are still vulnerable to coronavirus. It's only the current restrictions that are preventing more people from dying.
A vaccine would teach our bodies to fight the infection by stopping us from catching coronavirus, or at least making Covid less deadly.
Having a vaccine, alongside better treatments, is ""the"" exit strategy.
The big breakthrough came when Pfizer/BioNTech published its first results in November.
The vaccine must be stored at a temperature of around -70C. It will be transported in a special box, packed in dry ice and installed with GPS trackers.
One 2 December, the UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.
The vaccine is a new type called an RNA, and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack.
An RNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials for other diseases.
Trials of the Oxford vaccine show it stops 70% of people developing Covid symptoms.
The data also shows a strong immune response in older people.
This may be one of the easiest vaccines to distribute, because it does not need to be stored at very cold temperatures.
It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees, that has been modified to not grow in humans.
Moderna uses the same approach as the Pfizer vaccine.
It is easier to store than Pfizer's, because it stays stable at -20C for up to six months.
Other trial results are also expected in the coming weeks.
However, a trial in Brazil for a drug developed by the Chinese firm Sinovac was suspended after a ""severe adverse incident"" - believed to be a volunteer's death.
Understanding which method produces the best results will be vital. Challenge trials, where people are deliberately infected, could help.
This depends on where Covid is spreading when the vaccine becomes available and in which groups each is most effective.
Older care home residents and staff top the UK's preliminary priority list, followed by health workers like hospital staff, and the over-80s.
Age is, by far, Covid's biggest risk factor.
It is thought that 60-70% of the global population must be immune to stop the virus spreading easily (herd immunity) - billions of people, even if the vaccine works perfectly.
People respond differently to immunisation.
History suggests any vaccine could be less successful in old people because an aged immune system does not respond as well, as happens with the annual flu jab. But data so far suggests this may not be a problem with some of Covid vaccines
Multiple doses may overcome any problems, as could giving it alongside a chemical (called an adjuvant) that boosts the immune system.

And as any serious meteorologist knows, success depends almost entirely on product quality, i.e. forecast accuracy. There’s absolutely no room for politicized science here.
Jung is quoted and featured regularly by Germany’s mainstream media.
This summer Germany and much of Central Europe have seen a spate of severe thunderstorm activity, and as a result many are asking if this might not be an ominous sign of global climate change.
Again Dominik Jung reminds us that the recent weather is nothing new, and even implies that the prognoses made by “climate experts” seem to change as quickly as the weather itself (translated with permission):
Weather: Storms in Germany: Is that the climate change?

Wiesbaden (wetter.net), 30 July 2014 – Storms in the summer are nothing unusual. The same is so with variable weather during Central European summers. This is entirely typical.
In 2003 scientists announced droughts for summers
There is also no data confirming that the number of storms has increased over the past years. However we have been able to determine that the single storms have become a little more severe with regards to their strength.
That there have been storms so often this July is pure coincidence. July 2013 was the exact opposite; it was too dry and rarely were there thunderstorms. Now after having seen the thunderstorms of the past few days, we are already once again hearing the first climate prognoses announcing that extreme downpours will continue to rise over the next years.
That’s weird: After the driest and hottest summer of all time in 2003, the climate experts all assumed summers would become drier and drier – the talk was even about drought.
Slowly we have to start asking ourselves what follows what: The climate follows the prognoses, or the prognoses the climate? The current stormy weather appears to be a welcome opportunity for some climate experts to shift the focus back to climate change – with the aim of acquiring more research money.

"**Nottingham has the highest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK, according to the latest data.**
Public Health England figures show that 689.1 per 100,000 people tested positive for the virus in the city over the past week.
Documents leaked earlier today indicate that new social distancing rules for Nottinghamshire are due to be announced on Monday.
Local politicians have criticised the delay in imposing restrictions.
Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said the government's lack of action on new measures in Nottingham ""makes absolutely no sense"" and that ""strict interventions are needed urgently"".
The Labour politician said: ""The delay leaves this weekend open to potential abuse of the existing rules, which could result in yet more Covid cases in our city.""
He called on the government to ""act urgently and decisively or, better still, give us the powers to let us get on with taking action ourselves"".
In the week up to 5 October, Nottingham recorded 2,294 cases, up from 407 the previous week.
Earlier, the county council said the rate of infection for Nottinghamshire was 106 per 100,000, much lower than the rate in Nottingham.
Although the government has yet to introduce formal measures, local authorities have asked people in the county to avoid mixing indoors with other households indoors following the ""dramatic"" rise in cases.
Nottingham's director of public health Alison Challenger said: ""Everyone needs to stick rigidly to their social bubbles and not mix with other households.
""There is no need to wait for additional government restrictions.""
Gedling MP Tom Randall said he would ""wholly support calls"" for people to follow stricter guidelines, while Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood has called the delay in introducing measures ""reckless and indefensible"".
Ms Greenwood added: ""It's outrageous that [MPs] only found out about this decision from the media.""
On Thursday evening, the government released a statement urging residents to follow ""the advice of the local authority"", as well as practising social distancing, wearing face coverings, and getting tested if they exhibited symptoms.
A spokesperson added: ""The local authority has our full backing and support.""
But Nottingham North MP Alex Norris, who was briefed about the government's strategy during a call with health minister Edward Argar, said he was sceptical about the government's strategy.
He said: ""When pressed about Nottingham, the advice that came back was, 'We've not decided yet', which is very hard to understand.
""They won't support us because they won't bring in the restriction we're appealing for them to bring in.
""We're trying to get ahead of those restrictions by suggesting them to people ourselves, but of course we don't have the legal backing to enforce those.""
Ben Bradley, MP for Mansfield - which has a lower infection rate of 62.2 - called on the government to reconsider blanket restrictions for the whole of the county.
The Conservative politician added: ""It would be really frustrating to have restrictions imposed when, locally, we might not need them.""
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, leaked documents show Nottinghamshire is expected to go into level two of a new ""three-tier"" system next week.
They indicate people will still be able to go on holiday outside the county, but only with people from their own household or support bubble.
Households would still be able to meet indoors if they are in a support bubble.
Jo Cox-Brown, founder of Night Time Economy, which works with businesses and local authorities to create safer nights out in English cities, said further restrictions could have a devastating effect on jobs.
""[Businesses] are terrified. The night-time economy is worth 14,000 jobs in Nottingham alone,"" she said.
""They were closed for three months, they have been trading for two months but at 50-75% of normal occupancy levels, so financially these venues are on their knees.""
Across England, bars and restaurants could be forced to close as the government prepares to tighten restrictions for the worst-affected areas.
It follows the announcement that similar outlets across central Scotland are to be closed for 16 days.
Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has refused to say whether pubs and restaurants in the north and in Nottingham will be forced to close.
He said: ""We are currently considering what steps we should take, obviously taking the advice of our scientific and medical advisers, and a decision will be made shortly.""
Asked if there will be an announcement linked to the hospitality industry, he said: ""We are considering the evidence. In some parts of the country, the number of cases are rising very fast and we are taking that very seriously.""

Radio host and psychologist Kyle MacDonald [opines](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=12273354) in a paper that the reason Greta Thunberg is given a hard time is because Greta is a girl.



Bad things happen when we don’t listen to children. It wasn’t that long ago we sent them up chimneys, and worked them to death in work houses. In some parts of the world they still do.



Much of my working life I’ve sat and listened to people explore and understand the impact that various experiences in their childhood had on them. Of not being listened to, of being treated with disdain, told to get over it, to stop crying. Experiences of being beaten, abused and neglected.



[…]Authority over women and children is of course one of the corner stones of much that is wrong with traditional, right wing, conservative orthodoxy. That somehow adult men are the only ones truly allowed a voice. That children should be seen and not heard.



[…]And it’s the same thinking that denies we are killing our planet.



Wait, what?



Turns out, people’s responses to Greta Thunberg provide a pretty clear litmus test of how much one still clings to the orthodoxy of misogyny.



Because she is both young, and a woman. She also – thankfully – refuses to be silenced.



Actually it’s because at 16 she knows nothing about history, economics or science, let alone the world’s climate and how it works.



So she stands defiant, and seems to show little disregard for the vitriolic rants that tell her to sit down and shut up. Instead, she carries on. She tells world leaders they’re not doing enough (because they’re not) and that it’s not up to her to be the beacon of hope: it’s up to them.



[…]It’s up to all of us to tolerate the guilt, the panic and anxiety and take action. As adults it’s our role to tolerate the feelings, and act to protect our rangitahi.



Not attack them, and leave them to flounder in their own distress. But so much of what unconsciously drives mysogyny, patriarchy and abuses of power over the vulnerable is an inability in the attacker to feel vulnerable. Instead that fear and inability to tolerate vulnerability it is projected out, and attacked in others: children of course being the very personification of vulnerability.



Hear that, [WH](https://thebfd.co.nz/author/wh/)? Stop attacking climate alarmists and denying your [vulnerability](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fail-of-the-day-12/)!



So if you feel affronted by Greta Thurnberg’s words, good. Deal with it. In her words:



“I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day.”



I feel affronted. I feel affronted that a child with obvious psychological problems should be so used and exploited by others. Politics is a brutal game and climate change is deeply political. What is at stake is literally our way of life and capitalism itself. 



And if you believe that Greta Thunberg writes her own speeches I have a bridge to Venezuela to sell you.

"Arguments surrounding the use of genetically modified crops and whether they are the solution to the world’s problems of food supply and public health are no nearer to resolution than when GM was introduced. In Europe, there is widespread opposition to GM crops, with import or cultivation of many GM foods prohibited by EU regulations. In the Americas, and to a lesser extent in Asia, regulations are less stringent and a substantial proportion of the area used to grow corn, soybean and cotton is planted with GM seeds. The agri-business companies responsible for developing the seeds, notably Monsanto, are frequent targets of anti-GM campaigners. But not all GM crops come from the private sector, with considerable research underway at public research institutions or funded by charities – not that this provides protection from protesters, such as when Golden Rice field trials were destroyed in the Philippines last year. GM seeds are not just used for foodstuffs. Most of the cotton grown in India comes from GM seeds, referred to as Bt cotton having had the addition of genes from the Bacillus thuringiensis bacterium, which provides resistance to cotton bollworm. Even so, India has banned the use of GM food crops, notably aubergine, partly from the belief that the rate of suicide among farmers has increased in cotton-growing states since Bt cotton was introduced in 2002. This belief was espoused by Prince Charles in 2008 and more recently by the controversial environmental campaigner Vandana Shiva. Anti-GM campaigns point to the costs of seeds and the fact that a crop failure can ruin farmers who then turn to suicide. The suggestion that there is a suicide among Indian farmers every half an hour seems shocking. This is not a very helpful statistic however; there are more than 40m Indian farmers in the nine main cotton-growing states. Fortunately, suicide is rare, and no less rare among Indian farmers than among farmers in other parts of the world. In 2011, the annual suicide rate for Indian farmers in the main cotton-growing states was around 30 per 100,000 farmers. This is higher than in England and Wales where the rate is about 12 per 100,000, but similar to the best estimates of the rates in Scotland and France. The evidence indicates that GM farming does not lead to higher suicide rates. In six out of the nine cotton-growing states, the suicide rate for males who did not work on farms was higher than for farmers. Also in 2001 (before Bt cotton was introduced) the suicide rate was 31.7 per 100,000 and in 2011 the corresponding estimate was 29.3 – only a minor difference. The balance of evidence favours the argument that adopting Bt cotton has increased yields in all cotton-growing states except Punjab, and has reduced pesticide costs so that the crop has become more profitable for farmers. So it’s reasonable to suppose that these farmers have reduced their debts and, to the extent that suicide has an economic component, are less at risk of committing suicide. In fact, the available data does not support the view that farmer suicides have increased following the introduction of Bt cotton. Taking all states together, there is evidence to support the hypothesis that the reverse is true: male farmer suicide rates have actually declined after 2005 having been increasing before then. The picture at the state level is less clear-cut, especially the contrast between Maharashtra and Punjab. In Maharashtra, farmer suicides have gone down, in Punjab they have gone up. Can we bring any more evidence to bear to understand this contrast better? Both Punjab and Maharashtra have relatively high proportions of farmers growing cotton (26% and 20%) and Bt adoption rates are much the same. However, when we examine the effect of the introduction of Bt cotton on cotton yields, we find that yields have risen in Maharashtra but have gone down in Punjab. We cannot, of course, say that this is a causal effect but the results for these two states are in line with the hypothesis that there is an economic component to the explanation of suicides. The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole are not notably high in a global context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton, albeit not in every cotton-growing state. The widespread adoption of Bt cotton – more than 90% by area in most states – means we will never have the opportunity to carry out a before and after epidemiological study of cotton farmers. Instead we have to rely on official data at an aggregate level with all the caveats that entails. However, such a study might be possible if permission to grow GM vegetable crops is granted by the Indian government (as it has been in Bangladesh) and might lead to a more definitive answer. Hard Evidence is a series of articles in which academics use research evidence to tackle the trickiest public policy questions."
"More than a decade of overwhelming evidence links air pollution and heat exposure with negative pregnancy outcomes in the US, according to a new review of dozens of studies. The investigation, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, identified 57 studies since 2007 showing a significant association between the two factors and the risk of pre-term birth, low birth weight and stillbirth. Black mothers were particularly at risk, as were people with asthma. The review analyzed 32m births tracked across 68 studies. Of those, 84% found air pollution and heat to be risk factors. Human-caused climate disturbances are forcing temperatures higher, raising humidity and reducing people’s ability to cool off even at night. Climate change also makes air pollution worse. Smog from the burning of fossil fuels forms on hot days. And wildfires that cause smoke inhalation are exacerbated by the crisis. “When you talk about climate, people think about severe weather, big storms or huge fires … but we wanted to talk about the impacts that are common and widespread and ongoing and also are rarely attributed to the climate crisis,” said Bruce Bekkar, a co-author of the study and a retired obstetrician. “We are already having generations weakened from birth. There’s just no way we can allow that to happen, and I would like to see not just mothers and their husbands and kids show up at council meetings, but I’d like to see many more health professionals involved in calling for legislation that reduces the ongoing and really pretty scary health burdens of the climate crisis.” The findings come as the Trump administration has sought to weaken pollution protections and climate efforts, including by rolling back standards for car and power plant emissions. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency has also ignored scientists’ advice to enact stricter air quality rules. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already finds climate change to be an urgent threat to women’s health, in addition to a major public health challenge. Climate change is linked with worsening cardiac disease, respiratory disease, mental health and exposure to infectious diseases. But pregnant women and developing fetuses are especially vulnerable to its effects. In the review, 19 studies linked air pollution to pre-term birth, defined as a baby born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Twenty-five studies linked air pollution to low birth weight. And four studies linked air pollution to stillbirth. One study found the risk of stillbirth increased 42% with high third-trimester exposure. Stillbirth is rare, so data on it is limited and it is difficult to draw broad conclusions about why it happens, Bekkar said. The review considered studies about smog, also called ozone, and fine particle pollution. Emerging science is increasingly linking air pollution to a range of health problems, including dementia. A new rodent-based study from the University of California, Davis, finds that traffic-related air pollution is connected to an increased risk for changes in brain development that might cause neurodevelopmental disorders. “What we witnessed are subtle changes,” co-author Kelley Patten said. “But we are seeing these effects using air pollution exposures that fall within regulatory limits.” We are already having generations weakened from birth. There’s just no way we can allow that to happen There were fewer studies on the effect of heat on pregnancies to review, but almost all of them found it to be harmful. One study posits that the risk of early birth increased 11.6% with every 5.6C increase. Global average temperatures are already more than 1C higher than since before industrialization and are on track to rise to 3C higher. The review confirmed black mothers are at greater risk for pre-term birth and low birth weight. Social determinants of health – including poverty, long-term stress levels and access to healthcare –disproportionately hurt people of color. The study concludes that “environmental exposures further exacerbate that background risk and could be included among these social determinants”. Americans increasingly understand that the climate crisis is harming human health, according to a survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. This year, far more Americans were likely to respond that they expect heatstrokes, asthma, diseases carried by insects and pollen-related allergies to get worse as the planet warms. For example, in 2014, 37% of Americans thought heatstrokes caused by extreme heat waves would become more common. In April, 57% did. A growing movement among medical practitioners aims to educate patients about climate change. Bekkar hopes health professionals will share the review’s findings with their patients and urge them to avoid prolonged exposures to heat and pollution. “It’s not possible for everybody, but those that can should. If someone doesn’t have an air conditioner at home and is pregnant, the more time they can spend in air-conditioned places that have filtered air, the better for their pregnancy outcome,” Bekkar said. But he also wants women’s advocates to demand more from elected officials. “Reducing air pollution and fighting climate change is a matter of their children’s survival and health,” he said."

Love him or hate him, he’s making an impact. I thought it worthwhile to make his testimony available to read.

Submitted Written Testimony of Climate Depot’s Marc Morano at Congressional Hearing on Climate Change: ‘The Origins and Response to Climate Change’


Morano to the U.S. Congress: ‘The scientific reality is that on virtually every claim — from A-Z — the claims of the promoters of man-made climate fears are failing, and in many instances the claims are moving in the opposite direction. The global warming movement is suffering the scientific death of a thousand cuts.’

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a press release from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research.
Original article: Bayr, T., D. Dommenget, T. Martin, S. Power, 2014: The eastward shift of the Walker Circulation in response to global warming and its relationship to ENSO variability. Climate Dynamics, DOI 10.1007/s00382-014-2091-y.
Note that their results are based on climate model simulations, the same kind that have had a 97.4 % failure rate thus far (see chart, above).
Yet these scientists think they are good enough to make predictions for the year 2100. This is what I call classic, very transparent quackery (They couldn’t even get the first 15 years right).
That aside, here is the GEOMAR press release (try not to fall off your chair laughing):
========================
Will climate change make El Nino a permanent concern?
27 May 2014/Kiel. Currently there are many indications that an El Niño event will be developing in the months ahead. This could become a lasting situation as a result of increasing global warming – even if the observations of the last decade have been showing the opposite trend. This is the result reached by a study conducted by an international team of scientists lead by the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research based in Kiel. The results have appeared in the international journal Climate Dynamics.

El Niño, or more correctly El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is the strongest climate fluctuation on timescales of a few (2-7) years. The phenomena often occurs at Christmas time and got its name from Peruvian fishermen (Span.: El Niño) and involves a strong warming of the Eastern Pacific and is connected to the absence of fish swarms.  Today we know that it involves a coupled system between ocean and atmosphere. The El Niño oceanic component is characterized by the warming of the central and eastern Pacific and the atmospheric Pendant Southern Oscillation, which is a measure for the pressure difference over the Pacific and Indian Ocean. During an El Niño, the area of low pressure that normally lies above the Indonesian region shifts eastwards over the Pacific. This leads to flooding in the eastern Pacific and droughts over northern Australia.
The model studies analyzed by the authors coming from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) , with which the climate projections for the IPCC climate report were calculated, show a general weakening and eastward shifting of atmospheric, equatorial circulation pattern until the year 2100 relative to the mean condition of the years 1950-1979. The pattern resembles a weak but lasting El Niño situation.
The ERA Interim Reanalysis 1979-2012, however, was not able to confirm this trend, but rather it showed an opposite development with a westward shift and strengthening of atmospheric circulation at the equator. “This apparent contradiction can be explained by internal variability in the climate system,” explains the study’s lead author Tobias Bayr of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. “We believe it is unlikely the models are falsely predicting the development as more than 36 different models and numerous model runs were used for the employed analyses,“ Bayr adds. With the help of the analysis process (Multi-model Ensemble) used for the study, very reliable, robust signals could be extracted from a variety of experiments. “And a clear majority of the models predict we will get a more or less permanent El Niño by the end of this century because of climate warming.”
All observations point to a development of an El Niño in the months ahead. However it remains anyone’s guess on whether or not this El Niño will be the turning point to the trend predicted by the models.
===================================
Stunning BS. Amazing such crap gets published nowadays.
Using models of the sort that have had a 97% failure rate thus far, they pretend being quite sure about the year 2100, and yet turn right around and admit that they can’t predict what will happen next year, writing it’s “anyone’s guess”.
Your tax-euros at work, folks. And they (media and established politicians) wonder why skeptic parties won huge in last weekend’s elections.

Today POLITICO Arena asks: 



Bain Capital invested in a number of firms that specialized in relocating American jobs to lower‐​wage facilities in countries like China and India, the _Washington Post_ has reported. Obama senior adviser David Axelrod seized on the story last night, accusing Romney of “breathtaking hypocrisy.” Romney has pledged on the campaign trail to protect American jobs from outsourcing. Could this information be a solid nail in the coffin of Romney’s business record? Or will Obama’s economic record overshadow it?



My response:   
  
  
David Axelrod, like Obama himself, is playing to the economic ignorance that afflicts a good part of the American public. Firms don’t “specialize” in outsourcing jobs. They try, rather, to produce the best products at the lowest costs—for the benefit of their owners and their customers. If that means going abroad to find the best labor at the lowest cost, so be it. What would you have them do, seek inferior labor at higher costs? How would that benefit owners, customers, or the nation as a whole? Firms are not welfare agencies.   
  
  
When firms are run efficiently, everyone benefits—including those higher‐​wage domestic workers who would otherwise have been employed but now must seek other opportunities that will arise only under conditions of efficiency. Or, of course, we could _restrict_ firms from going abroad, _force_ them (by law) to be less efficient, and thus lower the standard of living for everyone. That’s the prescription implicit in the Axelrod/​Obama vision. Obama’s multiple “Solyndra” fiascos have cost several million dollars per job “created” (and eventually lost). I dare say those workers would have preferred having the (taxpayer’s) money to the jobs.   
  
  
As for Axelrod’s charge about Romney’s “breathtaking hypocrisy”—his pledging on the campaign trail to protect American jobs from outsourcing—there’s a perfect explanation for that, but to understand it it takes a better grasp of economics than Axelrod or Obama, by his actions, seem to have. You remove so many of the irrational, rent‐​seeking regulations we have today, which Romney has promised to do, and you’ll create a climate in which firms won’t have to look abroad for labor. If there’s any “breathtaking hypocrisy” at play here, it’s with Axelrod and Obama, who purport to speak for the “middle class” but whose policies for three and one‐​half years have driven the middle class into ever greater depths of despair. Obama’s record, as we say, speaks for itself.

"**More than 200 swimming pools in England will remain closed despite being able to reopen as lockdown restrictions are eased, a Swim England report has said.**
The swimming body said the decision presented a ""catastrophe for the health and wellbeing of the nation"".
The 221 pools were council-run, with the North West being particularly hard hit, affecting about half a million swimmers, Swim England said.
Councils pointed to financial difficulties in their decision making.
With lockdown in England having come to an end, gyms and swimming pools across the country are allowed to reopen from Wednesday, regardless of what tier their area is in.
""While it's extremely positive that millions of swimmers up and down the country can return to the activity they love, it's unacceptable to even think that so many people or clubs will not have a much-loved swimming pool to visit,"" Swim England's chief executive Jane Nickerson said.
She said more investment was needed to keep swimming pools and leisure centres open, adding despite a government grant for the industry ""financial pressures have not gone away"".
Four times world champion triathlete Barbara Holmes, from Lancashire, said: ""People need their pools, especially the children.""
Ms Holmes, who is the over-60s world champion, has been backing campaigners trying to reopen Fleetwood swimming pool.
""The community needs to be heard,"" she said.
Trafford Leisure said all of its centres would remain closed until the new year, saying they would be ""largely empty and costly to run"".
To save money, its chief operating officer said it had had to furlough staff as well as leaving its pool and building unheated.
In Stoke-on-Trent, the council said it recognised the ""essential"" physical and mental health benefits of leisure facilities but had made the decision to stagger their reopening and only two of the city's gyms would not remain closed.
Council leader Abi Brown said 75% of its leisure centre staff had been ""redeployed to critical services including welfare calls and contact tracing"" in an effort to bring down coronavirus cases and some centres had been adapted for community testing.
""If the current situation improves, we expect to restart more of our sport and leisure services from the new year,"" she said.
While some pools have been ""mothballed"", Ms Nickerson said some would ""sadly never reopen"".
Swindon's Oasis Leisure Centre is one victim, which will not reopen after its landlord Seven Capital found its operation was ""not viable"".
A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport said it had announced Â£100m of funding to support local authority leisure centres, as well as Â£7.2bn to councils to help with the impacts of coronavirus."
"**The government hopes to start distributing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine imminently.**
However, the vaccine needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C.
Most other vaccines do not need this, so how will this be made to work?
In the short-term, Pfizer has a plan.
The vaccine will be distributed from its own centres in the US, Germany and Belgium.
It will need to travel both on land and by air and possibly be stored in distribution centres, before being delivered to anywhere the vaccine will be given.
Pfizer has developed a special transport box the size of a suitcase, packed with dry ice and installed with GPS trackers. Each reusable box can keep up to 5,000 doses of the vaccine at the right temperature for 10 days, if it remains unopened.
Wiltshire-based firm Polar Thermals makes similar boxes for other vaccines and counts Pfizer among its clients, but not yet for this particular purpose.
The box is not likely to be cheap. Head of sales Paul Harrison says a standard chilled transport box, which will retain a temperature of up to -8C for five days and is big enough to hold 1,200 vaccines, costs about Â£5,000 per unit - although they can be reused thousands of times.
His firm uses aerogel as insulation, rather than dry ice - which could be handy if a global carbon dioxide shortage from earlier this year continues to affect the availability of related products, such as dry ice.
The US Compressed Gas Association, however, has said it is committed to meeting demand.
The vaccine can survive for a further five days once thawed, Pfizer has said, but this does not buy a great deal of extra time.
In the longer-term, Public Health England says that in the UK ""national preparations"" are under way regarding both central storage and distribution of the vaccine across the country, but has not given details.
As it stands, extreme cold storage is certainly not commonplace, and your local GP is unlikely to have it.
Some institutions, such as universities and research labs, do have the right storage capacity. In the UK, universities shared resources at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, including PPE-making equipment and ventilators.
The situation in developing countries is even more tenuous.
Burkina Faso, in central Africa, reported last month that it was already short of about 1,000 clinical fridges.
The World Health Organization, in conjunction with UN children's agency Unicef, has an ongoing project mapping cold storage facilities in anticipation of a Covid-19 vaccine.
Unicef wants to have 65,000 solar-powered cold fridges installed in low-income countries by the end of 2021."
"The failure of governments and central banks to set out a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis is threatening to derail vital UN climate talks aimed at staving off global catastrophe, campaigners have warned. On Friday, the UK and the UN attempted to revive the stalled Cop26 climate talks, with a coalition of businesses committing to a Race for Zero, signing up to reduce their emissions to net zero by mid-century. Close to 1,000 businesses have joined the campaign, including household names such as Rolls-Royce and the food and drink majors Nestlé and Diageo.  Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and UN special envoy for climate and finance, said: “The transition to net zero is creating the greatest commercial opportunity of our time. Net zero targets must be underpinned by transition plans so that investors can assess which companies will seize the opportunities in the transition and which will cease to exist.” But rhetoric is not enough while central banks are still pouring money into propping up “business as usual”, according to campaigners. “It’s been great to hear the government’s warm words about the green recovery, but what really matters now are the policies and investments needed to make it a reality,” said Morten Thaysen, green recovery campaigner at Greenpeace UK. “The UK has a chance to lead on the world stage next year with Cop26, and set an example of what building back better actually looks like. Committing to this ahead of the climate talks will show international leadership on what a truly green recovery looks like.” The vast majority of the stimulus money so far announced by governments around the world is set to prop up the fossil fuel economy, according to analyst company Bloomberg New Energy Finance. More than half a trillion dollars worldwide – $509bn (£395bn) – is to be poured into high-carbon industries, with no conditions to ensure they reduce their carbon output. Only about $12.3bn is to go towards low-carbon industries, such as renewable energy, and a further $18.5bn into high-carbon industries provided they achieve climate targets. At these rates, the rescue packages would be even less green than the economic stimulus following the 2008 financial crisis, despite government rhetoric on a green recovery, and pressure from economists and campaigners to use the stimulus packages to shift to a low-carbon footing. The current and former governors of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey and Mark Carney, joined François Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Bank of France, to write in the Guardian of the need for a green recovery. They said: “The economic recovery plans being developed today offer the chance to build a sustainable, competitive new economy.” However, the first disclosures from the Bank’s Covid Corporate Financing Facility this week showed that billions of pounds of taxpayer support are being funnelled to fossil fuel companies. Airlines have taken up about £1.8bn of the £16bn already allocated from the funds, which could top £67bn when fully disbursed, while carmakers have benefited by more than £1bn so far and two oil service companies, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger, are taking £600m and £150m respectively. “The Bank of England’s failure to lead by example in greening its activities risks seriously undermining the UK’s efforts to show global leadership on climate through Cop26,” said Fran Boait, executive director of the pressure group Positive Money. “It would be farcical if the institution underpinning Britain’s financial system is still pumping money towards companies whose business models are utterly incompatible with global emissions targets.” The European Central Bank has also propped up high-carbon industries in its lending, with as much as €220bn (£193bn) going to fossil fuel industries, according to analysis by the pressure group Reclaim Finance. The bank’s plans will funnel money to 38 oil companies including big names such as Shell and Total, and several coal companies. “The ECB is simultaneously acknowledging climate urgency and refusing to act,” said Paul Schreiber, campaigner at Reclaim Finance. “This stance is unbearable – we now know that the ECB is not neutral, but finances climate change.” Governments are also continuing to subsidise the fossil fuel industry, according to an analysis by the OECD and the International Energy Agency on Friday. Last year, $478bn of government support was poured into the production and consumption of fossil fuels by 77 economies. Ángel Gurría, the secretary-general of the OECD club of rich countries, said: “I am saddened to see some backsliding on efforts to phase out fossil fuel support. This rise in production subsidies seems set to continue in 2020 with some countries targeting state aid to fossil fuel and related industries. We should seize this opportunity [of the coronavirus recovery] to reform subsidies and use public funds in a way that best benefits people and the planet.” Britain’s role as president of Cop26 means the UK government has a crucial role to play if these trends towards a bailout of the high-carbon economy are to be reversed and the world is to reach net zero emissions. The vital UN summit, postponed by a year to November 2021, is seen as the last chance to put the world back on track to meet the Paris agreement on climate change, and avoid catastrophic levels of global heating. For Cop26 to be a success, the government must lead by example in setting out a green recovery, experts concluded. “The clock is ticking for the UK to show it’s serious about a green recovery,” said Chris Venables, head of politics at the Green Alliance thinktank. “We’ve heard bold and ambitious words from Boris Johnson and other ministers, but with the first stimulus package only weeks away we need to see the government’s plans to support its ambitions. We need to take some big steps. Let’s fire the starting gun on a real green recovery.”"

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
People sometimes ask why I don’t publish in the so-called scientific journals. Here’s a little story about that. Back in 2004, Michael Mann wrote a mathematically naive piece about how to smooth the ends of time series. It was called “On smoothing potentially non-stationary climate time series“, and it was published in Geophysical Research Letters in April of 2004. When I read it, I couldn’t believe how bad it was. Here is his figure illustrating the problem:

Figure 1a. [ORIGINAL CAPTION] Figure 1. Annual mean NH series. (blue) shown along with (a) 40 year smooths of series based on alternative boundary constraints (1) – (3). Associated MSE scores favor use of the ‘minimum roughness’ constraint. 
Note the different colored lines showing different estimates of what the final averaged value will be, based on different methods of calculating the ends of the averages. The problem is how to pick the best method.
I was pretty naive back then. I was living in Fiji for one thing, and hadn’t had much contact with scientific journals and their curious ways. So I innocently thought I should write a piece pointing out Mann’s errors, and suggesting a better method. I append the piece I wrote back nearly a decade ago. It was called “A closer look at smoothing potentially non-stationary time series.”
My main insight in my paper was that I could actually test the different averaging methods against the dataset by truncating the data at various points. By doing that you can calculate what you would have predicted using a certain method, and compare it to what the true average actually turned out to be.
And that means that you can calculate the error for any given method experimentally. You don’t have to guess at which one is best. You can measure which one is best. That was the insight that I thought made my work worth publishing.
Now, here comes the story.
I wrote this, and I submitted it to Geophysical Research Letters at the end of 2005. After the usual long delays, they said I was being too hard on poor Michael Mann, so they wouldn’t even consider it … and perhaps they were right, although it seemed pretty vanilla to me. In any case, I could see which way the wind was blowing. I was pointing out the feet of clay, not allowed.
I commented about my lack of success on the web. I described my findings over at Climate Audit, saying:
Posted Oct 24, 2006 at 2:09 PM
…
[Mann] recommends using the “minimum roughness” constraint … apparently without noticing that it pins the endpoints.
I wrote a reply to GRL pointing this out, and advocating another method than one of those three, but they declined to publish it. I’m resubmitting it.
w.
So, I pulled out everything but the direct citations to Mann’s paper and resubmitted it basically in the form appended below. But in the event, I got no joy on my second pass at publishing it either. They said no thanks, not interested, so I gave up. I posted it on my server at the time (long dead), put a link up on Climate Audit, and let it go. I was just a guy living in Fiji and working a day job, what did I know?
Then a year later, in 2007 Steve McIntyre posted a piece called “Mannomatic Smoothing and Pinned End-points“. In that post, he also discussed the end point problem.
And now, with all of that as prologue, here’s the best part.
In 2008, after I’d foolishly sent my manuscript entitled “A closer look at smoothing potentially non-stationary time series” to people who turned out to be friends of Michael Mann, Dr. Mann published a brand new paper in GRL. And here’s the title of his study …
“Smoothing of climate time series revisited”
I cracked up when I saw the title. Yeah, he better revisit it, I thought at the time, because the result of the first visit was swiss cheese.
And what was Michael Mann’s main insight in his new 2008 paper? What method did he propose?
“In such cases, the true smoothed behavior of the time series at the termination date is known, because that date is far enough into the interior of the full series that its smooth at that point is largely insensitive to the constraint on the upper boundary. The relative skill of the different methods can then be measured by the misfit between the estimated and true smooths of the truncated series.”
In other words, his insight is that if you truncate the data, you can calculate the error for each method experimentally … curious how that happens to be exactly the insight I wasted my time trying to publish.
Ooooh, dear friends, I’d laughed at his title, but when I first read that analysis of “his” back in 2008, I must admit that I waxed nuclear and unleashed the awesome power that comes from splitting the infinitive. The house smelled for days from the sulfur fumes emitted by my unabashed expletives … not a pretty picture at all, I’m ashamed to say.
But before long, sanity prevailed, and I came to realize that I’d have been a fool to expect anything else. I had revealed a huge, gaping hole in Mann’s math to people who were obviously his friends … and while for me it was an interesting scientific exercise, for him it represented much, much more. He could not afford to leave the hole unplugged or have me plug it.
And since I had kindly told him how to plug the hole, he’d have been crazy to try something else. Why? Because my method worked … hard to argue with success.
The outcome also proved to me once again that I could accomplish most anything if I didn’t care who got the credit. 
Because in this case, the sting in the tale is that at the end of the day, my insights on how to deal with the problem did get published in GRL. Not only that, they got published by the guy who would have most opposed their publication under my name. I gotta say, whoever is directing this crazy goat-roping contest we call life has the most outré, wildest sense of humor imaginable …
Anyhow, that’s why I’ve never pushed too hard to try to publish my work in what used to be scientific journals, but now are perhaps better described as the popular science magazines. Last time I tried, I got bit … so now, I mostly just skip getting gnawed on by the middleman and put my ideas up on the web directly.
And if someone wants to borrow or steal or plagiarise my scientific ideas and words and images, I say more power to them, take all you want. I cast my scientific ideas on the electronic winds in the hope that they will take root, and I can only wish that, just like Michael Mann did, people will adopt my ideas as their own. There’s much more chance they’ll survive that way.
Sure, I’d prefer to get credit—I’m as human as anyone, or at least I keep telling myself that. So an acknowledgement is always appreciated.
But if you just want to just take some idea of mine and run, sell it under another brand name, I say go for it, take all you want, because I’ve learned my lesson. The very best way to keep people from stealing my ideas is to give them away … and that’s the end of my story.
As always, my best wishes for each of you … and at this moment my best wish is that you follow your dream, you know the one I mean, the dream you keep putting off again and again. I wish you follow that dream because the night is coming and no one knows what time it really is …

[UPDATE] In my above-mentioned comment on Steve McIntyre’s blog, I mentioned the analysis of Mannian smoothing by Willie Soon, David Legates, and Sallie Baliunas, entitled Estimation and representation of long-term (>40 year) trends of Northern-Hemisphere-gridded surface temperature: A note of caution. 
Dr. Soon has been kind enough to send me a copy of that study, which I have posted up here. My thanks to him, it’s an interesting paper.

A closer look at smoothing potentially non-stationary time series

[1] An experimental method is presented to determine the optimal choice among several alternative smoothing methods and boundary constraints based on their behavior at the end of the data series. This method is applied to the smoothing of the instrumental Northern Hemisphere (NH) annual mean, yielding the best choice of these methods and constraints.
1. Introduction
[2] Michael Mann has given us an analysis of various ways of smoothing the data at the beginning and the end of a time series of data (Mann 2004, Geophysical Research Letters, hereinafter M2004).
These involve minimizing different boundary conditions at those boundaries, and are called the “minimum norm”, “minimum slope”, and “minimum roughness” methods. These methods minimize, in order, the zeroth, first, and second derivatives of the smoothed average. M2004 describes the methods as follows:
“To approximate the ‘minimum norm’ constraint, one pads the series with the long-term mean beyond the boundaries (up to at least one filter width) prior to smoothing.
To approximate the ‘minimum slope’ constraint, one pads the series with the values within one filter width of the boundary reflected about the time boundary. This leads the smooth towards zero slope as it approaches the boundary.
Finally, to approximate the ‘minimum roughness’ constraint, one pads the series with the values within one filter width of the boundary reflected about the time boundary, and reflected vertically (i.e., about the ‘‘y’’ axis) relative to the final value. This tends to impose a point of inflection at the boundary, and leads the smooth towards the boundary with constant slope.” (M2004)
[3] He then goes on to say that the best choice among these methods is the one that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) between the smoothed data and the data itself:
“That constraint providing the minimum MSE is arguably the optimal constraint among the three tested.” (M2004)
2. Method
[4] However, there is a better and more reliable way to choose among these three constraints. This is to minimize the error of the final smoothed data point in relation, not to the data itself, but to the actual final smoothed average (which will only be obtainable in the future). The minimum MSE used in M2004 minimizes the squared error between the estimate and the data points. But this is not what we want. We are interested in the minimum mean squared error between the estimate and the final smoothed curve obtained from the chosen smoothing method. In other words, we want the minimum error between the smoothed average at the end of the data and the smoothed average that will actually be obtained in the future, when we have enough additional data to determine the smoothed average exactly.
[5] This choice can be determined experimentally, by realizing that the potential error increases as we approach the final data point. This is because as we approach the final data point, we have less and less data to work with, and so the potential for error grows. Accordingly, we can look to see what the error is with each method in the final piece of data. This will be the maximum expected error for each method. While we cannot determine this for any data nearer to the boundary than half the width of the smoothing filter, we can do so for all of the rest of the data. It is done by truncating the data at each data point along the way, calculating the estimated value of the final point in this truncated dataset using the minimum norm, slope, and roughness methods, and seeing how far they are from the actual value obtained from the full data set.
[6] In doing this, a curious fact emerges — if we calculate the average using the “minimum roughness” method outlined above, the “minimum roughness” average at the final data point is just the final data point itself. This is true regardless of the averaging method used. If we reflect data around both the time axis and the y-axis at the final value, the data will be symmetrical around the final value in both the “x” and “y” directions. Thus the average will be just the final data point, no matter what smoothing method is used. This can be seen in Fig. 1a of M2004:
ORIGINAL CAPTION: Figure 1. Annual mean NH series. (blue) shown along with (a) 40 year smooths of series based on alternative boundary constraints (1)–(3). Associated MSE scores favor use of the ‘minimum roughness’ constraint. (Mann 2004)
[7] Note that the minimum roughness method (red line) goes through the final data point. But this is clearly not what we want to do. Looking at Fig. 1, imagine a “smoothed average” which, for a data set truncated at any given year, must end up at the final data point. In many cases, this will yield wildly inaccurate results. If this method were applied to the data truncated at the high temperature peak just before 1880, for example, or the low temperature point just before that, the “average” would be heading out of the page. This is not at all what we are looking for, so the choice that minimizes the MSE between the data and the average (the “minimum roughness” choice) should not be used.
[8] Since the minimum roughness method leads to obvious errors, this leaves us a choice between the minimum norm and minimum slope methods. Fig. 2 shows the same data set with the point-by-point errors from the three methods (minimum norm, minimum slope, and minimum roughness) calculated for all possible points. (The error for the minimum roughness method, as mentioned, is identical to the data set itself.)
[9] To determine these errors, I truncated the data set at each year, starting with the year that is half the filter width after the start of the start of the dataset. Then I calculated the value for the final year of the truncated data set using each of the different methods, and compared it to the actual average for that year obtained from the full data set. I am using a 41-year Gaussian average as my averaging method, but the underlying procedure and its results are applicable to any other smoothing method. I have used the same dataset as Mann, the Northern Hemisphere mean annual surface temperature time series of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia   [Jones et al., 1999], available at http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/ftpdata/tavenh2v.dat.
Figure 2. Errors in the final data point resulting from different methods of treating the end conditions. The “minimum roughness” method error for the dataset truncated at any given year is the same as the data point for that year.
3. Applications
[10] The size of the errors of the three methods relative to the smoothed line can be seen in the graph, and the minimum slope method is clearly superior for this data set. This is verified by taking the standard deviation of each method’s point-by-point distance from the actual average. Minimum roughness has the greatest deviation from the average, a standard deviation of 0.110 degrees. The minimum norm method has a standard deviation of 0.065 degrees from the actual average, while the minimum slope’s standard deviation is the smallest at 0.048.
[11] Knowing how far the last point in the average of the truncated data wanders from the actual average allows us to put an error bar on the final point of our average. Here are the three methods, each with their associated error bar (all error bars in this paper show 3 standard deviations, and are slightly offset horizontally from the final data point for clarity).
Figure 3. Potential errors at the end of the dataset resulting from different methods of treating the end conditions. Error bars represent 3 standard deviations. The minimum slope constraint yields the smallest error for this dataset.
[12] Note that these error bars are not centered vertically on the final data point of each of the series. This is because, in addition to knowing the standard deviation of the error of each end condition, we also know the average of each error. Looking at Fig. 2, for example, we can see that the minimum norm end condition on average runs lower than the true Gaussian average. Knowing this, we can improve our estimate of the error of the final point. In this dataset, the centre of the confidence limits for the minimum norm will be higher than the final point by the amount of the average error.
3.1 Loess and Lowess Smoothing
[13] This dataset is regular, with a data point for each year in the series. When data is not regular but has gaps, loess or lowess smoothing is often used. These are similar to Gaussian smoothing, but use a window that encompasses a certain number of data points, rather than a certain number of years.
[14] When the data is evenly spaced, both lowess and loess smoothing yield very similar results to Gaussian smoothing. However, the treatment of the final data points is different from the method used in Gaussian smoothing. With loess and lowess smoothing, rather than using less and less data as in Gaussian smoothing, the filter window stays the same width (in this case 41 years). However, the shape of the curve of the weights changes as the data nears the end.
[15] The errors of the loess and lowess averaging can be calculated in the same way as before, by truncating the dataset at each year of the data and plotting the value of the final data point. Fig. 4 shows the errors of the two methods.
Figure 4. Lowess and loess smoothing along with their associated end condition errors.
[16] The end condition errors for lowess and loess are quite different, but the average size of the errors is quite similar. Lowess has a standard deviation of .062 from the lowess smoothed data, and loess has a standard deviation of .061 from the loess smoothed data. Fig 5 shows the Gaussian minimum slope (the least error of the three M2004 end conditions), and the lowess and loess smoothings, with their associated error bars.
Figure 5. Gaussian, lowess and loess smoothing along with their associated error bars. Both lowess and loess have larger errors than the Gaussian minimum slope error.
  [17] Of the methods tested so far, the error results are as follows:
METHOD                      Standard Deviation of Error

Gaussian Minimum Roughness            0.111

Gaussian Minimum Norm                 0.065

Lowess                                0.062

Loess                                 0.061Gaussian Minimum Slope                0.048
[18] Experimentally, therefore, we have determined that of these methods, for this data set, the Gaussian minimum slope method gives us the best estimate of the smoothed curve which we will find once we have enough additional years of data to determine the actual shape of the curve for the final years of data.
3.2 Improved and Alternate Methods
[19] At least one better method of dealing with the end conditions exists. I call it the “minimum assumptions” method, as it makes no assumptions about the future state of the data. It simply increases the result of the Gaussian smoothing by an amount equal to the weight of the missing data. Gaussian smoothing works by multiplying each data point within the filter width by a Gaussian weight. This weight is greatest for the central point of the filter, and decreases in a Gaussian “bell-shaped” curve for points further and further away from the central point. The weights are chosen so that the total of the weights summed across the width of the filter adds up to 1.
[20] Let us suppose that as the center of the filter approaches the end of the dataset, the final two weights do not have data associated with them because they are beyond the end of the dataset. The Gaussian average is calculated in the usual manner, by multiplying each data point with its associated weight and summing the weighted data. The final two points, of course, do not contribute to the total, as they have no data associated with them.
[21] However, we know the total of the weights for the other data points. Normally, all of the weights would add up to 1, but as we approach the end of the data there are missing data points within the filter width. Their total of the existing data points might only be say 0.95, instead of 1. Knowing that we only have 95% of the correct weight, we can approximate the correct total by dividing the sum of the existing weighted data points by 0.95. The net effect of this is a shifted weighting which, as the final data point is approached, shifts the center of the weighting function further and further forwards toward the final data point.
[22] The standard deviation of the error of the minimum slope method, calculated earlier, was 0.048. The standard deviation of the error of the minimum assumptions method is 0.046. This makes it, for this data set, the most accurate of the methods tested. Fig. 6 shows of the difference between these two methods at the end of the data set.

Figure 6. Gaussian minimum slope and minimum assumptions error bars. The minimum assumptions method provides the better estimate of the future smoothed curve.
[23] We can also improve upon an existing method. The obvious candidate for improvement is the minimum norm method. It has been calculated by padding the data with the average of the full dataset, from the start to the end of the data. However, we can choose an alternate interval on which to take our average. We can calculate (over most of the dataset) the error resulting from any given choice of interval. This allows us to choose the particular interval that will minimize the error. For the dataset in question, this turns out to be padding the end of the dataset with the average of the previous 5 years of data. Fig 7 shows the individual errors from this method, compared with the minimum assumptions method. Since the results from the two very different methods are quite similar, this increases confidence in the conclusion that these are the best of the alternatives.
Figure 7. Smoothed data (red), minimum assumptions errors (green), tuned minimum norm (previous 5 year average) errors (blue)
[24] The standard deviation of the error from the minimum norm with a 5-year average is slightly smaller than from the minimum assumptions method, 0.045 versus 0.046.
4. Discussion
[25] I have presented a method for experimentally determining which of a number of methods yields the closest approximation to a given smoothing of a dataset at the ends of the dataset. The method can be used with most smoothing filters (Gaussian, loess, low-pass, Butterworth, or other filter). The method also experimentally determines the average error and the standard deviation of the error of the last point of the dataset. Although the Tuned Minimum Norm method yields the best results for this dataset, this does not mean that it will give the best results for other datasets. It also does not mean that the Tuned Minimum Norm method is the best smoothing method possible; there may be other smoothing methods out there, known or unknown, which will give a better result on a given dataset.
[26] The method for experimentally determining the smoothing method with the smallest end point error is as follows:
1)  For each data point for which all of the data is available to determine the exact smoothed average, determine the smoothed result which would be obtained by each candidate method if that data point were the final point of the data. (While this can be done by truncating the data at each point, padding the data if required, and calculating the result, it is much quicker to use a modified smoothing function which simply treats each data point as if it were the last point of the dataset and applies the required padding.)
2)  For each of these data points, subtract the actual smoothed result of the given filter at that point from the smoothed result of treating that point as if it were the final point. This gives the error of the smoothing method for the series if it were truncated at that data point.
3)  Take the average and the standard deviation of all of the errors obtained by this analysis.
4)  Use the standard deviation of these errors to determine the best smoothing method.
5)  Use the average and the standard deviation of these errors to establish confidence limits at the final point of the smoothed data.
5. Conclusions
1)  The Minimum Roughness method will always yield the largest standard deviation of the end point error in relation to the smoothed data, and is thus the worst method to choose.
2)  For any given data set, the best method can be chosen by selecting the method with the smallest standard deviation of error as measured on the dataset itself.
3)  The use of an error bar at the end of the smoothed average allows us to gauge the reliability of the smoothed average as it reaches the end of the data set.

I had to laugh at this statement from the press release below:
“What we found is that during several recent extreme weather events these planetary waves almost freeze in their tracks for weeks.”
Gosh,”frozen patterns” like Rex blocks have been known for decades.Wikipedia has a good summary:
Blocks in meteorology are large-scale patterns in the atmospheric pressure field that are nearly stationary, effectively “blocking” or redirecting migratory cyclones. They are also known as blocking highs or blocking anticyclones. These blocks can remain in place for several days or even weeks, causing the areas affected by them to have the same kind of weather for an extended period of time (e.g. precipitation for some areas, clear skies for others).[2] In the Northern Hemisphere, extended blocking occurs most frequently in the spring over the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
NCAR also has a good explanation of it here. An example: – NOAA on the Russian heat wave of 2010:
The heat wave was due primarily to a natural phenomenon called an atmospheric “blocking pattern”, in which a strong high pressure system developed and remained stationary over western Russia…”
One of the hottest summers the USA ever experienced in 1936 was due to a blocking high:



The 1936 blocking ridge happened several times in that year & had occurred in 1934, as well.  By comparison, record-breaking warmth occurred in March 1986, only to return in mid April with 88-93 setting records. – See more at: http://blogs.wlfi.com/2012/03/20/55894/#sthash.7p8c5pWX.dpuf
Now, according to PIK, suddenly such atmospheric blocks are caused by “climate change”. What a load of tosh. Thank our old alarmist buddy Hans Joachim Schellnhuber for turning mundane meteorology into something sinister.
Weather extremes provoked by trapping of giant waves in the atmosphere
02/2572013 – The world has suffered from severe regional weather extremes in recent years, such as the heat wave in the United States in 2011 or the one in Russia 2010 coinciding with the unprecedented Pakistan flood. Behind these devastating individual events there is a common physical cause, propose scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). The study will be published this week in the US Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and suggests that man-made climate change repeatedly disturbs the patterns of atmospheric flow around the globe’s Northern hemisphere through a subtle resonance mechanism.

“An important part of the global air motion in the mid-latitudes of the Earth normally takes the form of waves wandering around the planet, oscillating between the tropical and the Arctic regions. So when they swing up, these waves suck warm air from the tropics to Europe, Russia, or the US, and when they swing down, they do the same thing with cold air from the Arctic,” explains lead author Vladimir Petoukhov.
“What we found is that during several recent extreme weather events these planetary waves almost freeze in their tracks for weeks. So instead of bringing in cool air after having brought warm air in before, the heat just stays. In fact, we observe a strong amplification of the usually weak, slowly moving component of these waves,” says Petoukhov. Time is critical here: two or three days of 30 degrees Celsius are no problem, but twenty or more days lead to extreme heat stress. Since many ecosystems and cities are not adapted to this, prolonged hot periods can result in a high death toll, forest fires, and dramatic harvest losses.
Anomalous surface temperatures are disturbing the air flows
Climate change caused by greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil-fuel burning does not mean uniform global warming – in the Arctic, the relative increase of temperatures, amplified by the loss of snow and ice, is higher than on average. This in turn reduces the temperature difference between the Arctic and, for example, Europe, yet temperature differences are a main driver of air flow. Additionally, continents generally warm and cool more readily than the oceans. “These two factors are crucial for the mechanism we detected,” says Petoukhov. “They result in an unnatural pattern of the mid-latitude air flow, so that for extended periods the slow synoptic waves get trapped.”
The authors of the study developed equations that describe the wave motions in the extra-tropical atmosphere and show under what conditions those waves can grind to a halt and get amplified. They tested their assumptions using standard daily weather data from the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). During recent periods in which several major weather extremes occurred, the trapping and strong amplification of particular waves – like “wave seven” (which has seven troughs and crests spanning the globe) – was indeed observed. The data show an increase in the occurrence of these specific atmospheric patterns, which is statistically significant at the 90 percent confidence level.
The probability of extremes increases – but other factors come in as well
“Our dynamical analysis helps to explain the increasing number of novel weather extremes. It complements previous research that already linked such phenomena to climate change, but did not yet identify a mechanism behind it,” says Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, director of PIK and co-author of the study. “This is quite a breakthrough, even though things are not at all simple – the suggested physical process increases the probability of weather extremes, but additional factors certainly play a role as well, including natural variability.” Also, the 32-year period studied in the project provides a good indication of the mechanism involved, yet is too short for definite conclusions.
Nevertheless, the study significantly advances the understanding of the relation between weather extremes and man-made climate change. Scientists were surprised by how far outside past experience some of the recent extremes have been. The new data show that the emergence of extraordinary weather is not just a linear response to the mean warming trend, and the proposed mechanism could explain that.

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is making a working or “no frills” trip to Washington. It’s a chance for him to meet President Donald Trump as they discuss what the White House calls “common priorities.” And the premier has business to conduct, including expressing his concern over proposals to restrict use of H-1B visas, which have brought many Indian professionals to America.



Some observers have highlighted similarities between the two leaders, including their nationalist/​populist message. Both emphasize business and jobs but neither believes in free markets. Both benefited from a surge in support from religious voters, though the faiths differ. Finally, critics tagged both as potential strongmen. However, PM Modi appears measurably stronger politically.



Indeed, the latter is the far more practiced politician. He led the state government of Gujarat and Bharatiya Janata Party before taking over as premier after the BJP’s overwhelming victory in 2014. The party did well last March in state elections, though it won outright only in the super‐​state of Uttar Pradesh. Still, the BJP far out‐​classed the once ruling Congress Party with a campaign that transcended caste politics, embraced Hindu nationalism, and relied on grassroots activism. PM Modi appears well‐​positioned for a repeat national victory when elections are held in two years.



Under him India has become more active internationally. New Delhi gloried in its role as a member of the “nonaligned bloc” during the Cold War. Now the bipolar world is gone and India is wealthier and ready for global leadership. President George W. Bush initiated a significant improvement in U.S.-India relations, hoping to develop New Delhi as a counterweight to China’s growing influence.



Although India has no desire to be the catspaw of Washington or anyone else, it is a natural rival to the People’s Republic of China. Their relationship remains marred by a territorial dispute that sparked a short war a half century ago. Even before the U.S.-New Delhi rapprochement, India was active economically in Burma when Western sanctions had given the PRC a near monopoly and the Indian navy was patrolling waters in Southeast Asia where local forces were dwarfed by China’s forces.



The Obama administration continued to promote good relations, as should the Trump administration, despite some concerns in New Delhi created by the president’s criticisms of the Paris climate change treaty and H-1B visas. Hopefully tonight’s White House dinner will smooth any ruffled feathers. President Trump’s apparent choice for U.S. ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, currently serving on the National Economic Council, also should be a positive influence given his extensive experience with India. There are several areas for fruitful cooperation, including economic. U.S. officials have suggested the possibility of negotiating a free trade agreement. No formal alliance is needed; a friendly, prosperous, and democratic India naturally serves the balance of power.



It perhaps has become an international cliché, but India should follow China down the path of sustained high economic growth. With a growth rate of 7.9 percent in 2015 India has been growing faster than the PRC. Last year the International Monetary Fund forecast continued expansion above seven percent annually in coming years. Many of India’s fundamentals look solid. Inflation remains modest. India’s population is likely to surpass China’s and the McKinsey Global Institute predicted that India’s “consuming class” will triple in size over the coming decade. Entry of more women into the workforce affords India another important growth opportunity. Moreover, India’s “country risk” is below that of China, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. Indeed, New Delhi enjoys a clear though hard to quantify advantage from democracy: Indian politics is messy, but offers a critical pressure valve lacking in the Chinese political system.



Yet there are worrisome signs that India may fall short of its potential. Some growth fundamentals remain weak. For instance, government spending rather than private investment has been driving the economy. The drop in oil prices also spurred recent growth; no similar stimulus is likely in the near future. Per capita GDP increases have not kept up. Job creation also has disappointed. HDFC Bank warned of a “growing disconnect between economic growth, education, skills and jobs.”



A number of companies fear the future. Business confidence, along with sales growth and capacity utilization, are down. In March the _Economist_ reported that “firms are busy cutting back investment as if mired in recession. Bank lending to industry, growth in which once reached 30 percent a year, is shrinking for the first time in over two decades.”





India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is making a working or ‘no frills’ trip to Washington.



Even the information technology sector is suffering. The Modi government had hoped to expand India’s success in information technology, proposing to wire every village as part of the “Digital India” plan. But layoffs have hit the IT sector, which currently accounts for nearly ten percent of India’s GDP. Kris Lakshmikanth, who runs Head Hunters India, said that “For the first time, companies are touching middle management.” The industry, which provides two‐​thirds of world IT out‐​sourcing, also faces foreign pressure. A related threat from President Trump is limiting use of H-1B visas, available for more highly skilled workers.



The national government has a debt to GDP ratio of 67 percent, among the highest in Asia; the 2018 deficit will be about 3.2 percent. State debt also has been increasing sharply, up from two percent of GDP in 2012 to about three percent now. Annual state deficits run about 2.5 percent of GDP. The combined national‐​state deficit is burdensome 5.7 percent of GDP.



Earlier this year states began writing off agricultural debts. In Uttar Pradesh the victorious BJP promised to waive $5.6 billion in small farmers’ loans. Farmers across the nation then demanded the same treatment. The likely result is a $40 billion write‐​off, about two percent of GDP. (The then‐​ruling Congress party took a similar step in 2008, at a cost of 1.8 percent of GDP.)



Still, the most serious barrier to an Indian economic take‐​off is India’s government, both national and state. Around the world—India’s diaspora numbers some 30 million—ethnic Indians are traders. But not in India. New Delhi and numerous state capitals simply smothered the natural entrepreneurship of the Indian people.



Collectivist, dirigiste economics reigned. The state dominated the economy’s commanding heights, imposed confiscatory tax rates, created a “License Raj” to micro‐​manage private industry, and enforced its dictates through a bureaucracy rated the worst in Asia. Even as the famed “Tigers” of Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and eventually China raced ahead, India languished. As late as 1983 the poverty rate was an astounding 60 percent.



Meaningful reform finally came in 1991. Although the changes were sharply limited compared to what needed to be done, they were a dramatic advance over the past. Average incomes doubled within a decade and tens of millions of Indians escaped poverty. But people hoped for so much more while New Delhi again fell behind. For instance, in the 2014 _Economic Freedom of the World_ rating, India had dropped to 112 from 102 the year before. Explained Swaminathan S. Anklesaria Aiyar in a Cato Institute study, “Although many old controls have been abolished, many still continue, and a plethora of new controls have been created.”



Expectations were great when PM Modi took over, given his pro‐​business rhetoric and positive record in Gujarat. And his government has some solid achievements, despite lacking control of the upper house, which allowed the opposition to block some measures. Modi’s administration streamlined the goods and services tax (GST), implemented a new bankruptcy code, eased restrictions on foreign investment, limited spending, eliminated capital and certification requirements barriers for business, accelerated environmental approvals, and improved public administration and infrastructure. Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General of the Confederation of Indian Industry, praised the “impressive agenda of innovative economic reforms and social programs that have positively impacted growth.”



However, some of the premier’s supporters have been disappointed, given the magnitude of the changes yet needed. For example, Shankar Acharya, a columnist for New Delhi’s _Business Standard_ , worried: “Economic reforms have clearly lost momentum and there is a sense of drift in economic policy.” The _Times of India_ editorialized that “the government hasn’t pressed the pedal hard on reforms” and “implementation of projects” has been slow. The _Economist_ saw a cavalcade of mini‐​initiatives rather than a serious reform program.



Despite BJP rule, the 2017 _Index of Economic Freedom_ rated India at only 143 of 180 countries. In contrast, China stood at 111. Moreover, New Delhi’s rating _fell_ from the year before. India performed particularly poorly on business freedom, financial freedom, government integrity, investment freedom, judicial effectiveness, and labor freedom.



PM Modi’s ability to effect change will improve as the BJP makes additional gains in parliament’s upper chamber. However, the premier is more like Donald Trump than Ronald Reagan, to whom he was originally compared, in that he believes in managed rather than free markets. In fact, the BJP has, in the words of the Carnegie Endowment’s Milan Vaishnav, a “nationalist, protectionist wing” with which President Trump would be comfortable. Moreover, despite PM Modi’s dominating role, he “seems stuck in the mindset of a provincial executive: he is more interested in projects than in policies; he is a modernizer, not a reformer,” observed Sebastian Mallaby of the Council on Foreign Relations. The _Economist_ similarly termed the premier “a fine administrator but not much of a reformer.”



The government often has manipulated rather than freed the market. For instance, New Delhi imposed agricultural prices controls and criticized “hoarding,” Officials also have discussed recreating state monopolies in “strategic” economic sectors, Particularly harmful was last November’s currency “reform,” by which 86 percent of the nation’s currency was demonetized without an adequate number of new bills available. The result was chaos for all and ruin for some, particularly small, cash‐​based businesses. Currency shortages in ATMs persisted until last month. Saurabh Mukherjea of Ambit Capital described demonetization “as the economic equivalent of a heart attack.”



PM Modi moderated the political blowback by playing the populist card, arguing that the program was necessary to tame the rich and stop corruption. But whatever the economic justification for moving the economy away from a disproportionate reliance on cash, the government appeared motivated more by the desire to bring the nation’s finances under its control. The botched swap probably accounted at least partly for the lower annualized growth of 6.1 percent during the first quarter of this year, below the rate when PM Modi took office. And the impact could last for some time.



The premier should shift course and use his authority, strengthened by the March elections, to accelerate reforms. Much could be done to liberalize markets, encourage entrepreneurship, ease business creation, and spur employment. For instance, Cornell’s Eswar Prasad of Cornell advocated “reducing labor regulations, unshackling businesses from red tape and bureaucracy, reducing government control of banks and clearing up their bad loans, developing capital markets, revamping the government’s tax and expenditure systems and improving infrastructure.”



Of particular concern, the rules governing business hiring and firing greatly increase costs, discouraging job creation. Employment actually has fallen in these areas, while growth has been limited primarily to uncovered industries. Regulated companies tend to stay small and rely on temporary labor. India hosts only 270 firms with sales above $125 million, compared to 7,680 in China. Nine out of ten jobs come from the informal sector. This system has greatly hindered development of a competitive manufacturing industry, like that in China. India’s abundant human resources are being squandered.



Government enterprises are used to provide jobs. Even in a good economy losses are routine. Firms that make money usually rely on government monopolies or other special privileges. Air India loses more money the more it flies. Overall, parastatals lose billions of dollars a year. They survive only at extraordinary public cost: “soft loans, subsidies, and bail‐​outs keep them afloat,” observed the _Economist_.



State banks are loaded with bad debts which McKinsey & Co. figures exceed the banks’ total value. Government “services” are a scandal. Said Aiyar, “With almost no exceptions, the delivery of government services in India is pathetic, from the police and judiciary to education and health.” Many teachers in public schools don’t even bother to come to class. Lawsuits can take decades to resolve: the legal system has a backlog of 31.5 million cases.



PM Modi also should avoid the temptation to inflame Hindu nationalism to win votes. Religious intolerance and persecution have worsened since his 2014 victory. Vigilantism has been rising, especially against Muslims accused of trafficking in beef. Yet after the BJP’s victory in Uttar Pradesh he appointed as chief minister a Hindu priest once jailed for his violent rhetorical attacks on Muslims. Even if such tactics yield short‐​term political benefits, they risk not only social conflict but economic harm, discouraging foreign investment and trade which would benefit all Indians.



Just as the world spent decades waiting for China to escape Mao Zedong’s communist madness, so, too, has the world spent decades waiting for India to leave behind Jawaharlal Nehru’s socialist nostrums. PM Modi offers competent management and has moved his country closer to economic freedom. But getting the rest of the way requires freeing India’s people from the shackles created by government social and economic engineers. Ethnic Indians have proved their economic prowess around the globe. Now they need the chance to do so at home.



It is good for the prime minister to visit America early during the two leaders’ joint tenure. Although no one knows how two such egos that have climbed the political mountains in their respective nations will get along, Narendra Modi is a worthy partner for Donald Trump. Both have succeeded in tough political systems and overcome harsh opposition. And both have a unique opportunity to transform their respective nations, and ultimately the world. Working together they are more likely to succeed in doing so, and for the better.

"WASHINGTON  —   The Justice Department on Monday evening urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump’s targeted travel ban, saying immediate action was needed to ensure the nation’s safety. The administration’s brief was the last in a series of urgent pleas to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which is now set to rule on the most ambitious and disruptive initiative of Mr. Trump’s young presidency. The ruling will almost certainly be followed by an appeal to the Supreme Court. The court scheduled an hourlong oral argument for Tuesday. That gives at least another day of reprieve to foreign visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, as well as other immigrants, who initially were blocked from entering the United States by Mr. Trump’s order. The administration’s brief largely tracked its earlier arguments that dismissing the ban outright would threaten national security and disregard presidential authority. But it also asked the appeals court, at a minimum, to reinstate at least part of Mr. Trump’s order  —   appearing to acknowledge the possibility that the government’s case might not be successful. “At most,” the brief said, the court order blocking the ban should be limited to “previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future. ” That would allow the federal government to block people who have never visited the United States. On Monday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the administration stood ready to reinstate the entire ban. “Once we win the case, it will go right back into action,” he said. Later on Monday night, Mr. Trump called threats “from radical Islamic terrorism is very real. ” “Courts must act fast!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. Trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump’s executive order, which suspended travel from the seven countries and limited the nation’s refugee program, but none of those cases have reached an appeals court. And none of the   rulings were as broad as the one under review in the case, State of Washington v. Trump. The Ninth Circuit scheduled the oral argument in the case for Tuesday at 3 p. m. Pacific time. It is to take place by telephone, and the court said it would be   on its website. Holding an oral argument by telephone in a major case is unusual. The case will be heard by Judge William C. Canby Jr. appointed by President Jimmy Carter Judge Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama and Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush. At issue is the earlier ruling, by Judge James L. Robart, a federal judge in Seattle, that blocked the key parts of Mr. Trump’s executive order. Judge Robart’s ruling allowed immigrants and travelers who had been barred from entry to come to the United States, and it inspired a harsh attack from Mr. Trump, who accused the judge of endangering national security. On Saturday, the administration asked the Ninth Circuit for an immediate administrative stay of Judge Robart’s ruling without hearing from the plaintiffs, the States of Washington and Minnesota. The court declined, instead asking for more briefs. Opponents of Mr. Trump’s targeted travel ban made three kinds of arguments in their submissions to the appeals court, saying that the ban is unlawful, that it represents bad   policy, and that it is a threat to the nation’s economy. A brief from Washington and Minnesota, filed early Monday morning, said that “President Trump unleashed chaos by signing the executive order. ” Fifteen states and the District of Columbia  —   including New York, California, Massachusetts and Virginia  —   filed a supporting brief to argue that allowing the ban to stand would “cause harm to the states, including to state institutions such as public universities, to the businesses that sustain our economies, and to our residents. ” In a brief filed Saturday, the Trump administration argued that Judge Robart’s order would cause irreparable harm to national security. In response, lawyers for Washington and Minnesota said that was not plausible, because it would mean the nation had long been suffering “some unspecified, ongoing irreparable harm. ” “That makes no sense,” the brief said. “As this court has held, preserving the status quo against sudden disruption is often in the interest of all parties. ” On Monday, the Trump administration responded that the states were asking the courts “to take the extraordinary step of   a formal   judgment made by the president himself pursuant to broad grants of statutory authority. ” In its earlier brief, the Trump administration urged the Ninth Circuit to reject arguments based on religious discrimination, even though Mr. Trump has said he meant to favor Christian refugees. Judicial consideration of the president’s motives, the administration’s brief said, would violate the separation of powers. The states responded that “courts have both the right and the duty to examine defendants’ true motives. ” They added that the administration had taken “a dizzying number of positions” on whether the executive order applied to permanent residents holding green cards. The order itself appears to cover such people, but the administration has said it will not enforce that part of the order. Questions about permanent residents are not moot, the states’ brief said, as the administration could again change positions. Several former diplomatic and national security officials filed a declaration making a second kind of argument. “We view the order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,” it said. “In our professional opinion, this order cannot be justified on national security or foreign policy grounds. ” The officials filing the declaration included John Kerry, a secretary of state under Mr. Obama Madeleine K. Albright, who held the same position under President Bill Clinton Susan E. Rice, Mr. Obama’s national security adviser and Leon E. Panetta, secretary of defense and director of the C. I. A. under Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump’s order, the officials said, would endanger American troops and intelligence sources, disrupt counterterrorism and law enforcement efforts, damage the economy and have “a devastating humanitarian impact. ” “And apart from all of these concerns,” the former officials said, “the order offends our nation’s laws and values. ” The third front in the legal battle against Mr. Trump’s order was opened by the technology industry and other businesses. Almost 100 companies, including Apple, Facebook and Google, urged the Ninth Circuit to continue to block the order, saying it “harms the competitiveness of U. S. companies. ” The “instability and uncertainty” created by the order, the brief said, “will make it far more difficult and expensive for U. S. companies to hire some of the world’s best talent  —   and impede them from competing in the global marketplace. ”"
"The importance of clearly communicating science to the public should not be underestimated. Accurately understanding our natural environment and sharing that information can be a matter of life or death. When it comes to global warming, much of the public remains in denial about a set of facts that the majority of scientists clearly agree on. With such high stakes, an organised campaign funding misinformation ought to be considered criminally negligent. The earthquake that rocked L'Aquila Italy in 2009 provides an interesting case study of botched communication. This natural disaster left more than 300 people dead and nearly 66,000 people homeless. In a strange turn of events six Italian scientists and a local defence minister were subsequently sentenced to six years in prison. The ruling is popularly thought to have convicted scientists for failing to predict an earthquake. On the contrary, as risk assessment expert David Ropeik pointed out, the trial was actually about the failure of scientists to clearly communicate risks to the public. The convicted parties were accused of providing “inexact, incomplete and contradictory information”. As one citizen stated:  We all know that the earthquake could not be predicted, and that evacuation was not an option. All we wanted was clearer information on risks in order to make our choices. Crucially, the scientists, when consulted about ongoing tremors in the region, did not conclude that a devastating earthquake was impossible in L’Aquila. But, when the Defence Minister held a press conference saying there was no danger, they made no attempt to correct him. I don’t believe poor scientific communication should be criminalised because doing so will likely discourage scientists from engaging with the public at all.  But the tragedy in L’Aquila reminds us how important clear scientific communication is and how much is at stake regarding the public’s understanding of science. I have argued elsewhere that scientists have an ethical obligation to communicate their findings as clearly as possible to the public when such findings are relevant to public policy. Likewise, I believe that scientists have the corollary obligation to correct public misinformation as visibly and unequivocally as possible.  Many scientists recognize these civic and moral obligations. Climatologist Michael Mann is a good example; Mann has recently made the case for public engagement in a powerful New York Times opinion piece: If You See Something Say Something. Still, critics of the case in L’Aquila are mistaken if they conclude that criminal negligence should never be linked to science misinformation. Consider cases in which science communication is intentionally undermined for political and financial gain. Imagine if in L’Aquila, scientists themselves had made every effort to communicate the risks of living in an earthquake zone. Imagine that they even advocated for a scientifically informed but costly earthquake readiness plan.  If those with a financial or political interest in inaction had funded an organised campaign to discredit the consensus findings of seismology, and for that reason no preparations were made, then many of us would agree that the financiers of the denialist campaign were criminally responsible for the consequences of that campaign. I submit that this is just what is happening with the current, well documented funding of global warming denialism. More deaths can already be attributed to climate change than the L’Aquila earthquake and we can be certain that deaths from climate change will continue to rise with global warming. Nonetheless, climate denial remains a serious deterrent against meaningful political action in the very countries most responsible for the crisis. We have good reason to consider the funding of climate denial to be criminally and morally negligent. The charge of criminal and moral negligence ought to extend to all activities of the climate deniers who receive funding as part of a sustained campaign to undermine the public’s understanding of scientific consensus.  Criminal negligence is normally understood to result from failures to avoid reasonably foreseeable harms, or the threat of harms to public safety, consequent of certain activities. Those funding climate denial campaigns can reasonably predict the public’s diminished ability to respond to climate change as a result of their behaviour. Indeed, public uncertainty regarding climate science, and the resulting failure to respond to climate change, is the intentional aim of politically and financially motivated denialists. My argument probably raises an understandable, if misguided, concern regarding free speech. We must make the critical distinction between the protected voicing of one’s unpopular beliefs, and the funding of a strategically organised campaign to undermine the public’s ability to develop and voice informed opinions. Protecting the latter as a form of free speech stretches the definition of free speech to a degree that undermines the very concept. What are we to make of those behind the well documented corporate funding of global warming denial? Those who purposefully strive to make sure “inexact, incomplete and contradictory information” is given to the public? I believe we understand them correctly when we know them to be not only corrupt and deceitful, but criminally negligent in their willful disregard for human life. It is time for modern societies to interpret and update their legal systems accordingly. "
"Energy secretary Ed Davey has finally recognised that the take-up of Green Deal financing was “disappointing”, and the latest figures show how much it is flagging. But Davey analysis of the scheme shows the government is still missing the point when it comes to helping the public reduce their energy consumption. In order to be credible, the Green Deal must be promoted in local communities from the bottom up. The Green Deal is a government-backed loan scheme aiming to help people lower their domestic energy consumption. While something like 150,000 assessments (which cost between £100 and £150) have been undertaken since the Green Deal was launched in December 2012, fewer than 1,000 of these assessments have been converted into work actually being done.  Davey offered three reasons for the Green Deal’s lack of success: that it is “too clunky and too complex”, not sufficiently “consumer friendly” and that the online experience of the Green Deal is disjointed. Davey’s shadow counterpart, Caroline Flint, took the opportunity to offer her own interpretation of the Green Deal’s failure: “With sky-high interest rates, hidden charges and penalty payments it’s no surprise that so few people have taken out a green deal plan.” But evidence gathered by our research team strongly suggests both Davey and Flint are missing a key reason for the low take-up of the Green Deal offer: it needs to be promoted from a grassroots level. Our Reducing Energy Consumption through Community Knowledge Networks (RECCKN) project spent the past two years working with households in the Midlands. We analysed how people find out about reducing their energy consumption and aimed to improve the circulation of this knowledge.  We found that householders get their knowledge about energy saving from a variety of sources. People mentioned newspapers, the internet, leaflets through the door, advertisements on television and friends and family, among other sources.  When these sources were ranked for trustworthiness, the results were striking. Virtually without exception, the least trusted sources of information were those involving large commercial organisations, such as the so-called Big Six energy companies. In contrast, the most trusted sources were friends and family, and local companies with which respondents had had some positive interaction in the past. These findings suggest it’s not only suspicions about interest rates, hidden charges, penalty payments and complexity that have rendered the Green Deal ineffective, but the very way in which it has been rolled out. In common with many government initiatives, it’s been a top down affair. But what our project observed was that people are much more likely to take action once an initiative is validated by individuals and organisations they know and trust. We made this discovery virtually by accident. To find out where people got their energy-saving information from, we set up a number of focus groups in the four communities with which we were working. Once people were gathered together with a cup of tea, a piece of cake or perhaps a glass of wine in front of them, they began to talk about energy saving strategies with each other, virtually unbidden.  As confidence and trust in each other began to increase, it became clear that in setting up these groups we had created a public space in which energy had become “discussable”. As our respondents told us, energy saving is not a normal topic for conversation, and yet the animated discussions which we had set in train showed that it was a conversation that people wanted to have. One commented that “a face-to-face sharing of tips and ideas is really useful”. A second effect of these face-to-face conversations was the confidence people developed in their own knowledge about energy saving. Information they might once have regarded as irrelevant or incomplete turned into important and usable knowledge as they exchanged it with other people around the table. Far from being the empty vessels assumed by government information campaigns, people are repositories of refined, subtle, and above all trusted, experience-based knowledge. The next step for our participants was to take this knowledge out into their communities. Each of the four groups designed an “intervention”, ranging from an energy question time, to an insert in the local community Christmas newsletter, to an energy coffee morning and a stall at the town’s Christmas fair. Crucially, these were all run by local community members themselves.  Given what they had discovered about trust, they decided firmly against including any commercial representation in their interventions. Based on what we have discovered, a more effective Green Deal roll-out would have started from the bottom rather than the top. But we are where we are, and our recommendation now would be to channel some of the huge amounts of money being spent on the Green Deal into the creation of local energy discussion groups. These won’t happen on their own and our findings suggest that if they were set up by commercial companies or even by local government, they would not be successful.  Universities, local community groups, non-governmental organisations, and charities were widely regarded by our participants as honest brokers. These organisations should therefore be used more to facilitate discussions about energy. The list of community energy projects that have recently won funding from the Department for Energy and Climate Change is a positive move in this direction. They show how social action can help people reduce their energy consumption. Commercial interest is conspicuously absent and community forums, social enterprises and local volunteers seem to be at the fore.  As our project shows, making energy discussable is a low-cost and low-tech approach to effectively saving energy, with the enormous added benefit of increasing people’s self-confidence."
"**England has exited lockdown but for nearly all the country, Wednesday marks just a small step back towards normality.**
With the exception of Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly, strict restrictions mean people's lives are being curtailed.
A crucial factor - ministers have argued - is that the NHS risks being overwhelmed without the tough curbs on freedoms. But is this really true?
A quick glance at the latest data on hospital beds shows there were nearly 13,000 beds free at the end of November.
That's 50% more than last winter.
There are also several thousand beds available in private hospitals that the NHS has paid for until the end of the year that could be used for non-Covid patients.
It means, in theory, there are enough beds available to cope with a doubling of Covid patients - there are currently about 14,000 in hospital.
In practice, the NHS is meant to keep at least a tenth of its beds free to create flexibility to admit patients and cope with surges in demand.
It also allows time for cleaning and infection control - something that is, of course, particularly important during a pandemic.
In fact, the need for social distancing and infection control has meant hospitals have had to be reconfigured significantly, leading to 13,000 beds being lost from the system.
What is more, the pressures are not felt evenly around the country.
The past few months have been marked by individual hospitals getting dangerously close to full, with some reporting more than a quarter of beds occupied by Covid patients.
But the flip side of that is that some are not. Explaining why he was voting against the new tiers, Tim Loughton, the Tory MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, said his hospital had just four Covid patients.
These differences matter. Hospital capacity is one of the five key tests for working out which tier local areas are in.
While doing this, the NHS is playing a juggling act. In the spring, a lot of planned work, including some cancer care, was cancelled.
The decision was taken because of the fear that hospitals could be completely overwhelmed. But it meant significant numbers of beds were left unused as the data for June in the chart below shows.
But this chart also demonstrates how the NHS has tried to get services back to normal over the summer and autumn with the number of non-Covid patients in hospital (shown in green) climbing.
This is deemed essential because of the growing backlog in numbers waiting for treatment. Macmillan estimates there are more than 40,000 missing cancer patients.
Meanwhile, the numbers waiting over a year for routine treatment, such as knee and hip operations, is at its highest level since 2008.
It is easy to think these sort of treatments can wait. But as Royal College of Surgeons of England president Prof Neil Mortensen says, these are patients whose lives are on hold left waiting ""potentially in pain"".
The desire to keep the non-Covid work going is strong - and when you put this all together, it leaves very little wriggle room.
It means any significant increase in Covid patients above the level seen now has a direct impact on non-Covid care.
All this is being done while staff are exhausted with significant numbers - 30,000 at last count - off work for Covid-related issues.
England has a network of seven field hospitals known as Nightingales. These were built during the spring, again on the assumption that hospitals could become overwhelmed.
One of the challenges the NHS has faced is that it has fewer doctors, nurses and beds per head of population than many other western European countries.
Tory MP John Redwood has been vocal in calling for the Nightingales to be used, accusing those making dire warnings of trying to ""scare"" the public. Between them they could provide care to several thousand patients.
But the problem is they need staff. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, says they were only ever built as an ""insurance policy"" to be used as a last resort if hospitals were overwhelmed.
To open them would mean spreading staff more thinly across hospitals and the Nightingales. That, of course, has consequences for the quality of care. It is the reason why only two have been pressed into action during the second wave.
Stretching the NHS beyond the point it is at currently is certainly possible, but it will have consequences.

Guest post by Dr. Tim Ball
It is important for the person who leaked the emails from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) in November 2009 and 2010 to reveal themselves and release the remaining 200,000 emails. The public are increasingly aware of the inaccurate science and failed projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Those promoting the false science are pushing even harder as they lose ground, but a final disclosure would expose the full extent of the deceptions. This would force leaders to abandon policies already causing serious social and economic harm and develop policies based on proper science.
The IPCC failures are no surprise and inevitable because of the political rather than scientific agenda exposed in the first 6000 emails. Evidence from leaked information from AR5, the next IPCC Report, indicate they have not changed. Equally important, the people involved at the CRU and the IPCC think they’ve escaped responsibility with the release of the Norfolk Police Report. It was the engineered response they wanted and in its own way is deceptive.
On July 18, 2012 the Norfolk Police closed their investigation because of the “Realistic prospect of identifying the offender or offenders and launching criminal proceedings within the time constraints imposed by law”. They also concluded the attack was carried out “remotely via the Internet”, which is not surprising and does not eliminate a whistleblower. 
They further deflected the whistleblower claim saying there is “no evidence to suggest that anyone working at or associated with the University of East Anglia was involved in the crime”. It is very unlikely that a whistleblower would work from within the University and run the risk of easy exposure. Most people working at CRU would likely have external access, so they could continue work at home, or when traveling to the numerous worldwide IPCC climate conferences.
Canadian network engineer Lance Levsen after detailed analysis showed, convincingly, the source was someone within the university. He concluded, “For the hacker to have collected all of this information s/he would have required extraordinary capabilities…to crack an Administrative file server to get to the emails and crack numerous workstations, desktops, and servers to get the documents.” Access to the files is a major hurdle, but once inside there is a bigger challenge. Which files do you select? Whoever released the files knew which ones were significant. This required considerable knowledge of climate science as well as the politics and machinations of the people involved.
A comment posted on Anthony Watt’s web site encapsulates the problem. “It would take a hacker massive amounts of work to parse through decades of emails and files.” The commenter suggested a different scenario that involved hacking a single file. Such a file would exist because of “an ongoing process of internally collating this information for an FOI response is entirely consistent with what we find in the file.” The problem with this argument is that the emails appeared in November 2009, at which time both the CRU and the University of East Anglia were rejecting all FOI requests. In January 2005 Phil Jones “states that he will be using IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) to shelter the data from Freedom of Information requests.” In an email on August 20th 2008, Prof. Jones says “The FOI line we’re all using is this. IPCC is exempt from any countries FOI – the skeptics have been told this. Even though we (MOHC, CRU/UEA) possibly hold relevant info the IPCC is not part our remit (mission statement, aims etc) therefore we don’t have an obligation to pass it on.” It is unlikely anyone did much work preparing files to answer FOI requests. Even if they did, files for an FOI request are different from those required to expose corruption and still required selection.
Levsen reached a solid and logical conclusion “the simplest explanation or strategy tends to be the best one”. “The simplest explanation in this case is that someone at UEA found it and released it to the wild and the release of FOIA2009.zip wasn’t because of some hacker, but because of a leak from UEA by a person with scruples.”
How did the CRU people and others exposed in the emails essentially avoid any accountability? Part was likely due to groupthink defined by Irving Janis. “Groups affected by groupthink ignore alternatives and tend to take irrational actions that dehumanize other groups.  A group is especially vulnerable to groupthink when its members are similar in background, when the group is insulated from outside opinions, and when there are no clear rules for decision-making.” In his Report for a combined Congressional investigative committees on the “hockey stick” Professor Wegman identifies the insulation. “It is important to note the isolation of the paleoclimate community.” Phil Jones said the banter was typical, which is a disturbing and instructive comment in itself.
Every time a serious problem occurred for IPCC official climate science or those promoting it, they hired professional spin doctors. Why do ‘official’ climate scientists need spin doctors? Answer, because they practice politics not science. Climategate, like it’s namesake Watergate, became exposed by the cover up, in this case disgraceful, atypical behavior disclosed in the emails.
After the November 2009 leak the University of East Anglia hired Neil Wallis of Outside Organization to handle the fall out. University spokesperson Trevor Davies said it was a “reputation management” problem, which he claimed they don’t handle well. Apparently they didn’t consider telling the truth. The leaked emails triggered a shock wave that required a top political spin-doctor. Wallis, a former editor at the News of The World, was later arrested in connection with the phone hacking scandals that led to the resignation of London Metropolitan Police Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner, as well as Andy Coulson, Prime Minister Cameron’s press secretary.
CRU Director Phil Jones immediately called in the police, which established the event potentially as a criminal act. This raises the question of what he had to hide. If there was nothing in the files of consequence, then loss of the information had no currency. The British House of Commons’ Science and Technology Committee perpetuated the criminal idea by referring to emails as “stolen” in their whitewash investigation of Jones’ behavior. They didn’t even take testimony from scientists qualified to address the problems with the science, yet still concluded the science was solid.
Terminology used is apparently important and possibly done on advice. Involving the police froze further disclosure of information and created the idea it was a crime. Calling it a theft or a hacking reinforced this with an implication for future legal action. Reportedly, hacked material or stolen information is not admissible in court, unlike information disclosed by a whistleblower.
A special police unit achieved the desired result of letting the investigation drag out past the statute of limitations and then concluded there was no evidence of an inside leak. It is critical to remember the implications went beyond the CRU because its members dominated and controlled the principle portions of the IPCC Reports. The person who released the information apparently knew this because it was timed to derail the Conference of The Parties (COP) 15 scheduled for Copenhagen in December 2009.
The first 1000 emails included some selected to expose behavior unacceptable even without knowledge of climatology. Others show how the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) science was conjured. Exposure of CRU members was necessary because they dominated and controlled the vital portions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Reports. The leaks achieved their objective of derailing the political program of COP 15. The COP was in a bind because their starting point and assumption is the validity of IPCC science.
COP 15 scheduled for December 2009 in Copenhagen Denmark offered the ideal opportunity for exposing the corrupted science. “The main contentious issues in Copenhagen where whether or not to abandon the Kyoto Protocol, which binds almost 40 industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions. At the heart of the dispute, developing nations wanted to extend the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and work out a separate new deal. But most developed nations wanted to merge Kyoto into a single new accord obliging all nations to fight global warming.” It was a critical meeting because failure probably meant the end of Kyoto and any attempt at replacement or modification. The leak was effective because Kyoto expired on December 31, 2012, despite further attempts at resuscitation at COP 16 in Durban.
Who, on the inside, had “scruples” about what was going on. Some of the clues lie in how the person attempted to release the information without personal exposure. The ‘leaker’ was determined to have the material out before the Copenhagen Conference. He sent it out through a Russian IP that reportedly prevented a trace.
George Monbiot of the Guardian actively sold the scientific material produced by the IPCC, which makes his reaction more telling. Reportedly shocked by the emails he said “why was CRU’s response to this issue such a total car crash.” George, the answer is because they were deceiving you, the politicians and the public. Meanwhile, you attacked scientists who knew what was going on and dared to speak out. I can attest that you were told.
The spin-doctors pursued the coverup by putting in place two investigation panels that separated out the science and limited their investigation with terms of reference. I know how this is done because I have refused to participate in such political deceptions. The trick is to pretend to remove the politics by establishing arms-length from governemnt committees to investigate and report. These committees are identified by their Chairs, Muir Russell and Lord Oxburgh. Conflicts and questions immediately arose about the integrity and independence of the committees, which the parties tried to address. The emails and their content were already arousing suspicions.
The University of East Anglia (UEA) and Muir Russell both said the Lord Oxburgh inquiry would examine the science. At a press conference on February 11, 2010 Muir Russell said, “Our job is to investigate scientific rigor, the honesty, the openness and the due process of CRU’s approach as well as the other things in the remit and compliance with rules. It’s not our job to audit CRU’s scientific conclusions. That would require a different set of skills and resources.” The Lord Oxburgh investigation was doomed from the start. “A member of the House of Lords appointed to investigate the veracity of climate science has close links to businesses that stand to make billions of pounds from low-carbon technology.”
The cover-up was easily detectable. Clive Crook, Senior editor of The Atlantic wrote a searing indictment of the whitewash. “I had hoped, not very confidently, that the various Climategate inquiries would be severe. This would have been a first step towards restoring confidence in the scientific consensus. But no, the reports make things worse. At best they are mealy-mouthed apologies; at worst they are patently incompetent and even wilfully wrong. The climate-science establishment, of which these inquiries have chosen to make themselves a part, seems entirely incapable of understanding, let alone repairing, the harm it has done to its own cause.”
Worse, they concluded that what went on was within normal patterns of interchanges and activities between a group of scientists. It’s inconceivable that any reasonable person reading the emails, especially the second 5000, can reach such a conclusion. Meanwhile, we still don’t know who leaked the material. 
It is helpful to study the details and consider the people involved. The final police report concluded it was not a whistleblower, but that challenges the evidence. However, it was a valuable conclusion for the coverup. Phil Jones, former Director of the CRU, knew the potential damage and legal implications of the file contents. Ironically, in order to claim the files stolen and a crime committed Jones admitted the files belonged to CRU. What would have happened if he denied they were files from the CRU?
Internal Candidate
There are several internal candidates, but I think the strongest is Keith Briffa. The person was apparently disaffected by the conflicts within the CRU, but also the implications of false data as the basis for world policy. Emails illustrate Briffa’s conflicts within the group. On October 5th 2009 Wigley wrote to Jones “It is distressing to read that American Stinker item. But Keith does seem to have got himself into a mess. As I pointed out in emails, Yamal is insignificant…….I presume they went thru papers to see if Yamal was cited, a pretty foolproof method if you ask me. Perhaps these things can be explained clearly and concisely — but I am not sure Keith is able to do this as he is too close to the issue and probably quite pissed of (sic). I think Keith needs to be very, very careful in how he handles this. I’d be willing to check over anything he puts together.” It appears Wigley is aware of the danger of Briffa doing something rash, like releasing documents. Jones forwarded the email to Briffa, which would likely only irritate him more.
Briffa’s dislike of Mann had a long history. On 22 September 1999, almost ten years before the leaks, Briffa confronted Mann in a long email that included the comment, “I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1000 years ago.” Treasonous words for Mann’s hockey stick paper that claimed no medieval warm period existed. Mann appeared to back off. He wrote, “Walked into this hornet’s nest this morning! Keith and Phil have both raised some very good points.” In reality, he puts Briffa down again. “SO(sic) I think we’re in the position to say/resolve somewhat more than, frankly, than Keith does, about the temperature history of the past millennium. And the issues I’ve spelled out all have to be dealt with in the chapter.” One cynical comment from Mann says, “And I certainly don’t want to abuse my lead authorship by advocating my own work.” It’s an interesting comment in light of his role in the IPCC 2001 Science Report and Summary for Policy Makers. It is also a concern the Wegman Report identified in Recommendation 1; “Especially when massive amounts of public monies and human lives are at stake, academic work should have a more intense level of scrutiny and review. It is especially the case that authors of policy-related documents like the IPCC report, Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis, should not be the same people as those that constructed the academic papers.”
On 17th June 2002 Briffa wrote to Dr Edward Cook about a letter involving Esper and Michael Mann, “I have just read this letter – and I think it is crap. I am sick to death of Mann stating his reconstruction represents the tropical area just because it contains a few (poorly temperature representative) tropical series. He is just as capable of regressing these data against any other “target” series, such as the increasing trend of self-opinionated verbage (sic) he has produced over the last few years, and … (better say no more)”Cook responds; “We both know the probable flaws in Mike’s recon (reconstruction), particularly as it relates to the tropical stuff…. It is puzzling to me that a guy as bright as Mike would be so unwilling to evaluate his own work a bit more objectively.”
Wigley didn’t help. Here is the first part of a belittling email from Wigley to Briffa on 10 January 2006. Thanx for this. Interesting. However, I do not think your response is very good. Further, there are grammatical and text errors, and (shocking!!) you have spelled McKitrick wrong. This is a sure way to piss them off. It appears to typify Wigley’s patronizing way of talking to wayward CRU members, especially those who undermined the elimination of the Medieval Warm Period.
Conflict continued as Briffa expressed his concern. Mann made some overtures, but on April 29th 2007 Briffa responded, “I found myself questioning the whole process and being often frustrated at the formulaic way things had to be done – often wasting time and going down dead ends. I really thank you for taking the time to say these kind words. I tried hard to balance the needs of the science and the IPCC, which were not always the same. I worried that you might think I gave the impression of not supporting you well enough while trying to report on the issues and uncertainties.” What damning commentary about what the CRU and the IPCC were doing?
Briffa may have worked with the Information Officer at the University who was under pressure for Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. In March 2009, we learned Briffa was ill and he and his wife were cancelling meetings with people at the CRU. Did this give him time to think about what was happening? Maybe, but his treatment by Mann and the sinking ship was likely an impetus. Whatever the answer, any reading of the emails show they were anything but normal correspondence between colleagues. It became more than a scientific disagreement.
Because of Jones’ actions the Norfolk police, a regional force, involved the national government through the National Domestic Extremism Unit, which was surely another measure of the seriousness of what was involved in the files. This led to the University of East Anglia turning over all the files related to skeptics and their requests through Freedom of Information (FOI). Apparently, the police and subsequent investigations accepted the CRU claims that requests for information were politically driven and caused hardship that diverted them from their work. When police interrogated skeptics, they asked about political affiliations. Why?
The idea of politics as the only motive developed because the CRU and the IPCC made global warming a purely political issue. Besides, why has motive got anything to do with the requests for scientific data and methods, especially when funded by taxes and used to create potentially devastating policies?

"The HS2 project survives. Despite ferocious attacks, the initial High Speed Rail (Preparation) Act 2013 was passed in November and the Hybrid Bill – where the real arguments are debated – is now going through the UK Parliament. The key questions are about connectivity, how HS2 will link up the cities and towns of Britain, bringing them closer together. The confirmation that there will be no link to the Eurostar line is insignificant compared to the importance of linking up the towns, cities and regions of Britain. The main issue with HS2 is that though these trains will slash times from London Euston to Birmingham Curzon Street and Manchester Piccadilly, passengers will be left on the platform at these destinations with few onward options. Until now, virtually no thought has been given to the final destinations where people want to go to, or how they’ll get there. Curzon Street Station, for example, is several hundred metres from the connecting trains at New Street Station, where a £500 million rebuild is taking place – yet, amazingly, there’s no plan for getting the customers from one to the other. Belatedly, HS2’s planners have recognised that a key argument for the new railway is its potential to trigger urban regeneration – but that regeneration is likely to be limited to a small circle around the new stations. But the places most in need of regeneration are not the great core cities like Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. It’s the scores of industrial towns in the regions around them which have lost their old economic base and are struggling to find a new one.   Only in the past few months have civic leaders woken up to this fact. As a result, a split is developing between the core cities and other places such as Wakefield, Bradford, Burnley and Blackburn. There’s a risk that these secondary and tertiary towns and cities might even be worse connected to the rest of the country than they are now if left out of the HS2 project. This problem can be solved through a three-pronged attack. First, it’s essential that tram and bus rapid transit systems are created to link the HS2 stations to surrounding areas. Manchester, which is completing a 60-mile tram network, provides the model. Second, the local and cross country rail networks that link the wider regions need to be electrified and upgraded, and these networks need to be seamlessly connected to the HS2 hubs. This is not an easy job in Birmingham and Leeds because of the way the stations’ tracks are configured, but it can be done. Third, and most critically, the HS2 trains need to provide onward connections to these networks, providing a direct service to London not just from the terminus at Birmingham, Leeds, or Manchester, but from Bolton, or Solihull, or Bradford – from the wider range of towns that fill the hinterland around great cities. The model here is France, where old industrial towns in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region enjoy direct trains to Paris.  Finally, equal attention needs to be given to links at the London end. The key interchange at Old Oak Common in West London, where it will meet Crossrail trains heading into the West End and the financial centre of the City, needs redesigning along Dutch lines with direct, cross-platform interchanges. And as Boris Johnson has stressed, Euston cannot accommodate the extra traffic without investment, notably in a second Crossrail line. All this will cost money, but without it, HS2 will simply not do the job it was intended for. Remarkably, HS2’s new boss Sir David Higgins has fully bought into these arguments.  Fifteen days into the job, he launched the project’s rethink in the northern capital of Manchester, pointing out the “poor connectivity” in the North, “not just to London, but also east to west between Liverpool and Manchester, Manchester and Leeds, Leeds and Hull. Those challenges have direct consequences, not just for the economy as a whole, but for people’s daily experience and aspirations.”“ Perhaps he’s thinking even further: as well as linking HS2 into local rail network, he sees the need for radically improved service on that west-east Trans-Pennine corridor in the North of England. Call it HS1.5. It could and should become an early priority if we want to see HS2 flourish."
"Carbon dioxide emissions have rebounded around the world as lockdown conditions have eased, raising fears that annual emissions of greenhouse gases could surge to higher than ever levels after the coronavirus pandemic, unless governments take swift action.  Emissions fell by a quarter when the lockdowns were at their peak, and in early April global daily carbon dioxide emissions were still down by 17% compared with the average figure for 2019, research published last month in the journal Nature Climate Change found.  Now daily carbon emissions are still down on 2019 levels, but by only 5% on average globally, according to an updated study.  “Things have happened very fast,” said Corinne Le Quéré, a professor of climate change at the University of East Anglia and the lead author of the studies. “Very few countries still have stringent confinement. We expected emissions to come back, but that they have done so rapidly is the biggest surprise.” Emissions for the year to date, from 1 January to 11 June, are 8.6% lower than in the same period for 2019, and emissions for the whole of this year are likely to be between 4% and 7% lower than for the whole of last year. That is not enough to make a significant contribution to the cuts in emissions needed to fulfil the Paris agreement on climate change, which will require structural changes to transport systems and how energy is generated. In the UK, emissions had fallen by 31% in early April, when the lockdown was at its most restrictive. But this week daily emissions were found to be 23% lower than last year’s levels. The reduction is likely to shrink further as the lockdown is loosened. Most of the fall and subsequent rebound has come from road transport. Deserted streets and empty motorways swiftly became the norm during lockdown, as people were ordered to stay at home except for emergencies. “Road transport is the most responsive sector,” said Le Quéré. “Emissions from transport were always going to go back up, but government responses have not been as fast as I would have liked [to make changes to people’s driving habits]. It would be terrible if we carry on going back to normal. It would be a disaster.” Mike Childs, the head of science at Friends of the Earth, said ministers in the UK had sent mixed signals. Boris Johnson, in his address last month announcing the first lockdown easing, explicitly urged people to drive to work. “By saying that people should jump back into cars, the government are contributing to increased pollution,” Childs said. “Road use was the big problem, and cycling and walking provision has always been part of the solution – just more so now, as we emerge.” Air pollution has not rebounded as fast as carbon dioxide emissions in Europe, according to estimates from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, which found that the expected increase in pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particles was not yet apparent. However, this could be owing to many factors including the weather. While emissions overall are still down on last year, there are fears that as lockdowns around the world ease further in the coming months, carbon from cars could surge to levels higher than before the pandemic as people avoid public transport. “What we may now see are emissions that exceed pre-pandemic levels, if for instance more people start using private instead of public transport due to health concerns,” said Bob Ward, a policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “Any economic recovery packages designed to help economies fully rebound need to focus on zero-carbon climate resilient investments that address unemployment but avoid locking us into a new high-carbon future.” Le Quéré said the role of governments around the world would be key. “There is the possibility [of emissions surging to well above pre-crisis levels] if the government incentives for boosting the economy are blind to climate change. Building roads, for example, would be very detrimental.” But the hope of making some of the emission reductions permanent was not yet lost, she said. Governments could still use their economic rescue packages to encourage a switch from high to low carbon infrastructure, for instance by removing the obstacles to electric vehicle adoption, by renovating buildings to make them more energy efficient, and by planting trees and restoring nature. “The window of opportunity will not be closed until the end of the year,” she said. “But after that it will be closed.” Richard George, of Greenpeace UK, said forging a green recovery should be an urgent priority. “All effort now needs to be focused on supporting a green economic recovery, creating jobs and boosting clean technologies,” he said. “We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a permanent silver lining. Let’s not throw it away.”"
"It has been confirmed that the Malaysia Airlines plane that disappeared on March 8 crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. It would be hard to choose a more complicated region of the ocean to be searching for scattered aircraft debris. The area of the southern Indian Ocean to which the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 has been traced, 1,500 miles west of Australia’s southwestern coast, lies just on the northern flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, a huge ocean current encircling Antarctica. In many ways it is similar to the atmospheric jet stream, or a series of jet streams. Just as in the jet stream, the strange effect of the earth’s rotation leads to the eastward-flowing currents focusing into narrow bands, like rivers flowing within the ocean. The currents loop into closed eddies that break away from their current and spin off, like high and low pressure systems moving through the atmosphere. Unlike the atmosphere, these highs and lows are on a much smaller scale, perhaps 100-500km across. Typical flow speeds are around 20cm per second – about ten miles per day – but faster speeds of up to 100cm per second are possible, and the direction of flow at any one time is very unpredictable. The search area spans both the northernmost “river” of the Circumpolar Current, and a much calmer area to the north where currents are much slower. This means debris could have been scattered and pulled in different directions, at different speeds. Further complicating things is the effect of the wind. Any floating debris will be directly pushed by the wind, but will also be surrounded by water in the Ekman layer, which is the top 50 metres or so of the ocean in which the effect of the wind is immediately felt.   Here again, the rotation of the earth has an effect which results in water moving (in the southern hemisphere) to the left of the direction of the wind, to a degree which depends on depth. So the wind can cause debris to drift across the deeper ocean currents, generally to the north in this region of prevailing westerlies, but how much of an effect the wind has will depend on how deeply the debris is floating. It is now more than two weeks since flight MH370 was lost. In that time, debris could have drifted by several hundred miles from where it is presumed the plane hit the water, and the patch of debris could have spread by a substantial fraction of that distance. Even if the debris spotted is confirmed to be from the plane, finding any sunken remains will still be a big challenge. The ocean in that region is about 3,500-4,000 metres deep, and finding sunken wreckage will involve combing a vast area with advanced sonar imaging technology. Then there is the challenge of reaching it: only specialised equipment can operate at the pressures of more than 350 atmospheres present at such depths, although from that point of view it could have been worse – large areas of the seafloor lie more than 5,000 metres below the surface, with a few narrow trenches beyond 10,000 metres deep. If the debris is confirmed to be from the Malaysia Airlines plane, a lot of work will remain to be done. It will still be a long time before we are in a position to determine what happened to flight MH370."
"A Belgian transport minister has come under fire for taking a private jet from Brussels to Antwerp, a journey of approximately 34 miles. Lydia Peeters, mobility minister in the Flemish regional government, admitted she had taken a press flight organised by the private jet company ASL Fly Executive.  The journey, which takes 46 minutes on twice-hourly fast trains, has been heavily criticised by green groups and political opponents. One Greenpeace campaigner described the flight as “mind-blowing”, while a deputy for the Green party in the Flemish parliament, Imade Annouri, said it was nonsensical, polluting and outdated. “In several neighbouring countries, short flights are being phased out and investments are being put into rail links,” the Flemish deputy said. “I would prefer to see the minister for mobility in the avant-garde rather than supporting an airline company.” Peeters said she had taken the flight to show support for regional airports, but conceded her presence at a press conference would have been enough. In a statement, Peeters said she fully supported initiatives to make the aviation industry more sustainable. “Mobility and sustainability will have to go hand in hand. I therefore fully understood the criticism of last Tuesday’s press flight.” The minister had been attending an event to explain the Flemish government’s actions to help regional airports, such as Antwerp and Ostend, hit by the economic impact of coronavirus. The criticism recalls the outcry when the federal environment minister, Marie-Christine Marghem, took a private jet to a UN climate summit in 2018, but declined to sign Belgium up to a group of countries pledging to make deeper cuts in emissions. Belgium’s regions control many policies necessary to tackle the climate emergency, such as transport, housing and agriculture, which has contributed to slow progress. The nation is on course to miss climate targets in 2020 and 2030, according to an EU report."
"What if carbon trading – where companies must bid for limited permits to emit pollutants, and so pay a price in order to do so – could be applied on an individual level?  Personal carbon trading is a policy idea that aims to reduce a nation’s overall carbon emissions by handing to individuals rights and responsibilities for their own emissions. With the IPCC this week preparing their latest report on the threat of climate change, with greenhouse gas emissions still rising perhaps it’s time to put more tools on the table. In a scheme designed to manage household energy use and personal travel, each adult would be allocated an equal annual carbon allowance. Units of this carbon allowance would have to be paid out when paying household energy bills or filling up the car. Those using less than their annual allowance could sell their surplus units, while those needing more would have to buy them. This way, the polluter would pay – a key environmental maxim. Could such a radical policy work, and could it be socially and politically acceptable? The UK government has set itself a target of reducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. This would require considerably more rapid reductions in carbon emissions that have been managed so far. Some scientists argue that deeper and more rapid reductions in carbon emissions are required if the UK is to make a just contribution to global efforts. A low carbon society will require major improvements in energy efficiency, a shift towards low- and zero-carbon fuels, and ways of living and doing business which are much less energy-intensive. It’s unlikely that this can be achieved without actively involving citizens – who are after all directly responsible for more than 40% of UK emissions. So a personal carbon trading scheme would make people more directly aware of their energy-related carbon greenhouse gas emissions, and give them direct control of managing them. By contrast, most policy on personal energy use operates at a distance from individuals, for example requirements for energy suppliers to fund insulation schemes, or for manufacturers to meet minimum efficiency standards for appliances. And it fails to communicate the significance of different decisions on personal carbon emissions. Personal carbon trading would need be practical to use, and to persuade people to reduce their emissions. Research has shown that introducing an electronic card system and “bank” of carbon units would be easily possible with current technology (which already works for gas- and electric-payment cards, Oyster travelcards, secure entry building passes, and many other systems).  The policy could use various ways try and change individuals’ behaviour. For example, economic (by generating an extra cost for profligate energy use), psychological (by setting goals and budgets and providing timely feedback), and social (strongly signalling what constitutes a socially acceptable level of personal emissions). But would this policy be fair? It embodies a specific view of equity, proposing that an equal carbon allowance is fair. This is rights-based interpretation of fairness, but some would argue that a more just system would be based on an individuals’ ability to reduce emissions, or their ability to pay, or even to focus on most efficient reductions (most carbon savings at least cost). However, in terms of consequences, models have suggested that personal carbon trading in the UK would be a progressive policy. Poorer individuals would be mostly winners, because their levels of direct emissions are generally lower. Under the previous Labour government a few years ago, personal carbon trading attracted positive political interest. The government commissioned research which reported in 2008). But after considering that research, the government decided not to pursue the policy, largely due to concerns about public acceptability and costs. This decision was not universally welcomed, with an environmental committee of MPs advising the government to support more research into the subject, given its importance. My further research into public perception of the scheme has revealed a more positive attitude toward the idea than many alternatives, such as carbon taxation. There has been speculation that the government’s main objection to a system of personal carbon trading was that the policy would reveal the carbon gap between the rich and poor. Either way, there was very little research available at the time, so the official assessment of the policy was taken largely in ignorance. Which is not to say that carbon trading is dead in the water. In fact it’s currently being trialled in Norfolk Island, an island of around 1,800 people 1,500km off the coast of Australia. While still in its early stages, the scheme has registered 350 people, and set up systems for electronic carbon accounting, feedback on carbon emissions, and rewards for participation.  Personal carbon trading is a radical approach that directly engages citizens in taking steps to mitigate climate change. It encourages discussion about who the winners and losers would be in a lower-carbon society. Research shows it could be progressive and publicly acceptable, and in the absence of other big ideas to bring about emissions reductions, it’s surely time to re-evaluate the idea’s potential to bring about positive changes."
"The UK automotive industry has been in confidential talks with the government over a possible £1.5bn scrappage scheme or “market stimulus package” that it insists should encourage the purchase of diesel and petrol cars on an equal footing with cleaner vehicles. The plans under consideration by industry and government would take £2,500 off the price of a car and put a further 600,000 new vehicles on the road. Although many campaigners and business leaders have demanded that post-coronavirus industry bailouts be linked to environmental goals, the UK car industry said a key principle was that the incentive scheme is fair to all types. In correspondence with the government seen by the Guardian, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the scheme must “support the entire market, not just disproportionately favouring specific segments or technologies, recognising the diverse nature of UK automotive manufacturing”. While government has been pushing the industry to rapidly adopt greener technologies to help meet net zero-emission climate change targets, more than 90% of cars sold last year were purely petrol or diesel. The biggest manufacturers in the UK, such as Jaguar Land Rover, currently remain committed to diesel – although diesel’s market share has dropped from about half of new car sales to just over a quarter in the wake of the VW emissions scandal, public health fears and changing tax rules. In a letter sent to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the business secretary, Alok Sharma, in May pushing for “confidential discussions”, the SMMT’s chief executive, Mike Hawes, admits that the 600,000 new cars would mainly be “additional in an otherwise moribund market”. While the SMMT claimed that the scheme “could also support wider government ambitions in terms of climate change and improved air quality”, it said the “primary benefit would be in jump-starting the market, the sector and the economy without further drain on the public purse”. The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen: • Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest. • Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load. • Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.   • Beef, lamb and dairy consumption falling by 20%, though this is far lower than other studies recommend and a bigger shift to plant-based diets would make meeting the zero target easier. • A fifth of all farmland – 15% of the UK – being converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops and restoration of peat bogs. This is vital to take CO2 out of the air to balance unavoidable emissions from cattle and planes. • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050. • Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels.  The SMMT said the scheme would bring a net benefit to the exchequer of around £3 for every £1 spent, through tax receipts from VAT and vehicle excise duty; get manufacturing workers off the Treasury’s Covid-19 job retention scheme; and help avoid “looming redundancies in a depressed market”. The letter said that business minister Nadhim Zahawi had been “extremely helpful” in earlier talks and had acknowledged that a scheme would also have “the intangible benefit that such a boost to consumer spending would do for consumer confidence”. A car scrappage scheme introduced after the financial crisis in 2009 led to hundreds of thousands of extra vehicle sales. The UK car industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus lockdown. Production was halted at plants across the UK during April, when just 197 vehicles came off production lines and sales collapsed by 97.3%, making it the industry’s worst month since 1946. The primary demand of a previous SMMT letter from 24 April– the reopening of car dealerships – was granted early last month by the government, with specific permission for showrooms to open ahead of other non-essential stores from 1 June. However, a scheme that would incentivise the purchase of new diesel and petrol cars would run counter to government net-zero commitments and plans to phase out fossil fuel vehicles over the next two decades. Earlier this year the transport secretary, Grant Shapps – who appears not to have been copied-in on the correspondence – mooted bringing forward the target date for banning sales of new diesel and petrol cars from 2040 to as early as 2032. Lockdown has resulted in major improvements in air quality in many cities, but there are signs that car use and ensuing pollution could soar as businesses reopen and people return to workplaces. While passengers on rail, bus and other public transport are a small fraction of pre-crisis numbers – between 5% to 20% – road traffic is already back at around 70% of normal levels. Richard George, head of oil at Greenpeace UK, said: “If the government is going to bail out the car industry, then every penny should go to supporting the transition to clean electric vehicles. People have noticed and enjoyed the cleaner air we’ve seen during lockdown. Ditching petrol and diesel for electric cars and vans would improve air quality for good, with huge benefits to our health and environment, as well as pulling Britain’s car industry into the 21st century and securing a future for its workers.” The SMMT plan has emerged while other industry leaders have agreed that any bailouts should have green conditions attached. Earlier this week, about 200 signatories – including the bosses of BP and Heathrow – wrote to the government to say that efforts to repair the economy “can and should be aligned with the UK’s legislated target of net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest”. Asked about the SMMT proposals by the Guardian, Hawes said: “Like many sectors, we have been in constant communication with government, highlighting the situation and what support might be needed when the immediate crisis eases.” He said that while there appeared to be a positive response to the opening of car showrooms on Monday, and some pent-up demand, “the effect on underlying consumer confidence will be unclear and we may need to work with government to identify ways of boosting demand, especially given the contribution this sector makes to the economy and jobs. That time is not now but industry, and government, need to be prepared for all eventualities”. The government was approached for comment."
"**The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination.**
Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out.
The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs.
Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff.
But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted.
A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported.
The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people.
The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday.
Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored.
Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales.
The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better.""
There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it.
But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different.
When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it.
From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000.
That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted.
Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first.
This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital.
It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it.
While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.""
Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable.
The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK:
Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now.
It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available.
NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"".
But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation.
""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty.
The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government.
Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021.
Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue.
The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose.
Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group.
The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said.
The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut.
Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.
Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp.
""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today.""
The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing.
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials.
Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice.
Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours.
Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed:
The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"".
He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme ""the vaccine will only start to dent the size of the pandemic somewhat later in the year""."
"**The health secretary Matt Hancock has pledged to re-evaluate North Somerset's Covid restriction tier in a fortnight after protests from two local MPs.**
John Penrose, MP for Weston-super-Mare, and Liam Fox, North Somerset's MP, said it was not ""right or fair"" that the district had been placed in tier three.
The decision was made because of its proximity to Bristol.
The city recorded 197 cases per 100,000 people over the last week, while North Somerset has 179.5 cases per 100,000.
But according to the latest figures North Somerset's rates are down from 203.7 cases per 100,000 in the previous week.
In a letter to Mr Penrose and Dr Fox, Mr Hancock said he ""very much hoped that North Somerset's case rates continue to improve"".
Mr Penrose said Mr Hancock's reply ""shows he's listening"" but he was left frustrated that the district is left in tier three until areas are reviewed on 16 December.
Mr Penrose and Dr Fox voted in favour of the new tier system in the House of Commons on Tuesday.
They said not doing so would have ""prevented the government from dealing with local flare-ups without imposing another national lockdown"".
But fellow Conservative MP David Warburton voted against the plan.
The Somerset and Frome MP said the tier system was ""ludicrous and laughable"".
""The trouble is that the government will lose the consent of the people because it doesn't make any sense and I understand that because it doesn't make any sense to me"", he said.
Last week, a North Somerset landlord unable to open his pub because of the district being placed in tier three said he felt ""sold down the river"".
John Hayes, who runs the Old Inn in Hutton, about 20 miles (32km) from Bristol, said he had been ""victimised by post code"".

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski has a fascinating piece on what likely causes most of the sea ice to break up. The Spiegel introduction:
Sea ice is disappearing in the Arctic, around the Antarctic it is growing – today’s conventional climate models are unable to explain this contradiction. One effect has just been measured by sensors: wave motion is able to crack ice, hundreds of kilometers away.”
The Spiegel report explains how oceanic mechanical waves induced by large storms offshore propagate underneath sea ice and act to break it apart even hundreds of miles far into the ice sheet. Bojanowski cites a north Pacific storm near Alaska which created huge waves in 2005. “Six days later the surges ripped apart the B15A iceberg 13,500 km to the south.”

The new hypothesis is based on a recent study by Alison Kohout of the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Nature.
Scientists placed sensors on a section of the Antarctic ice sheet to measure ocean wave induced oscillations. When storms hit offshore, the ice sheet began to resonate and cracks developed due to the cyclic loading. Spiegel writes that cracks even hundreds of kilometers into the ice sheet resulted.
The scientists examined weather data between 1997 and 2009. They clearly observed that sea ice broke up as result of storms hundreds of kilometers away. Sea ice over water that bordered regions of relatively calm waters that saw low storm activity remained relatively intact.

Many global warming scientists insist ice break-up is likely caused mostly by warming. But the results of the study refute the claim and show that climate models have gotten it all wrong again. Bojanoawski writes on storm-induced ocean waves and ice break-up:
In the calculations such destruction is hardly taken into account by the models, which simulate sea ice. Up to now they have failed to depict the observed changes: …”
But the Alfred Wegener Institute is skeptical of the study’s result, claiming that it neglected to take wind into account.
It’s a good point, but here we see that even the warmist Alfred Wegener Institute indirectly admits that sea ice break-up is in large part driven by mechanical ocean wave dynamics and wind forces.
Bojanowski writes that the destructive effects of ocean waves are documented in the Arctic as well, citing how in 2012 “a huge storm ripped apart an area of sea ice three times the size of Germany in just 10 days“. He adds that the wave effect exascerbated the break-up as deeper warm water was agitated and brought up to the surface and melted the sea ice like “an ice cube in a tea cup.”
Whatever the warmists may argue, one thing is sure:  Sea ice break-up is far more complex and there is a growing body of evidence showing that it is due in large part to mechanical ocean dynamics and wind conditions.

Mandated increases in energy efficiency — popular almost everywhere on the ideological spectrum — have been implemented around the world. Laws like the European Union’s new requirement for 15% energy savings, or the U.S. Senate’s proposed Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012, appear like clear winners for almost everyone. If the costs of new technologies are within reason, they promise consumers lower energy bills and producers more profit while mitigating the environmental costs of energy development and consumption.



There is just one problem: Basic economics says that the best way to promote some activity is to reduce its price. That often means efficiency requirements end up having the opposite effect than the one intended.



Consider Mexico’s recent cash‐​for‐​coolers program, which subsidized the swapout of inefficient refrigerators and air conditioners for more efficient ones. A World Bank engineering study claimed that the new refrigerators would consume nearly 30% less energy. But the actual savings estimated by researchers at the University of California Energy Institute was only 7%, because buyers chose larger capacities and options like ice makers in the doors. Newer air conditioners actually consumed more electricity because they cut the cost of attaining previously unaffordable comfort levels in summer months.



Research on the effects of efficiency measures tells us that such overestimates of savings are significant, and economic theory suggests that they are to be expected. Overestimating the energy savings from new refrigerators is an instance of “rebound.” The more extreme case of increases in total consumption by new air conditioners is usually called a “backfire.”



Your first reaction might be that people will lower their thermostats to 71 from 78 degrees, but that will be the end of the story. Not so.



Higher efficiency reduces the cost of cooling. A family that once had only a single air‐​conditioned bedroom may now choose to install a central unit, and one that suffered in the heat may purchase its first one. Direct rebounds like these, however, are only the start of the story.



Technology that improves energy efficiency and reduces its cost means people can consume more goods and services that use energy — home electronics, appliances and the like. And of course, businesses will use additional energy making them.



These direct and indirect effects are substantial, as I found in my recent Energy Institute Research survey, “The Rebound Dilemma,” but they are small relative to the long‐​term consequences for the nation and the world.



America suburbanized with changes in energy markets and technology that allowed longer commutes and stand‐​alone houses. And an American factory that replaces an inefficient machine doesn’t throw the old one away. A world‐​wide market means that it will remain employed in a workshop in some less‐​developed country. Investment in the efficient machine raises rather than lowers world energy consumption.



Rebound greatly complicates the politics of energy efficiency. Some organizations, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, have attempted to refute it, but their studies have thus far examined only a minority of rebound findings and have yet to account for long‐​term and world‐​wide effects of greater efficiency.



Rebound gives critics of regulation both philosophical and practical rationales for their views: Some object to efficiency standards on libertarian grounds and rebound research now tells us that many standards will fall short of their initial promise. But for the Breakthrough Institute in Berkeley, Calif., which gives primacy to climate change, rebound increases the urgency of introducing large‐​scale governmental management of both markets and technologies.



The growing body of research on rebounds means that both the left and the right must rethink their stances on energy policy. Some efficiency regulations may be worth their costs, but the existence of rebound means that the nation can no longer accept legislation to improve efficiency without further thought.

"Much of the discussion on the current Ukraine crisis concerns European energy security and dependence on Russian gas. The different reactions of EU member states to the Ukraine crisis highlight an underlying issue that influences the security and cost of gas – trust. Without an understanding of trust in commercial and political relations, it is difficult to explain the variation of reactions to the Ukraine crisis and the significance of Russia’s actions on future gas relations. Trust is the reason why reactions range from building European gas independence from Russia, in the case of the Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski’s impassioned recommendation, to a more cautious wait-and-see approach from the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. This is not to say that technical and economic constraints such as pipelines and interdependence don’t matter. European energy trade with Russia begins with shared interests, but trust can enhance or inhibit cooperation. Trust shapes the preferences for actors to engage in trade in the first place. Trust influences reactions to disputes and supply disruptions like the one that happened in 2005, and it shapes the parameters of energy security policy. Although trust is needed for all trade activity, it is particularly pronounced in energy, and gas above all. The reason for this is threefold: the huge costs of extracting gas, the interdependency they create between the parties involved and the lack of robust international institutions to govern relations. Looking across Europe, there is considerable variation of trust levels toward Russia. There are also different types of trust: “particularised trust” and “generalised trust”.  “Particularised trust” means trust between two parties and based on the confidence of their previous experience. For example: “I the German consumer of Russian gas trust Gazprom to make good on its promises, to deliver X amount of gas for the price of Y.” From this perspective, it is not suprising that there should exist a high degree of trust between German customers and Russian suppliers after 40 years of reliable exchange. On the whole, the same principle applies to France and Italy. As a result they have defended Russia’s position in its previous disputes with Ukraine. The second type, “generalised trust”, applies to relations between most east European states and Russia. It is generalised because it is not based on a direct experience of commercial exchange, but rather on general perceptions of an entire national group. Therefore, despite subsidising our economy with cheap gas for forty years, Russians are perceived as untrustworthy because of the social and political oppression they have historically meted out on the region. From this perspective, market forces such as cost become less relevant. Crimea’s interest in seceding from Ukraine and Russia’s recent support of this movement harken to memories of Budapest in 1956 or Prague in 1969. This distrust is based less on commercial experiences with Gazprom than political fears of the past, and it is driving states to look for (expensive) alternatives to Russian gas. Ironically, the states that can least afford to pay for alternatives to Russian gas are the most willing. Poland, backed by the EU, spent €950 million to build a new liquefied natural gas terminal, the Baltic states also want to build them and the EU was planning to back the construction of an €8 billion pipeline to deliver gas from the Caspian Region without any firm supply contracts. LNG, in this case from Qatar, is generally more expensive than pipeline gas because of the additional transportation steps it requires. It should be noted that distrust in the east is not only directed to Russia. When Nord Stream was first announced, Poland approached the Norwegians to build their own trans-Baltic pipeline bypassing Germany with a direct link to Norwegian supplies. The Polish foreign minister went even so far as to describe Nord Stream as the “Molotov-Ribbentrop pipeline”. These examples illustrate the monetary cost of trust in gas trade. They are an energy security premium that states with low trust in Russia are willing to pay for the same product. Russia’s recent foray into the Crimea has reinforced fears in the east of Europe, exacerbating distrust among transit countries who have a higher dependence on Russian gas than western Europe. This renders more urgency to their appeals to the EU for developing alternatives to Russian gas. For Western Europe, those states on whom Russia depends the most for revenues from gas sales, it makes their defense of Russia as a reliable trading partner harder to make.  Put together, there is a net loss of trust between Europe and Russia, one that will be more difficult to overcome than the last two supply disruptions. And ironically, the conflict in Ukraine could have the single most detrimental effect on Gazprom’s European business since the first long term contracts were signed in the 1970s – even though no supply disruption may occur. No other example better illustrates the monetary and political costs of trust."
"Being perched off the northwest edge of Europe means that people in the UK are not often reminded of the vast Sahara desert situated only a few thousand miles to the south. This great desert is located under a descending branch of the global atmospheric circulation, that is, a point at which air, having been heated close to the equator and then blown north or southwards high in the atmosphere, then descends back to the surface. This leads to a hot, dry climate in the Sahara with little vegetation. Strong winds can lift dust from the bare desert soils, which can then be carried by the wind for thousands of kilometres. This dust is in fact a natural part of the earth system, providing essential nutrients to plankton in the oceans and plants growing as far away as the Amazon. Particularly large and intense dust storms occur quite often over the Sahara in spring, as weather fronts trailing from mid-latitude weather systems over the northern part of the Sahara generate winds strong enough to lift up the sands. It’s more unusual that dust from the Sahara is transported directly to the UK, but when it does, rain can bring the dust back down to earth.  This is often seen as a thin film of dust on cars, as noted in southern England. In Africa, persistently high concentrations of atmospheric dust have been linked to meningitis outbreaks, but the low concentrations that reach the UK are not a hazard. But in recent days the southerly winds bringing the dust have also brought man-made pollution from continental Europe. Trapped close to ground level and combined with pollutants from the UK, particularly emissions from road traffic in and around London, this has led to unusually high levels of air pollution. Saharan dust storms can be seen from space, because the dust reflects solar radiation and absorbs and emits infrared. This means atmospheric dust can either cool or warm the atmosphere, depending on its properties and those of the underlying surface. This interaction affects the rate at which the sun warms the earth’s surface, and how quickly earth loses that heat to space.  This means that weather forecast centres (such as the Met Office and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) are increasingly accounting for the effects of the varied atmospheric dust loads in their forecasting systems. This has led to improved forecasts not only for Africa, but also other regions such as Europe. Further chemistry takes place in clouds: the dust seen in the UK was brought down by rain, most of which would have originated from ice and snow in clouds. The dust is not only transported in such clouds, but interacts with them. In particular, the presence of dust allows ice crystals to form at warmer temperatures than would otherwise be the case (in the atmosphere, at temperatures warmer than about -38°C, some kind of solid nucleus is needed around which ice can form). The Sahara has not always been a desert, and sediments from ancient lakes are one source of fine particles that, once uplifted by strong winds, then fall sufficiently slowly to be transported over large distances. The winds do not lift these particles directly; instead they lift larger particles which quickly fall back to the surface, in turn releasing smaller particles on impact (a process called saltation).  As well as cold fronts from cyclones, a variety of meteorological mechanisms can lead to strong winds and so dust uplift. Understanding these mechanisms and improving dust forecasts is an area of active research."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCo-author of “The Neglected Sun“/geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning made a presentation at the 7th International Conference for Climate and Energy in Mannheim, Germany, back in April. EIKE has now put it up. The presentation is in German and so I am providing below a round up of the main points made by Lüning.

Lüning starts by reminding the listeners that geology is key to understanding the past, which in turn can help us to better understand the present and provide valuable clues of what to expect in the future.
The German geologist is a specialist in the geology of Africa. The scientitific literature shows that the Sahara was green a mere 6000 years ago, and his slide at the 0:45 mark show remnants of that time.

Remnants of a green Sahara, 6000 years ago.
Back then, in the mid Holocene, it was 1 – 2°C warmer than it is today and the Sahara was teeming with wildlife.
At the 2:20 mark Lüning shows a slide of cave painting, in the middle of the Sahara, depicting wildlife seen at the time:

Cave paintings of wildlife in the middle of the Sahara.
The changes over the Holocener period clearly are greater than what we are seeing today and are due to natural flcutucations, primarily solar activity. Lüning adds at the 3:40 mark:
This is a geological context that unfortunately is lost on many people like physicists who believe their formulae more than they believe the true facts.”
Greenland is cooling
At the 4:10 mark Lüning brings up the Axforf paper of 2013, which shows Greenland was “2 – 3°C warmer 6000 to 4000 years ago than it is today” and that the ice survived.
At the 5:00 mark he presents a 2013 paper by Lecavalier et al showing that Greenland has cooled 2.5°C over the last 8000 years.

Greenland has cooled 2.5°C over the last 8000 years.
On his slide Lüning writes:
Despite the thousands of years of continuous warmth, the dramatic ice collapse never occurred.”
At the 6:00 mark Lüning shows a chart from Bob Carter, also showing nothing unusual is happening, Co2 playing only a minor role.
At the 7:30 mark Lüning brings up the IPCC 1990 millennium temperature chart that distinctly shows a warmer Medieval Warm Period and a little ice age. At the 8:30 various hockey sticks are shown, which Lüning describes as “incorrect”. “Even Michael Mann had to admit that he had exaggerated”.
Climate driven by solar activity
Starting at the 9:45 mark, his charts show that solar activity correlates well with temperature, which Lüning calls “a surprisingly good match”. He then presents the various solar cycles that the sun undergoes, going into the works of Gerard Bond, who made temperature reconstructions using layers of ice-rafted material in the North Atlantic. Lüning calls the synchronicity between solar activity and temperature found by Bond “stunning”. See chart 13:20 mark below)

Strong correlation between solar activity and temperature.
At around the 14:00 mark Lüning recounts how he naively expected an explanation from Rahmstorf on why Bond’s findings were being ignored. Rahmstorf replied that “Bond’s cycles could not be reproduced by other groups” and that “Bond himself later stopped believing in his cycles” and that “Bond cycles are a scientific dead-end”.
But at the 14:45 mark, Lüning clearly shows this was not true, and presents a 2003 paper by Hu et al, where Bond is one of the co-authors. That paper too also showed a good correlation between solar activity and temperature over the last 12,000 years. Here the theory was enforced, rather than not being reproducible, as Rahmstorf falsely claimed. Another 2005 paper that included Bond as a co-author is shown at the 15:45 mark.
Clear solar signal found worldwide
Lüning then shows other papers showing solar activity driving climate patterns all over the world, in places like Australia, Oman, North Caorlina, China. He sums them up in chart at the 17:04 mark.
IPCC models have no chance of success
Lüning says that there is clearly a solar signal in climate over the millenniums, and therefore says the IPCC models have no chance of ever successfully modeling the climate. He says that the IPCC models have gotten worse, and not better.
Lüning at the 20:00 mark presents evidence showing that the recent warming is due primarily to the extremely high level of solar activity over the 20th century. Even the flowrate of the Parana River in South America is in sync with solar activity (21:45). Even Lake Victoria fluctuates in sync with solar activity (22:30).
Lüning then brings up the solar amplifier and Svensmark’s theory (23:20) and that cloud formation is modulated by cosmic ray intensity, which in turn is modulated by the sun’s magnetic field. Lüning believes such research deserves some funding (applause) and that the sun acting as one of the major climate modulators makes perfect sense.
Warming of last 20 years “statistically insignificant”
At the 28:00 mark he calls the warming of the last 20 years “statistically insignificant” and says it has indeed stagnated no matter which dataset you look at. At the 28:15 mark he shows how the IPCC’s previous prognoses are “all too hot”, see following figure:

Models have all been false.
At the 29:00 mark he calls the recent claims of an unprecedented warning unjustified and shows that similar warming episodes have occurred in the past. Even Phil Jones admits it.
Ocean cycles responsible for the 1980-2000 warming
At the 30:00 mark Lüning says the natural oceanic cycles have been responsible for the recent decadal temperature fluctuations, and at least for half of the most recent 1980 – 2000 warming. The remaining half has to be responsibly assigned to the other factors. At the 31:20 mark, he believes that cooling is ahead for the 20 years:

 Cooling projected for the next 20 years.
Cooling ahead
He thinks it is also possible that the low solar activity will lead to a cooling of one or two tenths of a degree Celsius over the next 5 years, which he says “could be very interesting for the discussion” (32:00). He cites Judith Curry. At the 33:00 mark he cites other papers showing that CO2 climate sensitivity has been overstated and needs to be corrected.
At the 37:30 mark Lüning tells the listeners he expects a huge drop in overall solar activity to take hold in the decades ahead and global temperatures to drop by 0.2°C by 2030 (see following chart).

Lüning believes 0.2°C cooling is possible by 2030.

"More than a third of New South Wales rainforest was among 5.4m hectares hit by last season’s catastrophic bushfires, according to new state government data. The report, an updated assessment of the effect of the fires on wildlife and landscapes, said 293 threatened animal species and 680 threatened plant species have habitat in the state’s fire ground. The affected area includes more than 3.5m hectares of the state’s best koala habitat.  Almost six months on from the crisis, the impact of the fire season is only beginning to be understood. Recovery work has begun in some areas, while in others, the Covid-19 pandemic shut down early assessment work. The fire ground includes 245 of the state’s 878 national parks and 208 out of 522 state forests. The report maps the relative severity of the fires based on how much of the tree canopy appears to have burnt. The maps were produced using geospatial data and will be refined over time with more on ground assessment, a NSW environment department spokesperson said. Of the national parks in the fire ground, the analysis found 23% have had their canopy fully affected and 36% partially affected. In state forests, those figures are 17% and 32% respectively. The report rated the ecological condition of forests in the fire ground, which is a measure of the quality and the intactness of habitat compared to its original condition. Within the NSW RFS fire ground, 72% of the original ecological was estimated as remaining in 2013. In 2020, that figure has decreased to 44% the report states. The analysis also looked at the ability of these locations to support native species and ecosystems, what is known as “ecological carrying capacity”. It estimated that within the fire ground 62% of the original carrying capacity remained in 2013. That had now fallen to 38%. As well as 37% of rainforests being affected, other findings included: 52% of all heathlands in NSW has been affected by fire. 50% of wet sclerophyll forests has been affected. 25% of the most suitable koala habitat in eastern NSW is in the RFS fire ground. That includes 68% of the best koala habitat on the south coast, 34% of the best koala habitat in the northern tablelands and 30% of the best koala habitat on the north coast. The report builds on earlier work which found vast areas of the Blue Mountains world heritage area and the Gondwana rainforests world heritage area were within the fire ground. John Merson, the executive director of the Blue Mountains World Heritage Institute, said although more than 80% of the world heritage area had burnt, it had not burnt uniformly or at the same intensity. He said there were areas of refuges, and recovery was occurring, but some critical ecosystems, including swamp communities that are important water resources had been affected on a large scale. Merson said surveys were occurring to examine not just the short term effects of the fires but what the longer term effect of climate change would be on the recovery, noting concern about fires returning with greater frequency. “I think we need a better understanding of how to protect this environment,” he said. In the state’s north, the botanist Robert Kooyman has been surveying areas of the Gondwana rainforests, including in the Nightcap national park. He said six months on there had been a significant resprouting in eucalypt forest and in the rainforest. But he said there was also a continuation of tree mortality. “Trees die slowly. There’s a continuing impact of the fires six months later,” Kooyman said. “The short story is there’s signs of life but the loss of large trees is something that doesn’t get replaced quickly. “We’re talking many decades and in some cases hundreds of years to replace that.” The department’s spokesperson said it was expected both the ecological condition and carrying capacity of the fire-affected areas would improve as areas regenerated. “This response will be captured in future assessments.” "
"**Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown.**
A tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into force in the nation, with businesses including hairdressers and beauty salons also able to open.
More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households.
The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"".
Meanwhile, the UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.
The first 800,000 doses will be available in the UK from next week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.
England's new three-tiered system was backed by MPs in a Commons vote just hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan.
There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark.
And people arrived promptly to take advantage of a stock clearance sale at Debenhams department store from 07:00 GMT.
Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown.
It comes after a period which has seen the collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group, women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ© and the failure of Debenhams to secure a buyer \- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk.
Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, but down by 24.1% on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard.
Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates.
She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online.""
Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy.
""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said.
""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month.""
Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.
Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand.
There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels.
British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers, with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"".
Pubs and restaurants are now allowed to reopen in tier one and two areas, although in tier two alcohol can only be served with a ""substantial meal"".
The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus.
And later on Wednesday about 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football League for the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March.
England's new coronavirus restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November.
Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers.
In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors.
And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.
Scotland operates a five-tier system while Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus restrictions \- with the latter currently in a two-week circuit breaker lockdown.
On Tuesday, a further 13,430 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK while a further 603 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 59,051.

"Climate change is a serious threat to human safety and security according to the latest report from the UN’s International Panel on Climate Change. But also coming through loud and clear is that adaptation can reduce the risks we face from climate change.  Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised; Charles Darwin was telling us this more than 100 years ago: It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change. The latest report lays out the risks from climate change on food, water and livelihoods more strongly than ever before. Presenting a series of new studies, it shows that we are already feeling the effects of a warmer world – hotter weather may already be reducing yields of major food crops, for example. The risks from climate change are clear and the latest IPCC report only adds more urgency to a global deal on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst impacts. However, we can’t entirely mitigate our way out of this problem. New in this report is much more emphasis on adaptation. Measures such as flood defences, shading on houses to keep out the heat and developing water-saving measures feature to abate the rising risks of climate change. The report shows how adaptation is already making the world more climate resilient and could reduce future risks by as much as 50%. We can see how adaptation is helping to protect British citizens, for example. Investment in flood defence has meant that UK flood damages to property in 2014 were less than in 2007, despite very widespread flooding. But this has cost money and will continue to do so. Adaptation has the potential to reduce some, but not necessarily all, impacts and many organisations are beginning to address climate change risks. But they often do not know exactly what they will have to adapt to.  So how can organisations and communities across the world adapt in a cost-effective way to climate change when scientists can only give a broad indication of what might happen to the local climate? It is possible to develop responses which are flexible to deal with uncertainty, but this may not be feasible in all cases or where investments are likely to be made over the long term. The IPCC report gives projections for 2050 or 2100, showing the broad, long-term risks of climate change. But they are still woefully short of regional and local detail. Adaptation is needed now and organisations are looking for information about the sort of climate extremes they might be facing this summer or next winter. There are relatively few organisations that plan over a 50 or 100-year timescale. Research into what might happen to climate over the next year or the next 10 years is developing rapidly. The IPCC Working Group I report, which came out last September, included a whole chapter on near-term climate change for the first time, led by my colleague Rowan Sutton.  But the scientific challenges are massive in this area of climate research. Trying to forecast climate for the next year or next decade is in some ways more difficult than a forecast for 2050 or 2100. Near-term forecasts require a much better understanding of natural variations in climate and how these interact with human influences. One example of recent research shows that a major current in the North Atlantic Ocean could be slowing down. Findings indicate that a recently measured slowdown of 10-15% may be part of larger decline that began in the 1990s and shows no sign of stopping.  This could have a significant impact on weather in Britain and elsewhere. The decline could cool the North Atlantic and reverse the recent pattern of wet British summers. It could also lead to fewer Atlantic hurricanes and more droughts in North Africa. This isn’t a forecast, but it is research that is developing rapidly and could be tremendously beneficial in helping understand how climate is evolving. We won’t ever have absolutely precise climate forecasts of next summer or the next decade, but the potential is there to provide useful guidance. Combining this with research into the impact of climate change on our lives is vital for adapting to and minimising the many risks that have been laid out in the latest IPCC report."

The federal government imposes a mandate to blend ethanol into gasoline. This “Renewable Fuel Standard” harms consumers, damages the economy, and produces negative environmental effects. The mandate has also spawned a bureaucratic trading system in ethanol credits, which the _Wall Street Journal_ reports is bankrupting a refinery in Pennsylvania.   






The rubber hits the road with that “10% Ethanol” sticker you see on the pump when you fill your tank. The sticker signifies that the government is imposing a foolish policy on the nation at the behest of a handful of selfish senators, who are bucking the interests of America’s 220 million motorists.   
  
  
Nick Loris discusses some ethanol basics at Down​siz​ing​Gov​ern​ment​.org. And Thomas Landstreet reiterated some of the problems with the mandate in the _WSJ_ the other day:   




The corn ethanol mandate was created under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Two years later, President Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act, which expanded the program by providing generous tax credits and subsidies to corn growers and ethanol blenders. It also established ambitious targets, increasing annually, for biofuels in the national fuel mix. The mandate soon diverted 40% of America’s corn crop away from the food supply.   
  
  
The government‐​imposed shortage caused corn prices to float from long‐​term mean levels of about $2 per bushel to more than $8 per bushel in 2012. This extraordinary price surge prompted a range of harmful responses in the farming industry. Farmers planted 17 million new acres of corn at the expense of soybeans, wheat, hay and cotton, driving prices for those crops to all‐​time highs as well. Cattle farmers, unable to afford corn gluten feed, culled their herds to levels not seen in 60 years, causing beef prices to rise an incredible 60% from 2007 to 2012. Over this five‐​year period, the IMF food price index rose 42%.   
  
  
…The country has endured a startling amount of economic disruption for what is clearly an inferior source of energy. Ethanol produces 34% less energy per volume than conventional gasoline, reducing cars’ fuel economy. As for its effect on the environment, a 2010 Congressional Budget Office study found that corn‐​based ethanol subsidies are terribly inefficient, with the government spending an estimated $754 per metric ton of avoided emissions—an astronomically high price tag compared with other policies. (The economics of climate change literature estimates the “social cost of carbon” at far lower levels, meaning the program is inefficient even on its own terms.)   
  
  
Moreover, ethanol is too corrosive to be transported through pipelines, so trucks must transport it. Growing corn also requires more water than other crops—and the policy gave farmers an incentive to plant only corn, which depleted the soil of nutrients. A 2008 study in Science found that converting natural environments for biofuel production can produce hundreds of times more carbon emissions than the biofuels themselves would save. No wonder ethanol mandates are losing support among environmentalists.



The ethanol mandate reduces freedom and costs you money at the gas pump for no reason other than to line the pockets of corn farmers, who already benefit from billions of dollars of federal farm subsidies. The mandate is stupid policy and ought to be repealed.

"LYON, France  —   The French   leader Marine Le Pen delivered a grim populist kickoff to her burgeoning presidential campaign on Sunday, warning thousands of her   supporters of “two totalitarianisms,” globalization and Islamism, that want to “subjugate France. ” Ms. Le Pen’s dark picture of a weakened France troubled by bureaucrats and burqas was a striking echo of themes being sounded across the Atlantic. France, a prosperous country with the world’s   economy, was depicted as a besieged wreck. In a packed hall here, she made a point, in an hourlong speech brimming with nationalist fervor, of praising President Trump and the Americans who had elected him, as her supporters shouted forcefully, “This is our country!” Americans, she said, had “kept faith with their national interest,” even as she promised to do the same for France, saying the French had been “dispossessed of their patriotism. ” Whether it will sell in a country undoubtedly frightened by terrorism and weary of unemployment hovering around 10 percent is unclear, but it is certain that Ms. Le Pen’s National Front party is closer than it has ever been to gaining power in France after over 40 years of existence. Polls show that she is very likely to reach at least a second round of voting in France’s   electoral process this spring. The weekend’s campaigning in this prosperous southeastern metropolis  —   her likely runoff opponent, Emmanuel Macron, the centrist former economy minister, also drew thousands to a rally across town on Saturday  —   offered a taste of the fierce electoral battle to come and a rerun of some of the American election’s dynamic. The populist Ms. Le Pen, 48, offered up a forbidding dystopia in urgent need of radical upheaval, much like Mr. Trump did. The boyish Mr. Macron  —   he is 39 and has created a nonparty political movement that has suddenly caught fire  —   spoke of “reconciling” France and of “working together,” and repeatedly addressed more than 10, 000 supporters in a giant stadium as “my friends. ” France would certainly stay in the European Union, in his view, and there would be none of Ms. Le Pen’s war on globalization. The crowd spilled onto the grounds outside the stadium, forcing many to watch Mr. Macron on huge screens. He took a backhanded slap at Mr. Trump, promising refuge in enlightened France to American scientists, academics and companies “fighting obscurantism” at home. They would have, “as of next May,” the date of the presidential runoff, “a homeland, and that will be France,” Mr. Macron promised. The candidates both present themselves as outsiders  —   Mr. Macron served in the Socialist government but is not a Socialist, while Ms. Le Pen’s party has never held power  —   but the crowds at the two rallies were a study in contrast. Judging by a   interviews, Mr. Macron’s group was peppered with teachers, doctors, academics, civil servants and men who described themselves as “heads of companies. ” In contrast, Ms. Le Pen’s crowd was full of factory workers and former soldiers, and it adored her thundering opening line: “I’m against the Right of money, and the Left of money. I’m the candidate of the people!” Still, the slickly produced   National Front event at Lyon’s modernist conference center, full of party functionaries in blazers scurrying about, showed how far the party has come from its disreputable ragtag origins in the early 1970s, when it emerged as a xenophobic coalition of former Nazi collaborators and disgruntled veterans of the Algerian war who had not forgiven the country’s leaders for having agreed to Algeria’s independence  —   like Ms. Le Pen’s father, the party’s founder,   Le Pen. She has effectively kicked him out of the party. But Ms. Le Pen’s populist tirade echoed with many of the former patriarch’s themes. She delivered her speech against a screen projecting the words “In the Name of the People,” and it was full of immigrants committing crimes, jihadists plotting attacks and European Union bureaucrats stealing jobs from the French. Ms. Le Pen promised to crack down on all of them. Clearly buoyed by Mr. Trump’s victory after years of electoral defeats in France  —   “The impossible becomes the possible,” Ms. Le Pen said of it  —   she offered a sketch of what her presidency might look like. She promised to hold a referendum within six months on European Union membership, which she called a “nightmare,” secure the country’s borders and pull France out of NATO. Foreigners, she said, were eating up France’s social benefits and offering little in return. “Our benefits are distributed to people all over the world,” she said. But in contrast to Mr. Trump, for Ms. Le Pen restoring what she called “sovereignty” to France appeared as an end in itself. She offered no return to a golden age of prosperity for her country, promising instead to “restore order” within five years. Ruin was just around the corner, in her telling. “After decades of cowardice and   our choice is a choice of civilization,” she said. “Will our children live in a country that is still French and democratic?” The crowd ate it up. “She’s got a real program, in the name of the people, for the workers, and by the workers,” said Eric Fusis, a    retired military officer from the Doubs. “It’s for the nation, and not for the financial sector and the banks,” he said."

The Obama administration filed a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization on Monday alleging that the Chinese government is bestowing various prohibited subsidies upon Chinese automobile and auto parts producers to the tune of $1 billion and that Beijing is, accordingly, in violation of its commitments under the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.   
  
There are reasons to shake one’s head at this move, including the apparent hypocrisy it reveals of an administration that spins the $85 billion of subsidies it heaped upon two U.S. car companies and the United Autoworkers union as its chief economic accomplishment. Of course that figure doesn’t even include the $12-$14 billion in unorthodox tax breaks granted to GM under the bankruptcy terms; $17 billion in funds committed from the TARP to GM's former financial arm GMAC (which received taxpayer support to facilitate GM auto sales); GM's portion of the $25 billion Energy Department slush fund to underwrite research and development in green auto technology; and the $7,500 tax credit granted for every new purchase of a Chevy Volt, and more. (Full story here.)   
  
To complain about $1 billion of Chinese subsidies is – shall we say – a bit rich.   




Moreover, the filing of the WTO case reveals some of the unseemly perquisites of incumbency. A large concentration of the beneficiaries of the GM bailout resides in Ohio, a state that has had the administration’s strategic attention since its reelection campaign began in November 2008. But in case that largesse wasn’t enough to secure their support in November 2012, a large concentration of the beneficiaries of a successful U.S. WTO complaint also resides in Ohio, which is where – by Jove – the president was speaking when word of the WTO complaint became public.   
  
It is all exasperating, no doubt.   
  
But the bigger and more disconcerting story in all of this is the apparent ascendancy of economic nationalism within the GOP. Romney’s persistence in trying to brand himself the ""most protectionist"" or ""biggest China basher"" in the presidential race sort of forced Obama to bring the WTO case -- or at least expedited the timetable. Have you seen the Romney ads? Have you read the shrill RNC taunts that cite the widely-discredited, union-funded Economic Policy Institute’s figures on job losses caused by trade with China? Strange bedfellows, indeed!   
  
It was once the case – not too long ago – that Republican candidates argued in support of trade and the freedom of Americans to partake of the opportunities afforded by the global economy. But things, apparently, have changed. The nationalistic strains within the Republican Party have strengthened since 2009. I explained why this was happening in this 2010 Cato paper, which is excerpted below: 



Frictions in the U.S.-China relationship are nothing new, but they have intensified in recent months. Tensions that were managed adeptly in the past are multiplying, and the tenor of official dialogue and public discourse has become more strident. Lately, the media have spilled lots of ink over the proposition that China has thrived at U.S. expense for too long, and that China’s growing assertiveness signals an urgent need for aggressive U.S. policy changes. Once-respected demarcations between geopolitical and economic aspects of the relationship have been blurred. In fact, economic frictions are now more likely to be cast in the context of our geopolitical differences, which often serves to overstate the challenges and obscure the solutions.   
  
A sign of the times is a recent commentary by _Washington Post_ columnist Robert J. Samuelson, in which he declares: ""China’s worldview threatens America’s geopolitical and economic interests."" That statement would seem to support a course of action very different from the course implied by the same columnist 18 months earlier, when he wrote, ""Globalization means interdependence; major nations ignore that at their peril."" That change of heart appears to be contagious.   
  
Understandably, there is angst among the U.S. public, who hear frequently that China will soon surpass the United States in one economic superlative after another. Some worry that China’s rise will impair America’s capacity to fulfill or pursue its traditional geopolitical objectives. And those concerns are magnified by a media that cannot resist tempting the impulses of U.S. nationalism. Woven into stories about China’s frantic pace of development are reminders that the Chinese have not forgotten their two-century slumber—a period of humiliation and exploitation by foreign powers.   
  
A recent _National Journal_ cover story describing areas of bilateral policy contention—which the article laments as ""frustrating"" the fact that U.S. experts see ""few alternatives to continued engagement"" —features three menacing photographs of Chinese military formations, one picture of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il flanked by members of the Chinese military, and one photo of the Chinese foreign minister shaking hands with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.   
  
Subtly, and sometimes not, the media and politicians are brandishing the image of an adversarial China. In Chinese reluctance to oblige U.S. policy wishes, we are told that China selfishly follows a ""China-First"" policy. In the increasing willingness of Chinese officials to criticize U.S. policies, we are told of a new ""triumphalism"" in China. In the reportedly shabby treatment of President Obama by his Chinese hosts on his recent trip to Beijing, we are told that the ""Chinese have an innate sense of superiority."" But indignation among media and politicians over China’s aversion to saying ""How high?"" when the U.S. government says ""Jump!"" is not a persuasive argument for a more provocative posture.   
  
China is a sovereign nation. Its government, like the U.S. government, pursues policies that it believes to be in its own interests (although those policies—with respect to both governments—are not always in the best interests of their people). Realists understand that objectives of the U.S. and Chinese governments will not always be the same, thus U.S. and Chinese policies will not always be congruous. Accentuating and cultivating the areas of agreement, while resolving or minimizing the differences, is the essence of diplomacy and statecraft. These tactics must continue to underpin a U.S. policy of engagement with China.



In this campaign, the RNC seems to be fighting to position itself to the protectionist side of Obama, daring the president to take action – a dare the president has accepted, inflating his political credit in places like Ohio. In response to Governor Romney’s assertion that the president had been soft on China and that he, Romney, would label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, Obama created the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center, which resonated politically with the target audience. While the challenger blathers about the president’s alleged fecklessness in dealing with China, the president responds by bringing new WTO cases against Beijing. The most recent complaint, relative to the strident tack Mitt Romney is advocating, is the more responsible, more pro-market course of action. If Romney is to be believed, his trade actions would have far worse consequences for the economy.   
  
Instead of focusing on the real sources of economic stagnation in the United States – including the uncertain business climate inspired by the bailouts, the proliferation of costly and superfluous new environmental, health, and financial regulations, a tax code that is in constant flux, frivolous torts, an education monopoly that fails to produce enough talent backstopped by an immigration system that chases it away – Mitt Romney has chosen to blame America’s woes on China. THAT is the message the Republican presidential candidate, with the full backing of the RNC, brings to the voters in Ohio, whose fortunes are increasingly tied to America’s engagement in the global economy. As of July, Ohio’s unemployment rate was 7.2 percent, more than one full percentage point lower than the U.S. rate of 8.3%. Ohio’s economy is growing on account of trade – particularly with China, the state’s third largest market and destination of $2.7 billion worth of Ohio’s output in 2011. Just look at this bar chart that depicts the importance of China to Ohio, and conversely, the costs of a real bilateral trade war.   
  
Governor Romney should ditch his trade warrior schtick pronto, and start explaining to the electorate how pro-trade policies – including the freedom of corporations to invest abroad (to offshore a la Bain Capital)– help enlarge the economic pie. Puffing out the chest to appear the biggest protectionist in the race is bad economics and bad politics.

"David Shepard, a film preservationist who restored hundreds of discarded, hidden or forgotten films by masters like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and F. W. Murnau and packaged rarities for the consumer market, died on Jan. 31 in Medford, Ore. He was 76. The cause was cancer, said his brother, Donald. The era of Valentino and Fairbanks had been over for decades when Mr. Shepard, barely in his teens, began buying old films, reel by reel, with money earned from his paper route. He had been bitten by the bug when his uncle Myron, a photographer in the Signal Corps, brought home a projector and a boxful of films from France after World War II  —   abridged versions of Fritz Lang’s “Metropolis” and Georges Méliès’s experimental “A Trip to the Moon,” among others. They kindled an enthusiasm that only grew with time. Working for the American Film Institute and later for Blackhawk Films, which reproduced old films for the collectors’ market, Mr. Shepard began searching out movies that had been languishing in studio vaults or private collections and bringing them in for restoration. By trial and error, he developed techniques now used widely in commercial preservation laboratories. In 1989, after acquiring Blackhawk’s library, he created his own company, Film Preservation Associates. Over the years, he restored or made available many of the silent films now found in DVD and video libraries, including the 12 shorts that Charlie Chaplin made for the Mutual Film Corporation in 1916 and 1917, Murnau’s 1927 masterpiece “Sunrise,” all of Buster Keaton’s independent films of the 1920s, and Soviet silent films from the same decade. For many films, he commissioned new musical scores. One of his most stunning efforts was the restoration of the French filmmaker Abel Gance’s “La Roue” (“The Wheel”). Originally shown in 1923 over three days, it was cut down to two and half hours for commercial distribution, and the original was subsequently lost. Mr. Shepard, with the archivist Eric Lange, reassembled a      version from five different prints, released in 2008 by Flicker Alley. “If you’ve seen a superior print of a film by Chaplin or Keaton, Griffith or Murnau, chances are David had a hand in restoring it,” the film critic Leonard Maltin recently wrote on his blog. Just as important, Mr. Shepard brought films out of the archives and to the general public, building on the work of the pioneer revivalist Kevin Brownlow. “He was able to build an audience for silent film and keep it going,” Jeffrey Vance, a film historian who has written books on Chaplin, Keaton and Harold Lloyd, said in an interview. “He made silent films available to everyone. ” David Haspel Shepard was born on Oct. 22, 1940, in Manhattan and grew up, from the age of 11, in Tenafly, N. J. His father, Bertram, was an executive with the Grand Union grocery chain his mother, the former Marjorie Markley, was a homemaker.’ ”He was film crazy from his earliest years, with a connoisseur’s bent that his father indulged by taking him to the film programs at the Museum of Modern Art. After buying a   projector at 12, he discovered that film rental companies, hard hit by television, were selling off their stocks, and he began acquiring films for $1 a reel.” ’In junior high and high school, he filmed football games for the coaches to study. In the   he used the camera to make his own films with student actors. Mr. Shepard earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and religion from Hamilton College in Clinton, N. Y. in 1962 and a master’s in American studies from the University of Pennsylvania a year later. He was teaching theater and film at Pennsylvania State University in 1968 when the fledgling American Film Institute hired him to seek out historically significant films from studios and collectors, with the aim of having them donated to the institute for preservation and archiving. In an early coup, he persuaded Paramount Pictures to turn over the 200 silent features it had in storage in Fort Lee, N. J. After five years, he went to work for Blackhawk, in Davenport, Iowa, as head of product development. It was there that he led the project to acquire and restore Chaplin’s Mutual shorts, in which Chaplin’s Little Tramp character evolved from a purely slapstick figure to a rich, comedic personality. Mr. Shepard was hired by the Directors Guild of America in 1976 to oversee special projects, notably a series of oral histories with directors like King Vidor and Henry King. In the 1980s, he began teaching film history at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the School of Cinema and Television at the University of Southern California. In 1977, he married Kimberly Fetter, who had worked with him at Blackhawk. The marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his brother, he is survived by a son, Ben Baker. Pinched by competition from the video market, Blackhawk Films closed in 1987 and offered Mr. Shepard its equipment for scrap value. He bought an industrial building to house it, and to pay off the building he began doing commercial preservation and restoration work. Soon after, he acquired Blackhawk’s film library, which became the basis for Film Preservation Associates. The company worked with distributors like Kino International and Flicker Alley. Many of the titles were released in box sets, including “Masterworks of D. W. Griffith,” “The Art of Buster Keaton,” “The Golden Age of German Cinema,” “Cecil B. De Mille: The Visionary Years,” “Douglas Fairbanks: King of Hollywood” and “Georges Méliès: First Wizard of the Cinema. ” In 2006, the National Society of Film Critics gave its Film Heritage Award to Mr. Shepard and his collaborators  —   Anthology Film Archives and the film restorer Bruce Posner  —   for the   collection “Unseen Cinema: American   Films. ” Mr. Shepard, who lived in Hat Creek, Calif. had his fair share of serendipity along the way. Raoul Walsh’s first film, “Regeneration” (1915) sometimes credited as the first gangster feature, simply fell into his lap when a meter reader from Missoula, Mont. contacted him about some films he had stumbled across in a building scheduled for demolition. “When he went to read the meters for the last time, the tenants were gone but the films were still there, so he took them,” Mr. Shepard told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. “He called me looking for someone to preserve them. ” Better yet, he told the newspaper in 1999, while he was visiting a colleague in France in the early 1970s, a boy rode up on a bicycle balancing a box of films on the handlebars. He had recently retrieved them from the family farm in Normandy. Among the films was an original print of “The Tramp,” which Chaplin had made at Essanay Studios in 1915. “You couldn’t stage this in a bad play,” Mr. Shepard said."

From the American Chemical Society, something interesting.
A new anti-frost and anti-fog coating for glass
In an advance toward glass that remains clear under the harshest of conditions, scientists are reporting development of a new water-repellant coating that resists both fogging and frosting. Their research on the coating, which could have uses ranging from automobile windshields to camera lenses, appears in the journal ACS Nano.
Michael F. Rubner, Robert E. Cohen and colleagues point out that anti-fogging coatings that absorb water have been the focus of attention lately because of their ability to reduce light scattering and the resultant distortion caused by condensation. However, under extreme fogging conditions, these surfaces may frost and become foggy. They set out to make a better coating to withstand the aggressive conditions.

Their report describes development and testing of a new coating that rapidly absorbs water molecules that cannot freeze in the coating. At the same time, the coating has a water-repelling or hydrophobic effect to larger water droplets. The hydrophobic character means that water droplets do not spread extensively on the coating but essentially remain as flattened droplets.

The paper (which I had to dig up since it wasn’t included in the press release, sigh….) is here:
Zwitter-Wettability and Antifogging Coatings with Frost-Resisting Capabilities
Abstract:
Antifogging coatings with hydrophilic or even superhydrophilic wetting behavior have received significant attention due to their ability to reduce light scattering by film-like condensation. However, under aggressive fogging conditions, these surfaces may exhibit frost formation or excess and nonuniform water condensation, which results in poor optical performance of the coating. In this paper, we show that a zwitter-wettable surface, a surface that has the ability to rapidly absorb molecular water from the environment while simultaneously appearing hydrophobic when probed with water droplets, can be prepared by using hydrogen-bonding-assisted layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). An additional step of functionalizing the nano-blended PVA/PAA multilayer with poly(ethylene glycol methyl ether) (PEG) segments produced a significantly enhanced antifog and frost-resistant behavior. The addition of the PEG segments was needed to further increase the nonfreezing water capacity of the multilayer film. The desirable high-optical quality of these thin films arises from the nanoscale control of the macromolecular complexation process that is afforded by the LbL processing scheme. An experimental protocol that not only allows for the exploration of a variety of aggressive antifogging challenges but also enables quantitative analysis of the antifogging performance via real-time monitoring of transmission levels as well as image distortion is also described.

Responding to the worldwide refugee crisis—which the United Nations has called “the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era”—President Obama vowed last September that the United States would accept 10,000 Syrian refugees and 85,000 refugees total over the following 12 months. With much fanfare, the State Department hit its Syrian refugee quota this week. But with just one month left, it is still 15,000 short of its overall target, and if it continues at its current pace, it will come up 3,000 short.   
  
But here are seven reasons why hitting the target would be a major accomplishment.   
  
**1) A slow start** : The biggest reason that the State Department is cutting it close is that it suffered one of its slowest starts in recent years. In the prior three fiscal years (FYs), the refugee target was 70,000, and yet even with a higher goal this year, the United States had accepted fewer refugees at the midpoint of this year than at the same time in any of those years (the purple bolded line in the chart below). While the United States has usually ramped up slightly during the second half of prior years, it has taken an historic effort to catch up this year.

**2) Most refugees in a month ever:** If the United States is to reach its goal this year, it will need to accept nearly 15,000 refugees in September. This is more than any month that the State Department has made available since 2001 and possibly the most ever. Although month-by-month statistics are unavailable for the record year of FY 1992 when the United States admitted 132,000 refugees, the average monthly intake was only 11,000, making it possible that this September will be the most ambitious month in history.   
  
**3) Late planning** : A major reason for the slow start is that the agencies had planned throughout FY 2015 to accept only 75,000 in FY 2016. It was not until two weeks before the start of the year that Secretary of State John Kerry changed course and decided to increase the number by 10,000. The agencies scrambled to adjust, but it took time to ramp up. “As an operational person and for planning purposes, I had anticipated an increase from 70,000 to 75,000,” Barbara Strack, Refugee Affairs Division Chief of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), told Congress on October 1st last year. In order to meet the goal, the agency needed to “surge” hundreds of refugee officers into Jordan from February to April to conduct enough interviews to meet the goal.



 **4) No new money** : The agencies are already on pace to admit 12,000 more refugees this year than last year, despite receiving no new funding to do so. The agencies actually did not ask for new money. The State Department’s representative Larry Bartlett told Congress in October that the department was “looking for efficiencies across its programs.” Ms. Strack told Congress that USCIS believed that there was “sufficient funding… to cover the 85,000 anticipated admissions in FY ‘16 by reprioritizing between programs.” But again, reprioritizations and efficiencies take time, and the lack of new money likely delayed their ability to ramp up, making the accomplishment all the more impressive.   
  
**5) Humanitarian emergencies everywhere** : On top of these 85,000 refugees, the Office of Refugee Resettlement will also have to deal with the most Cuban arrivals since 1980, the most asylum-seekers at the border claiming a credible fear of persecution in their home countries ever, and a massive influx of unaccompanied immigrant children. The administration warned Congress as early as December that it may fall short of the money needed to handle the number of unaccompanied children, and that has in the past resulted in money being taken from the refugee program.   
  
**6) The most difficult cases** : Assuming that it takes in as many as it did last month, the United States is on pace to accept roughly 13,000 Syrian refugees this year, which is more than 5 times the amount it admitted last year. These cases require the highest level of security review. USCIS’s Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate conducts enhanced reviews of Syrian refugee cases that require more manpower than the typical refugee case. They employ surveillance to check any factually verifiable claim that the refugee makes during the process. This leads to higher rejection rates, which also makes these cases much more difficult to process.   
  
**7) Hostile political climate** : Maybe this goes without saying, but it has taken political determination to effectuate a 21 percent increase in the number of refugees in the face of congressional opposition and, at times, even public opposition. In 1980, Congress entrusted the president with the responsibility, after hearings with Congress, to raise the refugee goal precisely in order to insulate the decision-making from such political whims. The fact that the president has exercised the authority deserves credit.   




This achievement, however, should be seen in context: 85,000 refugees is 0.13 percent of the total number of forcibly displaced persons around the world this year who have fled their homes to escape violence and persecution. The president’s current goal for FY 2017 is 100,000, which is still lower than the share of refugees worldwide that the country has taken historically. I have argued that this number could be increased through exempting refugees from the normal immigration quotas and admitting refugees with private sponsors, neither of which would require more money from Congress.

"Ice cores are cylinders of ice drilled from glaciers and ice sheets. When snow falls it takes with it a record of many aspects of the atmosphere. As long as no melting takes place, this information is preserved as each layer of snow is buried by successive snowfalls from year to year. By drilling into the ice sheet, we can recover a chronological archive of the atmosphere. Most ice cores are recovered from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. However, it is also possible to obtain cores from glaciers at high altitudes at lower latitudes for example, in the Alps, Andes and Himalaya mountains. In the two large polar ice sheets, the ice may be more than 3000m deep.   Cores are recovered using drills that collect typically 3m of ice at a time, in a cylinder often 10cm in diameter. The drill is on the end of a cable: it is lowered to the depth of the previous collection, where it grips the side of the hole so that an inner section, with drill teeth on the lower end, can rotate. The teeth cut a ring of chippings, so that a cylinder of ice fills the inside of the drill barrel.  This is then taken to the surface.   Because ice deforms under pressure, the hole has to be filled with an inert fluid that keeps it from closing. The ice cores are then kept cold, in insulated boxes inside freezers, while they are transported from Greenland and Antarctica to laboratories of universities and research institutes for analysis. The ice can be dated by various methods – in favourable cases it is possible to find a chemical whose concentration varies from summer to winter, so that each year can be counted. However often more complex methods are used to determine the age.  The oldest ice recovered in an ice core so far is 800,000 years in Antarctica and 128,000 years in Greenland. The ice can be analysed for its physical properties (such as electrical conductivity), and sections are melted for chemical analysis. Information is held in three forms: The water molecules of the ice itself are not all the same – they come in various isotopic forms. The ratio between the different isotopes is used to determine the temperature at the time the snow fell. Various chemicals are trapped with the snow at the surface of the ice sheet. For example, after large volcanic eruptions, sulfuric acid is deposited from the atmosphere and shows up in ice cores as clear spikes in sulfate concentration against a relatively flat background.  As the layers of snow are buried the individual crystals of snow eventually (at somewhere between 60 and 100m deep) join together to form a solid matrix of ice with air bubbles trapped inside. These air bubbles contain a sample of all the stable gases in the air from the time that it compacted including nitrogen, oxygen and argon. They can be cracked open for analysis.  Ice cores are a very important source of information about the past. They are the main archive of information about temperature and snowfall rates in the polar regions, as well as our only direct record of atmospheric composition before the middle of the 20th century. Numerous chemicals can be measured that give information about the extent of past sea ice, volcanic activity, the strength of the sun, winds and many other environmental parameters. Information from ice cores is then complemented by other palaeoclimate archives such as marine sediments, corals, tree rings and speleothems (mineral deposits that form in caves such as stalactites). Numerous major scientific findings have emerged from ice cores. Carbon dioxide concentrations were fairly steady at around 280 parts per million in the millenium before 1800, but have risen to nearly 400 parts per million since then. This reveals the extent that industrialisation has added CO2 to the atmosphere, and clarifies how unusual recent changes are compared to the small and slow natural variations throughout history. At a much longer timescale, Antarctic ice cores have shown that temperatures there, like many other climate signals, varied between warm interglacial periods and cold “ice ages” roughly every 100,000 years. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the ice tracked faithfully with the temperature changes. The CO2 increases at the end of each cold period helped to amplify small regional changes in climate into the large global changes that led Earth into and out of ice ages. Ice cores therefore play an important role in adding to our understanding of the Earth’s climate through the ages and help us confirm and map how the climate has evolved. Unfortunately they don’t give much of a forecast for the future, however, because the ice core era does not contain concentrations of CO2 comparable to now and the future."
"Over the past two centuries, millions of dedicated people – revolutionaries, activists, politicians, and theorists – have been unable to curb the disastrous and increasingly globalised trajectory of economic polarisation and ecological degradation. This is perhaps because we are utterly trapped in flawed ways of thinking about technology and economy – as the current discourse on climate change shows. Rising greenhouse gas emissions are not just generating climate change. They are giving more and more of us climate anxiety. Doomsday scenarios are capturing the headlines at an accelerating rate. Scientists from all over the world tell us that emissions in ten years must be half of what they were ten years ago, or we face apocalypse. School children like Greta Thunberg and activist movements like Extinction Rebellion are demanding that we panic. And rightly so. But what should we do to avoid disaster? Most scientists, politicians, and business leaders tend to put their hope in technological progress. Regardless of ideology, there is a widespread expectation that new technologies will replace fossil fuels by harnessing renewable energy such as solar and wind. Many also trust that there will be technologies for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and for “geoengineering” the Earth’s climate. The common denominator in these visions is the faith that we can save modern civilisation if we shift to new technologies. But “technology” is not a magic wand. It requires a lot of money, which means claims on labour and resources from other areas. We tend to forget this crucial fact.

      Should we engineer the climate? A social scientist and natural scientist discuss


 I would argue that the way we take conventional “all-purpose” money for granted is the main reason why we have not understood how advanced technologies are dependent on the appropriation of labour and resources from elsewhere. In making it possible to exchange almost anything – human time, gadgets, ecosystems, whatever – for anything else on the market, people are constantly looking for the best deals, which ultimately means promoting the lowest wages and the cheapest resources in the global South.  It is the logic of money that has created the utterly unsustainable and growth-hungry global society that exists today. To get our globalised economy to respect natural limits, we must set limits to what can be exchanged. Unfortunately, it seems increasingly probable that we shall have to experience something closer to disaster – such as a semi-global harvest failure – before we are prepared to seriously question how money and markets are currently designed. This article is part of Conversation Insights
The Insights team generates long-form journalism derived from interdisciplinary research. The team is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects aimed at tackling societal and scientific challenges.  Take the ultimate issue we are facing: whether our modern, global, and growing economy can be powered by renewable energy. Among most champions of sustainability, such as advocates of a Green New Deal, there is an unshakeable conviction that the problem of climate change can be solved by engineers.  What generally divides ideological positions is not the faith in technology as such, but which technical solutions to choose, and whether they will require major political change. Those who remain sceptical to the promises of technology – such as advocates of radical downshifting or degrowth – tend to be marginalised from politics and the media. So far, any politician who seriously advocates degrowth is not likely to have a future in politics.  Mainstream optimism about technology is often referred to as ecomodernism. The Ecomodernist Manifesto, a concise statement of this approach published in 2015, asks us to embrace technological progress, which will give us “a good, or even great, Anthropocene”. It argues that the progress of technology has “decoupled” us from the natural world and should be allowed to continue to do so in order to allow the “rewilding” of nature. The growth of cities, industrial agriculture, and nuclear power, it claims, illustrate such decoupling. As if these phenomena did not have ecological footprints beyond their own boundaries.

 Meanwhile, calls for a Green New Deal have been voiced for more than a decade, but in February 2019 it took the form of a resolution to the American House of Representatives. Central to its vision is a large-scale shift to renewable energy sources and massive investments in new infrastructure. This would enable further growth of the economy, it is argued.  So the general consensus seems to be that the problem of climate change is just a question of replacing one energy technology with another. But a historical view reveals that the very idea of technology is inextricably intertwined with capital accumulation, unequal exchange and the idea of all-purpose money. And as such, it is not as easy to redesign as we like to think. Shifting the main energy technology is not just a matter of replacing infrastructure – it means transforming the economic world order. In the 19th century, the industrial revolution gave us the notion that technological progress is simply human ingenuity applied to nature, and that it has nothing to do with the structure of world society. This is the mirror image of the economists’ illusion, that growth has nothing to do with nature and so does not need to reckon with natural limits. Rather than seeing that both technology and economy span the nature-society divide, engineering is thought of as dealing only with nature and economics as dealing only with society. The steam engine, for instance, is simply considered an ingenious invention for harnessing the chemical energy of coal. I am not denying that this is the case, but steam technology in early industrial Britain was also contingent on capital accumulated on global markets. The steam-driven factories in Manchester would never have been built without the triangular Atlantic trade in slaves, raw cotton, and cotton textiles. Steam technology was not just a matter of ingenious engineering applied to nature – like all complex technology, it was also crucially dependent on global relations of exchange. This dependence of technology on global social relations is not just a matter of money. In quite a physical sense, the viability of the steam engine relied on the flows of human labour energy and other resources that had been invested in cotton fibre from South Carolina, in the US, coal from Wales and iron from Sweden. Modern technology, then, is a product of the metabolism of world society, not simply the result of uncovering “facts” of nature. The illusion that we have suffered from since the industrial revolution is that technological change is simply a matter of engineering knowledge, regardless of the patterns of global material flows. This is particularly problematic in that it makes us blind to how such flows tend to be highly uneven.  This is not just true of the days of the British Empire. To this day, technologically advanced areas of the world are net importers of the resources that have been used as inputs in producing their technologies and other commodities, such as land, labour, materials, and energy. Technological progress and capital accumulation are two sides of the same coin. But the material asymmetries in world trade are invisible to mainstream economists, who focus exclusively on flows of money.

 Ironically, this understanding of technology is not even recognised in Marxist theory, although it claims to be both materialist and committed to social justice. Marxist theory and politics tend toward what opponents refer to as a Promethean faith in technological progress. Its concern with justice focuses on the emancipation of the industrial worker, rather than on the global flows of resources that are embodied in the industrial machine.  This Marxist faith in the magic of technology occasionally takes extreme forms, as in the case of the biologist David Schwartzman, who does not hesitate to predict future human colonisation of the galaxy and Aaron Bastani, who anticipates mining asteroids. In his remarkable book Fully Automated Luxury Communism: A Manifesto, Bastani repeats a widespread claim about the cheapness of solar power that shows how deluded most of us are by the idea of technology. Nature, he writes, “provides us with virtually free, limitless energy”. This was a frequently voiced conviction already in 1964, when the chemist Farrington Daniels proclaimed that the “most plentiful and cheapest energy is ours for the taking”. More than 50 years later, the dream persists. Electricity globally represents about 19% of total energy use – the other major energy drains being transports and industry. In 2017, only 0.7% of global energy use derived from solar power and 1.9% from wind, while 85% relied on fossil fuels. As much as 90% of world energy use derives from fossil sources, and this share is actually increasing. So why is the long-anticipated transition to renewable energy not materialising?  One highly contested issue is the land requirements for harnessing renewable energy. Energy experts like David MacKay and Vaclav Smil have estimated that the “power density” – the watts of energy that can be harnessed per unit of land area – of renewable energy sources is so much lower than that of fossil fuels that to replace fossil with renewable energy would require vastly greater land areas for capturing energy.  In part because of this issue, visions of large-scale solar power projects have long referred to the good use to which they could put unproductive areas like the Sahara desert. But doubts about profitability have discouraged investments. A decade ago, for example, there was much talk about Desertec, a €400 billion project that crumbled as the major investors pulled out, one by one.  Today the world’s largest solar energy project is Ouarzazate Solar Power Station in Morocco. It covers about 25 square kilometres and has cost around US$9 billion to build. It is designed to provide around a million people with electricity, which means that another 35 such projects – that is, US$315 billion of investments – would be required merely to cater to the population of Morocco. We tend not to see that the enormous investments of capital needed for such massive infrastructural projects represent claims on resources elsewhere – they have huge footprints beyond our field of vision.  Also, we must consider whether solar is really carbon free. As Smil has shown for wind turbines and Storm van Leeuwen for nuclear power, the production, installation, and maintenance of any technological infrastructure remains critically dependent on fossil energy. Of course, it is easy to retort that until the transition has been made, solar panels are going to have to be produced by burning fossil fuels. But even if 100% of our electricity were renewable, it would not be able to propel global transports or cover the production of steel and cement for urban-industrial infrastructure. And given the fact that the cheapening of solar panels in recent years to a significant extent is the result of shifting manufacture to Asia, we must ask ourselves whether European and American efforts to become sustainable should really be based on the global exploitation of low-wage labour, scarce resources and abused landscapes elsewhere.

      Lithium is finite – but clean technology relies on such non-renewable resources


 Solar power is not displacing fossil energy, only adding to it. And the pace of expansion of renewable energy capacity has stalled – it was about the same in 2018 as in 2017. Meanwhile, our global combustion of fossil fuels continues to rise, as do our carbon emissions. Because this trend seems unstoppable, many hope to see extensive use of technologies for capturing and removing the carbon from the emissions of power plants and factories. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) remains an essential component of the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change. But to envisage such technologies as economically accessible at a global scale is clearly unrealistic. To collect the atoms of carbon dispersed by the global combustion of fossil fuels would be as energy-demanding and economically unfeasible as it would be to try to collect the molecules of rubber from car tires that are continuously being dispersed in the atmosphere by road friction.  The late economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen used this example to show that economic processes inevitably lead to entropy – that is, an increase in physical disorder and loss of productive potential. In not grasping the implications of this fact, we continue to imagine some miraculous new technology that will reverse the Law of Entropy.  Economic “value” is a cultural idea. An implication of the Law of Entropy is that productive potential in nature – the force of energy or the quality of materials – is systematically lost as value is being produced. This perspective turns our economic worldview upside down. Value is measured in money, and money shapes the way we think about value. Economists are right in that value should be defined in terms of human preferences, rather than inputs of labour or resources, but the result is that the more value we produce, the more inexpensive labour, energy and other resources are required. To curb the relentless growth of value – at the expense of the biosphere and the global poor – we must create an economy that can restrain itself. Much of the discussion on climate change suggests that we are on a battlefield, confronting evil people who want to obstruct our path to an ecological civilisation. But the concept of capitalism tends to mystify how we are all caught in a game defined by the logic of our own constructions – as if there was an abstract “system” and its morally despicable proponents to blame. Rather than see the very design of the money game as the real antagonist, our call to arms tends to be directed at the players who have had best luck with the dice. I would instead argue that the ultimate obstruction is not a question of human morality but of our common faith in what Marx called “money fetishism”. We collectively delegate responsibility for our future to a mindless human invention – what Karl Polanyi called all-purpose money, the peculiar idea that anything can be exchanged for anything else. The aggregate logic of this relatively recent idea is precisely what is usually called “capitalism”. It defines the strategies of corporations, politicians, and citizens alike. All want their money assets to grow. The logic of the global money game obviously does not provide enough incentives to invest in renewables. It generates greed, obscene and rising inequalities, violence, and environmental degradation, including climate change. But mainstream economics appears to have more faith in setting this logic free than ever. Given the way the economy is now organised, it does not see an alternative to obeying the logic of the globalised market. The only way to change the game is to redesign its most basic rules. To attribute climate change to an abstract system called capitalism – but without challenging the idea of all-purpose money – is to deny our own agency. The “system” is perpetuated every time we buy our groceries, regardless of whether we are radical activists or climate change deniers. It is difficult to identify culprits if we are all players in the same game. In agreeing to the rules, we have limited our potential collective agency. We have become the tools and servants of our own creation – all-purpose money. Despite good intentions, it is not clear what Thunberg, Extinction Rebellion and the rest of the climate movement are demanding should be done. Like most of us, they want to stop the emissions of greenhouse gases, but seem to believe that such an energy transition is compatible with money, globalised markets, and modern civilisation.  Is our goal to overthrow “the capitalist mode of production”? If so, how do we go about doing that? Should we blame the politicians for not confronting capitalism and the inertia of all-purpose money? Or – which should follow automatically – should we blame the voters? Should we blame ourselves for not electing politicians that are sincere enough to advocate reducing our mobility and levels of consumption? Many believe that with the right technologies we would not have to reduce our mobility or energy consumption – and that the global economy could still grow. But to me that is an illusion. It suggests that we have not yet grasped what “technology” is. Electric cars and many other “green” devices may seem reassuring but are often revealed to be insidious strategies for displacing work and environmental loads beyond our horizon – to unhealthy, low-wage labour in mines in Congo and Inner Mongolia. They look sustainable and fair to their affluent users but perpetuate a myopic worldview that goes back to the invention of the steam engine. I have called this delusion machine fetishism.  So the first thing we should redesign are the economic ideas that brought fossil-fueled technology into existence and continue to perpetuate it. “Capitalism” ultimately refers to the artefact or idea of all-purpose money, which most of us take for granted as being something about which we do not have a choice. But we do, and this must be recognised. Since the 19th century, all-purpose money has obscured the unequal resource flows of colonialism by making them seem reciprocal: money has served as a veil that mystifies exploitation by representing it as fair exchange. Economists today reproduce this 19th-century mystification, using a vocabulary that has proven useless in challenging global problems of justice and sustainability. The policies designed to protect the environment and promote global justice have not curbed the insidious logic of all-purpose money – which is to increase environmental degradation as well as economic inequalities. In order to see that all-purpose money is indeed the fundamental problem, we need to see that there are alternative ways of designing money and markets. Like the rules in a board game, they are human constructions and can, in principle, be redesigned. In order to accomplish economic “degrowth” and curb the treadmill of capital accumulation, we must transform the systemic logic of money itself.  National authorities might establish a complementary currency, alongside regular money, that is distributed as a universal basic income but that can only be used to buy goods and services that are produced within a given radius from the point of purchase. This is not “local money” in the sense of LETS or the Bristol Pound – which in effect do nothing to impede the expansion of the global market – but a genuine spanner in the wheel of globalisation. With local money you can buy goods produced on the other side of the planet, as long as you buy it in a local store. What I am suggesting is special money that can only be used to buy goods produced locally. This would help decrease demand for global transports – a major source of greenhouse gas emissions – while increasing local diversity and resilience and encouraging community integration. It would no longer make low wages and lax environmental legislation competitive advantages in world trade, as is currently the case.  Immunising local communities and ecosystems from the logic of globalised capital flows may be the only feasible way of creating a truly “post-capitalist” society that respects planetary boundaries and does not generate deepening global injustices. Re-localising the bulk of the economy in this way does not mean that communities won’t need electricity, for example, to run hospitals, computers and households. But it would dismantle most of the global, fossil-fuelled infrastructure for transporting people, groceries and other commodities around the planet. This means decoupling human subsistence from fossil energy and re-embedding humans in their landscapes and communities. In completely changing market structures of demand, such a shift would not require anyone – corporations, politicians, or citizens – to choose between fossil and solar energy, as two comparable options with different profit margins.  To return to the example of Morocco, solar power will obviously have an important role to play in generating indispensable electricity, but to imagine that it will be able to provide anything near current levels of per capita energy use in the global North is wholly unrealistic. A transition to solar energy should not simply be about replacing fossil fuels, but about reorganising the global economy. Solar power will no doubt be a vital component of humanity’s future, but not as long as we allow the logic of the world market to make it profitable to transport essential goods halfway around the world. The current blind faith in technology will not save us. For the planet to stand any chance, the global economy must be redesigned. The problem is more fundamental than capitalism or the emphasis on growth: it is money itself, and how money is related to technology. Climate change and the other horrors of the Anthropocene don’t just tell us to stop using fossil fuels – they tell us that globalisation itself is unsustainable.

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

"Music was not only Walter Hautzig’s vocation. It also won over the young woman who would become his wife. And it saved his life. Mr. Hautzig, a concert pianist who escaped from   Vienna as a teenager armed with a fellowship from the Jerusalem Conservatory and went on to become a touring musical   ambassador, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 95. The cause was congestive heart failure, his daughter, Deborah Hautzig, said. Only five years after he blustered his way into an audition with the conservatory’s director in 1938, the    Mr. Hautzig made his American debut at Town Hall in New York with an ambitious program of Bach, Beethoven and Chopin. A reviewer for The New York Times said it “augured a brilliant career. ” Years later, Mr. Hautzig recalled, “My father said I should be a doctor or a lawyer, but after Town Hall, he never left the house without the New York Times review in his pocket. ” Mr. Hautzig (pronounced  ) won the 1943 Town Hall Endowment Series Award for best young artist that year. He later became a cultural ambassador for the United States, performing around the world for three decades. In the 1950s he performed frequently in Japan under State Department sponsorship. In 1979, after relations thawed, he was the first American artist officially delegated to perform in mainland China. “Beethoven and Chopin are as good for the Asians as for the Europeans as for the Jews as for the gentiles,” he told The Forward in 2007. He refused, however, to perform before a racially segregated audience in Alabama in the 1940s. “He told the concert manager, ‘You’re as bad as the Nazis! ’” Ms. Hautzig, his daughter, recalled in her eulogy at his funeral on Thursday. “They said, ‘Go back where you came from. ’” While music affected Mr. Hautzig profoundly, the instrument that spared him from Nazi persecution and led to his marriage entered his personal life serendipitously. “His father had had a big success in his business and told my grandmother she had two choices: She could have a fur coat, or she could have a piano,” Ms. Hautzig said in her eulogy. “She chose the piano. ” Her father began playing it when he was 4. Walter Hautzig was born on Sept. 28, 1921, in Vienna to the former Rosa Zwim and David Hautzig, a bookbinder. He studied at the Vienna Academy of Music until the German annexation of Austria capped a period of growing   there, during which he was arrested at least once and also forced to scrub streets on his knees. “They made the world believe that they were Hitler’s first victims, but Hitler’s army was received with kisses,” he said of Austrians. When the music academy was shuttered and seized by German soldiers, he practiced the piano on his own at home. “I said to myself, ‘This they can never take away from me,’” he recalled in a documentary filmed by his granddaughter Molly DeVries. Responding to an advertisement in a Jewish newspaper, he arrived at a Vienna hotel at 8 a. m. to audition for Emil Hauser, director of the Jerusalem Conservatory and a founder of the Budapest String Quartet. Mr. Hauser was not just offering fellowships he was also offering exit visas. Mr. Hauser finally surfaced at 2 p. m. and apologized, saying he had had to rush to another appointment. Audaciously, Mr. Hautzig joined him in a taxi, and when they arrived at a private apartment that happened to have a piano, Mr. Hauser pointed to it and said, “Spiel!” (“Play! ”) Mr. Hautzig performed Beethoven’s “Waldstein” Sonata. “When I finished playing,” Mr. Hautzig said, “he exclaimed, ‘No matter what it takes, I will make sure that you come to Jerusalem. ’” A month later he arrived in what was then Palestine, where he studied under Josef Tal and Alfred Schroeder and performed as a soloist with the Jerusalem Academy Orchestra. After a year and a half, he joined his parents and sister, who had fled through Switzerland, in New York. He studied privately with Artur Schnabel and enrolled in the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He was later a professor of piano at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, from 1960 to 1988. He continued to perform until a few years ago. Returning from Scandinavia, where he performed to raise money for war victims of the Nazis, he met Esther Rudomin. She was on her way to New York from Siberia, where her family had been exiled. She was 16 and seasick. “I played for her the G minor Ballade of Chopin,” Mr. Hautzig said, “and she said, ‘Anybody who plays like that has to be good. ’” They married in 1950. Esther Hautzig, who became an author of children’s books, died in 2009. In addition to his daughter, Mr. Hautzig is survived by a son, David, and three grandchildren. The Hautzigs lived in an Upper West Side apartment building, and Mrs. Hautzig once cited the unique challenges that urban acoustics posed for a professional musician. “A neighbor called and said, ‘Mrs. Hautzig, your husband’s practicing is driving me crazy,’” she recalled. “I gulped and apologized. The neighbor interrupted my apologies: ‘No, what’s he practicing? I know the piece and can’t remember what it is! ’”"

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
It’s a bad week for poor people around the planet. First, and with great fanfare, our President unleashed his patented climate plan, affectionately known as Obama’s War on Coal™. He hasn’t said yet how much Obama’s War on Coal™ will cost, but we can be sure that it will not be cheap. And as in any war, it is guaranteed that the poor will suffer the most.
Sadly, this was followed by even worse news. The World Bank has decided it wants to keep the developing world from having inexpensive electricity. They will not make any more loans for coal-fired power plants.
You remember “inexpensive electricity”? When I was a kid, the US Government used to be in favor of inexpensive electricity, because it was rightly seen as the savior of the poor farmer and the poor housewife. That’s why the Tennessee Valley Authority came to be. I wash the clothes around our house, and I don’t do it by hand. I have inexpensive energy to do that. Now, however, the government and the environmental NGOs and the climate alarmists are doing every single thing that they can to make energy more expensive. And the World Bank has just officially joined the baying chorus.
The World Bank thinks that inexpensive energy will harm the poor … not now, of course, but in fifty years. And on that basis, the World Bank thinks it is justified to harm the poor now.
This is the madness at the base of the climate alarmists policy—it actively harms the poor now, with the justification that it might help their grandkids avoid harm in 50 years.
The wealthy fat-cats running the World Bank are unwilling for school kids in India to have cheap electricity to study by, on the grounds that it might, not will but might, make those students’ grandkids a bit warmer in a century. I doubt that the poor in India would vote for that plan, but I guess the World Bank is our economic paterfamilias who knows what the poor need, much better than the poor know themselves, and it’s not cheap electricity …
The same thing is going on in the US. Where I live, California, the resident burglars are called the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, known as PGE. They are a monopoly utility, and supposedly they are run for the benefit of the ratepayers.
Now, if you had a monopoly public utility for say water, and your water supplier said they were going to charge twenty times the going price for a glass of water if you were really, really thirsty, would you think that was in the public interest?
That’s exactly what’s happening to Anthony, PGE is gouging him on the price because that’s when he really needs the electricity … what kind of a screwed up world has this become? A public utility is supposed to provide cheap energy, not gouge the customers at the time they really need the electricity.
Now, the East Coast and the Powder River country is going to feel the pain, as coal-fired plants close and their electricity costs start to creep up. So, since war has been declared, let’s see if Obama’s War on Coal™ is worth the billions and billions of dollars it will cost … what are we buying for our money?
Well, fortunately I don’t have to go through all the math to figure it out. There is a strong supporter of the Obama climate plan named Chris Hope, who has done the math for us. His blog says:
Chris is a climate change policy researcher, PAGE model developer, and faculty member at Cambridge Judge Business School, interested in environment and energy.
He has used his whiz-bang model to do the calculations. His assumption is that the US will do the following
1) Lower the CO2 emissions to 83% of the 2008 level over the next seven years, and
2) Maintain that low level of emissions for the succeeding 80 years.
Now, absent a huge technological breakthrough or another depression, there’s little chance of us getting to 83% of 2008 emissions in the next seven years.
But that pales before the improbable idea of the US maintaining that low a level of emissions for the next 80 years.
So to start with, we see that Mr. Hope has made the most hopeful assumptions about the climate plan—first that it will meet its initial goal, and second that it will maintain that goal for over three-quarters of a century.
And with those likely unattainable assumptions, what does Mr. Hope calculate as the effect of Obama’s War on Coal™?
Well … um … well, he says that by the year 2100, nearly a century from now, that the temperatures will be much cooler.
…
How much cooler, you ask?
…
Well … two …
…
Two degrees C?
…
Er … no …
…
Oh … so, it’s two tenths of a degree C, then, not two degrees C?
…
Um … no.
…
I have to confess, in writing this I find that I am very reluctant to reveal the expected outcome of Obama’s War on Coal™ for a simple reason—it is at times like this that I’m embarrassed to be an American.
…
Because the reality is that Chris Hope, an ardent supporter of the War on Coal™, using the most optimistic (and unattainable) assumptions, says that IF we win the War on Coal and we put hundreds of people out of work and increase the cost of electricity for poor and wealthy alike (although obviously, Obama and his rich pals don’t care about the cost increase), here’s our prize. Here’s what Chris Hope says we’ve bought for the all the pain and suffering:
In the year 2100 the world might be 0.02°C cooler.
Two hundredths of a degree in a century. Maybe. That’s the prize. That’s what Chris Hope has proudly announced will be the reward for the job loss and the pain and suffering of the poor.
Two hundredths of a degree of cooling. An amount that is far below our ability to even measure …
Me, I think that that one fact alone should be our emblem and our rallying cry in opposition to this gob-smacking lunacy. So the next time someone says they think the War on Coal™ is a brilliant plan, gently point out to them that they are advocating spending billions and billions of dollars to cool the planet by two hundredths of a degree in the year 2100, and in the process harming the poor … and ask if that strikes them as the most rational of plans …
Or you could just shake them until their teeth rattle and say “You think we should spend billions of dollars to cool the planet two hundredths of a degree a century from now, while hurting the poor today? Have you gone barking mad? Billions for a reward that’s too small to be even measured, while pensioners shiver in fuel poverty? Unhand my wallet, you thieving varlet, and slink back to your hole!”
I swear, this unremitting attempt by Obama and the activists and the environmental NGOs to crush the poor back into their hovels, while they proudly declaim the noblest of motives, turns my stomach and threatens to fair unhinge my reason … how can they do that?
Billions and billions of dollars for two hundredths of a degree … bad news, folks, the Emperor not only has no clothes. He’s lost his mind entirely.
Grrrrr, bad for my blood pressure … in any case, here’s what coal did while Obama was declaring war on it …

"**Visitors to a spa town's seafront are not adhering to coronavirus safety measures, councillors have complained.**
Craig Hannaway, who represents Saltburn on Redcar and Cleveland Council, said there were crowds and most were not socially distancing.
Signs on the seafront and promenade were ""very clear, but they are mainly being ignored"", he said.
The council said it had hired seven coronavirus ""ambassadors"" to provide a public presence and give advice.
Another Saltburn councillor, Philip Thomson, said last month he had received numerous reports from residents about people not following the rules.
""Enforcement should be used to make it clear that this is a serious situation,"" he said.
Current guidance is for people to avoid travelling into and out of areas in tier three, which includes Saltburn.
The ambassadors have no enforcement powers, but can report issues to the authority and other agencies, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
Cabinet member for health Steve Kay said the ""vast majority of residents and visitors"" had followed the rules.
""However, the fight is not over and while I absolutely understand people heading to Saltburn, we must remember to socially distance, wear masks at the right time and wash or sanitise our hands,"" he said.Â
The council had put up stickers and signs, he added.
Meanwhile, health bosses at South Tees Hospitals NHS Trust have said they believe it has ""passed the peak"" in this latest spike of cases.
The trust is treating 95 Coved-19 patients as of Tuesday, with 12 in critical care, down from 128 patients and 20 in critical care nine days ago.

Pope Francis’ new encyclical, “Laudato Si,” advocates a new “ecological spirituality.” Unfortunately, this challenging call is diminished by the document’s tendency to devolve into leftish policy positions. The encyclical seriously underestimates the power of market forces to promote environmental ends.



Drawing environmental lines requires balancing such interests as ecology, liberty and prosperity. One cannot merely assume that the correct outcome in every case is more of the first.



Indeed, the pontiff’s own goals conflict. He speaks movingly of the dignity of work and its importance for the poor. But the more expensive and extensive the government controls, the fewer and less remunerative the jobs.



Perhaps most disappointing is how the pope seemingly views capitalism, and especially property rights, as the enemy of a better, cleaner world. Yet most environmental problems reflect the absence of markets and property rights.



The encyclical rightly insists on “the obligation of those who cause pollution to assume its costs.” The best way to achieve this end is to either create or mimic markets and property rights.



For instance, public control rarely ends well. Garrett Hardin famously wrote about the “tragedy of the commons,” in which land open to everyone typically is misused by everyone. Federal range and forest land is badly managed, not because government officials are malign, but because the incentives they face are perverse.



In contrast, a private owner bears both costs and benefits, and suffers when he misuses a resource. The owner may make a mistake, but his power to do harm is sharply limited.



Pollution taxes and tradeable permits attempt to apply market forces to the great common areas, such as air and water. Yet “Laudato Si” launches a perplexing attack on the use of emission credits to limit use of hydro‐​carbons. Properly designed, they create an incentive for those who can control emissions at the least cost to control them the most. This serves the common good far more than imposing greater expense on everyone.



Although the Pope acknowledges “that honest debate must be encouraged among experts, while respecting divergent views,” “Laudato Si” ignores the most sophisticated critiques of climate alarmists. For instance, many critics dispute the likelihood of catastrophic change, and the best means to deal with the likely impact of any temperature increases.



For years, models failed to match climatic behavior. Peer‐​reviewed research increasingly suggests that warming will be modest. Moreover, any prediction today as to conditions decades in the future is a wild guess.



These argue in favor of addressing specific problems rather than imposing arbitrary, draconian, and costly cuts in energy consumption. Economic analysis confirms that adaptation can achieve similar environmental ends at less expense.



The encyclical offers no evidence for its sharp attack on consumption in developed countries, which of course produce more goods than they use. In fact, unowned resources are vulnerable to abuse in any society. Resources priced too cheaply — usually for political reasons — are squandered wherever they are located.



Where markets operate, resource depletion is largely a myth. There now is more recoverable oil than ever. Increasing prices tell consumers to use less, producers to operate more efficiently, suppliers to find new sources, and everyone to seek substitutes.



Markets typically are better than governments in protecting “future generations.” An individual landowner who misuses his property and squanders the resources loses value of his land. By contrast, the typical political time horizon is until the next election.



Economic progress eases the impact of environmental problems on the poor. It also provides resources to enhance the environment, efficiencies to produce more using less, and technologies to better preserve ecological values. New technologies and processes may reduce or counter greenhouse gas emissions.



Of course, markets are not perfect or enough. Government must create a legal and policy framework. Even more important is the moral infrastructure, about which the church should engage the rest of us. “Laudato Si” is part of that dialogue.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNever has such a lousy product been given so many free passes: wind turbines. Yes, they are lousy products – sorry!
In a free market, where poorly performing products get knocked out rapidly, wind turbines still can’t hold a candle to regular power plants. They only survive because of subsidies, and exorbitantly rosy promises.

Burning wind turbine
Germany’s online engineering magazine Ingenieur.de here writes a short, but damning piece on wind turbine performance and reliability. Hat tip: Wolfgang Neumann at FaceBook. Ingenieur.de writes:
Lightening strikes, damage to power cable insulation, overheated gear-drives: Every month on average 10 wind turbines are destroyed by fire the British elite university Imperial College has found out in a study.” […]
Scientist Guillermo Rein of the Imperial College emphasizes that the risk of fire has been played down many times. Worldwide on average only 1 wind turbine fire per month is made public. However, in fact the real figure is ten wind turbine fires on average according to investigations by the university.”
No matter how you calculate it, wind energy is terrible. Even the most amateur of engineers are able to appreciate the ultra harsh conditions that wind turbines must inherently withstand just due to their design and siting. The power generation unit is far above ground level and gets subjected to forces and conditions that way beyond anything conventional power plants situated in buildings at ground level are exposed to.
Then there’s the trend to put them offshore where conditions are even far more violent and menacing. Only one conclusion can be drawn on the wind turbine concept: the contraptions are impractical. It’s tantamount to using 500 laborers to do the job of a single Caterpillar excavator.

It boils down to the simple economic logic: Wouldn’t it just make much more sense to replace all these little bicycle generators, which are propped up on sticks hundreds of feet above ground way out in the hicks, with a single big one that’s at ground level (where fires at least can be fought), is easy to maintain, and can run continuously?
Ingenier.de writes that the fires often result in “total damage” to the wind turbine and that especially offshore turbine fires “lead to considerable damage to investors”.
Gradually the public is getting the picture that this wind energy idea is turning into a megaflop, one that reminds us of early airplane designs with flapping wings. Wind turbine producers sure have taken governments and consumers to the cleaners – to the tune of hundreds of billions. The public was sucked into buying a real lemon.
As a solution to the burning problem, experts are calling for “improved materials”.
Firemen unable to even get near the fire
When a fire does break out, Ingenieur.de reports that firemen can’t even get close to the fire because the turbines are so high above ground. And even if they could there’s an acute danger from falling parts and rotors, and so they refuse to get anywhere near the damn thing! All they can do is watch the contraption burn down.
Overall Guillermo Rein, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College, calls the results of the study “serious”.
Sounds like a nail in the coffin of a dumb idea that needs to be buried sooner than later.
Oh, there’s more. Rein will soon be publishing the results of a risk study that looks at solar energy. Get the popcorn ready.

“A little modesty might suit you better” – Count von Strack, _Amadeus_



I have to admit that it pains me somewhat to write this piece, because I was briefly acquainted with Professor Tim Flannery, many years ago. While he was an affable enough fellow, even then he was given to some rather odd views, for a scientist. For instance, taking James Lovelock’s “Gaia” hypothesis apparently absolutely literally – something Lovelock himself adamantly opposed.



But, in the years since, Flannery’s self-image seems to have oscillated wildly from self-proclaimed omniscient sage to grumpy Jeremiah.



Academic, author and former Australian of the Year Tim Flannery lamented the world’s failure to heed his warnings about climate change.



The dire situation, he concluded, led him “to look back on my 20 years of climate activism as a colossal failure”.



Flannery might have used this confession as an occasion to reflect on his frankly hilarious [record of dud climate predictions](https://www.riteon.org.au/tim-flannery-professor-of-dud-predictions-and-climate-falsehoods/). Unfortunately, self-reflection does not seem to be his strong point. The fellow who rants about “predatory deniers”, but then pontificates that “if you slag off people and degrade their reputations, you ultimately degrade your own,” is clearly short of a mirror or two.



Still, for all his paranoid conspiracy theories about alleged cabals of Murdoch journalists who are out to get him, Flannery might want to take heed of what even his scientific colleagues have been trying to tell him.



“Just because a guy is well known does not mean he knows what he is talking about,” said University of Sydney palaeontologist Dr Stephen Wroe. “I’ve got a fairly cynical view of Tim. He’s an opportunist. He knows climate change is a buzzword, but a few months’ work does not make him an expert” […]



And from archaeologist Jim Allen of La Trobe University: “I wish I could be as sure of anything as Tim is of everything”. Another archaeologist, Dr Judith Field of the University of Sydney: “Tim doesn’t let the facts get in the way of a good story. He does a lot of broadbrush stuff, with broad consequences, and some of it is just plain wrong” […]



[Environmental engineering professor Stewart] Franks remarked “He is perhaps best described as an amateur enthusiast.”



Or, as someone once put it to me somewhat more pithily: “First, Tim talked about stuff I didn’t know about, and he sounded really impressive. Then, he talked about something I do know about, and I realised that he’s just full of shit”.



Like another star eco-activist, Paul Ehrlich, Flannery has become something of a running joke for his dud predictions. Despite all that, he says with a straight face:



Asked at [a] press conference about his credibility, he stated “I’ve been really consistent with what I’ve said, which is that we’ve got a water problem in this country.”



Even more consistent than his wildly wrong predictions is Flannery’s ability to turn on a dime and adamantly deny have ever said what he said. Virginia Trioli is a senior ABC journalist, and certainly no right-wing stooge.



In 2011, ABC journalist Virginia Trioli stated “I’ve sat with Tim Flannery at forums and the like, where he has point-blank said: no, I never said that. And I’ll say: yes you did, here’s the quote. And then he’ll run a gag with the audience, a plea to get them on side, saying it must have been in the News Limited papers. And you’ll get a ha, ha, ha. And I’ll be there going, no, here it is, it’s actually in a Fairfax paper, not that that matters anyway. So this is intriguing to me because he has a little bit of a reputation of saying things and then denying it.”



Flannery not only denies his own words but he completely misrepresents others’.



Flannery […] last week wrote of impending climate doom and mass death, stating “British scientist James Lovelock has predicted a future human population of just a billion people.” As Bolt noted in 2012, that was in 2006, and Lovelock later disavowed his alarmist views, the scientist also criticising Flannery for his.



Lovelock [specifically repudiated Flannery](https://www.climatedepot.com/2012/04/23/alert-gaia-scientist-james-lovelock-reverses-himself-i-was-alarmist-about-climate-change-so-was-gore-the-problem-is-we-dont-know-what-the-climate-is-doing-we-thought-we-knew-20-years-ago/), alongside Al Gore. Ouch.



Tim, it has to hurt when one of your own heroes gives you a public shellacking, but perhaps you might want to use that as an occasion for some humble self-reflection, instead of just amping up your self-righteous screeching?

"A prolonged heatwave in Siberia is “undoubtedly alarming”, climate scientists have said. The freak temperatures have been linked to wildfires, a huge oil spill and a plague of tree-eating moths. On a global scale, the Siberian heat is helping push the world towards its hottest year on record in 2020, despite a temporary dip in carbon emissions owing to the coronavirus pandemic.  Temperatures in the polar regions are rising fastest because ocean currents carry heat towards the poles and reflective ice and snow is melting away. Russian towns in the Arctic circle have recorded extraordinary temperatures, with Nizhnyaya Pesha hitting 30C on 9 June and Khatanga, which usually has daytime temperatures of around 0C at this time of year, hitting 25C on 22 May. The previous record was 12C. In May, surface temperatures in parts of Siberia were up to 10C above average, according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Martin Stendel, of the Danish Meteorological Institute, said the abnormal May temperatures seen in north-west Siberia would be likely to happen just once in 100,000 years without human-caused global heating. Freja Vamborg, a senior scientist at C3S, said: “It is undoubtedly an alarming sign, but not only May was unusually warm in Siberia. The whole of winter and spring had repeated periods of higher-than-average surface air temperatures. “Although the planet as a whole is warming, this isn’t happening evenly. Western Siberia stands out as a region that shows more of a warming trend with higher variations in temperature. So to some extent large temperature anomalies are not unexpected. However, what is unusual is how long the warmer-than-average anomalies have persisted for.” Marina Makarova, the chief meteorologist at Russia’s Rosgidromet weather service, said: “This winter was the hottest in Siberia since records began 130 years ago. Average temperatures were up to 6C higher than the seasonal norms.” Robert Rohde, the lead scientist at the Berkeley Earth project, said Russia as a whole had experienced record high temperatures in 2020, with the average from January to May 5.3C above the 1951-1980 average. “[This is a] new record by a massive 1.9C,” he said. In December, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, commented on the unusual heat: “Some of our cities were built north of the Arctic Circle, on the permafrost. If it begins to thaw, you can imagine what consequences it would have. It’s very serious.” Thawing permafrost was at least partly to blame for a spill of diesel fuel in Siberia this month that led Putin to declare a state of emergency. The supports of the storage tank suddenly sank, according to its operators; green groups said ageing and poorly maintained infrastructure was also to blame. Wildfires have raged across hundreds of thousands of hectares of Siberia’s forests. Farmers often light fires in the spring to clear vegetation, and a combination of high temperatures and strong winds has caused some fires to burn out of control. Swarms of the Siberian silk moth, whose larvae eat at conifer trees, have grown rapidly in the rising temperatures. “In all my long career, I’ve never seen moths so huge and growing so quickly,” Vladimir Soldatov, a moth expert, told AFP.  He warned of “tragic consequences” for forests, with the larvae stripping trees of their needles and making them more susceptible to fires."

The watermelon cultists of the Church of Gaia delude themselves that the wind turbines and solar panels they fetishise are going to save the planet from the evil sky-dragon, climate change. This is rubbish, of course. Wind and solar, despite decades of taxpayer-funded indulgence, still account for a bare 1% of global energy consumption. The idea that they will imminently replace fossil fuels is a delusion.



But just how environmentally friendly are they, really?



Not only do solar panels and wind turbines create massive amounts of pollution and environmental degradation during their manufacture, they don’t work for very long (about half the life-span, or less, of a traditional power source) – and when they do, they leave a shocking mess behind.



Researchers estimate the U.S. will have more than 720,000 tons of blade material to dispose of over the next 20 years, a figure that doesn’t include newer, taller higher-capacity versions.



The 20-year-old turbines are babies, compared to the 200-metre tall behemoths being built today. The disposal problem is only going to get worse.



There aren’t many options to recycle or trash turbine blades, and what options do exist are expensive, partly because the U.S. wind industry is so young. It’s a waste problem that runs counter to what the industry is held up to be […]



Ninety percent of a turbine’s parts can be recycled or sold, according to Van Vleet, but the blades, made of a tough but pliable mix of resin and fiberglass — similar to what spaceship parts are made from — are a different story.



“The blades are kind of a dud because they have no value,” he said.



That might be 90% of the **parts** , but it’s not necessarily 90% of the **mass**. The blades make up the bulk of a wind turbine.



Decommissioned blades are also notoriously difficult and expensive to transport. They can be anywhere from 100 to 300 feet long and need to be cut up onsite before getting trucked away on specialized equipment — which costs money — to the landfill.



So, that’s tons of fibreglass being cut up and buried. Then there’s the concrete – which generates huge amounts of carbon emissions in the first place.



[Turbine owners] will only remediate the site to a depth of four feet, leaving most of the massive concrete foundations, which go as deep as 15 feet, used to anchor the wind turbines , in the ground indefinitely.



Furthermore, according to the website Renewable Technology, Nobles Wind facility has an extensive underground collector cable system, laid at a depth of four feet, connecting the turbines to a central substation…the Palmer’s Wind Farm project explicitly states that cables deeper than 4 feet would not be removed.



  
It’s not enough that green scammers hoover up trillions of taxpayer dollars to build these inefficient, destructive eco-crucifixes. They’re going to stiff the taxpayer to get rid of the wretched things, too.



It looks like Minnesota will have a very expensive mess to clean up when the wind turbines currently operating in the state reach the end of their 20 year useful lifetimes […]it will cost approximately $445,000 (in 2009 dollars) per turbine to decommission the wind facility […]bringing the total cost of decommissioning the Nobles project to $71 million. Xcel also states that these cost estimates are conservative.



  
As is so often the case with “renewable” energy scams, wind turbines are useless boondoggles which suck up bucketloads of taxpayer dollars, wreak environmental havoc, slaughter millions of birds and bats, and leave behind a legacy of massive end-of-life costs and enduring environmental pollution.



They’re the perfect symbol for the green movement.

"MOUNT VERNON, Va.  —   The costumed characters at George Washington’s gracious estate here are used to handling all manner of awkward queries, whether about   privies or the first president’s teeth. So when a visitor recently asked an     in a full skirt and head scarf if she knew Ona Judge, the woman didn’t miss a beat. Judge’s escape from the presidential residence in Philadelphia in 1796 had been “a great embarrassment to General and Lady Washington,” the woman said, before offering her own view of the matter. “Ona was born free, like everybody,” she said. “It was this world that made her a slave. ” It’s always 1799 at Mount Vernon, where more than a million visitors annually see the property as it was just before Washington’s death, when his will famously freed all 123 of his slaves. That liberation did not apply to Ona Judge, one of 153 slaves held by Martha Washington. But Judge, it turned out, evaded the Washingtons’ dogged (and sometimes illegal) efforts to recapture her, and would live quietly in New Hampshire for another 50 years. Now her story  —   and the challenge it offers to the notion that Washington somehow transcended the seamy reality of slaveholding  —   is having its fullest airing yet. Judge is among the 19 enslaved people highlighted in “Lives Bound Together: Slavery at George Washington’s Mount Vernon,” the first major exhibition here dedicated to the topic. She is also the subject of a book, “Never Caught: The Washingtons’ Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge,” by Erica Armstrong Dunbar. Most scholars who have written about Judge’s escape have used it as a lens onto Washington’s evolving ideas about slavery. But “Never Caught,” published on Tuesday by 37 Ink, flips the perspective, focusing on what freedom meant to the people he kept in bondage. “We have the famous fugitives, like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass,” Ms. Dunbar, a professor of black studies and history at the University of Delaware, said in an interview in Mount Vernon’s    food court. “But decades before them, Ona Judge did this. I want people to know her story. ” Research on slavery has exploded in the two decades since Mount Vernon, Monticello and other founder home sites introduced   tours and other prominent acknowledgments of the enslaved. “Lives Bound Together,” which runs through September 2018, was originally going to fill one    room in the museum here, but soon expanded to include six other galleries normally dedicated to the decorative and fine arts, books and manuscripts. “We had so much material, and it’s such an important story,” Susan P. Schoelwer, the curator at Mount Vernon, said. “We realized we could take many of the objects already on view and reframe them. ” The exhibition makes it clear just who poured from the elegant teapots and did the backbreaking work on the   estate. But integrating the harsh reality of slavery into the heroic story of Washington  —   “a leader of character,” as the title of the permanent exhibition across from the slavery show calls him  —   remains unfinished work, some scholars say. “He’s a much more mythic figure than Jefferson,” said Annette   the author of “The Hemingses of Monticello” and a Harvard professor. “Many people want to see him as perfect in some way. ” But his determined pursuit of Judge, she said, as much as his will freeing his slaves, reflects the basic   of slave owners. “It’s saying, ‘Whatever I might think about slavery in the abstract, I should be able to do what I want with my property,’” she said. Ms. Dunbar, the author of “Never Caught,” first came across Ona Judge in the late 1990s, when she was a graduate student at Columbia researching free black women in Philadelphia. One day in the archives, she noticed a 1796 newspaper ad offering $10 for the return of “a light Mulatto girl, much freckled, with very black eyes and bushy hair” who had “absconded” from the president’s house. “I said to myself: ‘Here I am, a scholar in this field. Why don’t I know about her? ’” Ms. Dunbar recalled. Since then, Judge’s story has inspired several children’s books, and even an episode of “Drunk History. ” But “Never Caught” is the first   nonfiction account, drawing on some newly unearthed sources to track her from Mount Vernon to New York City, Philadelphia and then New Hampshire, at a time when gradual abolition left the line between slavery and freedom ambiguous. “There’s a myth of the North as free, but her story shows how complicated that was,” Ms. Dunbar said. It is in the meticulous ledgers of Mount Vernon that we first see Ona Maria Judge, who was born around 1773 to an enslaved mother and a father who was a white indentured servant. At age 9 she was brought to live in the mansion house, eventually becoming Martha Washington’s personal maid. When Washington became president, Judge followed the first couple to New York and then Philadelphia, home to a growing free black community. Free blacks, Ms. Dunbar writes, aided Judge’s escape in the midst of a presidential dinner, after she had learned that she was to be given to Martha Washington’s granddaughter, Eliza. And it was free blacks who helped her catch a sailing ship to Portsmouth, N. H. where she married, had three children and lived on the edge of poverty, laboring in households far less exalted than the Washingtons’. In two interviews published in abolitionist newspapers shortly before her death in 1848, Judge testified to the desire for freedom that drove her to run away from the Washington household, where she had “never received the least moral or mental instruction,” she said. Judge’s story, Ms. Dunbar said, explodes any notion of “privileged” house slaves, or of the benevolence of the Washingtons, whose far from passive role in perpetuating slavery  —   and in doling out sometimes brutal punishment to the rebellious  —   is described in detail. Ms. Dunbar describes how the Washingtons quietly maneuvered around Pennsylvania’s 1780 gradual abolition law, rotating their slaves in and out of the state every six months. And she recounts their shock at the “ingratitude” of Judge, who fled “without any provocation,” the president wrote. After hearing that Judge was in Portsmouth, Washington, offering a story that she had been “enticed away by a Frenchman,” discreetly sent a federal customs officer to bring her back, circumventing procedures laid out in the 1793 fugitive slave law he himself had signed. When Judge agreed to return on condition that she be freed on Martha’s death, George Washington dismissed her demand as “totally inadmissible. ” However much he might favor general emancipation, he wrote to the customs officer, granting Judge any say in her fate would only “reward unfaithfulness” and give ideas to others “far more deserving of favor. ” In August 1799, Washington, through another associate, tried again to capture her, but was foiled when Judge received a tip about the plot and disappeared. Four months later Washington was dead, freeing all his slaves in his will. Judge and the others held by Martha Washington remained her legal property. Ms. Dunbar calls Washington’s act “no small thing,” but does not see the former president, who had no biological children to disinherit, as the hero of the story. “When it was safe, he emancipated his slaves,” she said. “He dealt with it after his death. And you know what? That’s what all the founders did with slavery: They kicked the can down the road. ”"
"Humanity will be “finished” if we fail to drastically change our food systems in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis, the prominent naturalist Jane Goodall has warned. She blamed the emergence of Covid-19 on the over-exploitation of the natural world, which has seen forests cut down, species made extinct and natural habitats destroyed. The coronavirus is thought to have made the jump from animals to humans late last year, possibly originating in a meat market in Wuhan, China. Intensive farming was also creating a reservoir of animal diseases that would spill over and hurt human society, said Goodall, one of the world’s foremost experts on chimpanzees and a longtime conservation campaigner, speaking alongside two European commissioners at an online event held by the campaigning group Compassion in World Farming, on Tuesday. “We have brought this on ourselves because of our absolute disrespect for animals and the environment,” she said. “Our disrespect for wild animals and our disrespect for farmed animals has created this situation where disease can spill over to infect human beings.” People must move away from factory farming and stop destroying natural habitats as a matter of urgency, she said, because of the threat of diseases and of climate breakdown. Factory farming is linked to the rise of antibiotic resistant superbugs, which threaten human health. “If we do not do things differently, we are finished,” she said. “We can’t go on very much longer like this.” She called for people to be lifted out of poverty, pointing to its strong impact on the natural world, as people with no alternatives and who are desperate to feed their families will cut down forests to survive, and in urban areas will choose the cheapest food whatever the harm caused by its production, because they have little other choice. War and violence also fuelled the destruction of nature, she warned, and so did our overweening consumerism and urge for “stuff that we accumulate”, as well as our diets. The wealthy should put pressure on leaders and take care over what they buy to avoid adding to the problem, she said. “We have got to stop buying their products,” she said, of companies that use factory farming and exploit nature. “We have come to a turning point in our relationship with the natural world,” she warned, saying there was only a small window of opportunity to make drastic changes before facing disaster. “One of the lessons learnt from this crisis is that we must change our ways. Scientists warn that to avoid future crises, we must drastically change our diets and move to plant-rich foods. For the sake of the animals, planet and the health of our children.” Stella Kyriakides, the EU’s commissioner for health and food safety, said the EU was responding to concerns through its newly unveiled agriculture and biodiversity strategies and the European Green Deal. These strategies would cut the use of pesticides and encourage biodiversity, she said. “Highly intensive farming systems have created an abundance of food but in Europe, at least, there is also significant waste and at times animal suffering,” she told the conference. “These phenomena deeply worry me. The parts that don’t work are ethically questionable and socially and environmentally unacceptable. Our citizens expect more and we will deliver a better balance to ensure farming practices are sustainable and food is affordable.” Janusz Wojciechowski, commissioner for agriculture, added: “We will constantly support sustainable farming and breeding practices as an alternative to intensive industrial farming.” Concern about the links between coronavirus and the exploitation of the natural world is growing. Eighteen conservation groups have joined together in the Campaign to End Wildlife Trading, which is urging Boris Johnson to call for a global wildlife trade ban when the G20 leaders meet this November. The groups say that such a ban is needed to end the exploitation of wildlife for traditional medicine, exotic pets, tourism and other purposes. Currently, the trade in some endangered species is banned but still rife. It is one of the biggest forms of illegal trafficking in the world, after people and drugs. The legal trade is estimated to be worth $7bn to $23bn a year, according to the campaign. Intensive farming’s links to disease outbreaks were examined by the FAIRR global investor network in a new report, which found that more than 70% of the biggest meat, fish and dairy producers were in danger of fostering future zoonotic pandemics owing to lax safety standards, closely confined animals and the overuse of antibiotics. Meat companies have been under pressure in the US, where the spread of Covid-19 has led to plant closures and disruption of the supply chain. In the longer term, according to FAIRR, the meat supply chain is likely to come under further pressure because of increased scrutiny and regulation needed to improve biosecurity. Jeremy Coller, founder of FAIRR and CIO of Coller Capital, said: “Factory farming is both vulnerable to pandemics and guilty of creating them. It’s a self-sabotaging cycle that destroys value and risks lives. To avoid causing the next pandemic, the meat industry must tackle lax safety standards for food and workers alike, closely confined animals, and overused antibiotics. Covid could be the straw that breaks the meat industry’s back.”"
"Editor’s note: We’re resurfacing this Eat column from last year for Smarter Living to give you some ideas for using up any leftover holiday wine. It is a new year. We have resolved, and a popular fixture in our resolutions is booze. We used it well: It went into punch. It went into grog. It went into mulled wine, cocktails and eggnog. It went straight in. It began in a trickle that became a geyser. Now we are pickled. Which is why January, though a poor time for drinking alcohol, is a good time for cooking with it. In particular, with wine  —   which is, in the elegant and spiritually stirring formulation of Robert Farrar Capon, the late Episcopal priest and cookbook author, ‘‘water that has matured according to nature’s will. ’’ Recipes using wine are notably less common today than they were half a century ago, when every fondue pot and chafing dish released rich gusts of boozy vapor. But there is little better use for the thousands of   bottles that litter refrigerators and counters than to help them effect a secular transubstantiation in our dinners. The alcohol in wine evaporates more quickly than water and is mostly gone after 30 minutes’ cooking. What is left is the taste of the grape that made it, among dozens of ghost flavors: cherry, violet, ash, pineapple, fresh leather, apple, black pepper, wet soil, mandarin, lilac or rose. Plus, a light acidity that keeps the palate alive and alert, and an unmistakable elegance that can be neither explained nor ignored. I have always found most enticing those recipes that truly rely on wine and demand it in quantity, raw and crude and as it is. The food writer Richard Olney recommends Soupe à la Bourguignonne, ‘‘Red Wine Soup’’: pork fat, butter, onions, flour, water, stale bread, herbs and almost an entire bottle of red wine. There is ‘‘Bavarian Wine Soup,’’ from ‘‘The Wine Cook Book’’ (1934): three parts wine to one part water, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and a beaten egg yolk, served with water crackers. Olney also describes a ‘‘typical Bordelais tourain,’’ which is usually eaten during the   harvest but could stand a winter reprise. Its ingredients are onions cooked in fat, salt, tomatoes, sugar, boiling water, stale bread and dry white wine. ‘‘A native,’’ Olney writes, ‘‘may first eat his sopped bread crust, empty out his (red) wine glass into the soup, and drink the rest from the soup plate, a performance known as faire chabrol’’  —   that is, ‘‘to act like a little goat. ’’ The simplest way to cook with wine is just to cook in it. A combination of half wine, half water or broth will cook any tough cut of meat flavorfully and subtly. But an even simpler and deeper pleasure can be found in cooking entirely in wine, with occasional pours of broth to keep things balanced, but the responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the juice of the grape. Coq au vin is of this lineage. So is a variation I prefer: coq au vin blanc, or coq au vin jaune, which leaves the old rooster or capon tasting as if it got taken to a party it wasn’t expecting, thoroughly saturated in the complexities of deep dark yellow wine and a long night on the town. There are a few questions that bedevil those who decide to try their hands at cooking with booze. What kind of wine? Father Capon wrote the most useful rule: ‘‘White for lighter meats, red for heavier, but don’t make a fetish of it. ’’ I lean toward the dry and the     but nothing too delicate, because the delicacy will be lost in cooking, and nothing too tannic or inky, which will turn to acidic mud. Can a wine be too good for cooking? Olney writes: ‘‘One may respectfully find a place in the kitchen for a great wine only if heat never comes into contact with it. ’’ That makes sense. If a fine wine is going to be put anywhere but a glass, it must stay unchanged until it reaches its final destination. Can it be too bad? Olney says if you would not drink it, do not cook with it. The former chef Daniel Gritzer recently conducted experiments and found that a wine that started overly fruity and   ended that way, but that a wine that was once good, then oxidized, resulted in a very good dish. This is my theory too  —   it is mostly the alcohol in the wine that oxidizes when a bottle is open and old. It is also the alcohol that disappears in cooking. Don’t worry if uncooked wine tastes oxidized before it is added to a braise or stew  —   as long as it tasted good in its past, however distant. Are there spirits that shouldn’t be cooked in? Scotch, vodka, gin, tequila and moonshine do not make good stew. All of them are, however, capable of sousing and pickling a fish as they are of sousing and pickling a human. And to more attractive ends. Recipe: Boeuf à la Mode"
"In the early days of the lockdown, philosopher Bruno Latour wrote an essay for the AOC cultural online newspaper. “The first lesson the coronavirus has taught us,” he wrote, “is also the most astounding: we have actually proven that it is possible, in a few weeks, to put an economic system on hold everywhere in the world…” That essay, translated since into at least 12 languages, has encouraged many to reimagine how different the world could look if we learned from this experience. It has also solidified the reputation of the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po) emeritus professor as one of the most influential thinkers of our age.  How has the pandemic reshaped our societies?Some say this is the revenge of nature. That is silly. Anyone who has studied the history of medicine knows how a virus can make a society feel completely different. We are on a great learning curve. It’s a huge experiment. This is a global catastrophe that has come not from the outside like a war or an earthquake, but from within. Viruses are completely inside us. We cannot completely eject them. We must learn to live with them.   At the beginning of the pandemic, you suggested everyone ask themselves what they would like to keep from the lockdown, what they would like to change. Those questions are now being asked all over the world. Has the interest surprised you?Even if you were not a spiritual person, the lockdown forced everyone into a kind of retreat, a moment for reflection. It was quite extraordinary. The questions were therapeutic. They gave people powerlessly stuck at home a way of thinking about how they would create a better future.  Can an idea go viral like a disease?Covid has given us a model of contamination. It has shown how quickly something can become global just by going from one mouth to another. That’s an incredible demonstration of network theory. I’ve been trying to persuade sociologists of this for 40 years. I’m sorry to have been so right. It shows that we must not think of the personal and the collective as two distinct levels. The big climate questions can make individuals feel small and impotent. But the virus gives us a lesson. If you spread from one mouth to another, you can viralise the world very fast. That knowledge can re-empower us. Many countries are now easing out of lockdown. What can we expect to emerge from this period of reflection?The pandemic has reopened the debate about what is necessary and what is possible. It has put us in a position where we can decide what is useful and what is not. That choice disappeared before. Everything seemed relentless like a tsunami. Now we realise it was not. We can see things are reversible. We can see which jobs are necessary and which are junk. How long that will last, I don’t know. We might have forgotten everything in three months. That depends on how hard the economic crisis becomes. I am overwhelmed by the size of the economic problem, from what I hear from my students. To put your own question back to you, what would you change?What we need is not only to modify the system of production but to get out of it altogether. We should remember that this idea of framing everything in terms of the economy is a new thing in human history. The pandemic has shown us the economy is a very narrow and limited way of organising life and deciding who is important and who is not important. If I could change one thing, it would be to get out of the system of production and instead build a political ecology.  Has the pandemic response made you more or less optimistic about humanity’s ability to tackle the climate and nature crisis?The bad guys are better organised and clearer in knowing what they want. The war we are engaged in is a difficult one. It is not that we are powerless; it is that many of us don’t know how to react.  In your latest art collaboration at ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany, you define the scope of human existence as the “critical zone”, a narrow band of Earth that can support life. What is the purpose of this approach?It is a redefinition of our landscape. The idea of the “critical zone” is useful because it gets you out of nature. Nature is very big. It covers everything from the big bang to microbes. Conceptually, that makes it a complete mess. The critical zone is limited. It is just a few kilometres thick – above and below the surface of the Earth. But all discovered life is within it. This brings us inside in a way that nature does not. It is very different from the way of thinking that makes people such as Elon Musk think they should go on a mission to Mars. That is escapist. But when you think in terms of a critical zone, you are locked in, you cannot escape. What does it mean for politics if we are locked in and not in the infinite cosmology opened by Galileo? It means we cannot behave in the same way. It means we cannot just endlessly extract resources and discard our waste. In the critical zone, we must maintain what we have because it is finite, it’s local, it’s at risk and it’s the object of conflict.  This seems to add a political edge to James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, which explains how “Life” acts to maintain habitable conditions for itself. You have long been a champion of this theory…Lovelock locked us in! While Galileo used a telescope to reveal that the Earth is part of an infinite universe, Lovelock used his electron capture detector to reveal that the Earth is completely different from any other planet because it has life. He and [Lynn] Margulis spotted Gaia. Lovelock from space, taking the question as globally as possible; Margulis from bacteria, taking the question from the other end, both realising that Life, capital L, has managed to engineer its own conditions of existence. For me that is the greatest discovery of this period, though it is still not very much accepted by mainstream science. This may be because we do not yet have the tools to receive it.  Why do you think scientists are still wary?That such an important concept is still so marginal in the history of science is extraordinary. I have done everything I can to make it accepted. But scientists are reflexively cautious. The cosmological shift from Aristotle to Galileo is the same as that from Galileo to Gaia. With Galileo, our understanding moved outwards to an infinite universe. Grasping that took a century and a half and faced resistance. Gaia is not just one more concept. It is not just about physics and energy. It is Life. Your work has often challenged the objective, God’s-eye view of science. You argue convincingly that humanity cannot be so detached. But the political right have twisted this approach to undermine all expert knowledge on the climate and nature crises. Any regrets?A critique of how science is produced is very different from the post-truth argument that there are alternative truths that you can choose from. Post-truth is a defensive posture. If you have to defend yourself against climate change, economic change, coronavirus change, then you grab at any alternative. If those alternatives are fed to you by thousands of fake news farms in Siberia, they are hard to resist, especially if they look vaguely empirical. If you have enough of them and they are contradictory enough, they allow you to stick to your old beliefs. But this should not be confused with rational scepticism.  Has the Covid-19 crisis affected our belief in science?The virus has revealed the number of things you need to know to decide what is factual and what’s not. The public are learning a great deal about the difficulty of statistics, about experiment, about epidemiology. In everyday life, people are talking about degrees of confidence and margin of error. I think that’s good. If you want people to have some grasp of science, you must show how it is produced. "

The online Swiss Berner Zeitung here has an article reporting on how scientists have underestimated the role on climate that the globe’s semi-arid regions are playing. According to the report, climate change has lead to the Nullarbor Plain of southern Australia to be the greenest it has ever been in 30 years.

CO2 is greening up the Nullarbor Plain of southern Australia. Photo credit:  Yewenyi. the GNU Free Documentation License.
Not only is the greening up surprising the scientists, all the new vegetation is also absorbing huge quantities of CO2 from the air…something the models forgot to account for. The article in the Berner Zeitung cites a study recently appearing in journal Nature.
Scientists have noticed that the man-made share of atmospheric CO2 has remained constant recently despite increasing emissions. As a reaction to man-made CO2, the planet has been greening up. The Berner Zeitung writes: “Possible reason: The higher CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and an additional take-up in atmospheric nitrogen have boosted plant growth.”
The Berner Zeitung describes how scientists once initially believed tropical rainforests would do most of the CO2 absorption, and are now surprised to see that semi-arid lands are are “playing a more important role”, one the never anticipated.
Time to go back and fix the models again.

Berner Zeitung writes:
2011 was extreme: 51 percent of the global CO2 intake on land was by vegetation on semi-arid deserts in three regions in the southern hemisphere. […]
…Since 1981 vegetation coverage in Australia has grown by 6%.”
Other recent studies based on satellite imagery and on-site observations show that the same is true in the African Sahara, which is adding thousands of square kilometers of vegetation every year.
At the end of the report the Berner Zeitung frets that the greening of semi-arid regions may in the end just be harboring a danger because such semi-arid areas are highly prone to bush fires and so the CO2 will wind up back in the air. The Berner Zeitung concludes:
The scientists believe that this hazard will probably increase in the future.”
Just goes to show: No matter what the planets does, pessimism and gloom always win in climate science and media!

"A great white shark is headed in the UK’s direction, but even better than that – according to the pundits it’s a great white mummy, in the family way. In fact the scientific value of this observation doesn’t need any spin or speculation. The real significance is that we are watching, in real time, the movement of a top ocean predator as it searches the North Atlantic for food and possibly a mate – or a place to drop its as-yet unborn pups.  The information returned by her satellite tag (a miracle of miniaturised modern technology) can tell us a massive amount about how white sharks use the oceans. The distances between turns she makes can give us information about where she might be feeding: tighter more frequent turns or dives suggest she is finding prey, longer straighter tracks and deeper dives that she is on the hunt for more prey. But where is she headed? If you believe Lydia is pregnant and if you also believe that Atlantic white shark birthing grounds are in the Mediterranean – a belief enshrined in folklore about white sharks – there is an obvious answer. But our genetic research on white sharks indicates that they, like the humble and less toothy salmon, return to their own birth place to drop their pups. We know this because the genetic signature of female sharks is characteristic of different geographic localities – a bit like a great white passport, identifying each individual’s home town.  We also know that the signature we find in the rare, contemporary Mediterranean white sharks is very different to that of North Atlantic white sharks, but very similar to Australian whites. In fact this genetic signature suggests that the ancestors of modern Mediterranean white sharks probably came from Australia some 450,000 years ago, when at least one, or possibly a few, made a navigational blunder of epic proportions. The climate back then was interglacial (between ice ages) and the combination of sudden warming and giga-gallons of freshwater hitting the oceans upset the balance of normally constant ocean currents. Indo-Pacific white sharks today commute between South Africa and Australia, perhaps using ocean currents as signposts. But during interglacials the powerful warm Agulhas current running south down the east coast of Africa became so strong it spun huge spirals of warm water round the tip of the continent north into the Atlantic. This might have effectively moved the commuters’ signposts, encouraging them to head north along the west African coast, eventually playing out their tendency to turn east by entering the Mediterranean. Oceanographically similar to the Pacific (warm, deep and salty) this might have been an acceptable new home for Pacific sharks. It has certainly proven so for more recent colonists from that part of the world, entering via the back door of the Suez Canal. So common is this phenomenon it is called Lessepsian migration, after the canal engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps. White shark pups born in the Mediterranean would have considered it home, eventually giving birth there themselves. Modern populations may even confine themselves to the Mediterranean, doing all the things other white sharks do in the oceans in this small sea. Such confinement might explain why the largest (and yes pregnant) great white ever recorded was caught off Malta; it might also explain records of Mediterranean pups. But is a small pond really where a big fish would live by choice? Perhaps. So far, a sad and rather worrying revelation from our work on Mediterranean white sharks is their genetic invariance and apparent lack of interbreeding with their Atlantic cousins. This dearth of diversity makes them incredibly vulnerable to environmental change, disease and pollution – things the Mediterranean has in abundance. If Lydia wasn’t born there, it’s hard to imagine why she’d be headed there. Neither I, nor anybody else, really knows where Lydia is headed. Perhaps it’s the Bay of Biscay, an area frequented by great whites. As relatively few satellite tags have been attached to Atlantic whites this may even be a common route. She’s just turned westward, away from the UK, but she could turn back east.  She may enter the Mediterranean, she may even be pregnant. But the genetics suggest she won’t give birth there – not unless she is actually a Mediterranean female who has gone walkabout, perhaps finding a Latino lover off the Americas. Now that would be a story.  Not only would it suggest Mediterranean white sharks are genetically more viable, and so less threatened, it could tell us a lot about the commute of northern hemisphere white sharks, how they use the seas and oceans. This is what conservationists need to know in order to protect them. How can we work this out? Simply by checking Lydia’s genetic passport."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you don’t have the truth, then some folks rely on lies and hope others will be fooled and stay so. Such is the case with global warming climate science. Almost every measure of global warming has stopped cooperating with the alarmists over the last 10 years. Now they have to make things up.
At Weatherbell Analytics Joe Bastardi has another outstanding Saturday Summary, which every week I look forward to like I looked forward to the Saturday morning cartoons when I was 8 years old.
This week I was fascinated by the number of falsehoods coming from the global warming industry that Joe debunked, and how he did it so quickly. The veteran meteorologist exposes all of them for what they are – in less than 10 minutes!
The string of debunking begins at about the 4-minute mark with the so-called claimed “record drought” that is supposedly gripping Texas and America’s heartland. Joe calls that claim “a lie”. With charts he clearly shows that the recent drought was not even close to being the worst, and that the drought of the 1950s was considerably more intense.
Secondly at the 7:55 mark, he debunks the claims of the upcoming “super El Niño” that the “Church of Super El Niño”, who want to see high temperatures, were ballyhooing earlier this year.
Chart right: Weatherbell
Again Joe presents charts that show the current development resembles nothing you’d expect from a super El Niño and that the current situation looks more similar to 2002/03 or 2009/10. All models have long since downgraded their forecasts. The missing heat remains missing.

Thirdly at the 10:00 mark Joe shows how the leading weather services are diametrically opposed when it comes to their forecasts using the Madden Julian Oscillation. While the European model shows the MJO will be in Phase 6, meaning US temps will be cool in July, the US models show that it will be in Phase 1, which means it will be warm over the US in July.
Fourthly, at the 10:55 mark, Joe shows that although tornado activity in the US has risen over the last weeks, the overall activity is still well below normal. How is that “extreme”?
Fifthly at the 11:15 mark, Joe tells the real story about wildfires, whose seemingly increased intensity is claimed to be yet another ominous of climate disaster. Here too we see that wildfire activity is being wildly exaggerated and is well below normal. Currently this year there have been 24,124 wild fires, normal is 31,758. As far as acreage is concerned, things are even less worse look worse for the warmist extremers. Normal acres burned is 1,777,552 acres. So far it is only 826,471 acres. Joe emphasizes, “We’re way the heck below the average.”
Finally at the 12:00 mark, Joe debunks falsehood Number 6 by presenting global sea ice for 2014 so far, and here we see that it is not even close to the ice-free conditions some were predicting some years ago.
Chart right: Weatherbell
In the Arctic sea ice is now headed toward normal levels. Around Antarctic sea ice remains stubbornly close to record levels.
Joe adds, “It may break the all-time record, let alone the daily record“.

"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."
"The biggest dairy companies in the world have the same combined greenhouse gas emissions as the UK, the sixth biggest economy in the world, according to a new report. The analysis shows the impact of the 13 firms on the climate crisis is growing, with an 11% increase in emissions in the two years after the 2015 Paris climate change agreement, largely due to consolidation in the sector. Scientific reports have shown that consumption of dairy, as well as meat, must be reduced significantly in rich nations to tackle the climate emergency.  The report, by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) in the US, also says the growth of giant dairy companies has helped force milk prices below the cost of production for the last decade, causing a crisis in rural livelihoods and requiring taxpayer subsidies to keep farmers afloat. The researchers say caps on production should be reintroduced to protect both the climate and small farmers. “Unlike growing public scrutiny on fossil fuel companies, little public pressure exists to hold global meat and dairy corporations accountable for their emissions,” said Shefali Sharma, European director at IATP and report author. “Few of these companies are even reporting their emissions.” “As governments ratchet up their climate goals, the rise of large-scale dairy and public incentives that further increase corporate dairy power, production and emissions must be stopped,” she said. “Rural livelihoods and our planet’s future depend on it.” Dairy industry representatives said the report did not reflect the reality of the dairy sector. In a joint statement, Judith Bryans, president of the International Dairy Federation, and Donald Moore, executive director of the Global Dairy Platform, said: “The dairy sector is committed to producing nutritious foods in environmentally sound and responsible ways.” “It’s very easy to put out a report that criticises and tries to paint a simple picture of a sector which doesn’t contain all of the nuances or realities of how the global dairy sector nourishes the world with nutrient-rich, safe foods and does so in a manner that strives for continued environmental improvements while providing livelihoods to a large percentage of the world’s population,” said Bryans and Moore. A 2019 joint report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Global Dairy Platform said: “In order to limit temperature rise, the dairy sector must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and work towards a low-carbon future … There is a clear case for immediate and more ambitious action.” It said: “The [dairy] sector’s emissions have increased by 18% between 2005 and 2015 because overall milk production has grown substantially by 30%. The good news is that there are many opportunities within the sector to limit climate change by reducing emissions. While there is some uncertainty about the size and timing of changes, it is certain that it is happening.” The report did not consider reducing production. Bryans and Moore said: “[Dairy’s] rich nutrition helps populations, particularly in developing nations, avoid malnutrition and poor health outcomes.” The biggest global producers of milk are the European Union, India and the US. The IATP report used the UN FAO’s global livestock environmental assessment model to assign emission levels to dairy produced in different regions. These were then applied to the companies’ production quantities as calculated by the IFCN dairy research network. More than 90% of the corporate dairy industries’ emissions are produced by the cows themselves, mostly in the form of methane. Research shows all plant-based milks, such as soya and oat, result in far fewer emissions than dairy milk. The IATP report found emissions from the big companies rose from 306m tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2015 to 338m tonnes in 2017. The UK’s annual emissions are 350m tonnes a year. Consolidation in the dairy industry saw four out of five dairy farms close in the EU from 1981-2013, and 93% of family farms in dairy closing in the US since the 1970s. “You have to get bigger or get out,” said Sharma. “The key argument is this industry drives overproduction and low prices, which creates demand, and it has marketing power, which creates demand. Demand doesn’t just happen by accident.” “There is growing support for supply management, a crucial policy that could address dairy’s twin crises. It prevents overproduction, balances supply and demand and stabilises prices,” she said."

The world lost a great champion of liberty with the passing of Allan Meltzer, a longtime Professor of Political Economy at Carnegie Mellon University. Allan was a prodigious worker who wrote hundreds of articles and more than ten books, including his monumental _A History of the Federal Reserve_ and more recently _Why Capitalism?_ The latter provides a strong defense of limited government, the rule of law, private property and free markets, which he saw as the surest means to increase the wealth of nations.   




Allan had a passion for ideas and a desire to influence policy; he sought to make the world a better place by safeguarding economic and personal freedom. He became a major player in the marketplace for ideas — writing, teaching, advising policymakers, serving on editorial boards, co-founding the Shadow Open Market Committee with his close colleague and lifelong friend Karl Brunner, acting as president of the Mont Pelerin Society founded by F. A. Hayek, chairing the International Financial Institution Advisory Commission (also known as the “Meltzer Commission”), and participating in numerous conferences. He continued working right up until his death on May 8, at the age of 89.   




I first met Allan in the early 1980s, when he began to participate in Cato’s Annual Monetary Conference. His paper “Monetary Reform in an Uncertain Environment” was delivered at the first conference, in January 1983, and published in the _Cato Journal_ later that year; it was reprinted in _The Search for Stable Money_ (University of Chicago Press, 1987), a book I co-edited with Anna J. Schwartz.   
  
In that article, Allan examined alternative monetary regimes and their implications for reducing risk and uncertainty. He sought a rule-based regime that would minimize uncertainty and best allow markets to flourish. He preferred, at the time, a quantity rule that would have the monetary base grow in line with the growth of real output adjusted for changes in the velocity of base money. Such a rule, he argued, would anchor expectations regarding the path of nominal income and achieve long-run price stability. However, the rule had to be credible and be supplemented with a fiscal rule that limited the taxing and spending powers of government. He did not want the Fed to finance government deficits or to allocate credit.   




It is important to note that Allan was not opposed to private money. At the 1983 monetary conference and in his paper, he held that   




individuals or groups should be permitted to issue and use privately produced money or monies. . . . The objective of policy rules is to reduce the uncertainty that the community must bear, not to prevent voluntary risk taking.



Allan was open-minded and was willing to change his policy advice based on logic and evidence.   
  
He continued to participate in Cato’s Annual Monetary Conference for many years and contributed 15 articles to the _Cato Journal_ (see Table 1). Although he was often critical of Fed policy, he thought Paul Volcker was correct in ending double-digit inflation by slowing the growth of money and credit, and that Alan Greenspan was correct in following an implicit monetary rule to prevent wide fluctuations in nominal income during the “Great Moderation.”   
  
Meltzer, however, was highly critical of the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy and wrote in the Spring/Summer 2012 _Cato Journal_:   




Overresponse to short-run events and neglect of longer-term consequences of its actions is one of the main errors that the Federal Reserve makes repeatedly. The current recession offers many examples of actions that some characterize as bold and innovative. I regard many of these actions as inappropriate for an allegedly independent central bank because they involve credit allocation, fill the Fed’s portfolio with an unprecedented volume of long-term assets, evade or neglect the dual mandate, distort the credit markets, and initiate other actions that are not the responsibility of a central bank.



He kept up his criticism until the end, writing articles for the Hoover Institution, where he was a distinguished senior fellow, with such titles as “Fed Up with the Fed” ( _Defining Ideas_ , February 17, 2016), “Fed Failures” (March 9, 2016), and “Reform the Federal Reserve” (October 12, 2016). His last article in Hoover’s online journal appeared on April 25, less than two weeks before he died.   
  
The last time I saw Allan was in Switzerland, in September 2016, where we had enjoyed many discussions at Karl Brunner’s Interlaken Seminar on Analysis and Ideology. He was in Zurich to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Karl’s birth, sponsored by the Swiss National Bank, and to deliver a paper discussing Karl’s many contributions to monetary theory as well as to political economy in general. In his paper, “Karl Brunner, Scholar: An Appreciation,” he emphasized that Karl   




highlighted information, institutions and uncertainty as well as the importance of microanalysis in macroeconomics. Karl Brunner explained that nominal monetary impulses changed real variables by changing the relative price of assets to output prices. And he concluded that economic fluctuations occurred because of an unstable public sector — especially the monetary sector — that disturbs a more stable private sector, a policy lesson forgotten or never learned by many central banks.



Those ideas also were central to Allan’s work — both with Karl and independently — and they are evident in his interpretation of Keynes’s monetary theory.   




In a careful study of John Maynard Keynes’s writings, Meltzer argues that the vast literature on Keynes neglected the importance he placed on credible rules, which he thought would reduce uncertainty and improve economic welfare (see _Keynes’s Monetary Theory: A Different Interpretation,_ Cambridge University Press, 1988).[i]   
  
In particular, Allan was influenced by Keynes’s classic _A Tract on Monetary Reform_(1923), which discusses rules for domestic (internal) price stability and for international (external) price stability — that is, exchange rate stability. In thinking about a rule to reduce the variability of unanticipated changes in prices and outputs, Meltzer ([1987] 1989: 78–81) draws on Keynes’s distinction and his recognition of the benefits of reducing both internal and external instability.[ii] The problem, of course, is to choose the appropriate institutional framework. Countries operating _independently_ cannot achieve both internal and external stability, argued Keynes, unless a key country anchors its price level by enforcing a credible rule.   
  
Building upon Keynes’s insights, Meltzer (p. 78) notes that if each major trading partner makes domestic price stability a priority, then uncertainty about the future path of prices will diminish and exchange rates among the partners will be more stable. To realize both internal and external stability, Meltzer proposes a simple rule: each major country should set “the rate of growth of the monetary base equal to the difference between the moving average of past real output growth and past growth in base velocity” (p. 83). If each country complies, the rule will reduce the “variability of exchange rates arising from differences in expected rates of inflation.”[iii]   
  
Meltzer’s proposed rule is “forecast free” and adaptable; it is mildly activist but nondiscretionary, similar to Bennett McCallum’s monetary rule.[iv] By choosing to stabilize the _anticipated_ price level rather than the actual price level, there is no need “to reverse all changes in the price level,” argues Meltzer (1989: 79). Instead, the actual price level is allowed “to adjust as part of the process by which the economy adjusts real values to unanticipated supply shocks.” In other words, Meltzer’s monetary rule “does not adjust to short-term, transitory changes in level, but it adjusts fully to permanent changes in growth rates of output and intermediation (or other changes in the growth rate of velocity) within the term chosen for the moving averages” (p. 81).   
  
In the current environment — with the Fed paying interest on excess reserves (in excess of what banks can get on highly liquid assets), no competitive fed funds market, banks subject to uncertainty about future monetary policy and complex macro-prudential regulations, and depositors holding more cash due to ultralow interest rates, Meltzer’s monetary rule would be severely constrained. The link between base money and broader monetary aggregates has weakened significantly since the 2008 financial crisis and the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy.   
  
Before serious consideration can be given to implementing any rule-based monetary regime, the Fed needs to normalize monetary policy by ending interest on excess reserves and shrinking its balance sheet to restore a pre-crisis fed funds market. Once changes in base money can be effectively transmitted to changes in the money supply and nominal income, Meltzer’s rule would reduce uncertainty and spur investment and growth.   
  
The key point, however, is that Allan wanted to explore alternative monetary rules and select those he thought would work best to reduce the variability of prices and output. That comparative-institutions approach was evident in all his work. But he recognized that, ultimately, the choice of a rule would be heavily influenced by the political economy. His careful scholarship was intended to help shape the climate of ideas and public policy in the direction of what Richard Epstein has called “simple rules for a complex world.”[v]   




Although Allan was known primarily for his work on monetary theory and history, he was deeply interested in the role of government in a free society; the relation between institutions, incentives, and behavior; the determinants of economic growth; the theory of public choice; the damaging effects of official foreign aid; and the distribution of income.[vi] He wrote many articles for the popular press, including the _Wall Street Journal_ , _Los Angeles Times_ , and _Financial Times_ , and he was always willing to help younger scholars and students understand the complexities of political economy.   




Allan Meltzer was a great scholar and teacher, a friend of liberty, a man of integrity who kept his word, and a fine human being. He was persistent in his research and his life. Allan taught at Carnegie Mellon for 60 years and was married to his lovely wife Marilyn for 67 years.   
  
When Allan was five years old, he lost his mother and went to live with his grandmother for several years until he moved to Los Angeles where his family ran a business. Reflecting on his early years, Allan said, “Her most important influence on my career and my outlook was her strongly held belief that, in America (and only in America), there were no real limits other than ability to what one could achieve by personal effort.”[vii]   
  
In his many accomplishments and honors, Allan certainly realized the American Dream, and had a life well lived.[viii] He will be sorely missed, but his work will live on.

Once again, the taxpayer-funded ABC has proved both that it is irredeemably biased, and that so-called “fact-checkers” are in reality invariably left-wing propaganda.



The ABC and its “fact-checking” unit have teamed up to “fact-check” Scott Morrison’s speech to the UN. Morrison hit back at the UN for banning Australia (along with other nations) from its latest climate gabfest – while handing a platform to mega-polluters like China and India, to demand more and more of our money.



To their obvious chagrin, Morrison was right on every major point. Except the ABC can’t bring themselves to plainly admit as much, so they resort to their usual gambit: fudge and mislead.



Prime Minister Scott Morrison has taken to the international stage to hammer the message that Australia is “taking real action on climate change and we are getting results […]the facts simply don’t fit the narrative they wish to project about our contribution”.



Which is the worst possible heresy, to the far-green-left, anti-Australian ABC.



Here is our take on some of the key claims made by Mr Morrison in his speech.



 **“Australia is taking real action on climate change and we are getting results.”**



[…]As Fact Check has previously noted, the Coalition’s “Direct Action” emissions reduction fund has played a positive, albeit modest, part in keeping a lid on emissions.



So Morrison is correct.



 **Scott Morrison 1, ABC 0.**



 **“By 2020, Australia will have overachieved on our Kyoto commitments, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 367 million tonnes more than required to meet our 2020 Kyoto target.”**



The [Department of the Environment and Energy] has estimated Australia will have reduced its emissions by some 376 million tonnes more than required over the eight years to 2020, thereby meeting its Kyoto obligations. This is consistent with Mr Morrison’s claim.



But Australia’s success has had little to do with Coalition policies.



 **Morrison never said that it did.** He simply, correctly, stated that Australia is exceeding its Kyoto target.



This is the most common gambit “fact-checkers” use to deceive: taking something their target **didn’t** say, and “fact-checking” that, instead of what they **actually** said.



 **Scott Morrison 2, ABC 0.**



 **“Our latest estimates show both emissions per person and the emissions intensity of the economy are at their lowest levels in 29 years.”**



This is correct. Because Australia’s population has been increasing, emissions per capita have been falling, and are currently at the lowest levels since 1990.



Again, all Morrison said that Australia’s per capita emissions have fallen – which is correct.



In fact, look how the ABC tries to have an each-way bet, while deliberately deceiving its readers.



As experts have previously told Fact Check, what counts as far as the Earth’s atmosphere — and international agreements — are concerned is the total level of emissions […] Moreover, while Australia’s emissions per capita have fallen, they remain among the highest in the world.



So, which matter? Per capita, or total? If it’s total emissions, then why do the ABC and their watermelon chums continually hype Australia’s per capita emissions? Because Australia’s total emissions are **minuscule**. Australia accounts for just over 1% of the world’s emissions. China emits more carbon dioxide in 20 days than Australia does in a year.



 **Scott Morrison 3, ABC 0.**



 **“Australia’s electricity sector is producing less emissions. In the year to March 2019, emissions from Australia’s electricity sector were 15.7 per cent lower than the peak recorded in the year to June 2009.”**



This is correct, but it has little to do with the policies of the Morrison Government.



Once again, that is not something that Morrison actually said. Stick to what he said, ABC watermelons, and stop trying to distract attention by attacking things he **didn’t** say.



 **Indeed, the ABC grudgingly concedes that Morrison didn’t actually go far enough in highlighting Australia’s progress:**



Using the raw data […]this was, as Mr Morrison points out, 15.7 per cent lower than the 211.3 million tonnes produced over the year to June 2009.



(If the seasonally adjusted, “weather normalised” data is used, the decline is even bigger).



 **So, it’s game, set and match, with Scott Morrison 4, ABC 0.**



It just kills these taxpayer-funded watermelons to admit that a conservative prime minister is right and that [Australia is doing more for the environment](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/morrison-aims-to-actually-fix-the-environment-instead-of-screeching-about-climate-change/) than any number of sour-faced Swedish brats. But that doesn’t change the facts.

"We are currently in the midst of the most severe macroeconomic shock since the second world war. The disruption to our daily lives and subsequent impact on our economies has been enormous. We are seeing first-hand that a collective response is needed to defeat a common enemy, as authorities across the world courageously mobilise all available resources to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. This crisis offers us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rebuild our economy in order to withstand the next shock coming our way: climate breakdown. Unless we act now, the climate crisis will be tomorrow’s central scenario and, unlike Covid-19, no one will be able to self-isolate from it. In the immediate response to the pandemic, governments have taken measures of unprecedented scale to keep economic and financial systems afloat. The IMF estimates that approximately $9tn of fiscal support has been provided across the world. This is necessary to limit acute and permanent damage. But as we consider the next stage of recovery, we must look beyond the immediate crisis and think more strategically about how we do it.  Collectively, countries around the globe are still far from meeting climate crisis goals, most notably the Paris agreement to limit the increase in global temperature to well below 2C, and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C. Over the last year, we have seen record temperatures across Europe, extreme rainfall in the US and wildfires in the Arctic. The effects of the climate crisis are irreversible, so the severity and frequency of these extreme weather events will only increase – by how much depends on our success in transitioning to a net-zero emission world. Recognising this risk, the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) – a coalition of 66 central banks, and supervisors – has been working to “green” the financial system to reduce the costly financial risks that these developments create. Acting early will help to smooth the transition and avoid a sharp and disorderly adjustment. To meet the goals of the Paris agreement requires a whole economy transition: every business, bank and financial institution will need to adapt. The pandemic has shown that we can change our ways of working, living and travelling, but it has also shown that making these adjustments at the height of a crisis brings enormous costs. To address climate breakdown, we can instead take decisions now that reduce emissions in a less disruptive manner. That requires us to be strategic. To build back better. This will only happen if financial decisions, including those made by businesses, investors, banks and governments, take the climate crisis into account. The economic recovery plans being developed today offer the chance to build a sustainable, competitive new economy.  Following the global financial crisis, only a fraction of fiscal spending improved sustainability. This time, governments’ stimulus packages can be more ambitious; for example, some are already accelerating the transition to clean energy, retrofitting homes and buildings, and linking financial support to climate-related conditions laid out by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Investments in renewable energy infrastructure could also serve a dual purpose, moving us towards an orderly transition path and creating jobs to support the recovery. Recognising the continued importance of climate risks to the financial sector, the NGFS has continued its work while those on the frontline fight the pandemic. As central banks and supervisors, we must use our financial stability mandates and expertise to ensure climate risks are effectively managed in the financial system. The challenge is global and will benefit from early action, so we are working together to share best practice and build our capabilities. Last week, the NGFS released a package of reports on climate and environmental risks, including an overview of industry practices and guidance for supervisory authorities, and in the coming weeks it will publish a set of climate reference scenarios. This work will support an orderly transition and raise the bar for the financial sector worldwide. In the aftermath of the financial crisis the international community rallied together to reform the financial system. These reforms have enabled the financial system to be part of the solution rather than the problem. Once again we have reached a fork in the road. We have a choice: rebuild the old economy, locking in temperature increases of 4C with extreme climate disruption; or build back better, preserving our planet for generations to come. To meet the climate crisis challenge, we must learn from the Covid-19 pandemic. Let us make a green recovery the first step down that road. • Andrew Bailey is governor of the Bank of England; François Villeroy de Galhau is governor of Banque de France; Frank Elderson is chair of the Network for Greening the Financial System and executive board member of the Nederlandsche Bank; Mark Carney is UN special envoy for climate action and finance"
"Senior scientists and government officials are meeting in Japan to finalise a new report on the impacts of climate change. It will be the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in seven years and will outline the impact that rising temperatures will have on humans, animals and ecosystems over the next century. The meeting in Japan marks the end of a very long process that’s involved in producing an IPCC report. As a lead author in the chapter which deals with freshwater resources, I’ve attended meetings over the last seven years with other experts to pour over the research papers published on the topic. We’ve spent many hours discussing how best to summarise all these results – drafting and re-drafting as well as dealing with many review comments from academics the world over. Over the next few days, government representatives are gathered together in Yokohama to agree every single word of the report summary. The hall has the look of a UN summit. All the delegates with their headphones on and banks of hard working translators sitting behind glass panels, making sure that whatever language you speak you can contribute to the process.  You might suspect that this rather formal IPCC governmental approval process would make the report a highly political document and of course there are some countries that argue to make the conclusions stronger and some that argue for them to be weaker. But the report has to remain true to the scientific evidence. Many of the scientists who have helped write the report are there at every step of the meeting, keeping the statements spot on with what the scientific evidence can tell us. So, how has our understanding of the impacts of climate change developed over the last seven years? There are no really big game changers; just a growing body of evidence that climate change, if left unchecked, could have very serious impacts on the food we eat, the water we drink and the places we live. A lot of details are still uncertain, but the risks are very clear. Many regions of the world will face multiple impacts. For example, populous parts of south and southeast Asia are likely to be exposed to increasing flood risk (along coasts and rivers), increasing risks of drought, decreases in crop productivity and more frequent heat waves. In my area of research, we know with high confidence that many parts of the world will see changes in the amount of rainfall they receive. Local details and magnitudes vary, but dry areas tend to get drier, and wet areas tend to get wetter – models consistently show this.  Water is already a scarce resource for more than a billion people in the world and with an increasing population it will get scarcer. Climate change will make the challenge of getting enough water even harder. For example, by 2050, one to three billion people in currently dry regions could have less water as a result of climate change, if greenhouse gases continue to rise rapidly.  On the other hand, 300 million to almost 3 billion people could have more water. But this water might not necessarily be available for people to use unless it is stored in some way (such as in reservoirs) and the risk of flooding for these people could increase. There has been less work done on how flood risk along rivers might change in the future. Clearly some regions will see increasing rainfall and there is also a clear signal that heavy rainfall will increase across many areas – all this points to increasing flood risk. One study suggests that the current once in a century flood could occur twice as frequently across up to 40% of the world’s floodplains. There’s also been a lot more research looking at how impacts might be reduced if we can keep the rise in global temperatures to below 2°C and to look at how quickly the severity of impacts increases with increasing temperature. This research helps to inform international climate policy, which is trying to agree reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to keep the impact of climate change from getting too bad. If global temperature rise can be limited to 2°C (which is looking increasingly challenging), this could reduce impacts in 2050 on water scarcity by 22-24% and on river flooding by around 16%. So, even with stringent emission reductions and limited warming, the world will still need to adapt to the significant impacts that climate change is bringing. And this is perhaps where the new IPCC report will show the greatest advances in our understanding.  Over the past few years, many organisations have begun to think about how to adapt to climate change. We now have many more examples in many parts of the world. They show that adaptation can substantially reduce the impacts of climate change – but they also show that there are many barriers to successful adaptation. A key one is the uncertainty in exactly how climate may change, and a clear lesson from the recent literature is that we need to think flexibly and innovatively in order to cope with our changing climate."

Would you keep using the same law firm if they had made mistakes with the last 40 legal transactions? Conveyancing errors, family trusts fouled up, divorce a shambles? No, of course not, you would have changed lawyer after mistake one. 



Would you still be using the same accountant after the last 40 years’ accounts had been full of errors with the IRD hassling you for wrong payments etc? No, of course not, you would have changed accountant after year two.



Would you continue to trust your investment adviser if the last 40 investments had been spectacular miscalculations? No, of course not, you would have changed adviser after failure two or three. 



Would you keep subjecting yourself to the gentle ministrations of a dentist who had wrongly drilled, filled, capped, extracted and so forth 40 times? No, of course not, you would have changed your dentist after mistake one. 



Would you keep believing the environmental and climate science doom-mongering experts and following their diktats when at least 40 predictions they had made over the past 50 years had failed to come true and not a single prediction had yet been proven correct? 



Apparently, yes, most of the population and all governments would.



Curious, isn’t it?

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski writes here about the grave error committed by the British Royal Society’s in its false claim that the Rhachistia aldabrae snail had gone extinct and that it had been due to global warming. Full story here in English.
Hat-tip: Reader DirkH.
Bojanowski calls the news of the extinction being false “good news”, but says that it has become “a problem for British Royal Society” and that the re-appearance of the alleged climate change victim has put the Royal Society “in difficulty“.
The story, first reported by the Times, is now catching some of the attention of the German mainstream media, which have been reluctant to report the good news. Bojanowski describes how scientists declared the snail extinct and how subsequent rebuttals were rejected.
Eventually a red-faced Royal Society admitted that the reviewers of the rebuttal were the very same who reviewed the 2007 paper which had declared extinction.
IPCC credibility questioned more than ever
Not only the Royal Society has been embarrassed by the snail’s re-appearance, Bojanowski also writes that “the case is also inconvenient for the UN IPCC“, which claimed global warming was threatening to make a number of species extinct and that the snail’s alleged disappearance was a sign of this happening.

On the IPCC Bojanowski writes:
Now credibility is in question more than ever”.
At the end Bojanowski tells readers, however, that the snail’s re-appearance is no reason to call off the alarm:
The number of snails at the Seychelles coral atoll has shrunk considerably since the 1970s. Reason unclear.”
The science is as murky as ever. But one thing is clear: some scientists were in quite a rush to declare it dead and to use it as a poster-child for global warming.
Backfired!

"Returning home on Saturday night after a dinner in Manhattan with some longtime friends, Gregory Locke boarded a No. 1 subway train and was confronted with an ugly sight. The car’s windows and posters were covered in   graffiti, according to accounts from Mr. Locke and another passenger in the car, Jared Nied. Messages like “Jews belong in the oven” and “destroy Israel, Heil Hitler,” had been written over subway maps, as shown by photographs taken on the train. Swastikas were drawn in black marker on the doors and windows. Mr. Locke, 27, a New York lawyer, said in a phone interview that his first reaction was shock, “especially once I realized how many instances of graffiti were on the train car. ” “But the shock quickly subsides and turns into a sort of a realistic horror,” he said. “You realize it’s appalling but it’s also not surprising at the same time. ” Neither man reported the graffiti to the police, and neither the New York Police Department nor the Metropolitan Transportation Authority had a record of any report. Mr. Nied, 36, was returning home from his work as a   around 7 p. m. and boarded the train at 42nd Street. He said in a phone interview that his reaction to the graffiti, which he noticed immediately, must have been written on his face, and he soon attracted the attention of another commuter. “There was a lady sitting across from me under the map, and she said, ‘Oh that’s absolutely horrible,’” he said. “‘Do you think there’s any way we can erase it? ’” Mr. Nied had many times used a Sharpie when he had meant to use a   marker, and he knew from experience that alcohol would work to erase the graffiti. “A light bulb went on, and I just asked, ‘Does anyone have hand sanitizer? ’” he said. Mr. Nied and several other commuters began to wipe away the graffiti, their actions captured in photographs taken by Mr. Locke, who wrote on Facebook about his experience. By late Sunday afternoon, more than 518, 000 people had reacted to the post on Facebook, and the post had been shared more than 354, 000 times. “I’ve never seen so many people simultaneously reach into their bags and pockets looking for tissues and Purell,” Mr. Locke wrote. “Within about two minutes, all the Nazi symbolism was gone. ” Mr. Nied said that the episode had lasted less than five minutes and that the passengers were able to erase the graffiti before the train reached 96th Street. He returned a bottle of hand sanitizer to one of the riders, apologizing for having used most of it. “We sat down and glanced around at each other and settled back into the commute,” he said. Both men said they understood that there might be skepticism about their accounts. “I understand the criticism, but unfortunately, I don’t have an answer for it,” Mr. Locke said. “I would probably be suspicious, too, if I didn’t take the pictures. ” Detective Ahmed Nasser of the New York Police Department said that while the episode had not been reported on Saturday, other reports of   graffiti had been logged recently: A recycling container downtown was reportedly defaced with the words “Jews are a virus” in black ink in January, and swastikas were found etched on a northbound F train this month. A separate episode, in which a passenger on a B train saw that a swastika on an American flag had been transformed into a message of love, drew a comment from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Sunday. On Saturday night, Mr. Nied sent a text to his wife, Jacquline, and to a friend with a photograph of the graffiti, but he did not consider the prospect that someone else might have taken photos. He said it had not even crossed his mind until more than an hour later, when his wife looked at her phone. “She said, ‘Dude, you’re going viral,’” he recalled. He added: “It was a very New York moment in that we all came together, we all teamed up, and then we settled back down. I don’t think any of those people really spoke, truth be told. Everyone kind of just did their jobs of being decent human beings. ”"

Guest Post by Steve Goreham
Originally published in The Washington Times.
Last week I received a “Home Energy Report” flyer from Commonwealth Edison, my electricity provider in northern Illinois. The leaflet compared my energy usage to neighbors over the last two months and declared, “You used 41% MORE electricity than your efficient neighbors.” Should I be concerned about this?
My wife and I use energy, but don’t waste it. For years I’ve driven my family batty, turning off lights in vacated rooms. During the summer, my wife dries laundry in the sunshine, rather than in the dryer. We also have many of the compact fluorescent bulbs. We take these measures to lower our energy bills, not for other motives.
Isn’t it odd that ComEd, a company in the energy business, is encouraging their customers not to use it? Imagine a mailer from Coca-Cola pointing out that you drank 41% MORE soft drinks than your neighbor. Or a letter sent from Apple telling you that you needed to reduce your iPhone and iPad purchases.

A visit to the ComEd website provides some answers. First, the company is required to use part of customer payments to urge Illinois customers to reduce electricity consumption by the Illinois Public Act 95-0481. But second, the website is filled with ideological nonsense. In the Saving Energy section of the website, we find a yellow “Power Bandit” and the statement, “Saving Energy was never so much fun! Beat the Power Bandit and learn lots of ways to save energy, save money and help save the planet!” Does ComEd really believe that we can save the planet by changing light bulbs?
For decades, environmental groups have waged war on energy. They warn that increased energy usage will pollute the Earth, destroy the climate, and rapidly exhaust natural resources. They demand substitution of dilute, intermittent, and expensive wind, solar, and biofuel energy for traditional hydrocarbon or nuclear power, which is an excellent way to reduce energy usage. They tell us that nations which use the most energy do the most environmental damage.
National and state governments have swallowed the “energy usage is bad” ideology hook, line, and sinker. Twenty-nine states have enacted Renewable Portfolio Standards laws, requiring utilities to use an increasing percentage of renewable energy or be fined. Hundreds of federal and state policies subsidize and mandate renewable or reduced energy usage, including light bulb bans, vehicle mileage mandates, wind and solar subsidies, ethanol fuel mandates, and energy efficiency programs. These policies collect additional taxes from citizens and boost the cost of electricity.
But, actual trends and empirical data show that our planet is not in imminent danger. Air and water pollution in the United States is at a fifty-year low. According to Environmental Protection Agency data, airborne levels of six major pollutants declined 57 percent from 1980 to 2009 even though energy usage was up 21 percent and vehicle miles traveled were up 93 percent. International data shows that pollution is lowest in high-income nations that use high levels of energy, such as Canada and Sweden, but highest in developing nations, such as India and Indonesia. The best way reduce pollution in developing nations is to increase per capita incomes, not to restrict energy usage.
Similarly, there is no empirical evidence to show that mankind is destroying Earth’s climate. Mankind’s comparatively tiny emissions of carbon dioxide, a trace gas in our atmosphere, cause only an insignificant part of the greenhouse effect. Global surface temperatures have been flat for more than ten years despite rising atmospheric CO2. Hundreds of peer-reviewed studies report warmer temperatures 1,000 years ago than temperatures of today. A review of history shows that today’s storms, droughts, and floods are neither more frequent nor more severe than past events.
Nor are we rapidly exhausting Earth’s energy resources. We’re at the dawn of a hydrocarbon revolution, triggered by the new techniques of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Mankind now has access to centuries of petroleum and natural gas from shale fields, which can be accessed with cost-effective and environmentally-safe methods.
Yet, the “energy is bad” ideology continues. Grade school students are taught that renewable energy is good and that hydrocarbon energy is bad. The EPA is waging a war on the U.S. coal industry. Demonstrators urge President Obama to stop the Keystone pipeline. And utilities tell us how we can “save the planet.”
By the way, reports state that the 20-room Tennessee house of former Vice President Al Gore devours more than 20 times the national average electricity usage. I wonder what rating Mr. Gore would get in a ComEd “Home Energy Report?”

Under the universal declaration of human rights, everyone has the right to hold opinions and the right to express them, including in writing – so we are informed by Jeremy Wells on Seven Sharp.



It is a little hypocritical for TVNZ to tell us this as TVNZ “free speech” does not apply to anyone exposing a contrary view on the supposed climate crisis; but I digress. 



The [segment](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/university-otago-professor-has-book-free-speech-banned-uk-publisher) was about Otago University Emeritus Professor Jim Flynn. Jim has written many books and even has an effect named after him, so he is a bright lad. See the [Flynn Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect).



 **However, his latest book, ironically on the defence of free speech, has been turned down by his UK publishers on the grounds that someone might object under UK hate speech laws.**



The publishers were afraid that someone might take portions out of context and use them to stir people up. As Flynn points out, that is true of any book ever written in the history of mankind.



Seven Sharp asked him, “What do think this says about the current state of free speech if you can’t publish a book, […] debating free speech?”



I think it is a sad reflection. When I was young, during the McCarthy period, it was people like me on the left that were fired from universities and I always thought that as universities get more liberal, they will get more tolerant. 



And now on many campuses, where the students are predominantly left-wing, they even want these books banned from libraries. That is, rather than arguing with their opponents they want to make it a test of might-makes-right. 



Well all that they are demonstrating is that they are more powerful than their opponents, not that they have more evidence on their side. 



**Once you make might-makes-right take over, free speech is dead.** It just depends on who has the biggest battalions.



A few days ago, another leftie was also lamenting the state of play.



I’m a bit of a leftie but can generally have a conversation with people on the right without things getting personal or abusive.



Not so with the hard left, it’s got totalitarian.

By a 5–4 vote, the Supreme Court recently stayed implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean Power Plan, a set of regulations that would have required the states to come up with plans designed to drastically reduce the use of coal as a source of energy for electric power generation.



Since first proposed in the summer of 2014, many and perhaps most lawyers looking at the issue have concluded that the Clean Power Plan would likely never survive judicial review on the substantive question of whether it was a reasonable interpretation of an ancient and seldom‐​used provision of the Clean Air Act (Section 111(d)).



Why would the EPA have ever taken the time and trouble to promulgate a regulation with such a low chance of ever being upheld by the courts? In persuading the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit not to stay the Clean Power Plan, the EPA itself provided the answer. The agency proclaimed proudly that even though its earlier 2013 regulations requiring reductions in mercury emissions from coal‐​burning power plants had been struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015, the mere threat that those regulations might be upheld had shut down many coal‐​burning facilities and caused others to spend up to $10 billion on compliance. Thus, the EPA argued, since unlawful regulations terrorize regulatory targets into compliance, there is no need to hurry in declaring those regulations officially unlawful when the targets have already suffered irreparable loss.





The EPA’s attempt to coerce decarbonization by promulgating regulations without regard to their legality is not only a cynical use of regulatory power, but an attempt to override a Congress that is not dysfunctional, but representative.



The cynical and strategic attitude underlying this argument is that the legality of regulation doesn’t matter. What matters instead is that by threatening regulation, the EPA can accomplish its ultimate goal of putting coal‐​burning electric‐​generating facilities out of business.



Climate change legal activists would likely argue that such use of regulatory power is far from cynical, but a heroic attempt to “stop” or “fix” global warming in the face of congressional failure to pass comprehensive climate change legislation. Indeed, after returning to Harvard Law School, former Obama administration climate change czarina Jody Freeman argued in some detail that when Congress fails to act to address pressing problems, regulatory agencies such as EPAshould be free to creatively interpret old statutes, such as the Clean Air Act, to address new problems like climate change.



This argument rests on the explicit assumption that congressional failure to enact comprehensive climate change legislation represents another failure by a dysfunctional Congress. Less explicitly, it assumes that most intelligent people must agree that climate change is a problem demanding federal legislation designed to decarbonize the American economy, and that climate change is a bad problem requiring a fix, however costly and disruptive it might be.



The economics of climate change are much more complicated than this. The EPA has used Obama administration estimates of the total harm from future climate change (the so‐​called social cost of carbon) to justify its regulations under the Clean Air Act. However, buried in the technical support document used to generate those estimates (and a recent National Academies of Science review), one finds clearly that the EPA’s estimated harm from future climate change depends on a whole series of, at best, questionable assumptions. For example, the economic models used to estimate harm assume that even developed countries have very limited ability to adapt to changing climate, an assumption that if true would mean the Netherlands would not be a country, but a shoal in the North Atlantic. And Arizona would not be home to millions of people nor California’s San Joaquin Valley the most productive agricultural area on earth. Instead, they would be uninhabited deserts.



Another big part of the estimated harm from future climate change is the potentially catastrophic type depicted in the movie “The Day After Tomorrow,” in which the North Atlantic Ocean’s meridional circulation shuts down, causing an almost instantaneous Ice Age over the entire Northern Hemisphere.



As laughable as that scenario may be, no less laughable is the way that climate economists have come up with their estimates for the cost of such future climate change: asking other climate economists for their best guesses. And all estimates of future potential harm from climate change rest on estimates of future temperature change, even as University of Alabama’s John Christy has repeatedly testified before Congress that the warming forecast by the computer models is breathtakingly high.



A body of recent economic work (which I survey in an article forthcoming in the Cato journal Regulation) shows that whether one considers agricultural productivity, human health, or virtually any other determinant of human well‐​being, climate became less and less important over the course of the 20th century. It is poorer societies that suffer differentially from the vagaries of weather and climate. If the future will be different and people will lose their ability to cope with climate, it will be primarily due to populations becoming poorer and devoid of the capital required for investment in technological innovation.



In this light, it is hardly astounding that many people, including members of Congress, would decide against incurring now the enormous economic costs of decarbonizing the American economy in order to prevent highly uncertain and indisputably distant harm from climate change. Others are of the opposite view and believe that now is the time for ending the use of fossil fuels to generate power.



Those holding this view tend to be from states such as California, Washington and Oregon, which get very large fractions of their electricity from hydropower or nuclear. Members of Congress from such states know full well that the EPA’s Clean Power Plan and other steps to decarbonize electricity supply would confer a sizable competitive benefit on their constituents by forcing fossil fuel‐​reliant states to adopt more expensive energy sources.



Congressional failure to enact comprehensive climate change legislation is not a manifestation of a dysfunctional Congress, but of a Congress that is representative, in which the views of those who would lose a lot from immediate steps to decarbonize the American economy have prevailed over the views of those who would be net winners.



The EPA’s attempt to coerce decarbonization by promulgating regulations without regard to their legality is not only a cynical use of regulatory power, but an attempt to override a Congress that is not dysfunctional, but representative.

 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



 **  
Rodney Local Board (Warkworth Subdivision)**



As of October 3, voter turnout is 23% down on 2016 which is an improvement on October 2. The Warkworth subdivision of Rodney Local Board is a bit more enthusiastic about doing their civic duty – just 3.7% behind the previous election. There are three seats in this subdivision, Local Board Chair Beth Houlbrooke the sole incumbent.



It seems an age ago but at the beginning of this election I wrote a [sneak peek](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/hold-the-press-a-sneak-peek/) of what was to come.



[ **Steven Garner – Rodney Now**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=0c044e11-ece0-4b52-9f54-cc40d2145920&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Rodney%20Local%20Board%20\(Warkworth%20Subdivision\)) ****



Garner’s affiliation has been difficult to nail down. The 2016 Independent candidate was on a Community Independents ticket on August 27 with Tim Holdgate though they were both Independent on [September 2](https://www.localmatters.co.nz/news/34718-local-election-campaigning-underway.html). Campaign literature circulated without an authorisation statement is headed “independent looking out for you and Rodney Now.” He had no affiliation in the [Northern Action Group’s ](http://www.nag.org.nz/Voting%20advice%20for%20NAG%20Supporters-1.pdf)voting guide. [Snell’s Beach Residents and Ratepayers](https://snellsbeach.co.nz/RLBelection/) coverage of their candidate debate is pictorial only. There’s been no public break up between the two ‘Community Independents’ and googling ‘Rodney Now’ brought up [this article](https://m.localmatters.co.nz/news/35222-rodney-first-versus-independents-at-candidates-meets.html) in which Garner was referred to as an independent and he claims to be opposed to tickets in local government. Maybe there was a private break up?  




Garner has been an elected member previously. He served as Deputy Chair from 2010-16. Warren Flaunty was also on Rodney Local Board and notoriously several others at the same time in 2013. There were 40 meetings Flaunty couldn’t attend in their entirety. Garner was the ultimate part-time board member, with 47 meetings not seen through from start to finish.



There were many instances in which Garner’s attendance was a handicap rather than a help. Often his reports were unread and sealed in the courier packs or he would return from holiday and attempt to relitigate issues he couldn’t take part in as a result.



When it feels like the entire world is against you, sometimes you need to look at yourself to understand why. Garner isn’t that smart and has bought in to the idea that the Rodney First ticket is a conspiracy to squash himself and others in the area that oppose the current elected board members.



The [Rodney Community Voices](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2338166819738983/permalink/2338189306403401/) facebook group, set up by Glen Ashton about a month ago, appears to be in response to the idea that the local facebook groups (created by Phelan Pirrie years ago but now with multiple admins) are censorship or an attack on democracy. What this group implies, via unauthorised pictures posted on October 1, is that if there is no collusion by the independents, then Glen Ashton appears to have appointed himself manager of their ‘campaigns’.



It’s all a bit pathetic really.



[ **Tim Holdgate – Independent**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=db07dc9c-122c-4835-90f3-b7e309ae44f8&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Rodney%20Local%20Board%20\(Warkworth%20Subdivision\)) ****



Just finished wasting ten minutes of my life verifying Tim Holdgate hasn’t previously been elected to the Rodney Local Board. His candidate profile states 



“My Warkworth community involvement has included 10 years on the Mahurangi College Board of Trustees (4 years as Chairman), 7 years as trustee on the Harbour Sport Trust, member of the Mahurangi Collective for Sport & Recreation, together with various other sporting and cultural committees.



As a Rodney Local Board member demanding greater financial accountability and transparency from Auckland Council, specifically for Warkworth Subdivision ratepayers. We must get our fair rates share spent locally.” 



I wouldn’t want to cast aspertions, so clearly Holdgate doesn’t have an eye for detail and his grammar sucks.



Holdgate’s day job is in real estate and he is also a Registered Valuer. He has also spent 10 years on the Mahurangi College Board of Trustees, 7 years Harbour Sport Trust and a member of the Mahurangi Collective for Sport and Recreation. No flashy title accompanied that last grouping so I couldn’t possibly speculate what he achieved there.



His priorities if elected (snarky comments from me in brackets):



What an absolute knob.



[ **Beth Houlbrooke – Rodney First**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=17c9a4d5-7d1d-4ab3-b45b-448ca7a0b312&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Rodney%20Local%20Board%20\(Warkworth%20Subdivision\)) **$$$$$**



(disclaimer – yes, I know Beth. No, I didn’t spend several hours a day for more than a month writing a voting guide to an entire city election as part of some conspiracy to fix the Rodney Local Board election)



Beth Houlbrooke has been on the Rodney Local Board for two terms and Chair for the current term. Beth isn’t a familiar face around Rodney because she has lived there for 25 years. It is because she works incredibly hard and is present at just about every community event and meeting in one of the geographically biggest local boards in Auckland.



Following the endorsement of those who submitted to the public consultation on implementing a targeted rate to fund transport initiatives, the work of Rodney First and Councillor Sayers successfully advocated a multi-million dollar increase from Auckland Transport to deal with the poor condition of the roading network in Rodney. It won’t happen overnight but it will happen over the next few years (lightspeed in bureaucracies).



Before joining the local board, Beth was an award-winning business owner. Networking, building relationships and negotiating are key skills to be an award-winning business owner and those are skills she employs today. The relationships with various bureaucrats, politicians, officials take time to nurture and blossom into results for your constituents. Anyone who thinks a bullet-pointed list of demands is going to deliver for Rodney is already out of their league.



Should Beth be returned to the local board for a third term, her priority is expanding the public transport network delivered by Rodney Local Board’s target rate, completing the Warkworth Park & Ride (a result of AT increasing the sealing budget, coming from the transport targeted rate), making further improvements on town centres and several more projects that Beth won’t be able to complete without the Rodney First team being elected also.



[ **Paul Manton – Rodney First**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=01bce9f3-2544-43fc-944d-8f1120e198ee&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Rodney%20Local%20Board%20\(Warkworth%20Subdivision\)) **$$$$$**



Paul lives near Puhoi where he is co-chair of the Puhoi Community Forum and sits on the Mahurangi Sports Collective, which oversees activities on the Warkworth Showgrounds. Paul must see Tim Holdgate there all the time when he isn’t busy doing fundraising for local clubs or working on the Matakana Coast Trail Trust.



Paul moved to Puhoi 30 years ago, after doing an engineering apprenticeship and working for Shell Oil.[ The Rodney First website](http://www.rodneyfirst.org/) mentions the ticket’s goals in relation to community participation in parks and reserves. That includes a number of new walking trails and the maintenance of existing walking infrastructure. Paul Manton probably knows a thing or two about doing that. After many years working in organisations that form relationships with the local board, he is well equipped to take the step of joining the local board to help those organisations.



He sees his role on the board as being the focal point for parks and recreational organisations, ensuring the parks are properly maintained for use and the limited facilities are flexible in their utilisation.



[ **Ayla Walker – Rodney First**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=e1baef4d-4af4-40ab-99e2-6cd5961f03eb&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Rodney%20Local%20Board%20\(Warkworth%20Subdivision\)) **$$$**



A resident of Ahuroa and proven election winner, having just been voted onto the Ahuroa School Board of Trustees. Walker is currently being mentored via One Warkworth Business Association having recently finished her business studies.



Mrs Walker is younger than most of those who are elected to and make a success of local boards. It is fortunate that if she is elected as part of a ticket, there will be plenty of support while she grapples with her role.



Ayla’s passion is the local environment and she wants to prioritise improving water quality and work with like-minded members of the community on recycling initiatives, and plant and animal pest control.



I saw the first mention of climate change in the Rodney contest in her list of priorities. 



She’s new.

"JERUSALEM  —   Israel’s Parliament passed a provocative law late Monday that would retroactively legalize Jewish settlements on privately owned Palestinian land, pressing ahead with a statement of   assertiveness despite the likelihood that the country’s high court will nullify the legislation. It was a defining  —   opponents said frightening  —   moment in Israel’s    relations with Palestinians and amid fading hopes of ending decades of conflict through a   solution. While polls consistently show that most Israelis still support two states, their leaders and the reality of what is happening on the ground are consistently heading in the opposite direction: Fifty years after Israel defeated Jordan and captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem, many   politicians say that now  —   with negotiations with the Palestinians frozen  —   is the moment Israel must decide what it wants and act decisively on it. The new law is “deteriorating Israel’s democracy, making stealing an official policy and bringing us one step closer to annexation” of more land Palestinians claim for a future state, said Anat Ben Nun, the director of external relations for Peace Now, an   group. Only a few months ago, the law was believed to have little chance of coming up for a vote. Even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was flying back from a meeting with Britain’s leaders as the law was being debated, seemed to oppose its passage for fear of further international censure. The bill had been so contentious that the nation’s attorney general, who described it as unconstitutional and in contravention of international law, said he would not defend it in the high court, which seemed in any case likely to nullify it. That is partly because the law applies to Palestinians and their property rights. Since Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are not Israeli citizens and cannot vote for candidates for Israel’s Parliament, or Knesset, critics of the legislation say it is inherently  . Under the law, Palestinian landowners will be offered compensation for the   use of their property but will not be able to reclaim it. But the bill gained internal momentum through several forces: Mr. Netanyahu is determined to show his support to the powerful settler movement, and is under pressure from   on the right and from corruption investigations that even his supporters say appear serious. That pressure intensified last week after Mr. Netanyahu’s government carried out a court order to evacuate about 40 settler families at the Amona outpost, declared illegal a decade ago. “Today Israel decreed that developing settlement in Judea and Samaria is an Israeli interest,” said Bezalel Smotrich, a   lawmaker, using the biblical names for the West Bank. “From here we move on to expanding Israeli sovereignty and continuing to build and develop settlements across the land. ” At the same time, Mr. Netanyahu and the right  —   some allies, some opponents  —   have taken into account that they have more leeway under President Trump than under President Barack Obama, who regularly condemned settlement building. It is uncertain, however, just how firm the support from the new administration in Washington is: Last week, the White House issued a statement, amid announcements here about thousands of units of housing for settlers, saying that further expansion “may not be helpful” in achieving a deal with the Palestinians, which Mr. Trump has said he wants. A clearer sense of how Mr. Trump differs from Mr. Obama and from nearly 50 years of American opposition to settlement building is expected to emerge from a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu on Feb. 15 in Washington. The vote on Monday, which passed, 60 to 52, retroactively legalized several thousand housing units in 16 settlements on about 2, 000 acres of   land. The law provides for compensation to Palestinian landowners. Opponents said the law would encourage more settlements on Palestinian land, with the expectation that they, too, would be legalized. “Looting is illegal,” Saeb Erekat, the Palestinians’ chief negotiator, said in a statement after the vote. “The Israeli settlement enterprise negates peace and the possibility of the   solution. ” Yair Lapid, the opposition politician seeking to succeed Mr. Netanyahu, said before the vote: “It’s unjust, it’s not smart, and it’s a law which damages the state of Israel, the security of Israel, governance in Israel and our ability to fight back against those who hate Israel. ” He added, “They are passing a law which endangers our soldiers, will undermine our international standing and undermine us as a country of law and order. ” Israel’s settlement activity has come under intense international criticism. In December, the United Nations  —   with the tacit support of the outgoing Obama administration  —   condemned Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem as an impediment to a   solution. Settlers and   Israelis say the West Bank and East Jerusalem, captured from Jordan in the   War of 1967, belong to the Jewish people. The international significance of the vote on Monday was underscored during Mr. Netanyahu’s quick trip to visit Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. On one hand, she noted that her first meeting with Mr. Netanyahu came 100 years after the Balfour Declaration, in which the British government governing the area supported the creation of Jewish state. She said, however, that Britain remained “committed to a   solution,” adding, “It’s the best way of building stability, peace and prosperity in the future. ” Appearing before reporters with Mrs. May in London, Mr. Netanyahu, who has in the past tepidly supported a   solution, did not do so on Monday. As voting neared, tensions rose in the divided Knesset. “You are only passing this law so that the Supreme Court will later overturn it, and then you’ll be in the position to blame the judges,” Revital Swid, a member of the Zionist Union Party, told the governing Likud Party’s science minister, Ofir Akunis. “The land of Israel is ours, and this cannot be disputed or be divided,” Mr. Akunis responded. “The concept of settlement blocs is no longer relevant because there are no Arabs to negotiate with anymore. ” The vote came on the same day as a rocket fired from Gaza landed near the Israeli city of Ashkelon. No one was hurt. The Israeli military responded with artillery fire and airstrikes in northern Gaza. It was unclear if the rocket attack was related to Monday’s vote."

Alternate Title: Climate Science Community Continues to Lose Sight of Reality
SkepticalScience is promoting the Holland and Bruyère (2013) paper Recent Intense Hurricane Response to Global Climate Change as proof positive that hypothetical human-induced global warming has caused more intense hurricanes. See Dana Nuccitelli’s post New Research Shows Humans Causing More Intense Hurricanes. My Figure 1 is Figure 1 from Holland and Bruyère (2013).

Figure 1
The abstract of Holland and Bruyère (2013) begins:
An Anthropogenic Climate Change Index (ACCI) is developed and used to investigate the potential global warming contribution to current tropical cyclone activity. The ACCI is defined as the difference between the means of ensembles of climate simulations with and without anthropogenic gases and aerosols. This index indicates that the bulk of the current anthropogenic warming has occurred in the past four decades, which enables improved confidence in assessing hurricane changes as it removes many of the data issues from previous eras.
That’s right; referring to Figure 1, Holland and Bruyère (2013) created an index by subtracting the multi-model mean of climate models forced by natural factors (variations in solar activity and volcanic aerosols) from the mean of the simulations that are also forced with anthropogenic factors like manmade greenhouse gases—as if the two types of model simulations and their difference represent reality. They then used that model-based index, with little to no basis in the real world, for comparisons to hurricane activity at various hurricane strengths.

Hurricane activity is influenced by tropical sea surface temperatures. Yet, we know climate models cannot simulate sea surface temperatures over the past 31 years, which is included in the 1975 to 2010 period studied by Holland and Bruyère (2013). Refer to the post here for a model-data comparison of satellite-era sea surface temperature anomalies. And we’ve also discussed for 4 years how ocean heat content data and satellite-era sea surface temperature data indicate the oceans warmed naturally. Refer to the illustrated essay “The Manmade Global Warming Challenge” [42MB]. The models are obviously flawed.
Hurricane activity is also influenced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). There are fewer Atlantic hurricanes during El Niño years due to the increase in wind shear there. On the other hand, there’s an increase in the intensity of eastern tropical Pacific cyclones during El Niño years. See Table 1, which is from the NOAA Weather Impacts of ENSO webpage.

Table 1
Does Holland and Bruyère (2013) consider ENSO? No. The words El Niño and La Niña do not appear in the paper, and ENSO appears only once, when they’re discussing the reason for the use of 5-year smoothing.
All variance numbers use the 5-years smoothed annual time series to remove ENSO type variability.
Can climate models simulate ENSO? The answer is also no. Refer to the post Guilyardi et al (2009) “Understanding El Niño in Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Models: progress and challenges”.
Guilyardi et al (2009) includes:
Because ENSO is the dominant mode of climate variability at interannual time scales, the lack of consistency in the model predictions of the response of ENSO to global warming currently limits our confidence in using these predictions to address adaptive societal concerns, such as regional impacts or extremes (Joseph and Nigam 2006; Power et al. 2006).
The multidecadal variability of the sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic is called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation or AMO. There are numerous papers that discuss the influence of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation on hurricane activity. In fact, the NOAA Frequently Asked Questions About the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) includes the question Does the AMO influence the intensity or the frequency of hurricanes (which)? Their answer reads:
The frequency of weak-category storms – tropical storms and weak hurricanes – is not much affected by the AMO. However, the number of weak storms that mature into major hurricanes is noticeably increased. Thus, the intensity is affected, but, clearly, the frequency of major hurricanes is also affected. In that sense, it is difficult to discriminate between frequency and intensity and the distinction becomes somewhat meaningless.
The AMO began its multidecadal rise in temperature in the mid-1970s. See Figure 2. By focusing their analysis on the period of 1975 to 2010, Holland and Bruyère (2013) appear to be, in part, attempting to blame manmade greenhouse gases for an increase in activity that’s already been attributed to the natural variability of the AMO.

Figure 2
Off topic note: Referring to Figure 1 from Holland and Bruyère (2013), notice how the surface temperature data ends in 1999 in cell b, while the models continue for a number of years beyond then, probably to the 2005 end year of the historic CMIP5 simulations. Apparently, some climate scientists haven’t figured out what assumption a reader is forced to make when he or she sees disparities in the end dates of model-data comparisons—that the models would show very poorly if Holland and Bruyère (2013) had extended the data to the end year of the historic simulations, 2005, or to the end year of their study, which was 2010. Note also that the data begins after the start year of the models, too. In other words, most readers wonder what the authors are hiding and assume the worst.
CLOSING
Holland and Bruyère (2013) appears to be a flawed attempt to counter the findings of the recent (2012) IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). See the Summary for Policymakers here. The IPCC writes:
There is low confidence in any observed long-term (i.e., 40 years or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity (i.e., intensity, frequency, duration), after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities.
Holland and Bruyère (2013) is yet another peer-reviewed study that relies on climate models as if the models represent reality, when climate models clearly do not. Eventually, the climate science community will have to come to terms with this—possibly not in my lifetime at the rate they’re going. And the portrayers of gloom and doom at SkepticalScience like Dana Nuccitelli somehow find papers like Holland and Bruyère (2013) to be credible. Nothing surprising about that.

One doesn’t need Superman’s X‐​ray vision or have to look far to see various tensions building in the Asia‐​Pacific region, aside from those long‐​standing ones between North and South Korea, or China and Taiwan.



Recent rhetoric over a chain of uninhabited islands in a potentially energy‐​rich area of the East China Sea, which the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands, and which the Chinese call the Diaoyu Islands, makes it appear that the Japanese government is taking a tougher approach on foreign policy and military affairs.



Its decision to purchase the disputed islands in September has only served to increase irritation among the Chinese. Ironically, the Japanese government was trying to keep things from getting worse, since the decision was a response to the hawkish plans of Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara, who sought to purchase the islands by collecting public donations. Given Ishihara’s nationalistic views, such a purchase would have certainly have further escalated the dispute.



Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda vowed that he would “never compromise” on the territorial dispute with China. And even his rival, Shinzo Abe, former prime minister and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has similarly pledged to defend Japan’s territorial assets.



Those hoping the United States can mediate this are likely hoping in vain. The United States maintains that it has no position on the dispute, while acknowledging that the islands nonetheless fall under a United States‐​Japan defense treaty.



Meanwhile, China continues its military and political standoff with the Philippines over control of parts of the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.



And the United States has conceptualized a new concept of American overseas military operations known as “Air‐​Sea Battle,” which some in Asia — as well as back home — see as a way for the United States to challenge a rising China.



Aside from its longstanding military presence in Japan and South Korea, the U.S. military, as part of the Obama Administration’s “pivot to Asia,” is building up its relationships with other Asian nations, especially those in and around Southeast Asia.



Last November, President Obama and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced plans for enhanced U.S.-Australian military cooperation, sending up to 2,500 U.S. Marines to Australia for joint training and exercises, increasing visits by U.S. aircraft to northern Australian airfields, and conducting more calls by U.S. ships to various Australian ports.



On Tuesday, Lieut. General Francis J. Wiercinski, commanding general of U.S. Army Pacific (USARPAC), said at a panel at the Association of the U.S. Army’s annual conference that “seven of the 10 largest armies in the world are in the Pacific.”



Usually when there are geopolitical tensions there are also rising military expenditures. Such seems to be the case, as least in East Asia, although the start of the rise predates the incident described above. A study released this month by the independent Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington examines defense spending in Asia for the five countries with the largest defense budgets in Asia—China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan—for the years 2000 to 2011.



Among its findings was that defense spending increased in all five countries between 2000 and 2011. They spent a combined $224 billion last year. In constant 2011 U.S. dollars, this is almost twice the amount they spent in 2000.



But there have been changes among those countries, according to the CSIS study. Until 2005, Japan had the largest defense budget in Asia. Since 2005, China has been the biggest spender on defense, having previously replaced India as the second‐​biggest spender in 2001. China’s share of the group’s combined defense spending, more than doubled from 19.9% in 2000 to 40.2% in 2011.



Accounting for inflation, from 2000 to 2011 China’s defense spending increased the fastest, with an 11‐​year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.4%. South Korea was second, with a 4.8% CAGR. India and Japan were on a very similar growth trajectory, with 3.6 and 3.5% CAGRs, respectively. Taiwan experienced the lowest increase in defense spending among the group with a CAGR of 1.8%.



Bur military spending is only an indication — not a prediction — of what might happen in the future.



The study concludes, among other things:



 _Overall, continued or increasing tensions in the Asia‐​Pacific region could drive further increases in defense spending by Asian countries. Should the economic climate of the Asia‐​Pacific region concurrently show positive growth, many countries will also have increased means to respond to security concerns. On the other hand, if the financial situation in the coming years proves to be more austere, pressure on defense spending may also mount._

The world lost a great champion of liberty with the passing of Allan Meltzer on May 8, 2017, at the age of 89. A longtime Professor of Political Economy at Carnegie Mellon University, Allan was a prodigious worker who wrote hundreds of articles and more than ten books, including his monumental _A History of the Federal Reserve_ and more recently _Why Capitalism?_ The latter provides a strong defense of limited government, the rule of law, private property, and free markets, which he saw as the surest means to increase the wealth of nations.



Allan had a passion for ideas and a desire to influence policy; he sought to make the world a better place by safeguarding economic and personal freedom. He became a major player in the marketplace for ideas—writing, teaching, advising policymakers, serving on editorial boards, cofounding the Shadow Open Market Committee and the Carnegie‐​Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy with his close colleague and lifelong friend Karl Brunner, acting as president of the Mont Pelerin Society founded by F. A. Hayek, serving on the Council of Economic Advisers, chairing the International Financial Institution Advisory Commission (also known as the “Meltzer Commission”), and participating in numerous conferences.1 He continued working right up until his death.



I first met Allan in the early 1980s, when he began to participate in Cato’s Annual Monetary Conference. His paper “Monetary Reform in an Uncertain Environment” was delivered at the first conference, in January 1983, and published in the _Cato Journal_ later that year; it was reprinted in _The Search for Stable Money_ (University of Chicago Press, 1987), a book Anna J. Schwartz and I coedited.



In that article, Allan examined alternative monetary regimes and their implications for reducing risk and uncertainty. He sought a rules‐​based regime that would minimize uncertainty and best allow markets to flourish. He preferred, at the time, a quantity rule that would have the monetary base grow in line with the growth of real output adjusted for changes in the velocity of base money. Such a rule, he argued, would anchor expectations regarding the path of nominal income and achieve long‐​run price stability. However, the rule had to be credible and be supplemented with a fiscal rule that limited the taxing and spending powers of government. He did not want the Fed to finance government deficits or to allocate credit.



It is important to note that Allan was not opposed to private money. At the 1983 monetary conference, he argued:



Individuals or groups should be permitted to issue and use privately produced money or monies.… The objective of policy rules is to reduce the uncertainty that the community must bear, not to prevent voluntary risk taking [Meltzer 1983: 109].



Allan was open-minded and was willing to change his policy advice based on logic and evidence.



He continued to participate in Cato’s Annual Monetary Conference for many years and contributed 15 articles to the _Cato Journal_ (Table 1). Although he was often critical of Fed policy, he thought Paul Volcker was correct in ending double-digit inflation by slowing the growth of money and credit, and that Alan Greenspan was correct in following an implicit monetary rule to prevent wide fluctuations in nominal income during the “Great Moderation.”





Meltzer, however, was highly critical of the Fed’s unconventional monetary policy and wrote in the Spring/Summer 2012 _Cato Journal_ :



Overresponse to short‐​run events and neglect of longer‐​term consequences of its actions is one of the main errors that the Federal Reserve makes repeatedly. The current recession offers many examples of actions that some characterize as bold and innovative. I regard many of these actions as inappropriate for an allegedly independent central bank because they involve credit allocation, fill the Fed’s portfolio with an unprecedented volume of long‐​term assets, evade or neglect the dual mandate, distort the credit markets, and initiate other actions that are not the responsibility of a central bank [Meltzer 2012: 255].



He kept up his criticism until the end, writing articles for the Hoover Institution, where he was a Distinguished Senior Fellow,2 with such titles as “Fed Up with the Fed” (February 17, 2016), “Fed Failures” (March 9, 2016), and “Reform the Federal Reserve” (October 12, 2016), all of which appeared in _Defining Ideas_ (Hoover’s online journal). His last article appeared on April 25, 2017, less than two weeks before he died.



The last time I saw Allan was in Zurich, in September 2016, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Karl Brunner’s birth at a conference organized by the Swiss National Bank. Allan discussed Karl’s contributions to monetary theory as well as to political economy in general. In his paper, “Karl Brunner, Scholar: An Appreciation,” he emphasized that Brunner



highlighted information, institutions and uncertainty as well as the importance of microanalysis in macroeconomics. Karl Brunner explained that nominal monetary impulses changed real variables by changing the relative price of assets to output prices. And he concluded that economic fluctuations occurred because of an unstable public sector—especially the monetary sector—that disturbs a more stable private sector, a policy lesson forgotten or never learned by many central banks.3





Those ideas also were central to Allan’s work—both with Karl and independently—and they are evident in his interpretation of Keynes’s monetary theory.



In _Keynes’s Monetary Theory: A Different Interpretation_ , Meltzer (1988) argues that the vast literature on John Maynard Keynes neglected the importance he placed on credible rules, which he thought would reduce uncertainty and improve economic welfare.



In particular, Allan was influenced by Keynes’s classic _A Tract on Monetary Reform_ (1923), which discusses rules for domestic (internal) price stability and for international (external) price stability—that is, exchange rate stability. In thinking about a rule to reduce the variability of unanticipated changes in prices and outputs, Meltzer (1989: 78–81) draws on Keynes’s distinction and his recognition of the benefits of reducing both internal and external instability. The problem, of course, is to choose the appropriate institutional framework. Countries operating _independently_ cannot achieve both internal and external stability, argued Keynes, unless a key country anchors its price level by enforcing a credible rule.



Building upon Keynes’s insights, Meltzer (1989: 78) notes that if each major trading partner makes domestic price stability a priority, then uncertainty about the future path of prices will diminish and exchange rates among the partners will be more stable. To realize both internal and external stability, Meltzer proposes a simple rule: each major country should set “the rate of growth of the monetary base equal to the difference between the moving average of past real output growth and past growth in base velocity” (ibid., p. 83). If each country complies, the rule will reduce the “variability of exchange rates arising from differences in expected rates of inflation.”4



Meltzer’s proposed rule is “forecast free” and adaptable; it is mildly activist but nondiscretionary, similar to Bennett McCallum’s (1984) monetary rule. By choosing to stabilize the _anticipated_ price level rather than the actual price level, monetary authorities will not need “to reverse all changes in the price level,” argues Meltzer (1989: 79). Instead, the actual price level is allowed “to adjust as part of the process by which the economy adjusts real values to unanticipated supply shocks.” In particular, Meltzer’s monetary rule “does not adjust to short-term, transitory changes in level, but it adjusts fully to permanent changes in growth rates of output and intermediation (or other changes in the growth rate of velocity) within the term chosen for the moving averages” (ibid., p. 81).



Under the Fed’s current operating procedure, in which the Fed sets a federal funds rate target range with the rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER) as its upper limit and the Fed’s overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) agreement rate as its lower limit, Meltzer’s monetary rule could no longer work as he imagined it might.5 Because the IOER rate is higher than comparable market rates, at least some banks now find it worthwhile to accumulate excess reserves instead of trading them for other assets. The economy is, in other words, kept in a purpose-made “liquidity trap,” so that the traditional monetary “transmission mechanism” linking increases in the monetary base to changes in bank lending, overall spending, and inflation, no longer functions as it once did. Instead, barring vast changes in the quantity of base money (“quantitative easing”), to alter its policy stance the Fed has to change its IOER and ON RRP rates, thereby influencing not the supply of but the overall demand for the Fed’s deposit balances.



Before serious consideration can be given to implementing any rules-based monetary regime, the Fed needs to normalize monetary policy by ending interest on excess reserves and shrinking its balance sheet to restore a precrisis fed funds market. Once changes in base money can be effectively transmitted to changes in the money supply and nominal income, Meltzer’s rule would reduce uncertainty and spur investment and growth.



The key point, however, is that Allan wanted to explore alternative monetary rules and select those he thought would work best to reduce the variability of prices and output. That comparative-institutions approach was evident in all his work. He recognized that, ultimately, the choice of a rule would be heavily influenced by the political economy. His careful scholarship was intended to help shape the climate of ideas and public policy in the direction of what Richard Epstein (1995) has called “simple rules for a complex world.”



Although Allan was known primarily for his work on monetary theory and history, he was deeply interested in the role of government in a free society; the relation between institutions, incentives, and behavior; the determinants of economic growth; the theory of public choice; the damaging effects of official foreign aid; and the distribution of income.6 He wrote many articles for the popular press, including the _Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times_ , and _Financial Times_ , and he was always willing to help younger scholars and students understand the complexities of political economy.



Allan Meltzer was a great scholar and teacher, a friend of liberty, a man of integrity who kept his word,7 and a fine human being. He was persistent in his research and his life. Allan taught at Carnegie Mellon for 60 years and was married to his lovely wife Marilyn for 67 years.



When Allan was five years old, he lost his mother and went to live with his grandmother for several years until he moved to Los Angeles where his family ran a business. Reflecting on his early years with his grandmother, Allan said, “Her most important influence on my career and my outlook was her strongly held belief that, in America (and only in America), there were no real limits other than ability to what one could achieve by personal effort” (Meltzer 1990: 22).



In his many accomplishments and honors, Allan certainly realized the American Dream, and had a life well lived.8 He will be sorely missed, but his work will live on.

"Unilever has pledged to invest €1bn (£900m) over the next decade in environmental projects that will improve the “health of the planet”. Alan Jope, Unilever’s chief executive, said that while the world was rightly focused on the devastating coronavirus outbreak and serious issues of inequality raised by the Black Lives Matter protests, the climate emergency should not be overlooked. “We can’t let ourselves forget that the climate crisis is still a threat to all of us,” he said. The consumer goods giant, which owns more than 400 brands including Marmite, Dove, Comfort and Sure, said that in response to the “scale and urgency of the climate crisis”, it was also setting a target of net-zero emissions from all its products by 2039. The company has already promised to reduce the mountain of plastic rubbish that its products generate, but Jope said it was just as important to look at the “impact they have on the planet at the start of their life” – in the sourcing of materials, as well as in their manufacture and transport. Unilever said its €1bn “Climate & Nature Fund” would be used to fund projects ranging from landscape restoration and carbon capture to wildlife protection and water preservation. It also pledges to have a “deforestation-free” supply chain within three years, and to harness emerging digital technologies – such as satellite monitoring and geolocation tracking – to increase traceability and transparency. Jope has warned that the company would sell off brands that could not meet its own sustainability targets. It was no longer enough for consumer goods companies to sell washing powders that made shirts whiter or shampoos that make hair shinier, because consumers wanted brands that had a “purpose” too, he said. Last week, the FTSE 100-listed company announced that it had picked London as its home in an about-face on the company’s 2018 decision to opt for Rotterdam, which was abandoned after a revolt by British shareholders. If investors back the plan, it will bring an end to the company’s complex dual structure, a hangover from Unilever’s formation through the merger of a Dutch margarine producer and a British soapmaker 91 years ago."
"Many people, including me, are pretty fed up with the continuing fuss about GM food and crops. Are they too dangerous to eat? Are they a hazard to the environment? Despite a “debate” stretching back to 1998, why has no consensus been reached?  It’s pretty clear to everyone that we will need to grow more food – and grow it sustainably – so why can’t we make up our minds? There have been innumerable reviews and many open debates. How does the recently published letter from the Council for Science and Technology to the government help? Initially the focus of the debate was on the meal from GM soya beans, which the regulatory committee (which I chaired) had recommended to ministers to be safe. This was challenged by a claim, in press releases and on a TV programme in August 1998, from Dr A Pusztai that GM potatoes caused cancer when fed to rats. A claim that this was true of all GM foods was then made, but never sustained – the claims were disputed and could not be reproduced.  But it became the rallying cry for a well-run media campaign which took all GM products out of UK supermarkets and stopped the European approval process dead in its tracks. But not in the US. Despite these fears, the fact that US consumers have been eating GM products for over a decade and that no-one in the most litigious nation in the world, has been harmed, is the reason why even the pressure groups have dropped their claims. What about the environment? This is a contentious area and claims have been made too about the adverse effects of GM crops on the environment – including damage to insects. They are often generalised to all GM crops, often from a single report. I have read the evidence carefully and my conclusion is that there is no evidence that genetic modification per se causes harm. GM crops do spread but just like normal crops and plant breeders have known how to handle those problems for years. So what went wrong? The genetic modification of the soya bean was modest – no more than the introduction of two genes from a common soil bacterium. But this product, although deemed safe by the regulatory committee, was rejected by consumers. Why was this? There were a number of reasons. There was a strong reaction against what was perceived as the economic hegemony of a large US multinational company and their unwillingness to label or to separate the new product from non-GM versions, so that consumers had no choice. Thus, decisions that might possibly affect the health of British consumers, and certainly affected their ability to choose, were being taken by Monsanto in Missouri. Consumers objected to this perceived loss of control. Plus, GM soya offered the consumer no advantage. The advantage went to the farmer and seed producer – there was little incentive for them to buy it. Underlying all this was a suspicion of the regulatory process, which stemmed from the BSE (or mad cow disease) outbreak in the UK in the 1990s. The media played their role too in enabling the anti-GM campaign to flourish, despite the poor scientific basis to many of their claims.  All these issues are addressed in the letter to the prime minister from the Council for Science and Technology. It suggests a sensible way forward and what follows are some of their main points that speak to how we should proceed with GM. There is a consensus on the scientific evidence that, when properly controlled, GM products are as safe as their conventional counterparts. We should have confidence in this and the EU regulatory process needs to be rebalanced to reflect the evidence. The European Academies Science Advisory Council are in agreement too that the regulatory framework should switch its focus on to products rather than on technologies. We need a regulatory framework that can allow for a variety of solutions to the current and future problems facing UK agriculture. In some instances, GM may be the only solution to a particular problem or one of several. We need a framework that is flexible enough to accommodate this. To move forward, government, industry, NGOs and the research community should tackle the barriers that prevent properly sanctioned field trials from taking place. Plus, most consumers are unaware of the challenges of food production and distribution. It would help if food producers and retailers were more open about these challenges, as the benefits citizens will have from GM technologies will be more apparent. Government, industry and the scientific community all have a role to play in explaining the technology, its benefits and how it is regulated. Others, including retailers, NGOs and the media, all have a duty to ensure that the debate reflects the evidence accurately. Wider concerns, which go beyond the scientific evidence, need to be acknowledged and addressed. The UK should continue to call loudly for science and evidence-based decision making on this issue – it’s clear that scientific consensus in both Britain and Europe calls for a relaxation of the strict barriers to GM crops."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt seems that it is beginning to dawn on some of Europe’s mainstream media: The transition to green energies is turning out to be ten or even 100 times more expensive than what they were led to believe just a few years ago.
Increasingly we have been seeing reports featuring renowned climate economists such as Bjørn Lomborg or Richard Tol in the German-language mainstream media.
The message: Hey, this green energy policy really isn’t working well at all.
And again the climate policy critics Tol and Lomborg are being featured by the German-language media as respected dissident voices, this time by the online Austrian nachrichten.at in an article titled: 1 Euro Kosten, 3 Cent Nutzen. In English:
1 euro costs, 3 cents benefit
First the nachrichten.at discusses what could be the most economically sensible way of reducing CO2 emissions. So far the measures that have been implemented have been both effective and ineffective: Effective at costing lots of money, ineffective at actually reducing CO2 emissions.
The nachrichten.at writes that the most effective policy to reduce carbon emissions may be a CO2 tax, but then writes how Australia has just repealed it because of its sheer unpopularity.
The Austrian nachrichten.at then writes about the astronomical costs and the utter ineffectivity of climate policy so far:

Already the EU 2020 strategy costs 185 billion euros annually. By the end of the century the costs will run to 15 trillion euros. With this, according to the UN IPCC, the global temperature increase will be lowered 0.05°C. For every euro that the EU pays into climate protection, it prevents 3 cents worth of damage from climate change. Lomborg writes: ‘That is not rational policy!'”
The nachrichten.at quotes what Lomborg said in 2013:
If the measures against climate change are not economically efficient, then they will not be sustainable because countries struggling to emerge like India and China will not follow along.”
Moreover the article presents harsh criticism from Richard Tol, writing:
Trillions of euros, zero effect
What has been done and planned thus far has been a debacle. […] Although the consequences of climate change cannot be denied, they have, however, been drastically overestimated. Tol accuses the climate scientists of acting ‘bitterly and politically’.”
Things are slowly changing. German language media are increasingly presenting other opinions to get the public to take another look at where the current, skewed energy policy is leading. That’s good news because a debate has long been sorely missing. As the costs skyrocket, the days of isolating divergent opinions may be ending.

"The   mogul Russell Simmons is teaming up with Universal Music Group to produce “The Scenario,” a musical set to three decades of  . The show, originally announced in 2015, is to premiere in New York during the   season before embarking on a   tour of “traditional and nontraditional venues,” according to the Universal Music Group. “I want everyone to see it,” Mr. Simmons said in a phone interview on Saturday. “I want kids in the ’hood in Detroit to see it. I want sophisticated theatergoers in New York to see it. And they’re going love it whether they’re 50 or 14. ” Mr. Simmons, 59, emphasized the intended   appeal of “The Scenario,” which he said would include songs from Universal’s catalog that cover rap’s ascension as a dominant   force. “The difference between Rakim and Kendrick Lamar is minimal,” Mr. Simmons said, referring to two   artists whose rises occurred nearly three decades apart. Tracks by Drake, Mr. Lamar, Kurtis Blow and the Sugarhill Gang are among those being strongly considered for the production, Mr. Simmons said. Universal owns Def Jam Recordings, which Mr. Simmons founded in 1984 with the producer Rick Rubin. The label, whose artists have included Beastie Boys, Public Enemy and Kanye West, is credited with helping to bring   to the mainstream. Named for a song by A Tribe Called Quest, “The Scenario” will follow a few artists as they “struggle and evolve,” according to Mr. Simmons, and he said the production would more closely resemble a concert than a Broadway musical. The audience will have a sizable role, playing on a    tactic often used in  . “There’s a lot of technology that we’ll be using to connect the audience and the stage in a way that Broadway hasn’t done,” Mr. Simmons said. “The Scenario” will pair Mr. Simmons with Universal’s Scott Landis, Def Pictures’ Jake Stein and the “Rock of Ages” producers Scott Prisand and Jamie Bendell. The author and   historian Dan Charnas (“The Big Payback”) is writing the show’s book. “The Scenario” follows the breakout success of “Hamilton,” the   musical that set a record for the most money ever made in a single week by a Broadway show. On Saturday, Mr. Simmons said that he loved that show and was thrilled about its success, but he bristled at the idea that its popularity has been surprising given the omnipresence of   in American life. “There’s a lack of insight on the part of the gatekeepers and the producers of content,” he said. “I can go anywhere and hear  . I think ‘Hamilton’ does help them buy in, but it’s overdue. It’s long overdue, and I’m excited that I’m part of it. ”"
"The world’s oil demand could climb at its fastest rate in the history of the market next year, and may reach pre-crisis levels within years, unless new green policies are adopted, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The global energy watchdog has forecast that the world’s daily oil demand may climb by 5.7m barrels next year, the fastest annual climb on record, to an average of 97m barrels of oil a day in 2021. The demand forecasts for next year fall short of levels recorded in 2019 because the record rebound will only partially offset the severe oil demand collapse triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, which is expected to erase an average of 8.1m barrels of oil a day from global demand during 2020. Video conferencing alone will not solve our energy and climate challenges. But global oil demand could return to pre-crisis levels as soon as 2022 if governments avoid a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak and restart the aviation industry, without putting in place new plans to accelerate clean energy investment. The IEA’s latest oil report, used by many major economies to help shape their energy policies, casts doubt over claims by some that the coronavirus has already triggered a terminal decline for oil demand. The IEA has warned that proactive government policies will still be needed to bring a peak to the world’s oil demand later this decade and help shift the world towards cleaner fuels. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said claims that the world had already reached peak oil were “overhyped”, and warned that it may fail to materialise unless governments accelerated clean energy investment as part of a green economic recovery plan. “I want to repeat, video conferencing alone will not solve our energy and climate challenges. We need [the] right government policies,” Birol said. “A change in lifestyle will not bring us a peak and a decline in oil demand.” Energy economists, including those at oil giant BP, believe the pandemic may hasten the peak and decline of oil consumption which was forecast for the second half of the 2020s. BP has revised down its view of long-term oil demand and market prices for the next three decades significantly following the outbreak, triggering a $17bn (£13bn) downgrade to the value of its business on Monday. The company said its average oil price forecast to 2050 has fallen from $75 to $55 a barrel because long-term oil demand would be lower than previously expected, meaning some of its exploration projects may prove uneconomic."

Guest post by Viv Forbes
There is a persistent green myth that coal-fired power generation causes city smogs. It does not.
City air pollution is nothing new. King Edward I complained about London pollution in 1306, as did Queen Elizabeth I in 1578, long before the first steam engine operated.
Let’s look at the causes of some famous smogs – London/Pittsburgh, Los Angeles/Santiago, the Dust Bowls and the Asian Smogs.
The London smogs were caused by open-air combustion of newspapers, wood and cheap high-sulphur unwashed coal in domestic fires, stoves and boilers; by coal-burning blacksmiths, brewers and ironworkers in smoky forges, furnaces and coke plants; and by many smoky steam locomotives; all with inefficient combustion and no pollution controls. The smog was slowly eliminated by clean air regulations and by changing to “clean coal by pipe” (town gas) and “clean coal by wire” (electricity).

The Los Angeles smogs were caused mainly by backyard incinerators, vehicle exhausts and natural air inversions. They were reduced by using cleaner fuels, better engines and compulsory pollution-control equipment. Santiago has undergone a similar clean-up.
The Dust Bowl conditions of the Great Plains in USA were caused by drought and wind erosion of newly cultivated soils. Gobi Desert storms produced the Yellow River and the Yellow Sea and contribute to the Asian Brown Cloud today.
Today’s Asian smogs have many sources – forest fires in Indonesia; open air cremations in India; dust from volcanic eruptions and desert storms; soot, ash and other pollutants from millions of domestic rubbish fires, mosquito fires, cooking fires and heaters using anything combustible – cow dung, wood, paper, cardboard, plastic or cheap unwashed coal; and soot and unburnt hydro-carbons from millions of vehicles, many with engines needing maintenance and no pollution controls. Beijing today combines the 1950’s problems of both London and Los Angeles.
The Asian smog is NOT caused by producing electricity in modern power stations with closed boilers, pollution controls and using high-quality washed coal such as exported by Australia to Asia. The “power station pollution” pictured so eagerly in ABC and Green propaganda is actually steam from the cooling towers.
The main products released by modern coal-fired power stations are water vapour and carbon dioxide – both are essential life supporters. Neither one is dangerous. Both make our climate more liveable, but the contribution of carbon dioxide to climate is tiny. And the carbon dioxide produced by burning coal has done more to encourage the growth of plants and the greening of planet Earth than Greenpeace will ever do.
“Clean coal by wire” into every home is the one thing that could solve much of the Asian air pollution.

Fraud and deceit are a slippery slope
Story submitted by Bruce Webster
An article in the New York Times chronicles the descent of a sociologist into wholesale fraud. It is worth reading the whole article, because I believe it offers insight into some of the pressures, temptations, and self-rationalizations that many scientists struggle with.
Here is one key passage that will likely not surprise anyone here at WUWT (all emphasis in quoted text is mine):
Each case of research fraud that’s uncovered triggers a similar response from scientists. First disbelief, then anger, then a tendency to dismiss the perpetrator as one rotten egg in an otherwise-honest enterprise. But the scientific misconduct that has come to light in recent years suggests at the very least that the number of bad actors in science isn’t as insignificant as many would like to believe. And considered from a more cynical point of view, figures like Hwang and Hauser are not outliers so much as one end on a continuum of dishonest behaviors that extend from the cherry-picking of data to fit a chosen hypothesis — which many researchers admit is commonplace — to outright fabrication.
“Cherry-picking of data” is, of course, not an unknown topic in these parts. But here’s an even more intriguing passage: 
Stapel did not deny that his deceit was driven by ambition. But it was more complicated than that, he told me. He insisted that he loved social psychology but had been frustrated by the messiness of experimental data, which rarely led to clear conclusions. His lifelong obsession with elegance and order, he said, led him to concoct sexy results that journals found attractive. “It was a quest for aesthetics, for beauty — instead of the truth,” he said. He described his behavior as an addiction that drove him to carry out acts of increasingly daring fraud, like a junkie seeking a bigger and better high.
And again:
What the public didn’t realize, he said, was that academic science, too, was becoming a business. “There are scarce resources, you need grants, you need money, there is competition,” he said. “Normal people go to the edge to get that money. Science is of course about discovery, about digging to discover the truth. But it is also communication, persuasion, marketing. I am a salesman. I am on the road. People are on the road with their talk. With the same talk. It’s like a circus.”
And finally how it all turned out:
…the universities unveiled their final report at a joint news conference: Stapel had committed fraud in at least 55 of his papers, as well as in 10 Ph.D. dissertations written by his students. The students were not culpable, even though their work was now tarnished. The field of psychology was indicted, too, with a finding that Stapel’s fraud went undetected for so long because of “a general culture of careless, selective and uncritical handling of research and data.” If Stapel was solely to blame for making stuff up, the report stated, his peers, journal editors and reviewers of the field’s top journals were to blame for letting him get away with it. The committees identified several practices as “sloppy science” — misuse of statistics, ignoring of data that do not conform to a desired hypothesis and the pursuit of a compelling story no matter how scientifically unsupported it may be.
A lesson for climate science. Be sure to read the whole thing.  ..bruce..

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
The press has been quick to jump on the idea that post-tropical cyclone Sandy (it was not a hurricane at landfall) was worsened by anthropogenic global warming and that “superstorms” are here to stay.   
  
But I must ask the impertinent question: could anthropogenic global warming actually have lessened the impacts of Sandy?   
  
There are basically three pro-global warming talking points involving Sandy: 1) global warming has caused sea levels to rise, thus making the storm surge larger, 2) global warming has led to higher sea surface temperatures and thus stronger hurricanes, and 3) global warming is making extratropical circulation features more conducive to intense and slower moving storm systems.   
  
There is precious little evidence to definitively support any of these points when applied to Sandy, and, in fact, there exists a body of evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion—that anthropogenic global warming may have actually acted to mitigate the intensity of Sandy. Perhaps what lies closest to our current best understanding is that anthropogenic global warming made little contribution one way or the other.   




Let’s start with sea level rise. Water levels at New York City’s Battery Park location have been measured and recorded since 1856. The full record shows an overall (relatively steady) rise of about 0.11 inches per year, for a total rise between 1856 and now of just a bit more than 17 inches. How much of this has to do with _anthropogenic_ global warming? Maybe a third, or about 6 inches. Of the rest, about half was caused by a subsidence of the land (geological processes related to the end of the last ice age, see Engelhart et al., 2009 for example), and the remainder to a warming up from the naturally occurring cold period which ended in the mid-19th century. So of the total 17.34 feet of water (above the station datum) recorded at The Battery tide gauge during the height of Sandy, about 0.5 feet of that could probably be linked to anthropogenic global warming. This is not nothing, but the overwhelming majority of the damage done by the storm surge would have happened anyway. For comparison, the influence of the full moon that night was about as large as the influence of anthropogenic global warming.   
  
As to anthropogenic global warming’s impact on the path, frequency, and intensity of hurricanes, there is a mixed bag of potential outcomes which may be detectable far in the future (towards the end of the century) if anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. The current science suggests that the frequency of hurricanes could decrease, the intensity may increase slightly, and the preferred path may be displaced out to sea (Wang et al., 2010). The net effect on the U.S. is anyone’s guess at this point (but 2 of the 3 argue for fewer hurricane impacts in the U.S.). But what virtually everyone does agree upon is that _any_ influence of anthropogenic global warming on hurricane characteristics is not detectable in today’s climate (see for example, Knutson et al., 2010). So that talking point is basically off the table.   
  
Which brings us to the third global-warming-made-Sandy-worse talking point—the influence of anthropogenic global warming on the extratropical circulation characteristics.   
  
This is where the rubber really meets the road when it comes to Sandy’s behavior. Without the northward, and ultimately westward pull from the upper atmospheric jet stream, Sandy would have progressed harmlessly eastward, away from the Northeast coast, and out to sea. But that is not what happened. Instead, a fairly deep trough (southward excursion) of the jet stream was coincidentally passing through the eastern U.S. just as hurricane Sandy was progressing up (but offshore) the U.S. Eastern Seaboard. This trough had the effect of attracting Sandy, and drawing it northwestward, pumping energy into it, and changing its character from a hurricane to an extra/post tropical storm system (also known as a Nor’easter in this part of the country). In October, this type of behavior is not particularly unusual. The preferred tropical cyclone track maps provided by the National Hurricane Center (Figure 1) indicate a general tendency for tropical cyclones in October to curve back into the northeastern U.S.—just like Sandy did.   






Figure 1. Prevailing tropical cyclone tracks for the month of October (source: National Hurricane Center, http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/)   
  
In fact, since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been about a dozen or so tropical cyclones that have made landfall in the U.S. north of Cape Hatteras which had a westerly component to their trajectory either immediately before or just after they came ashore. This includes historically damaging storms such as the 1903 New Jersey hurricane, the 1938 Long Island Express hurricane, and 1972’s Hurricane Agnes which is still the flood of record in many parts of the Northeast.   
  
The last one was tropical storm Danielle, over twenty years ago. This is the longest interval in the record (since 1900) between westward-component storms north of Hatteras. So much for the influence of global warming!   
  
So, given this fairly typical behavior—why would anyone even consider that anthropogenic global warming played a role in Sandy?   
  
For two reasons: 1) any bad weather these days is immediately linked to global warming by someone with an agenda, and 2) there was a paper published last spring (Francis and Vavrus, 2012) in which the authors concluded that the decline of Arctic sea ice (tied to anthropogenic global warming) was causing the Arctic to warm up faster than the lower latitudes, reducing the natural north-south temperature gradient which is where the jet stream (and extratropical storms) gain energy. According to Francis and Vavrus, a less energetic jet stream contracts and becomes more meandering, with relatively deeper troughs and higher ridges which produce slower moving storm systems and more extreme weather.   
  
Since Sandy was strengthened and pulled ashore by a deep trough/ridge system in the jet stream, folks are quick to assume that the Francis and Vavrus mechanism tying in anthropogenic global warming must be involved.   
  
Not so fast!   
  
This is like claiming to have made a new discovery that, when flipping a coin, heads are now more likely to occur than tails. And wouldn’t you know, the next time the coin is flipped, it came up heads—to which you proclaim, “See, I told you so.” And since heads are associated with a bad outcome, the press flock to your explanation. But what is completely overlooked, is that other researchers have examined every coin flip for the past 60 years and found that heads and tails occur with equal likelihood. So the current heads outcome is simply part of the natural 50-50 occurrence of heads or tails.   
  
In this case, the other researchers are a pair of atmospheric scientists from Cornell University which have examined the forward speed of all nor’easters along the East Coast from 1951 through 2006 (Bernhardt and DeGaetano, 2012). And what they found, in their own words, was “There was no clear trend in [nor’easter forward] speed during the time period, although considerable season-to-season variability was present.” In other words, while there is a lot of storm-to-storm and season-to-season variability, there is no overall trend towards slower moving nor’easters (Figure 2)—so much for the Francis and Vavrus hypothesis.   
  




Figure 2. Average speed of East Coast winter storms (nor’easters), from 1951-2006 (source: Bernhardt and DeGaetano, 2012).   
  
And, there has been a lot of other research on changes in the patterns and characteristics of the Northern Hemisphere jet stream during the period of anthropogenic global warming which did _not_ find that same thing that Francis and Vavrus found (we detailed many of these findings in our March 8, 2012 _Current Wisdom_). At least one of those papers suggested that the methodology employed by Francis and Vavrus “can generate false, or mask actual, variability patterns including trends” (Strong and Davis, 2007). Others concluded that global warming contracted, the jet stream, flattened it over the eastern U.S., and sped it up a bit—characteristics, which, along with a decreased temperature gradient, if applied to Sandy, would have combined to produce a _less_ intense post tropical storm system than if global warming had not been occurring.   
  
So rather than anthropogenic global warming making Sandy worse, it could have actually lessened its intensity and impacts.   
  
The truth is, is that it is impossible to know how, or even _if_ , global warming played any role at all in the lifecycle of Sandy. The science is all over the map, and the signal-to-noise ratio is so low that no matter what is occurring its impact in any direction is undetectable.   
  
But it is sexier and has much more press appeal to proclaim that the destruction wrought by “superstorm” Sandy is the product of our unrestrained fossil fuel consumption, rather than the equally plausible opposite—that anthropogenic climate changes may have combined to lessen Sandy’s intensity.

"Building serious infrastructure – such as energy supply, energy distribution, road and rail – is a big undertaking.  It takes a long time to build, but an even longer time to plan and to generate enough confidence in the project that companies will embark on the substantial investments necessary. For example, investments in large factories that can manufacture the equally large rotor blades for wind turbines, as has just been announced will take place in Hull. New port and manufacturing facilities in the city will be the centre for Siemens’ new turbine factories that will service the wind farms, current and planned, on Dogger Bank off Britain’s east coast. Hull and Siemens have spent years working on this plan to develop the capacity to make UK offshore wind farms happen. So it’s good news indeed to hear that the point of commitment has been reached. What is hard for many people to imagine, because they are not common these days, is the “large” aspect of these factories.  As a nation we have failed to keep up with the manufacture of the genuinely big stuff that is used across the planet, so this is nice to see. But this is is only a beginning.  Big as these factories will be, the offshore wind farm market has yet to happen at the scale hoped for. It is fundamentally expensive, so this new development is no nirvana. Offshore wind only accounts for 3-4% of total global wind energy. And these factories will be making only some of the components for these offshore wind turbines. What is interesting in the way this story has emerged is what it shows us about the UK’s backwards view of what manufacturing looks like these days. Too many still think in terms of a big shed with many people walking in and out every day, so when that happens (as in Hull) we celebrate it.  But when other, far more significant things happen that do not match this sepia-tinged view, we don’t even notice.  Manufacturing these days is totally global, and you earn your place in it by being a creative part of that global network.  Hooray for these factories in Hull.  But did you know that for years, Siemens has had a team of over 200 engineers in Manchester that is their global design, development and project management team for the company’s entire worldwide offshore wind energy division? They have designed and managed every Siemens offshore wind farm project, whether in German or British waters, or anywhere else. And I note, again, in the reports of these new factories in Hull, the standard negative comment on how the Vestas wind turbine blade factory on the Isle of Wight closed in 2009. There is much more to that story, and it’s worth knowing because it was a good story, not a bad one. What was well known when they built that factory on the Isle of Wight was that it was seriously size-constrained. As wind turbines got bigger, the size of the blades required outgrew the size of the factory. It also proved very expensive to manufacture the blades in that location, when it would inevitably involve considerable transport from the island to Southampton, from Southampton to wherever in the world they were destined, and then from that nearest port out to the wind farm site. Wind turbine blades are big things to move about and it costs a lot of money.   Many of them were in fact going to the American mid-west.  So, logically, Vestas built factories in Colorado which have been very successful.  Actually it was amazing that the Isle of Wight plant was able to manufacture for as long as it did in such a cost-ineffective location. So OK, the factory closed and that got lots of attention. But what really mattered got no attention at all. What Vestas recognised was British expertise: they invested £79m to create 220 jobs for engineers, and turned this team on the Isle of Wight into Vestas’ global blade technology development centre, which it has been ever since. Recently the centre received another seriously large investment to create an even bigger facility for specialised designing and testing of the ever-larger wind turbine blades powering the world’s wind farms. This British team, after 30 years in the game, is still producing the best blade technology there is, earning its keep and bringing in both income and investment to the UK for blade technology, which is then applied all over the planet. So of course the Siemens’ project in Hull is to be celebrated. But the quiet success of British engineering prowess that doesn’t reach the news headlines is a bigger success story.  What I wish is that the British media would get beyond looking for old-fashioned manufacturing sheds, good as they are, and wake up the the much more fundamental stories of success that are sitting invisibly in Manchester, the Isle of Wight and elsewhere – the world’s leading wind energy consultancy company is the highly respected Garrad Hassan based in Bristol, for example – earning their keep by doing their homework, maintaining their leading-edge know-how, and getting on a plane to wherever their know-how is needed. Isn’t that what we are supposed to do? That’s what success looks like."

The Highway Trust Fund is about to run out of money. The federal gasoline tax is set to expire in September. Too many federal transportation dollars have gone to ridiculously expensive projects that do little to support the movement of people and goods.



All of these facts point to one conclusion: It is time for Congress to get out of the transportation business and return highway and transit funding to state and local governments. At the very least, Congress should simply give federal transportation dollars to the states with no strings attached and let them decide how to spend them.





Return highway and transit funding to state and local governments.



In 1956, Congress approved the construction of the Interstate Highway System and funded it by dedicating federal gas taxes to those roads. This led to construction of one of the greatest and the most successful public works projects in history.



The Interstate Highway System was successful because it gave the states a simple mission: build interstate roads. Moreover, that mission was funded out of user fees on a pay‐​as‐​you‐​go basis, meaning that if no one drove on the roads there would be no gas taxes to pay for building them. Today, the interstates make up just 2.5 percent of the lane‐​miles of roads in this country, yet they provide 20 percent of all passenger travel and 15 percent of all freight movement.



The highway bill was written to sunset after six years, requiring Congress to periodically reauthorize it. In 1982, when the interstate highways were largely complete, instead of sunsetting the gas tax, Congress celebrated by raising the tax and dedicating a share of that increase to non‐​highway projects.



Today, gas taxes go to everything from bike paths to transit boondoggles to the writing of urban plans designed to reduce people’s mobility. Meanwhile, the costs of traffic congestion have nearly quintupled since 1982, when Congress began diverting gas taxes to other programs.



The simple mission of building an interstate highway system has been replaced by a complex and often contradictory set of missions: maintaining infrastructure, enhancing mobility, reducing air pollution, discouraging driving, supporting transit, building expensive rail lines, promoting economic development, stimulating the economy, stopping climate change, and ending urban sprawl, among others.



“Government will malperform if an activity is under pressure to satisfy different constituencies with different values and different demands,” wrote management guru Peter Drucker. “Performance requires concentration on one goal.”



In funding nonhighway projects with gas taxes, Congress departed from the pay‐​as‐​you‐​go user‐​fee system that worked so well for the interstates. Moreover, in its infinite wisdom, Congress mandated a minimum level of spending each year even if gas tax revenues didn’t come in. Since the 2008 financial crisis, Congress has had to top off the Highway Trust Fund with $55 billion in general funds to make up for its overspending.



Congress continues to overspend, which is why we’re set to go over what some call a “transportation cliff” in August. The Obama administration has proposed a massive increase in spending with no idea where the money will come from in the long run. Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT) and Bob Corker (R-TN) have proposed to raise gas taxes by 12 cents a gallon, but this will just give Congress more money to waste.



Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) proposes to extend the current law by three months to give members of Congress time to write a new bill. But they had six months six months ago and didn’t do anything about it then. Hardly anyone in Congress or the administration has seriously considered reducing spending to be no more than actual revenues.



Our transportation system is vast and complicated, and there’s no reason to think Congress can know where every dollar should be spent any more than it knows what clothes you should wear today or what you should have for dinner tonight. It is time for Congress to say what it should have said in 1982: The Interstate Highway System is finished, and new transportation projects, including bike paths, transit routes and bridge repairs, are of state or local interest and should be funded by state or local governments.

Greenpeace International is calling to make executives liable for funding “climate denialism“.
This would be tantamount to abusing the legal system as a weapon to harass and shut down freedom of science and the fundamental human right of freedom of expression.
Are bloggers next?
The next obvious step would be to go after bloggers for spreading “climate denialism“, as most of them, this blog included, are not funded at all and are running purely voluntarily. All the blogs I know operate independently of any funding activity taken by fossil fuel companies. Greenpeace writes:
Greenpeace International, WWF and the Center for International Environmental Law have written to the executives of large insurance corporations as well as fossil fuel and other carbon major companies [1], seeking clarity on who will pay the bill if such a lawsuit is brought against their directors or officers [2].
Generally, liability policies provide coverage for claims that put individual directors’ and officers’ assets at risk. These liability policies protect individuals who are conducting their business in good faith but are at risk of being held liable for undesirable business occurrences, which may be beyond their control.  However, a serious question is whether these policies would cover a director facing a climate-related claim [3].

The belief that corporate executives are guilty of brewing bad weather events is no different than ancient tribes psychopathologically blaming and sacrificing humans at an alter in a bid to appease angry gods.Today environmentally fanatic activists like those at Greenpeace are calling for the same thing. This gets down to raindancing and weather-brewing. Read on…
Leanne Minshull, Greenpeace International’s Climate and Energy Campaigner, says the cost of climate change is personal. ‘It’s personal to the victims of super typhoon Haiyan who lost family members and homes in the Philippines. It’s personal to farmers in California and Australia whose land is now too dry for farming. It should also be personal for any oil, gas and coal company directors who mislead the public by funding climate denialism and stopping action on climate change. The responsibility – not just the devastating effects – should be personal.'”
If anything, NGOs and Greenpeace need to be held personally accountable for blocking Golden Rice in Asia, a food that could have prevented millions of children from going blind and thousands of dying prematurely from vitamin deficiency.  That we know is absolutely very clear.
Carroll Muffett, President of the Center for International Environmental Law, says from ‘asbestos to tobacco to oil spills, history shows that those who mislead the public, the market or the government about the risks of their products, or the availability of safer alternatives, can face substantial legal liability, both as companies and as individuals. As the impacts of climate denialism and regulatory obstruction become clear, we want to understand how corporations, insurers, and officers and directors are allocating those risks among themselves.  Just as importantly, we ask what steps they’re taking to prevent the misconduct that creates those risks in the first place.'”
Samantha Smith, leader of WWF‘s Global Climate and Energy Initiative, says fossil fuel companies owe it to their shareholders and the public to tell us the truth about the devastating impacts of their activities on our shared climate. ‘Sooner or later, those who hide the facts and oppose policies to fight climate change will be held to account by the courts. By signing this letter, we hope to bring attention to the importance of truthful, transparent and responsible corporate reporting and policy engagement on climate change.”
The responses from the fossil fuel companies and insurers and will be published on the Greenpeace International website.”
The Greenpeace proposal is the latest authoritarian bully-tactic designed to intimidate those who have different scientific opinions, to stamp out scientific dissent, and to force a universal junk-science based green ideology on the rest of the population. Greenpeace is pioneering the newest path to thought totalitarianism.

An often overlooked aspect of the Jones Act is its environmental effects. By raising the cost of waterborne transportation, the law encourages the use of alternative forms of transport such as trucks and rail. These alternative means of moving goods generate more greenhouse gases and emit pollutants that are in many ways more harmful than those emitted by waterborne transport. Moreover, the Jones Act encourages the use of older, less‐​efficient vessels. Thus, the Jones Act contributes to an environment that is more despoiled than would otherwise be the case in the law’s absence.



This paper presents a detailed examination of the potential environmental gains that could be realized from reform or repeal of the law. It estimates that the environmental benefits accruing from the law’s repeal, through expanded use of waterborne transport as well as newer, more efficient vessels, would exceed $8 billion per year. Such gains are rarely estimated, if they are even considered.



To mitigate the adverse effects that transportation has on the environment, policymakers should acknowledge that the Jones Act encourages businesses to use less environmentally friendly forms of transport. Repeal of the Jones Act—or even a more limited set of reforms—would both promote economic growth and a cleaner environment.



Freight transport is an important service traded in largely competitive markets, but it gives rise to a variety of what economists call external costs. These costs are not borne by carriers or their customers, but by others who are not voluntary participants in the transaction. These costs are real: congestion, accidents, and noise all detract from total economic welfare. No carrier thinks about its marginal contribution to congestion, the increased chance of an accident, or the noise that one more truck creates as part of a consideration of whether or not to move another load of freight.



Environmental costs are an important class of external costs: air emissions, water contamination, and degradation of land resources are important examples of external environmental costs. The magnitude of these environmental spillovers is a function of the amount of freight transport and the choice of mode—truck, rail, air, or water—because they each have different environmental effects. Changing marine cabotage policy (“cabotage” refers to transportation between two places in the same country by a transport operator from another country) has the potential to change freight transport choices, with implications for transport markets and their external costs. This paper focuses on the net change in environmental costs from potential changes in marine cabotage policy.



Freight transportation is essential for the modern economy. We have grown accustomed to delivered consumer products, and industry has reengineered supply chains to minimize inventory costs and avoid costly delays. Transportation services account for a steady 3 percent of gross domestic product year after year, although waterborne transport—at less than 3 percent of total transportation value-added—is only a sliver of that.



As shown in Figure 1, most freight transportation moves by truck and rail, which account for more than two‐​thirds of the total ton‐​miles of freight movement. The third‐​largest mode is pipeline, which is particularly cost‐​effective for moving the petroleum and natural gas that the United States is producing in increasing quantities. Water transport includes ocean­going and inland waterway traffic (some of which is on the Great Lakes). Despite the physical advantages of buoyancy, which reduces the amount of energy required to move cargo a given distance, water transport accounts for only about 7 percent of the total freight movement trips.1 Moreover, about 40 percent of the U.S. population lives along the coasts or Great Lakes, which underscores how underutilized water transportation may be.



With its heavy reliance on trucks, the United States has a much different freight transport network than other countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co‐​operation and Development (OECD). There are a number of reasons for this. Rail is the dominant freight mode throughout the OECD. After decades of regulation, the U.S. railroad industry has stabilized with fewer, larger railroads and lower rates. Physical endowments matter as much as policy in the nature of transport networks. No matter the enticement, Switzerland is unlikely to have much coastal waterway traffic, but Japan is likely to have a lot. The United States is mostly a continental market with a handful of isolated outposts—including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico—that must rely heavily on marine transport. Short‐​term fluctuations in economic activity and fuel prices can affect demand for alternative transport modes, but long‐​term factors have an important influence. There is substantial path dependence in transport modes because of physical factors and long‐​term infrastructure investments.



Despite its ample water resources, U.S. water transport is restricted by the requirements of Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly known as the Jones Act. The Jones Act requires that domestic waterborne transport of freight be conducted on vessels that are U.S.-built, owned, registered, and crewed. Colin Grabow, Inu Manak, Daniel Ikenson,2 and Rob Quartel,3 among many others, have documented the distortions created by this provision. The century since the Jones Act’s passage has witnessed a dramatic decline in maritime transport. In an apparent effort to promote U.S. shipbuilding and U.S. shipping, the law has unwittingly incentivized alternative modes of transport, which generate environmental externalities that could be reduced under a different policy environment. The relatively few beneficiaries from the Jones Act receive gains at the expense of millions of consumers who absorb higher shipping costs, while the act imposes a great expense to the local and global environment upon which billions of humans depend.



Environmental costs from freight transport are substantial. Plausible changes to the current set of rules governing freight transport could reduce costs from emission in excess of $8 billion per year. While that translates into a welfare gain of about 1 percent of GDP from transportation, it represents more than 50 percent of the total value‐​added by water transportation. Accounting for avoided envi­ronmental costs provides strong additional motivation for Jones Act reform, with the upper bound increasing estimated welfare gains by 2 to 10 times.



The transportation industry is among the top producers of environmental externalities, which are particularly high relative to the industry’s contributions to GDP. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 14 percent of 2010 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were generated by the global transportation sector, with nearly all (95 percent) of the emissions stemming from the use of petroleum as fuel. However, the contribution of transportation to total environmental costs varies substantially across different types of emissions and therefore, via different paths, affects human well‐​being. In 2016, transportation accounted for 28 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. All modes of transport accounted for 58 percent of carbon monoxide emissions in the United States in 2014. Transportation sources from all modes accounted for 60 percent of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 25 percent of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions. Each of these types of emissions has different physical effects, including dispersion and longevity that affect the economic value of changes in emission levels.4



While the transport sector is responsible for sizeable proportions of total emissions, it has substantially reduced emissions across a range of criteria air pollutants since federal air regulations were implemented in the early 1970s, as shown in Figure 2. The transport sector has been far more successful than the nontransport (mostly fixed) sector in reducing emissions of criteria air pollutants, as well as other types of emissions. Removing lead from gasoline helped to dramatically reduce airborne lead levels, for example, with an attendant decrease in lead levels measured in human blood.5



Figure 2 also shows how the criteria air pollutants emissions profile of transportation differs from other sources: carbon monoxide (CO) dominates transportation emissions, although NOx and VOCs also make large contributions. Relative to nontransport sources, emissions of particulate matter (PM), sulfur oxides (SOx), and ammonia (NH3) are all both relatively and absolutely small. These differences between transport and other sources have not changed over time. While emissions intensity of transportation has fallen over recent decades, the compositional differences remain. This is important because integrated assessment modeling shows that the damages from emissions are highest for pollutants that are not prevalent from transport sources.6



Furthermore, Nicholas Z. Muller, Robert Mendelsohn, and William Nordhaus show that water transportation has very localized damages.7 Whereas highway and railroad emissions affect every county in the country, the damages from marine emissions are concentrated in coastal areas. And when criteria air pollutant emissions are released far from human populations, as is the case with marine transport to Alaska and Hawaii (which accounts for a significant amount of U.S. marine transport), the environmental costs are not as large. While that does not necessarily eliminate damages generated through other channels, the economic costs of local air pollutants depend on the location of emission. Greenhouse gases, in contrast, are global stock pollutants, which means their economic costs do not depend on the location of their emission.



While transportation has been relatively successful in reducing criteria air pollutant emissions, GHG emissions are a different story. Greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transportation sector increased by 20 percent between 1990 and 2016. Over that time, transport’s share of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions increased from just under 24 percent to just over 27 percent. The good news is that relative to the overall transportation sector, maritime transport is relatively clean. Reallocating freight across modes has the potential to reduce GHG emissions.



Achieving such a shift would require some policy changes or other changes to encourage use of water transport, which has become less popular in the United States. In 1990, water transport of all types accounted for 6.7 percent of all transportation energy use in the United States. By 2016, water transport only accounted for 4 percent, even as transport energy use increased by 26 percent.8



Different transport modes generate different sets of environmental costs. Some ocean‐​going ships have traditionally burned residual fuel oil that is relatively high in sulfur, leading to much higher SOx emissions from that portion of the transport network, but a new low‐​sulfur standard mandated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) limiting such emissions to 0.5 percent by weight (from a previous limit of 3.5 percent) took effect on January 1, 2020. Trucks are less energy efficient than ships, so they use more energy per ton‐​mile and generate more emissions, but U.S. trucks mostly burn low‐​sulfur diesel, so they have lower SOx emissions, all else being equal. As both ships and trucks move toward using natural gas as a fuel, the differences in their emissions profiles may disappear in the future. The coastal waters of the continental United States, Hawaii, and parts of Alaska are part of the Emissions Control Area, a designation that requires the use of low‐​sulfur marine fuels—with a standard even lower than the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 low‐​sulfur standard. As a result, expanding coastwise short‐​sea shipping within the Emissions Control Area will likely have less effect on SOx emissions than would a similar expansion using the global commercial fleet.



Table 1 compares the emissions profiles for different modes of freight transport, which reveals the importance of scale to waterborne freight emissions. The table includes a comparison of two different vessels, one large and one small, as measured by capacity. Shipping volume typically is measured in “twenty‐​foot equivalent units” (TEUs), which is the size of a standard shipping container with a maximum net cargo of 23.8 tons. The table highlights three basic findings. First, by requiring less energy to move a given amount of freight, ships can have much lower emissions than alternative transport modes. Second, this advantage depends heavily on the scale of waterborne transport—larger ships are cleaner than other modes, but the advantage declines for smaller ships. Third, waterborne freight has higher criteria air pollutant emissions.



Since the golden spike was driven to mark the completion of the first transcontinental railroad 150 years ago, much of the country has had a choice between transport modes. When the relative ease of a Pullman car beckoned, traveling from New York to San Francisco no longer meant a long and dangerous trip around Cape Horn or across Central America, both of which were journeys mostly by ship. Technological improve­ments have helped all transport modes, but the increased number of options—as well as costly mandates imposed by the Jones Act—bodes ill for the waterborne share of freight. Today, marine transport is primarily used where there are no substitutes, and the U.S. domestic oceangoing fleet has shrunk to a mere 99 ships. Using data from the Commodity Flow Survey, two‐​thirds of U.S. bluewater freight transport trips (excluding inland water­way and the Great Lakes) either originate or terminate in the noncontiguous states of Alaska and Hawaii, yet these trips carry only about 2 percent of the ton‐​mileage of U.S. water freight transport. Waterborne freight is concentrated in a handful of low‐​value, mostly time‐​insensitive, commodities. Nearly three‐​quarters of the waterborne ton‐​mileage of marine transport is in four classes of commodities: metallic ores, refined petroleum products, coal, and agricultural products.



By restricting the choice for domestic water­borne transport to qualified carriers, the Jones Act has raised costs for marine transport. Measuring these costs is a challenging empirical task. The first channel for impact is that the qualifications might directly raise production costs, either by requiring more expensive factors such as labor, or by specifying more costly performance standards, such as safety equipment. These changes must be measured relative to a historical transportation cost basis, so continuing technological improvement could lead to lower real costs and also to contemporaneous alternatives not subject to the same qualifications. Nonexclusive to the first, a second possibility is that substitute transport modes experience falling costs because of technological change or other policy measures. Third, the market structure in the domestic market may afford occupant firms short‐​term pricing power. Unless there are barriers to entry, in the long run firms cannot maintain market power. But the Jones Act does restrict entry to domestic firms and may act as an effective barrier to entry into the market. A fourth explanation is that short‐​term factors might reduce the long‐​term incentive for complementary investments, such as in ports, which then raise costs in the long run. The extent to which these factors amount to substantial and significant cost differences is an empirical question.



Surveys provide estimates of higher operating expenses for Jones Act–eligible vessels than for foreign‐​flagged vessels. The magnitude of the cost differential is contentious, but a variety of sources corroborate the intuition that the Jones Act contributes to higher costs for domestic shipping services. The U.S. Maritime Administration reported in 2011 an average operating cost for U.S.-flagged vessels that was 2.7 times higher than the foreign‐​flagged equivalent, mostly because of higher crew costs,9 while the Government Accountability Office noted in a 2018 report that “the relative cost of operating a U.S.-flag vessel compared to a foreign‐​flag vessel has increased in recent years.”10 Older estimates suggest that the cost differences have grown over time. The U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) reported higher U.S. operating costs: from 110 percent for Aframax tankers11 to 15 percent for 2,000-TEU containerships, which is consistent with earlier reports that found operating cost differentials of 52 percent for Aframax tankers and 13 percent for a 2,000-TEU containership, according to the USITC.12 The OECD data provide a consistent picture: in 2018, the OECD Service Trade Restrictiveness Index rated the United States as 60 percent more restrictive than the average OECD country, which was about the same as the difference in 2014. Most of the barrier is attributable to Jones Act restric­tions on foreign entry.13



Existing information about cost differentials has been used to parameterize the USITC computable general equilibrium model that provides economic welfare estimates. In 2002, the USITC estimated that full liberalization of the Jones Act would increase U.S. economic welfare by $656 million (1999 U.S. dollars, equivalent to $1 billion in 2019).14 Removing only the domestic shipbuilding require­ment but keeping all other provisions of the Jones Act would deliver an increase of $261 million (1999 dollars, equivalent to $407 million in 2019) in economic welfare. Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Kimberly Ann Elliott found a similar topline figure using a different methodology, estimating that a full liberalization would increase U.S. economic welfare by $556 million (1990 dollars, equivalent to $1.1 billion in 2019).15 This gain is decom­posed into a $1.83 billion (1990 dollars, equivalent to $3.59 billion in 2019) gain for consumers of marine services and a $1.28 billion (1990 dollars, equivalent to $2.51 billion in 2019) loss for producers. Joseph Francois, Hugh M. Arce, Kenneth A. Reinart, and Joseph E. Flynn arrive at a higher estimate of $3 billion (1989 dollars, equivalent to $6.21 billion in 2019) in economic welfare cost, but add to the consensus that the Jones Act protects a relatively small number of jobs and firms at a broadly dispersed cost.16 None of these studies have attempted to enumerate the external costs, and so they potentially represent an underestimate of the burden of this law by measuring only direct cost differences.



The net effect of making waterborne transport relatively more expensive is that less freight moves by ship and boat than one might otherwise expect. In 2016, 4.2 percent of U.S. domestic freight tonnage was moved by water, compared to 65.7 percent by truck.17 Waterborne freight transport focused on low‐​value products, moving only 1.8 percent of total freight value. In 2015, 3.4 percent of domestic freight tonnage was moved by water, compared to 66.1 percent by truck.



Environmental costs are an important class of external costs associated with transport choices. Table 2 shows that in 2016, ships and other vessels accounted for only 0.9 percent of all freight GHG emissions, compared to more than 80 percent for trucks. The relative intensity of moving freight by different modes is shown in the final column of Table 2. Here water transport has a clear advantage: it is one‐​third lower than pipeline, 70 percent lower than rail, more than 80 percent lower than truck, and hundreds of times lower than air.18 So while water transport is not particularly competitive when environmental costs are excluded, taking GHG emissions into account makes water transport relatively more competitive among modes. How large this effect is relative to existing cost differences that drive current freight patterns, and how incorporating other types of environmental externalities affects the net balance, are all relevant to determining the environmental costs of the Jones Act.



Optimal transportation requires different considerations. Minimizing cost is one, but so too is timeliness, particularly in a world of just‐​in‐​time supply chain management. Envi­ronmental costs are another dimension to be considered. Given its importance to the modern economy, it is not surprising that transport choices have attracted considerable study, and the tradeoffs between modes are complex. Consider a hypothetical trip from Boston to Miami. Using the Geospatial Intermodal Freight Transport model (GIFT), the shortest‐​distance trip is one that relies heavily on ship, shaving about 150 miles (10 percent) off the shortest land route.19 That itinerary does not minimize the time spent traveling. While the ship delivers the cargo in a total travel time of 72 hours, the shortest‐​duration trip is about 24 hours with delivery by truck. Neither of these routes considers potential slowdowns, some of which might be predictable, such as traffic congestion or hours of service regulations for truckers, and some of which might not be predictable, such as weather.



Shipping rates take these differences into account. While ships may have lower unit costs than trucks, to the extent that they are slower, part of the cost savings is consumed by slower travel time. Bryan Comer et al. report delivery times at least four times longer by ship as compared to truck.20 Conversely, a shipper might find it worthwhile to pay a premium for a truck to ensure direct delivery of a time‐​sensitive load. Shipping rates vary with the timeliness of delivery, and sometimes shippers are willing to pay more for speed; each day of transit time is equivalent to an ad valorem tariff between 0.6 and 2.1 percent.21 So a trip from Boston to Miami that takes three days instead of two might be expected to cost some 1.2 to 4.2 percent less. Naturally there are some products for which time is more valuable—fresh produce might be one example—and others that are less time‐​sensitive. The value of time is borne out in the lower costs of inventory that firms must hold with just‐​in‐​time delivery. Slower supply chains can be just‐​in‐​time as well, making the variance of delivery time more relevant to inventory costs. The fact that low‐​value products dominate water transport indicates that the time costs may be higher.



Returning to the GIFT model for travel between Boston and Miami, and considering the external costs of transport mode choices, can lead to still more variation. For example, to minimize carbon dioxide emissions on a per‐​TEU basis, ship transport is far preferred, in part because less than one‐​third of the energy inputs are needed to move the cargo by sea as opposed to land. But marine transport is not always the optimal transport mode. Other environmental criteria, including coarse particulate matter, SOx emissions, and NOx emissions, are minimized by truck transport. The net environmental cost savings depend on the value of these marginal changes in the composition of emissions between transportation modes.



The socially optimal transport choice is one that minimizes the total costs, including the monetary cost, the value of time, and external costs. A key question is whether reducing the amount of marine transportation decreases or increases the net environmental costs. Because marine transportation creates external environmental costs, it is true that reducing the amount of waterborne transport helps reduce those particular external costs. However, because freight that might otherwise be moved by boat or ship tends instead to be moved by some other means, the relative environmental cost for waterborne transport depends on the relative environmental costs across all transportation modes.



Mark Delucchi and Don McCubbin helpfully summarize a number of studies examining different types of external costs for both passenger and freight traffic. Compared to other transport modes, water transport lacks a comprehensive suite of studies, but where research has been conducted it has generally concluded that water transport has lower external costs than other transport modes.22 Table 3 summarizes those results, showing a range of economic damage estimates in cents per ton‐​mile that reflect differences across modes, in research methodologies, and different levels of scientific uncertainty about the magnitude of the external costs. For the external costs attributable to health effects from criteria air pollutants, the range of estimates is substantial but largely consistent across modes. Rail emerges as the lowest external cost mode in this regard, followed by water, air, and road. Consistent with Table 1 and Table 2, climate costs are lowest for water transport, thanks to lower fuel requirements due to buoyancy. Rail is second, followed by low‐​end road estimates. The range for road costs extends well behind the higher climate costs from air transport.



Rainer Friedrich and Emile Quinet provide a direct comparison between external cost estimates for water freight transport in the United States and Europe as part of a broader comparison between the transport systems.23 The rank ordering across all modes is roughly the same between the United States and Europe. After converting units at current exchange rates, the comparison for water freight external costs attributable to air pollution indicates that the cost of those emissions is higher in the United States than in Europe (0.23–9.2 versus 0.11–1.4 dollars per ton‐​mile). The authors are careful to point out that the U.S. estimates include health effects but the European estimates do not, and that the European estimates reflect a much narrower range of scientific uncer­tainty thanks to a greater number of studies. A similar result holds for GHG emissions, with the U.S. estimates ranging higher than their European counterparts (0.0–0.67 versus 0.0–0.13 dollars per ton‐​mile). Together these results provide some weak evidence that the emissions profile of the U.S. water freight system generates slightly higher costs than the water freight system in Europe. Convergence between emissions costs from these two transport systems is possible: modernizing the U.S. fleet via repeal of the Jones Act or even its domestic‐​build requirement would be one step in that direction.



Expanding from just GHGs to criteria air pollutants, the environmental costs of freight transport become more nuanced. While water transport has lower external climate costs, it has higher criteria air pollutant emissions than other transport modes, notably rail. Taking these two types of emissions together, it is clear that water transport has lower external costs than air or truck. Rail and water have overlapping ranges of estimates, with rail being slightly lower. Comparing the United States to European countries reveals higher GHG emission costs in the United States. This is offset by slightly higher external costs from criteria air pollutant emissions, although the underlying methodologies are not comparable.



The Bureau of Transportation Statistics reports average revenues per ton‐​mile across transportation modes, which are also included in Table 2.24 Under competitive conditions, these average revenues should be a good proxy for average costs. Consistently over time, water transport revenue has been between one‐​eighth or one‐​ninth of the revenue from trucks. In contrast, the cost difference between water and rail is much smaller, with barge rates as close as three‐​quarters of rail rates. The results are intuitive: planes cost more than trucks, which cost more than trains, which cost more than ships.



Internalizing external costs potentially changes the ordering of modes by costs. The high end of the range of external costs reported in Table 3 suggests that the environmental costs of water transport are potentially as high as the private costs. Truck transport is the only other mode that has as large a level of external costs. David Austin conducted a comprehensive study of external costs for truck and rail and found a lower ratio of external costs to market rates for trucks than is indicated by the figures shown in Table 2.25 External costs have the least effect on air transport, in part because the market rates are already so high.



Forcing providers to pay external costs therefore has the largest relative effect on water transport and the smallest relative effect on air transport. However, when accounting for external costs, water transport has the lowest overall costs of any transport mode.



An important policy question is the degree to which today’s usage of different transport modes is attributable to the Jones Act and how much reflects intramodal competition. Estimating the environmental costs of the Jones Act requires three steps. The first is a comparison of the current situation and a counterfactual with a different cabotage regime. This paper uses existing estimates of the policy change. Second, a large literature evaluates the environmental costs of transportation outcomes across a range of measurable outcomes. Third, these two existing estimates are combined to project the effect of a policy change on environmental costs.



To calculate the environmental costs of the Jones Act, consider three counterfactuals. The first case imagines that the U.S. domestic fleet is upgraded to an international standard of emissions intensity, without any change in the volume of freight carried. The scenario reflects the relatively antiquated nature of the U.S. fleet, as compared to similar international fleets. In 2017, nearly one‐​third of all U.S.-flagged vessels were more than 25 years old—excluding the towboats and barges, the proportion was more than 53 percent.26 Because modern vessels are likely to have lower external environmental costs as a function of technological progress, the Jones Act fleet’s modernization alone might offer scope for improvement.



The second case considers the effect of increasing maritime freight transport by 10 percent, displacing truck and rail transport in equal proportions. This counterfactual reallocates freight from truck and rail to maritime shipping. Hufbauer and Elliott provide some of the only quantitative estimates of reducing maritime cabotage barriers: they estimate a 22 percent price reduction as a result of complete repeal and an underlying supply elasticity of one.27 The posited extensive effect is therefore something less than previous estimates of the effect of a full repeal of the act. These scenarios provide short‐​run estimates of cost savings, even though the physical transitions might take some time. The third case includes both the intensive and extensive effects. The scope of a liberalization, let alone its effects, are uncertain.



Table 4 summarizes the effect on environmental costs from freight transport under these three alternative counterfactuals. In the first case, upgrading the Jones Act fleet to lower‐​emissions vessels comparable to those found in Europe—purchases of which would become far cheaper after removal of the Jones Act’s domestic‐​build requirement—would avoid environmental costs mostly attributable to criteria air pollutant emissions. In part because of uncertainty about the magnitude of the environmental cost from these emissions, these avoided costs range from $118 million to $3.96 billion.



The second case offers a chance for more freight to move by ship by displacing truck and rail traffic. Such a displacement would be incentivized by waterborne freight transport cost reductions realized through Jones Act reform or repeal. The relative cleanliness of water transport compared to truck and rail comes into play at this point. This is reflected in the larger share of avoided costs of GHG emissions from switching freight to a more energy‐​efficient transport mode. In this case, the higher profile of water transport for criteria air pollutant emissions suggests that there could be a slight increase in environmental costs, mostly as relatively cleaner train traffic is replaced by the potentially most environmentally costly part of the U.S. fleet. However, the net avoided costs range higher than in the first case as more freight is reallocated to ships. This extensive change in water freight transport represents a real gain for the marine shipping sector.



The third case combines the first two cases, with waterborne transport becoming both more widespread and more environmentally friendly as older vessels are replaced with newer ones. The range of potential avoided costs in this scenario is from $109 million to $8.2 billion. To put the $8.2 billion figure into context, it is more than 50 percent of recent value‐​added from water transportation, or about 1 percent of the total transportation contribution to GDP. Given previous estimates of economic welfare gains from Jones Act reform that top out at $3 billion, the large estimated environmental benefits greatly strengthen the case for revisiting this law.



Changing the composition of the U.S. marine freight fleet to move more cargo raises a variety of other concerns that might be considered. Jones Act reform could deliver benefits indirectly by changing emissions profiles. A variety of other policies designed to provide an incentive to internalize external costs have been employed and discussed, and those policies could have a first‐​order effect on freight transport. The United States has relied on different mechanisms to control criteria air pollutant emissions, including technical standards that help explain the marked improvement in emissions intensity as shown in Figure 1. Because freight transport in general, and water transport in particular, are small relative to total environmental costs from transport, the sector was not focused on in the past. The exception to this is the Emission Control Area, which limits the sulfur content of marine fuels.



The current Jones Act–eligible fleet is disproportionately skewed toward tankers: 57 of 99 oceangoing vessels are tankers and they represent 80 percent of deadweight tonnage. One reason is the reliance on tankers to deliver oil from Alaska. In the short run, without a change in the fleet, the only way to increase the volume of freight transported by the Jones Act fleet is to use the existing stock of tankers. That means moving crude oil and refined products, which brings with it an increased risk of oil spills. While the Jones Act fleet is entirely comprised of double‐​hulled tankers, which have a lower risk of catastrophic spills, there is still a risk and an economic value attached to moving more oil and refined products in tankers.28 In the event of a major spill in U.S. coastal waters, Jones Act waivers are needed to allow international fleets to help respond and remediate.



Oil and refined products’ disproportionate share of waterborne freight is a cautionary indication of the Jones Act’s effect. Because recent expansions in oil production have not been in Alaska where marine transport is required, the tradeoff has focused on pipelines versus rail.29 Increasing utilization of the current fleet requires that increased bluewater freight be liquids. Bulk carriers are very limited, and other types of potentially useful ships, such as LNG [liquefied natural gas] tankers, do not exist under current build requirements.



Another important question is who stands to gain or lose from the environmental cost standpoint if the Jones Act were revised. In the event that a reform of the act resulted in a net shift of freight transport to marine and inland waterways, then local external costs might be felt by different groups of people. Broadly speaking, people near ports would likely be exposed to greater external costs, while those near highways or railroads would experience somewhat lower costs. To the extent that external costs are global rather than local, only the net change matters because local incidence is not an issue.



There are other external costs that might be alleviated by reform of the Jones Act. These include highway congestion, train derailments, and motor vehicle accidents. Further analysis of these external costs could further strengthen the case for Jones Act reform. There are also other potential environmental costs that could be accounted for, both directly and indirectly. Other direct costs are likely to be dominated by the public good nature of the air emissions.



There could also be further indirect effects embedded in supply chains. By limiting domestic shipment of time‐​insensitive bulk commodities such as scrap steel, the Jones Act unwittingly and unintentionally increases global emissions by diverting industry to foreign soil. The U.S. steel industry is among the cleanest in the world. When electric arc producers are unable to economically ship the scrap feedstock to their mills, foreign producers are only too happy to commission foreign‐​flagged vessels to export steel scrap to fuel their industry. The leading class of U.S. steel exports is scrap. Some steel smelted from U.S. scrap is reimported, further under­cutting the American steel industry. Local and global envi­ronments lose out on the trade. If affordable short‐​sea shipping could move scrap steel to steel minimills or even legacy producers, there would be a double dividend for marine carriers and the domestic steel industry.



Because GHG emissions are such an impor­tant factor in determining the environmental costs of waterborne shipping, the carbon price is a key consideration. The cost of carbon applies to all modes of transport, with water transport the least costly mode. Increasing the marginal cost of carbon emissions, either by assessing higher damages or limiting emissions, will increase the calculated environmental costs of the Jones Act. Reducing the social cost of carbon, as some in the United States have recently argued, will decrease the magnitude of environmental costs.



Changing the Jones Act offers the prospect of substantially reducing environmental costs created by freight transport. Using more marine transport would reduce the emissions from freight transport, especially for greenhouse gases. Criteria air pollutant emissions from water transport are slightly higher than for rail, but lower than for trucks. Both intensive and extensive changes to the prevailing regime could yield external environmental cost reductions of as much as $8 billion per year. These gains provide strong additional motivation for Jones Act reform. While previous studies have provided a range of economic welfare gains from easing the law’s restrictions, the environmental gains offer a substantial boost. Using the most conservative estimates of the gains from reform, the environmental benefits increase the net gains by 50 percent. Much larger gains are possible, increasing the benefits of reform by double or more.



Accounting for the external costs of transport services results in lower consumption. Various mechanisms exist to encourage decision­makers to internalize the costs, including taxing the activity in proportion to the marginal external costs. The change in the overall consumption of transport services is a function of the size of external costs and the elasticities of supply and demand for transport services. Allowing for multiple transport modes with different marginal external costs reallocates market share toward the mode with relatively lower marginal external costs. While the total amount of external cost will decrease, the amount attributable to the lower marginal cost mode will increase.



Accounting for the external costs of the Jones Act requires a second consideration: the Jones Act’s effect in the transport market. The top panel of Figure A1 represents the Jones Act as a supply shifter for the waterborne transport sector. Because waterborne transport is small relative to the total transport industry, and the Jones Act does not affect the supply of other modes of transport, the overall shift is smaller. Holding demand constant, the net effect is a reduction in overall transport from Q to Q′, and a corresponding private cost increase. The magnitude of these shifts depends on the price elasticity of demand and the aggre­gate supply elasticity. Under this specification the market share of waterborne transport decreases from QW/Q to Q′W/Q′. This is a short‐​run change. In the long run, the elasticity of supply in the waterborne sector is likely to decrease because of barriers to entry and lower capital investment attributable to smaller quasi‐​rents.



The lower panel of Figure A1 shows the effect of the policy regime on external costs, without explicitly forcing carriers to internalize external costs. The shift from restricted supply S′W to unrestricted SW has three theoretical effects that ultimately lead to empirical questions. First, the increase in the amount of waterborne transport increases the total external costs from waterborne transport by area A. This increase in market share comes at the expense of nonwaterborne transport that has higher marginal external costs. The second theoretical effect is a decrease in external costs from nonwaterborne transport of A + B. The reduction of external costs from nonwaterborne transport (A + B) is partially offset by the increased external costs from waterborne transport A, implying a net reduction of external costs equal to area B. The third effect is an overall increase in transport, which increases external costs by area C. Combining these three effects, the net change in external costs from the policy change shifting SW is a reduction of area B — C.



The empirical magnitude of this change depends on a handful of parameters. The first shift depends on the marginal external costs of waterborne transport and the increase in traffic from the policy change, which depends on the size of the supply shift and the elasticity of supply for the sector. The displacement of higher‐​cost modes of transport depends on the difference in marginal external costs between waterborne and other transport. The third effect, the extensive increase in transport, depends on the elasticities of supply and demand for transport. In summary, supply elasticities for waterborne and total transport, a demand elasticity for transport, and the expected cost decrease of the policy change are the key parameters that are needed.



One final note deserves mention. The lower panel of Figure A1 represents the marginal external costs as constant over the relevant ranges. That need not be the case. It is possible, if not plausible, that marginal external costs could change in a way that alters the net gains of B from displacing other modes with waterborne transport. If





(holding the relationship at Q′W constant), the policy change could increase marginal external costs by area





As an empirical matter, the marginal external costs are unlikely to change much over the relevant ranges from this policy change.

Some years ago, I watched a series called “ [Mataku](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?&keywords=mataku) “. The episodes enthralled and entertained me. They frightened me and I learnt NOT to watch them at night.



Much like Gremlins… never ever feed them at night. Yet I could not stop watching this magnificent series of Maori television whereby I was entertained and also learnt about Maori Culture at the same time.



One thing I learnt from watching Mataku was that if I was a “ foreigner “, I would think that that I was watching a horror movie. But, to me, as a Kiwi, I just accepted that this was part of who I was and where I was and what I was.



So many episodes reminded me of how deeply our cultural past is part of our present and our future. They tapped into our sense of self as a Nation: Maori and Pakeha.



Our deep-rooted and kindred spirit of SELF: We, as Kiwis, draw spiritual and WHOLEsomeself from the Land we call HOME.



We embrace others to join us on our voyage through life and do it in the Kiwi way.



Maori spirituality has always been expected and respected in our land. The Taniwha, the concepts of the fight between the North Island and the South Island; the hook, the fish, the legends… WE, as a Nation grew up on these wonderful and long-held TRADITIONS.



Why are we now changing our country and turning it into a foreign place? A place of global idealism and imported doctrines?



New Zealand is a young country in the scheme of things. A baby who was born a few seconds ago in terms of the planet time clock.



Our fledgeling country is still in nappies in the GLOBAL sense, so why are we being thrust forward on to the global stage as a world leader in the United Nations? When, in actual fact, we are a toddler and still finding our feet – historically.



My daughter is currently in Prague, attending a conference. A city that oozes history, culture and more culture (in the current definition of culture), than we can ever dream of – or, more importantly, catch up on.



We, as a Nation, will never and can never catch up on Europe or other Nations for historic culture.



Neither should we.



We are a small Nation, a new Nation and a proud Nation.



We can only compete in a NEW World.



Is this what Jacinda Ardern is trying to do? Propel New Zealand onto the world stage with speeches about climate change, diversity, love and kindness?



Well, I feel that New Zealand was not a Nation founded on love, climate change, kindness and sympathy.



We were founded on hard work, mud, respect, rain, cold.. reality.



Yes, Reality.



And part of our Reality was Mataku – Fear.



Fear of failure. Fear of death. Fear.



Right now, I FEAR.



For our Aotearoa, our New Zealand.



There is nothing worse than the death of a loved one.



In this case, it is the death of our Nation.



Mataku.

Now that forest fires are in the news, someone noticed that President Obama has proposed a new way of funding wild firefighting. Instead of borrowing from its fuels treatment funds when the Forest Service exhausts its regular fire-fighting budget, Obama wants to let the agency draw upon a new ""special disaster account"" that is ""adjusted each year to reflect the 10-year average cost of responding to such events.""   
  
Treating excessive firefighting costs by giving the Forest Service more money makes as much sense as attempting to suppress forest fires by throwing gasoline on them. In case you don't hear the sarcasm, it makes no sense at all.   
  
Obama is focusing on the wrong problem, the drawdown of funds intended for fuel treatments. The real problem is the incentives the Forest Service has to spend wildly on firefighting.   
  
As far as I know, no democracy has given any government agency a blank check to accomplish any goal--except the Forest Service for fighting fires. Even the Pentagon was given budgets for fighting World War II, the Cold War, and other wars. But in 1908, Congress gave the Forest Service a blank check for firefighting, saying the agency could spend as much as it needed to suppress fires, and Congress would reimburse it later.



Congress repealed the blank-check law in about 1978, leading to eight years of relatively modest spending on firefighting. But after two serious fire seasons in 1987 and 1988, Congress reimbursed the agency's firefighting debts, and since then it has muddled about, not knowing what to do. Obama's new proposal puts the agency firmly back in the blank-check mode.   
  
The president has underscored his support for excessive spending by allowing the Forest Service to buy four new air tankers, including a DC-10. The agency already had access to a DC-10, but rarely used it because it wasn't cost-effective. Now it will have two white elephants on its hands.   
  
Contrary to popular belief, firefighting has not grown more expensive because of anthropogenic climate change. The nation actually suffered worse droughts in the 1930s than in the last decade, and there is no evidence, in the forests at least, that recent fires are due to anything but cyclical climate changes.   
  
Nor are costs high because of new houses in the woods, or wildland-urban interface as fire people call it. Protecting these homes only requires treatment, either in advance of the fire through landscaping and home design or as fires approach through application of fire retardant, of the homes themselves and land within 150 feet of the homes. Anything the Forest Service does beyond that 150 feet is neither necessary nor sufficient to protect homes that are themselves untreated.   
  
Instead, lots of acres burn because the Forest Service now places firefighters well behind the fire lines and has them back burn everything between them and the fire lines. In some fires, close to half the acres burned are back burns.   
  
Meanwhile, costs are high because the Forest Service knows it has what amounts to a blank check, so it makes no effort to save money. As I explain in this Cato paper, the only solution is to ""divorce the agency from Congress’s blank check."" One way to do this might be to have national forests join state fire protection districts by paying an annual per-acre fee, and then letting the states worry about fire fighting. They would have much stronger incentives to control fire at the lowest, rather than the highest, possible cost.   
  
The president's concern that the Forest Service might hamper its fire prevention efforts by having to borrow from those funds to suppress fires is touching but needless. As shown by previous fires, Congress could fully fund fire prevention and fuel treatment programs for years without reducing the number of homes destroyed by fire each year. In fact, Congress is so willing to do anything to protect homes that the Forest Service practically depends on a few houses burning down each year to keep the money flowing.   
  
The Forest Service should educate homeowners about what they need to do to defend their homes from fire. Beyond that, what people actually do is between them and their insurance companies, which for too long have indirectly relied on the blank check to keep their costs down. Getting firefighting decisions out of the hands of federal agencies may be the only way to let this happen.

So the little ones managed to tag an extra day onto their school holidays, no doubt with the blessing of their so-called teachers who have decided that climate change is a subject within the curriculum that deserves to be politicised. This is a tool whereby students can be brainwashed to the point of fear through hysteria emanating from many teachers’ mouths purely to suit and promote their left-wing U.N. agenda. No doubt there were thousands more pupils who simply took the day off.



It is most unfortunate that the Prime Minister is leading the charge in the dissemination of this willfully misleading information. The nonsense being spouted to students that the planet, and indeed they themselves are going to perish because of the climate within their lifetimes, is but one part of a broader push for the implementation of the UN dream of a one-world government controlled by the Socialist left. This is not unlike [the goal Hitler had ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/the-fourth-reich-marches-to-victory-at-last/)when he instigated World War Two. The likes of Ardern and her dangerous ilk who like to call themselves progressives are in fact nothing of the sort. They are all comrades stuck in the past, running around with their cloth caps on and waving their hammers and sickles.



The EU view of Brexit is a good example Aside from the fact that they need Britain more than Britain needs them (something they wouldn’t admit to), Britain leaving is the end of their dream of a European Empire. This has been articulated by Mr Verhofstadt of the European Commission and he is very angry. The real objective is to get a number of similar groups around the globe such as the one we have joined. Like the EU they start off as a trading arrangement and then the political angle is introduced. The end result is all the groups become one single entity and there’s your world Government.



The other arrant nonsense Jacinda is promoting is one where we live in a borderless world as one people being kind and hugging each other. This is all part of the plan. It is however completely devoid of reality. Where, for example, do Maori and the Treaty of Waitangi fit in that scenario? As a country do we just forfeit our sovereignty? If that is Jacinda’s true aim then she should immediately stand aside and hand over the reins to someone who is prepared to put New Zealand’s interests first.



These dangerous conspiracies are being driven and funded by the likes of George Soros and others of similar warped thinking. Wherever or whenever there’s trouble, the name Soros seems to pop up; Greta Thunberg being a recent example. If Jacinda was smart enough she’d realise she is fraternising with people who have undesirable aims for both the planet and its inhabitants. They are only interested in pushing their own barrows with the end result being of benefit to no one but themselves.



I, for one, do not wish the sovereignty of my country to be lost at the behest of lunatic socialist dictators. Nationalism and patriotism are what this country needs along with a political party which is prepared to show similar intent. I have yet to be convinced that we have one.

There is no surer way to tell that you’ve crossed the border from NSW to the ACT than by the quality of the road. One minute you’re bumping along on a fairly ordinary stretch of bitumen, the next you’re gliding on air. Canberra must surely have the smoothest, best-maintained roads in all of Australia.



The public sector is no slouch at looking after itself. It should surprise not a single taxpayer that the ACT has the highest median income in Australia, by a country mile. Like so many rich people today, these public service fat cats are as addicted to virtue-signalling as they are to our money.



The last stage of South Australia’s Hornsdale wind farm comes online today. With that, the ACT, more than 1,000 kilometres away, will “officially” be powered by 100 per cent renewable electricity.



Except that that’s just another in the litany of green lies.



Only about five per cent of the territory’s electricity is generated within its borders, by a few solar farms and rooftop panels on Canberra homes.



The rest comes from the national electricity market — the grid that powers the eastern seaboard — and four-fifths of the grid’s power comes from non-renewable sources.



In other words, nearly 80% of Canberra’s electricity comes from dirty old coal and gas… and that’s on the days when the wind is blowing and the sun is shining.



The “100 per cent renewable” claim is a typically deceitful green pea-and-shells game. Only watermelons can somehow spin a maximum 20% into “100%”.



The ACT funds five different wind farms around Australia to feed energy into the national grid to make up for what Canberra consumes.



Those investments, together with Canberra’s own solar, put a stop to about 40 per cent of the ACT’s carbon emissions […]the shortfall is made up by the ACT Government’s mandatory contribution to the national renewable energy target, where it buys the equivalent amount of renewable power for 21 per cent of its total consumption.



  
No matter how you spin that, it still doesn’t add up to 100%. And Canberra is **still** consuming fossil-fuel generated electricity.



As always, the climate change scam is 100% fuelled by bullshit and taxpayers’ money.

I hate to say it, believe me, but the cartoon in yesterday’s Dompost accurately sums up the way the National party is allowing themselves to be portrayed.



They seem to be dithering, **distracted by things that simply don’t matter** , while they ponder and mull over their stance on the Zero-Carbon Bill, the biggest economic hand-grenade a government of New Zealand has ever considered pulling the pin on.



 **They need to oppose this Bill in the strongest possible terms** , they need to be holding feet to the fire, they need to stay on message and point – this bill is economic sabotage and, it’s a fact, we will all be worse off, especially the lower earners.



They need to be especially targeting global-warming emperor-with-no-clothes Shaw and his blithe let-them-eat-cake shrug-off towards this bill’s victims:



“The modelling suggested **the poorest 20 per cent of households could be twice as worse-off thanks to climate action** as their counterparts on the average income, thanks to them spending a higher proportion of their income on products likely to increase in cost.  
 **Shaw said any change would be gradual** and Government interventions such as the Families Package would be key. The Families Package greatly increased the amount of money the poorest families gain from Working For Families and other benefits.”



Oh, OK, James, so the poor will only gradually get poorer, that’s nice, and only gradually more reliant on welfare hand-outs. I’m sure they’ll take comfort from that. These points need to be hammered home, hard! But instead, what do we get?



Never a truer thing spoken by _Stuff_ : “National doesn’t bite”. At a time when we need an opposition dog prepared to tear into this bill and its proponents, ripping them a new rear entrance if necessary, we get a toothless poodle who doesn’t want to “play politics”.



Get going, Mr Bridges, or get gone!

graphic by Jo NovaThis must be personally satisfying for Steve McIntyre, though I doubt the folks at RealClimate will have the integrity to acknowledge that he was right, and they were wrong.
It seems that in the latest publication from CRU’s Keith Briffa, they decided to leave out those elements (The most influential tree in the world) Steve identified that led to the Yamal Superstick.
Have a look at this remarkable graph below.

McIntyre writes:
Unreported by CRU is that they’ve resiled from the Yamal superstick of Briffa 2000 and Briffa et al 2008 and now advocate a Yamal chronology, the modern portion of which is remarkably similar to the calculations in my posts of September 2009 here and May 2012 here, both of which were reviled by Real Climate at the time.
In today’s post, I’ll demonstrate the degree to which the new Briffa version has departed from the superstick of Briffa 2000 and Briffa et al 2008 and the surprising degree to which it approaches versions shown at CA.

Figure 3. Comparison of Briffa et al 2008 superstick to yamal_trw chronology of Briffa et al 2013. Both in z-scores.

…the next graphic shows the two CA calculations that had been so reviled by CRU and Real Climate (the green chronology of Sept 2009 and the May 2012 calculation with updated information from Hantemirov). I think that I’m entitled to observe that the B13 chronology is more similar to the two reviled CA calculations than it is to the Briffa et al 2008 superstick. Needless to say, this was not reported in CRU’s recent Real Climate article. 
Figure 4. Comparison of B13 Yamal chronology to CA (Climate Audit) calculations.
omnologos points out this missive from Gavin Schmidt on RealClimate:
The irony is of course that the demonstration that a regional reconstruction is valid takes effort, and needs to be properly documented. That requires a paper in the technical literature and the only way for Briffa et al to now defend themselves against McIntyre’s accusations is to publish that paper (which one can guarantee will have different results to what McIntyre has thrown together). 
Looks like that guarantee expired.

@Steve McIntyre
From Fig. 4 above:
it’s quite obvious that in 2009 and again in 2011, you shamelessly plagiarised Briffa 2013
Easily the worst sin in the academic book, run a close second only by disrupting the space-time continuum in order to perform the plagiarism
Too Funny! To prevent this from happening again, we need to establish a Pre-plagiarism Crimes unit, complete with a minority report. /sarc

When climate scold Greta Thunberg screeched at the UN that “people are dying!”, she was barely half-right.



Yes, people are dying, and they are dying because of climate change. But they are not dying because of global warming, and they are not dying because governments are refusing to act.



 **People are dying because of the very policies that Greta Thunberg wants to force on the world.**



As many commentators have pointed out to the ignorant, megalomaniac brat, climate-related deaths have plummeted. People are [far more likely to die from cold than heat](https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2015/05/20/cold-weather-deaths/27657269/). **People are dying because of the climate-change panic.**



Staggering energy prices are taking a toll on those unable to pay their bills, a UK regulator has admitted, confirming that **thousands of people may have died because of fuel poverty** and lack of heating during winter.



Climate change is an obsession for the elite. The sort of elites who fly their private jets or sail luxury yachts to “climate change summits” in swanky resorts, and vote for government subsidies for wind farms that will never be built in their leafy inner-city enclaves. The costs, in money and lives, are borne by the poor.



The most vulnerable households spend more on their energy bills than wealthier ones, and “can therefore be at greater risk of fuel poverty,” according to a comprehensive new study by the Office of Gas and Energy Markets (Ofgem) on Thursday.



Fuel poverty, a common UK term for customers who cannot afford to keep adequately warm at an affordable cost, “increases the risk that people [will] develop ill health,” it acknowledged.



Over winter 2017-18, we estimate that fuel poverty may have contributed to 5,500 excess winter deaths and that 16,500 excess winter deaths may have been linked to people living in cold homes.



The shocking death toll occurred despite the government trying to make energy more “cost reflective”.



Lest this all be dismissed as mere propaganda from RT, [the report itself](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/system/files/docs/2019/10/2019_state_of_the_energy_market_0.pdf) makes for eye-opening reading. Ofgem (a suitably Orwellian moniker) trumpets its goals as “driv[ing] down prices” and “protect[ing] consumers, especially the vulnerable”. Hard as the report tries to gloss over the inconvenient truths, it’s obvious that it’s failed those goals badly.



In England and Wales, around one in five privately rented households live in fuel poverty, compared to around a tenth of other households […]fuel poverty may have contributed to 5,500 excess winter deaths in winter 2017-18. From 2013 to 2018, more than 64,000 fuel poor customers have been connected to the mains gas grid, providing access to cheaper energy.”



In other parts of the UK, the situation is even more: one in four Scottish homes is fuel poor.



Meanwhile, the goal of all this suffering, “decarbonisation” is failing badly:



UK carbon emissions fell by only 12 million tonnes in 2018, the slowest rate of decline since 2012.



As George Orwell rebutted the foolish argument about needing to break eggs to make an omelette: “Where’s the omelette?”



People are indeed dying, Greta, you ignorant, arrogant brat: They’re dying because of people like you.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis week the 6th Klimawoche (Climate Week) has been taking place in the German northern port city of Hamburg. The aim of the Climate Week Conference is to urge Germans to accelerate the implementation of green energies in order to curb the rapidly approaching dangerous climate warming. It is viewed as a “communication” event.
Hat-tip: The alarmist klimaretter.de. 
For those organizing and participating in the conference, the science has long been settled and the planet is certainly on a dangerous, accelerated path to destruction by the end of the century, that is unless man drastically alters his way of life.
The conference was opened at a Christian mass last Sunday by renowned journalist Franz Alt. In his opening remarks Alt made the shrill declaration:
We are in the middle of a Third World War against nature.”
Alt: The sun and wind don’t send bills

Earlier this year in an interview Alt aimed sharp criticism at the German government for dragging its feet with the implementation of renewable energies. In the interview Alt appeared completely unaware of extreme renewable energy costs that German consumers have had to endure so far, even reiterating the slogan: “Wind and sun don’t send bills“.
He also asked why Germany’s Economics Minister, Sigmar Gabriel, kept talking about the problems and costs involved with renewable energy: “Why doesn’t he speak about the advantages?”
Alt also said he cannot understand why Germany imports 100 billion euros worth of oil and gas from the Middles East and from Putin’s Russia instead of investing that money in renewable energy at home, once again reiterating, “The sun and wind don’t send electric bills“.
Sun’s always shining, wind always blowing!
Alt is also convinced fossil fuel energies are dinosaurs that are right on the verge of running out, and that the future is wind and sun: “The sun is always shining! The wind is always blowing!”
The week-long Hamburg Climate Week event features education events for schoolchildren, and workshops on sustainable living and climate friendly nutrition. Also scheduled to appear at the conference were climate scientists Mojib Latif, Hartmut Graßl and Claudia Schmitt.

"Last week the Guardian asked New Zealanders how they thought the country should change as workers return to their offices and life slowly returns to “normal”. Many urged systemic and far-reaching changes in society following the pandemic, which saw just under 1,500 infections in the country and 22 deaths. Overall, the majority of respondents were keen on exploring a four-day week – floated by the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern – saying it would allow for more work-life balance, and the continuation of habits picked up during lockdown, including home-cooked meals, walking, cycling and more time spent with the family. Other common suggestions included the introduction of a universal basic income, greater emphasis on climate change adaption – and fewer cars on the road.  “I have been enjoying working from home. Working from home has meant I’ve seen my family more, have not had to spend an hour a day in the car commuting, and have been able to go on daily walks around the neighbourhood. Local walks have been wonderful, with next to no motorised traffic. Families have been out cycling on Auckland’s normally insanely dangerous roads. The city has been quiet. Birdsong has been audible. The air has been noticeably clearer.Discretionary spending has dropped hugely. No more convenience shopping for lunches, no more Uber Eats. I’ve been cooking lunches and dinners, and enjoying it.I wish the family time, the inner-city peacefulness, safety and cleanliness, and sense of community built by the crisis could continue. While we were in lockdown, it seemed as if the world would never be the same again. Now the economy is starting up again, it seems like we’re heading back towards a similar version of what we had before – except without international travel or tourism. I would like to see a fundamental change. I think neoliberal values have had their day, and that this crisis has proved, as has our government and the people’s response, that there are better priorities and more noble goals than the pursuit of growth above all else.” Simon Bennett, 55, Auckland “I have preferred working from home because my team live throughout the country and I communicate with them via video-call most of the time anyway. While I do miss small things like casual conversations with colleagues over a mug of tea in the office kitchen and getting dressed up to go out for the day, I have enjoyed other adjustments – such as our daily quiz now via Teams and being cozy in my dressing gown in the lounge at home as we head into winter here in the Southern hemisphere. The whole ‘work-life balance’ idea is so individual.After Covid-19, I hope to continue spending greater time on activities that are so much more meaningful to me now, given our gradually less-limited freedom. While I was already a nature-lover and foodie, my passion for these areas of life has grown exponentially; my breath-work meditation practice, plant-based meals. The quality of my relationships is a constant work-in-progress but upon reflection, I wish to be more mindful of how I can engage in these more presently and attentively. I think, where practically possible, [the four-day week] is definitely the way forward when it comes to the future of work. The global pandemic has forced several overdue ideas into action, like virtual healthcare consultations and more flexible working arrangements. This opportunity has a lot of potential, from stronger family connections and social cohesion to business productivity and employee health outcomes. We need to be open to new ways of doing things, especially when it revolves around one of the world’s precious non-renewable resources – time!” Sarsha Sivanantham, 22, Wellington “Working from home can bring so many bonuses – flexibility, pleasant working environment, no early morning alarms, no stressful commuting, enjoying daily lunchtime walks, better home-prepared meals, better quality sleeping and less anxiety. Why would I want to go back into the office?” Rachael, 57, librarian, Wellington “I’ve worked from home for years, as a copywriter and now as a researcher. I prefer it and think most people should be allowed to do it. I hope when I finish my program this year I’ll land a job that will allow me to continue to work from home. The fact that most people still go into a brick-and-mortar office in this day and age is bizarre. The environmental impact alone should be a reason to change this. Why so many are forced to get in their car, drive 30+ minutes to an office, and sit at a desk to answer emails is beyond me. It would be awesome if New Zealand could find a way to move forward with less dependence on tourism. Tourism was wreaking havoc on the environment and only really helping the ‘bottom line’ on economists’ spreadsheets. There’s gotta be a better way to transfer those jobs and businesses to something less dependent on people getting on a plane for 12 hours to come here. I suggest re-focusing all that manpower towards environmental projects, business innovation, and sustainability.” April, 41, Wellington “Less Facetime and more face-to-face time with the people that matter is what it’s all about, right? Many New Zealanders it seems are increasing our veggie patches and our ability to take care of ourselves in the event of another emergency like this one. The world cannot carry on in the exhausting way we have been and that includes exhausting our finite resources and upsetting the earth’s ability to deliver on the renewable ones like clean air and water. Humans don’t need to take it all.” Evie Ashton, 48, Auckland “I’d like to see a universal basic income, a return to more progressive taxation and more emphasis on halting global heating.” Malcolm, 70, Lower-Hutt “I have absolutely loved the working from home it’s been an incredible opportunity and privilege that I never thought I would have. I’ve really enjoyed not having to commute every day … having the ability to hang out the washing and walk the dog in the morning is an added benefit. I feel like I can actually breathe and my heart isn’t always racing.” Jade, 43, Wellington “I loved working from home, but I would like to see colleagues in person occasionally, as I found Zoom meetings tiring after a while. My perfect arrangement would be days when we have the option to work from home, and agreed mornings or afternoons when we are at work and can see people in person. I am going to miss the quiet streets, empty skies and more audible bird song – that was the silver lining during our lockdown.” Nicki Frances, Lower Hutt, early 50s “I believe New Zealand needs to look at how it can look after itself more when this happens again. I don’t think New Zealand should give up on globalism but I do think we should rely on the outside world less.” Nicola, Auckland “I would love to be able to retain the silence and the birdsong. The impact of traffic noise has been shown to be all-pervasive harm to our peace and connection to nature. Electric cars and bikes are far quieter – I would like to see a definite and fixed timetable for the phase-out of all combustion engines. I’ve loved being able to enjoy the sunshine all day long, while working from home. When I stop for a coffee, I can go sit in the sun, or go potter outside amongst the plants. When I think of going back to the office, all I see in my mind is the unrelenting greyness of shadowy office space. I no longer want to spend the best part of every day sitting in the gloom. But most of all, working from home has made me realise how stressful my work is, and how much I dread the everyday office conflict, hierarchy, surveillance and ‘constructive criticism’. Work has given me my best friends, meaningful work, and an educated understanding of the world. But it’s also utterly reductive, demoralising, and humiliating. I am one of the lucky ones, with a salaried, permanent job, and yet it feels actually like an abusive relationship. Lockdown has made me realise more than ever I need to get out, and find some other way to earn a living – independent, creative, and with my self-respect in one piece.” Anonymous, Wellington, 48 “I love people so I want to be able to carry on just like before.” Leif, Auckland, 82 “As the wonderful Arundhati Roy wrote shortly after the Covid-19 pandemic had been declared, this pandemic is a portal. We can step through to work towards a world focused on human and planetary health, happiness and wellbeing, or we can try to ‘get back to normal’ – which means continuing the unsustainable economic rat race that has been driving us into a spiralling vortex of problems. I’m for going through the portal. The first thing we need to do is change our mindsets – we’ve become an urbanised consumer society – and we’d do well to listen to the voices of our first people who work so hard to teach us kaitiakitanga (guardianship and protection), a way of managing the environment, based on the Māori world view.” Anne, South Island “In terms of work-life I’m quite pleased to go back to the office, I really enjoy the team I work with and working from home doesn’t give the same team dynamic that I’m used to. I also really enjoy the separation between home and work life which just isn’t possible where I currently live.” Anonymous, 28, Wellington “It seems the silver lining in NZ has been a reinforcement of some core community values which may have been lost over the last few decades. That may be a bit of a generalisation but I’ve noticed more care and consideration in my own neighbourhood over this time.” Tim, 49, Lower Hutt “Ultimately Covid is another expression of climate change. As is the severe drought we are still experiencing. I am not an advocate for going back to business as usual. Shelter, food and interesting culture are more important.” Anonymous, Hokianga “The biggest changes I hope to see are not in my home but in society at large, where Covid-19 has thrown some chronic problems into stark relief. We could try to get back to how things were, but why, when we know how dysfunctional it was?” Ben Whitmore, Raglan, 43 “I would hope to see a new ‘normal’, one where people appreciate their time more and working from home is a real possibility. It seems as if many people gained a greater appreciation for their time, health, and nature during the lockdown, and it would be a shame if this was lost so quickly and without serious consideration for what life could be like.” Edward, 29, Auckland"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLately I’ve been reading up a lot on nutrition, and I’m finding out that the riff-raff and fraud that are rampant in the food and pharmaceutical industry is even more cold-blooded than the playground kind of stuff we see in “climate science”. It really is that bad.
Recall how George Clooney once asked (paraphrasing) “if 99% of doctors tell you’re sick and only 1% say you’re fine, who are you gonna hang out with?” Turns out that taking Clooney’s advice is a good way to long, painful death.
Right now I’m reading “Wheat Belly” by Dr. William Davis. This is a must read for anyone over 30.
When you get down to it, the pharmaceutical industry is not interested in making you healthy, rather they are all about making you sick while dragging out your life in order to reap maximum profits through a lifetime of drugs sales and expensive treatments. It turns out that many of the diseases (e.g. diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, skin diseases, asthma, arthritis, bone degeneration, etc., etc., etc.) are easily preventable (and even reversible) just by making adjustments in your diet: reducing the intake of carbohydrates, eliminating glutens, and avoiding plant-based fats and oil. But what good is a healthy patient to Big Pharma’s bottom line?
What follows is a short excerpt of Wheat Belly that depicts the cold-blooded advice that supposedly respectable professional organizations like the America Diabetes Association (ADA), American Dietetics Association, and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) all have been feeding the public for decades:
Years ago, I used the ADA diet in diabetic patients. Following the carbohydrate intake advice of the ADA, I watched patients gain weight, experience deteriorating blood glucose control and the increased need for medication, and develop diabetic complications such as kidney disease and neuropathy. Just as Ignatz Semmelkweis caused the incidence of childbed fever in his practice to nearly vanish just by washing his hands, ignoring ADA diet advice and cutting carbohydrate intake leads to improved blood sugar control, reduced HbA1c, dramatic weight loss, and improvement in all the metabolic messiness of diabetics such as high blood pressure and triglycerides.
The ADA advises diabetics to cut fat, reduce saturated fat, and includes 45 to 60 grams of carbohydrate – preferably ‘healthy whole grains’ in each meal, or 135 to 180 grams of carbohydrates per day, not including snacks. It is, in essence, a fat-phobic, carbohydrate-centered diet, with 55 to 65 percent of calories from carbohydrates. If I were to sum up the views of the ADA toward diet, it would be: Go ahead and eat sugar and foods that increase blood sugar, just be sure to adjust your medication to compensate.”
My, what a wonderful way to milk the patient for years until he dies. Davis continues:
But while ‘fighting fire with fire’ may work with pest control, and passive aggressive neighbors, you can’t charge your way out of credit card debt and you can’t carbohydrate-stuff your way out of diabetes.
The ADA exerts heavy influence in crafting national attitudes toward nutrition. When someone is diagnosed with diabetes, they are sent to a diabetes educator or nurse who counsels them on ADA diet principles. If the patient enters the hospital and has diabetes, the doctors orders an ‘ADA diet’. Such ‘dietary guidelines’ can, in effect, be enacted into health ‘law’. I’ve seen smart diabetic nurses and educators, who coming to understand that carbohydrates cause diabetes, buck ADA advice and counsel patients to curtail carbohydrates consumption. Because such advice flies in the face of ADA guidelines,  the medical establishment demonstrates its incredulity by firing these rogue employees.”

Here too we see how “skeptics” of “consensus science” are harshly dealt with.
Davis continues, listing the ADA recommended foods for diabetics:
– whole grain breads, such as whole wheat or rye
– whole grain high-fiber cereal
– cooked cereal such as oatmeal, grits, hominy, or cream of wheat
– rice pasta, tortillas
– cooked beans and peas, such as pinto beans or black-eyed peas
– potatoes, green peas, corn, lima beans, sweet potatoes, winter squash
– low-fat crackers and snack chips, pretzels, and fat-free popcorn
In short, eat wheat, wheat, corn, rice, and wheat.”
Boy that’ll sure help your diabetes to improve, won’t it! This is like trying to cure an alcoholic with Jack Daniels, or a gunshot wound with a shot gun.
Recall the diet to help diabetics cope with their illness is recommended by the quintessential 97% of all real doctors and experts. Why, you’d have to be crazy not to hang out with them if you’re a diabetic!
Paging George Clooney.
William Davis’s Wheat Belly is chock-full with examples of such riff raff in the fields of food, nutrition and pharmaceuticals.

By WUWT regular “Just The Facts”
During the first crowdsourcing thread for the under construction WUWT Paleoclimate Reference Page, we had a number solid recommendations and WUWT moderator D.B. Stealey dropped a virtual mountain of links into comments  here and here. The result is that the original WUWT Paleoclimate Reference Page has more than doubled in size and continues to grow as more comments from the prior crowdsourcing thread are added. Given the large number of additions and the fact that we now have a number of near-duplicate graphs, it seemed prudent to continue this crowdsourcing exercise to gain further input on the validity and value of each and all of the graphs.
There will likely be at least one more crowdsourcing thread for the WUWT Paleoclimate Reference Page, in order to assess a number of the currently disputed, questionable and falsified graphs, including Briffa et al., 1998, Jones et al., 1998, Mann et al., 1998, Pollack et al., 1998, Jones et al., 1998, Mann et al., 1999, Mann et al., 2000, Briffa et al., 2001, Esper et al., 2002 and Jones and Mann 2004, AR4 section 6.6.1.1 2007 and Marcott et al. 2013. Note that two (1, 2) of the graphs currently on the Paleoclimate page have a Disputed label, as per this comment and Alley’s own graph, the x axis label should read Years Before Present (1950 AD) not (2000 AD)

However, disputes aside, a gigantic thank you to D.B. Stealey, and all of those who have contributed to the WUWT Paleoclimate Reference Page. The following are some of the new additions to the WUWT Paleoclimate Reference Page:

"**It is not yet known when all care home residents in Wales will be able to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.**
The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.
But Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton could not say when care home residents would receive it due to storage temperature requirements.
Care home residents and staff are among those identified as a top priority.
Other priority groups include health and social care workers and over-80s.
The jab offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness and the Welsh Government hopes the first vaccines will be given within seven to 14 days.
But Dr Atherton said getting the vaccines to care homes was a ""work in progress"" and ""very difficult"" to do because it needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C.
Initially it will have to be provided to a limited number of sites, he said.
""We're trying to find ways, even with this vaccine, to provide a more disseminated approach to distribution.
""There are of course other vaccines in the pipeline - the Oxford vaccine for example which doesn't have such stringent requirements around temperature management and control.
""As that comes online, as we hope, that will that will give us a further ability to work our way through those priority lists.""
Dr Atherton added: ""I can't give you an exact date or a time frame, but we're working through that process as quickly as we can.
""Because those elderly residents, usually elderly in care homes, are one of our highest priorities.""
Everyone over 50 will be offered the vaccine in the coming months.
The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19.
It will be ""well into next year"" before the entire Welsh population has been vaccinated against Covid-19, Dr Atherton said, adding it would be ""a massive undertaking"".
Vaccines for younger people will be available after the over-50s have had their jabs, according to Gill Richardson, who chairs the Welsh Government's Covid-19 vaccine programme board.
Dr Richardson said the Welsh Government was taking steps to ensure the vaccination programme did not affect other NHS services.
""People will be invited to come and have the vaccine through the NHS - we'll be holding special vaccine clinics to make sure people can receive the jab, while keeping normal NHS services free to see people,"" she said at the Welsh Government press briefing.
""The vaccine is the best way to protect people, but no-one will be forced to have it if they don't want it,"" Dr Richardson said.
Dr Atherton added that a Public Health Wales survey had shown that 70% of people would be willing to have the vaccine, and 60% would want their children to have it.
There are plans for people who have had a jab to be given a record card but it is not anticipated that hospitality businesses in Wales will turn away people who cannot prove they have been vaccinated, according to Dr Richardson.
""We hope that people will come and have this extremely precious and significant commodity for free of their own volition, but there's no compulsion,"" she said.
The Welsh Government said two areas had been identified as appropriate delivery sites for the vaccine and local health boards would collect the vaccines directly from these sites.
Dr Richardson declined to say where the sites were, but added: ""We have looked very carefully at all the storage parameters and also ease of distribution so we can get this vaccine out as swiftly as possible to the immunisers who will need it in each of the health boards and trusts.""
People will be sent appointments with details of the location where they will receive the vaccination, dependent on where they are in the schedule and risk, it added.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""Today's news is a small glimmer of light at the end of what has been a long and dark tunnel...
""We must all continue to do our bit to prevent the spread of coronavirus - regular hand washing, social distancing, and wearing a face covering where required to protect yourself and others.""
Dr Richardson said serious side effects from the new vaccine were ""extremely rare"".
She said people might get a sore arm or occasionally a raised temperature, but ""it's a very safe vaccine"".
She added that the ""safety profiles"" were ""really good"" for the elderly and those that have clinical conditions.
""We are extremely pleased to be offering what we feel is a very safe vaccine to the Welsh population,"" she added.
Dr Atherton said it was not yet known whether the vaccine will stop transmission of the virus.
He said it is known from data submitted by the company ""it's pretty good"" at stopping people getting infected and having serious infections.
""We just don't know yet whether it will stop transmission,"" he told the press briefing.
""That will only be known to us in the fullness of time when vaccines are rolled out.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""This is fantastic news and is what we have all been waiting forâ¦ it is vaccines like this one that will give us the protection needed to reclaim our lives.""
Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader in Westminster and MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said the news was ""fantastic"" and there was ""a cloud beginning to lift"", especially for those in care homes and people who have been isolated.
""There's this prospect of being reunited with loved ones,"" she said. ""We really need some hope. It's such good news.""
Conservative MS for Aberconwy Janet Finch-Saunders said she had no concerns about the plans for the mass vaccination.
""The concern was always about whether a vaccine could be found and whether it would be approved, so today is a good day,"" she said.
As the NHS prepares for a challenging winter, with the additional pressures of delivering the vaccine, staff welcomed the news.
Dai Samuel, a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital who had coronavirus earlier this year, said: ""Excellent news and reflects the immense efforts and superb work undertaken by the medical research community.""
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, as two shots are needed.
It is the fastest ever vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same developmental steps that normally span a decade."

However, the question was not, “How to wreck an economy?” The question was about dealing with the climate crisis. Since this answer was proposed by Billy Fleming, a US landscape architect, we had better sit up and take notice.



Safeguarding New Zealand against the devastating impact of climate change could mean seizing the means of production.



US landscape architect Billy Fleming has a radical vision for the country’s future if it’s going to survive rising sea levels and extreme weather, and it involves the dreaded s-word: socialism.



Billy, the landscaper, is obviously a bright lad:



“So much of Auckland is right up against the water and on fill, so a lot of the terrain is quite soft. You’re probably going to need walls.”



Holland keeps the rising seas at bay through the use of dikes and drainage canals along the Dutch coastline, but Auckland will require more robust structures including pumps to drain seawater when it encroaches on the city.



The strong implication from that statement is that the Dutch system simply drains into the sea whereas Auckland will need pumps. Since about one-third of the Netherlands is below sea level and a great chunk of Rotterdam is 5m below sea level, it is clear to anyone with a brain that any water will not drain away on its own. The Dutch have been pumping water for centuries.



Remind me not to get Billy to design a garden water feature.



Poor Billy really is a little short on facts:



You’re not in the position Australia or Canada are where they have lots of land you can imagine people moving to as sea levels encroach. That process in other places will be incredibly expensive and politically fraught and hard, but they have the option of thinking about that. 



Have a look at the map, Billy.



Should all your doom come to pass, there appears to be plenty of land to live on.



For Fleming, socialism is inextricable from the issue of climate change. Capitalism, with its relentless growth demanding more and more of the Earth’s resources, is inherently incompatible with sustained human life. Things need to change, and they need to change fast.



“We’re going to have to do a whole lot of things really quickly, faster than we’ve ever done them, better designed than ever, and we’re going to have to balance that with a very real need to make sure there’s deliberation and public ownership over that process,” he says.



“Part of that means discarding the idea that markets can solve all of these problems for us, which is not a radical statement at all in most parts of the world, but in the United States is something that gets you thrown out of rooms.”



The thing about capitalism is that it also drives efficiency. Equivalent vehicles now are far more fuel-efficient than they were twenty years ago. Many previous ‘luxury’ food items are now available every day at the local supermarket. Clothes can be supplied more cheaply and so on.



Obviously there are some abuses, like child sweatshops, that need to be eliminated but the bald fact remains that socialism has never ever worked anywhere. 



It would be a wonderful service to humanity if all the socialism advocates took themselves off to Venezuela to show the locals how to ‘do socialism’ properly, while the rest of us got one with allowing capitalism to make our lives and our environment better. 



Haiti (left) has per capita GDP of around $US 760. They chop down the forest to make charcoal for heat and cooking. Dominican Republic (right) has a per capita GDP of just over $US 7,000, they do not need to use the forest as an energy source.



It may be simplistic but it seems that the wealthier a nation, the more money it can spend on cleaning up and caring for the environment.



I prefer the capitalist idea of having lights at night time.



Don’t ever forget what one of the originators of the IPCC said back in 2010:



Basically, it is a big mistake to discuss climate policy apart from the big issues of globalization.   
The climate summit in Cancún at the end of the month is not a climate conference but one of the biggest business conferences since the Second World War. […]  
  
But one has to say clearly: we are effectively redistributing world wealth through climate policy. 



Billy is correct, the end goal of climate alarmism is Socialism.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Inspired by an interesting guest post entitled “An energy model for the future, from the 12th century” over at Judith Curry’s excellent blog, I want to talk a bit about energy storage.
The author of the guest post is partially right. His thesis is that solving the problem of how to store city-sized amounts of electricity would make a very big difference, particularly for intermittent sources like wind and solar. And he’s right, it would. But he’s wrong not to point out how devilishly difficult that goal has been to achieve in the real world.
Storage of electricity is a very strange corner of scientific endeavors. Almost everything in a 2013 car is very different from what was in a 1913 car … except for the battery. Automobile batteries are still lead-acid, and the designs only differ slightly from those of a hundred years ago.
Figure 1. Elements of a lead-acid car battery. SOURCE 
Now, we do have nicads and such, but the automobile storage battery is the bellwether for the inexpensive storage of electricity. Cars need a surprisingly large amount of energy to start, particularly if they are balky. If there were a cheaper way to store that big charge, it would be on every car on the planet. Given that huge market, and the obvious profits therein, people have been busting their heads against the problem since before Thomas Edison made his famous statement about automobile batteries.
And despite that century-long huge application of human ingenuity, in 2013 the lead-acid battery still rules. It’s an anomaly, like fusion energy, a puzzle that has proven incredibly hard to solve. Potential solutions have all fallen by the wayside, due to cost, or capacity, or energy density, or dangerous components, or long-term stability, or clogging, or rarity of materials, or a habit of exploding or melting down, or manufacturing difficulties, the number of pitfalls is legion.
So I’ll get excited when we have something other than lead-acid batteries in our cars. Because that will be evidence that we’ve taken the first step … but even that won’t be enough. The other problem is the huge amount of energy we’re talking about. Here’s some back-of-the-envelope figures.
New York City’s electricity consumption averaged over a 24/7/365 basis is on the order of 5 gigawatts (5E+09 watts) continuous. Let’s take a city a tenth of that size, there’s plenty of them on the planet, China alone has dozens and dozens of cities that big, and lets consider how much storage we’d need to provide three days of stored electrical energy for that city. The numbers look like this
5.0E+08 watts continuous times

72 hours equals

3.6E+10 watt-hours of storage times

3.6E+03 seconds/hour gives

1.3E+14 joules of storage needed
So that means we’d need to store 130 terajoules (130E+12 joules) of energy … the only problem is, very few people have an intuitive grasp of how much energy 130 terajoules is, and I’m definitely not one of them.
So let me use a different unit of energy, one that conveys more to me. That unit is “Hiroshima-sized atom bombs”. The first atomic bomb ever used in a war, the Hiroshima bomb released the unheard of, awesome energy of 60 terajoules, enough to flatten a city.
And we’re looking to store about twice that much energy …
I’m sure that you can see the problems with scalability and safety and energy density and resource availability and security for that huge amount of energy.
So while I do like the guest author’s story, and he’s right about the city-sized storage being key … it’s a wicked problem.
Finally, as usual, Judith has put up an interesting post on her interesting blog. I don’t subscribe to a lot of blogs, but hers is near the top of the list. My thanks for her contribution to the ongoing discussion.
w.
PS—Edison’t famous statement about automobile batteries? He was offered big money in those days, something like ten grand from memory, to design and build a better battery for electric automobiles than the lead-acid battery. He took the money and went back to his laboratory. Month after month, there was no news from him. So the businessmen who’d put up the money went to see him. He said he didn’t have the battery, and in fact he didn’t even have the battery design.
Naturally, they accused him of having taken their money and done nothing. No, he assured them, that wasn’t right at all.
He said there had actually been significant progress, because he now knew of more than fifty ways NOT to make a battery for an electric automobile …
Curiously, Edison ended up inventing a nickel-iron-peroxide battery, which was a commercial failure … so even he couldn’t get past lead-acid.
Similarly, we now know hundreds and hundreds of ways not to make a battery for a city. So I suppose that’s progress in Edison’s terms, but after a century the wait’s getting long. I suspect we’ll solve the puzzle eventually, perhaps with something like a vanadium flow battery or whatever, but dang … it’s a slow one.

"Aerosols are microscopic liquid or solid particles suspended in the atmosphere. They can originate from natural sources (pine forests, for example), but centuries of burning wood and fossil fuels means there are plenty of aerosols from human activity. Aerosols influence the climate system by changing the Earth’s energy balance, for example by reflecting sunlight back into space before it reaches surface level. But the strength of this effect, known as the aerosol forcing, remains uncertain. Due to their typical lifetime of less than two weeks, and great variability in size and chemical composition, the effects of aerosols are difficult to model. While it remains particularly difficult to resolve the many small-scale interactions between aerosol particles and clouds, their general effects and behaviour can and have been simulated. What our study shows is that, while different climate models simulate aerosol effects in varying levels of complexity, the range of results for different models broadly agree with each other – but reveal errors or bias in recorded observations. Some recent studies have shown how temperature and precipitation in certain regions are influenced by the emission of aerosols. Our study shows that both regional temperature and precipitation in the tropics respond predictably to changes in aerosols, both in climate models and as observed during the mid-20th century. Climate models show that precipitation in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes decreases in response to these changes in aerosols, in line with theory. But recorded observations reveal an increase in precipitation, the opposite to what is expected. For example, aerosol emissions from industry increased markedly in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes as Europe rebuilt its economies and industrialised in the years following World War II. This caused the temperature gradient between the two hemispheres to alter, as the northern hemisphere cooled and southern hemisphere continued warming – something that climate models accurately recreate in simulations. The effect on temperature has a knock-on effect on precipitation patterns, even far from the source of the aerosols. Recent studies have shown that cooling concentrated over the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes can drive changes in the strength of the tropical Hadley cells, a key component of global atmospheric circulation. As a result the tropical rainbelt, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, shifts southwards. This shows up in records of rainfall in the northern hemisphere’s tropics, which show a clear downward trend in the 1960s and 1970s, and also in the severe drought in the Sahel of that time. Again, models and observations match. But when we examine the mid-latitudes in the northern hemisphere this agreement between observations and models breaks down. Our most reliable observations should be here, considering more people have been recording the weather for a longer time than anywhere else globally. In this region we’d expect local aerosol concentrations to lead to a reduction in precipitation – but the observations of the last few decades show quite the opposite. Scientists know that there may be errors or bias in observed mid-latitude land precipitation trends, particularly in the early 20th century. This is due to jumps in the record that can arise through changes in the instruments used or recording or measuring practices. Ocean temperature measurements revealed a distinct temperature drop after 1945, for example, which was eventually revealed to be down different methods of measuring water from a bucket. Snowfall, difficult to measure properly, is a further complication at higher latitudes. But significantly, our study offers an idea of how wrong these observations might be, through linking temperature changes, precipitation changes and aerosol changes, offering an opportunity to correct these key observations. Observations are often taken as truth and used as the standard against which to compare models. We should make a concerted effort to continue correcting these important observations, while always considering potential bias when they are incorporated into studies. Observations, not just models, can also be wrong."

“Overly Overcast: Germany Weathers Darkest Winter in 43 Years”
It seems that there’s a lot of gloom in Germany this Winter, more so than usual. This article in Spiegel explains why:
“The days may be getting longer, but there’s still not a hint of springtime sunshine in Germany. Weather data shows that this winter has been the gloomiest in 43 years. If the sun doesn’t start shining soon, it will be the darkest winter on record.

Winter in Germany is typically a grim affair, dark and steeped in the kind of chilly damp that goes straight to the bones — and, unhappily, to the psyche. But many residents feel that this winter has been particularly hard to bear.
Meteorologists say that’s because it has been the darkest winter in more than four decades. Less than an average of 100 hours of sunshine have been recorded so far over the course of the meteorological winter, which runs from December through February, said National Meteorological Service (DWD) spokesman Gerhard Lux on Monday. The winter average is an already measly 160 hours of sun.”

"This winter’s floods were amongst the most severe in living memory, with swathes of the country submerged. The loss of life has been much lower than for many disasters around the world, but many land owners have suffered substantial damage to their homes and property. Government policy is often unable to save or even help everyone affected and so difficult decisions have to be made over who to save. When explaining the allocation of resources for land protection, the chair of the Environment Agency Lord Smith presented the choices facing the government as a stark dichotomy. He stated that we were confronted with a “difficult choice”, which “involves tricky issues of policy and priority: town or country, front rooms or farmland?” He went on: There’s no bottomless purse, and we need to make difficult but sensible choices about where and what we try to protect. Presented in this way, the government appear to face a classic moral dilemma. One thought experiment, “The Speluncian Explorers”, describes a group of explorers trapped in a cave who have to choose between the consumption of one of their party, or the certain starvation of them all. We are fortunate that few natural disasters are likely to present us with such an unpalatable choice, but as floodwater flows towards a populated area, are we justified in diverting it to farmland or less heavily settled villages? If we accept that it is the role of the government to protect property rights, we must examine why some rights are protected at the expense of others. National infrastructure developments such as HS2, motorways and the national grid have all yielded winners and losers. Many benefit, but others have their property rights removed as a matter of political expediency. From a property perspective, planning and environmental laws are all statutes of compromise which attempt to balance competing interests. When flood defences are built, policymakers must decide which land should be prioritised. Much has been made of the government’s cost-benefit analysis of flood protection and the shortfall after Environment Agency budget cuts. This analysis included a number of factors and prioritised the protection of the homes of the less well-off and elderly – presumably to ensure that the cost of repair and disruption fell on the broadest shoulders. Newspapers frequently report on flood damage running well into the millions of pounds, but financial calculations alone are a poor indicator of the real value of property, either to the individual or to society as a whole. Economic value is often bested by sentimental attachment, and certain types of property, including land, can be part of a person’s identity. With farmland, it is possible that the land could have been in a family for generations – loss of it may feel like a severe amputation. The choice becomes even more complicated when governments have to consider sentimental attachment to property on a regional or national scale, as no valuation of public land can be entirely divorced from its value to society as a whole. The furore that ensued after the government published plans to sell Forestry Commission land demonstrates that the less tangible values associated with public land should be a significant factor in the creation of public policy. Rural land can be valued according to its agricultural productivity, but even the market value of  land is governed by a number of disparate factors. This land can also be used for other purposes, including the many parks and footpaths that are enjoyed by walkers and other visitors. Multiplier effects have been used to value amenity trees in cities such as London. Is a tree that is visited and admired by many thousands of people every day of greater value than one which is lost amongst a forest of its peers? The forestry commission believes that it is. Applying this rule places a higher value on more populous areas and on more visited attractions, but taken on its own does not measure the environmental value of land that is a habitat for rare flora and fauna. If a government is forced to make a choice between property winners and losers, no attempt to balance property rights will satisfy every party because of the subjective nature of property values. The law can compensate injured parties, but there are some values attached to property that make this irreplaceable in financial terms. Where land and resources are limited there is a long history of the prioritisation of land use. Although many people connect their identity to personal attachments to land, the foundation of rights in real property is one where the owners’ rights have never been absolute. This gives legislators significant power over a commodity that is of great financial and sentimental value. We can only hope that this power is exercised carefully and responsibly."
"**Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown.**
A tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into force in the nation, with businesses including hairdressers and beauty salons also able to open.
More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households.
The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"".
Meanwhile, the UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.
The first 800,000 doses will be available in the UK from next week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.
England's new three-tiered system was backed by MPs in a Commons vote just hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan.
There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark.
And people arrived promptly to take advantage of a stock clearance sale at Debenhams department store from 07:00 GMT.
Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown.
It comes after a period which has seen the collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group, women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ© and the failure of Debenhams to secure a buyer \- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk.
Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, but down by 24.1% on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard.
Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates.
She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online.""
Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy.
""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said.
""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month.""
Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.
Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand.
There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels.
British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers, with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"".
Pubs and restaurants are now allowed to reopen in tier one and two areas, although in tier two alcohol can only be served with a ""substantial meal"".
The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus.
And later on Wednesday about 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football League for the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March.
England's new coronavirus restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November.
Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers.
In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors.
And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.
Scotland operates a five-tier system while Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus restrictions \- with the latter currently in a two-week circuit breaker lockdown.
On Tuesday, a further 13,430 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK while a further 603 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 59,051.

Todd Muller has posted some thoughts on Friday’s School Strike for Climate on his Facebook page. As he predicted, there has been a bit of a ‘pile on’ in the comments because he wasn’t alarmist enough. The climate reality deniers cannot handle anything but complete subservience to the ’cause’. 



I admire the passion of the students who marched. 



I would admire their passion had they given up a day of their holidays.



I agree with their demands that those in political and economic influence around the world must initiate faster global action on climate change. 



And that is where the wheels fall off the National Party position on this debate. The climate has always changed and will continue to change and it is utter hubris for mankind to think that they can stop the climate changing.



First of all, we would need to agree on what exactly is the ideal climate that we should not change from. 



I accept that civil demonstrations can mould the political and business will for investment in technologies that will support transition to a low emission future.



We do not need to worry about the emissions of CO2; it is the food our environment needs for plant growth. By all means, reduce the emissions of harmful exhaust gases and make engines more efficient, thus saving money, but demonising a harmless trace gas is a nonsense. 



But when I see messages, repeated on signs held by our vulnerable, determined, anxious, youth saying “You’ll die of old age, I’ll die of climate change!”, I feel deeply uneasy.



I quite agree. This is an extremely harmful message that is being pumped into the minds of children not old enough to understand.



I do not agree that our young New Zealanders lives are at risk if global efforts to reduce emissions don’t happen at the pace that keeps global warming below 1.5 to 2 degrees.



Absolutely correct. There is no evidence that doom arrives at 2°C



Our young New Zealanders are right to be concerned about climate change. However, I do not believe their futures are hopeless, and we should not be allowing this message to take hold.



No, they are not. They are right to be concerned about the pollution of the rivers, lakes and seas. They are right to be concerned about the disappearance of the orangutan habitat and so on. But worrying their young heads about the climate is futile.



Doomsday predictions framed to challenge the perceived inherent inertia of the status quo, to make a political point, are reckless. For our young people, already feeling a sense of anxiety and lack of certainty around their futures, it can add to their sense of hopelessness.



Quite so. So **why is the National Party agreeing with the whole climate change shemozzle** that is totally built on doomsday predictions?



I appreciate that calling out such alarmist and catastrophising language will see many on the extremes of this debate pile in and say ‘hey, there’s the Nats Ag guy acting as a denier again’.



And, as predicted – they did.



I am not. I am, however someone who believes perspective is important in this debate, especially in how we articulate the opportunities, challenges and impacts of climate change to our youth and children.



Climate change is the most complex issue facing our planet.



Not it is not.



If we are to address climate change, it requires global adversaries, such as the United States, China and Russia, to cooperate together to transform their economies. Even if we work at breakneck pace, we still expect the world to warm 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. With this will come changes to agriculture, oceans and cities around the world, and we need to focus on how we adapt to these changes.



 **Why do we need to ruin our economies to fix a non-problem?**



But it is misplaced to state our society will collapse under these changes.



No, it is not. Please explain to us how society can continue without petroleum products and all the derivatives. The removal of all ‘fossil’ fuels is the end game of the climate strikers.



We need our young people to view climate change as a challenge they have a positive role in solving. Today’s youth will be the innovators of the next decade. There are opportunities to develop solutions to the challenges climate change presents to us, particularly in agriculture if given time to be invented.



Don’t waste their creative efforts on climate change. Channel them into something useful like reducing water pollution or predator control or anything else that improves our environment. 



A balanced sense of both challenge and opportunity must be outlined to our youth precisely because of their talent, curiosity and determination.



Let’s not dampen that collective capacity by scaring their self-belief with talk of extinction lingering just around the corner.



Fear paralyses, Hope enables. Let’s demonstrate that.



Hear, hear!



 _I have met and talked to Todd on many occasions. Todd is a thoroughly decent bloke who genuinely seems to be trying to rein in some of the excesses of Shaw et al. However until the National Party completely opposes this climate change nonsense they will continue to alienate possible supporters and voters._

"In the UK, the wild food trend has re-acquainted people with the various edible plants to be found in the countryside. But around the world wild foods are relied on by a billion people as a key part of their diet. For those who farm, fish, hunt and forage for a living, undomesticated or semi-domesticated plants and animals are an important source of food routinely or in hard times. Many of these wild foods are to some degree effectively cultivated, yet are typically neglected in global analyses of food security. But evidence from across the world suggests that several hundred species contribute significantly, especially to the health and well-being of those most vulnerable to poverty and hunger. There are key lessons to be learnt from our two recent reviews in 2010 and 2014 of the use of wild foods, which can highlight some of the reasons why the use of wild foods may be declining, and how to stop that decline. Historically there has always been a continuum rather than any clear distinction between the farmed and the wild, and this remains the case. Useful plants and animals beyond field margins are stewarded to varying degrees. In this way farming, hunting, gathering and nomadism are complementary, with those living on the land using a wide range of practices to manage all three. Examples of management of the wild includes the sparing of young animals, collecting and scattering of seeds and roots, providing feed to animals and fish, clearing forest glades to assist hunting, and irrigating areas wild plants. Food and other ecosystem goods and services are managed for immediate and long-term benefits. Where non-agricultural environments are no longer actively stewarded in this way, important sources of food, fibre, fodder, medicine and income are put at risk. Humans have historically used around 7,000 species of wild plants for food, yet more than half the world’s total protein and calorie requirements are met by just three agricultural crops: rice, wheat and maize (corn). Just 12 species contribute 80% of all the world’s dietary intake. Global agriculture is focused on 150 commercialised species, while by contrast those communities that routinely use wild plants enjoy a startlingly diverse diet.  We collated evidence from 31 studies of wild food use in 20 countries in Asia and Africa, and found an average 92 species were used for food. In 12 indigenous communities this rose to 120 species, with the Karen of Thailand using 252 species of plant and 63 types of animal.  The link between the importance of biodiversity conservation and food security for those relying on wild foods is clear, especially where poverty and hunger is rife. In the Sahel, for example, edible desert plants are a source of iron, zinc, calcium and essential fatty acids. For the Ferlo of Senegal, half of wild plants are at least partly edible, providing a source of vitamins A, B2, and C. The availability and use of wild food runs into a number of social and ecological challenges. The effects of climate change will have an impact on the habitats and distribution of some species, for example. And turning more land over to farming food crops in order to increase food production often leads to loss of biodiversity around farmed areas which, perversely, affects the availability of long-established wild food species. Many communities across the world are losing the local knowledge necessary to be able to select, manage and use uncultivated species. Groups that historically have lived mostly off the land are having to rely more and more on food purchased from shops. For example, across the circumpolar North researchers have documented the negative impact on health this has had due to inadequate micronutrients and excessive sugar and fats. Our reviews underline the importance of linking up policies for food, poverty and biodiversity conservation. As 16 of the world’s biodiversity hotspots overlap with areas of hunger and malnutrition, policies need to tackle many issues at once. Those policies designed either to protect biodiversity or increase food production may have unintended perverse consequences for both. One way to address this is effective community-level management of biodiverse areas – between 400,000 and 500,000 community groups were formed between the early 1990s and 2000s to manage watersheds, forests, irrigation, pests and fisheries. Broadening the focus of agricultural policy away from just production and looking at nutritional security rather than food security would open up the way to promote sustainable intensification of existing farmland which would better preserve a wealth of species biodiversity, on and off the farm. Cultural and agricultural revitalisation projects can focus on reconnecting with traditional food cultures and ecological knowledge. With wild foods contributing vitally to many agricultural communities, and especially subsistence farmers, conservation and agricultural policies should aim to support objectives in both areas – helping conserve landscapes, improve food security, and promoting sustainable livelihoods."

When the wizened wizard of woke-ness, Bob Brown, led his ill-fated clown parade of anti-coal activists last May, it was the standard motley collective of greybeards in sandals (and that was just the women) and dreadlocked ferals. The nosey-nannas at least have the poor excuse that they’re too clapped out to perform any useful function in society, but the smelly unemployables are supposedly of working age.



Except that “work” is as foreign a concept as personal hygiene. Indeed, one of the dreadlocked delusionals actually boasted that protesting was his job.



Australia’s Employment Minister begs to differ.



Employment Minister Michaelia Cash has **threatened to suspend the welfare payments of activists who spend their time protesting instead of looking for jobs.**



Senator Cash told The Australian the government would ­always be focused on getting “people off welfare and into work” after Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton urged the community to push back against disruptive protesters.



“Taxpayers should not be ­expected to subsidise the protests of others.”



As rock band TISM once said of Australia’s arts elite, these publicly-funded grifters line up to hurl abuse at taxpayers while deftly picking their pockets.



Ever the government’s head kicker, Peter Dutton is backing Senator Cash, and going the biff on indulgent lefty beaks who treat these tax-scrounging pests with indulgence.



In an interview on Sydney radio 2GB on Thursday, Mr Dutton took aim at magistrates who imposed “slap on the wrist” penalties for protesters, declaring Queensland should introduce mandatory sentences for those who regularly disrupt the community.



It comes after six people were charged with obstruction offences on Wednesday after a road-blocking protest by climate activist group Extinction Rebellion disrupted the Brisbane CBD during peak hour.



Two days earlier, four people involved in the same group were charged over a protest in which a woman climbed up a large tripod on a high-traffic CBD bridge at a similar time…Radio host Ray Hadley said three of the protesters who ­attached themselves to the Brisbane streets were welfare recipients, and argued that the benefit should be removed […]



Mr Dutton said the community needed to “push back” against the “unacceptable” behaviour seen by those in the recent protest action.



“People should take these names and the photos of these people and distribute them as far and wide as they can so that we shame these people,” he said. “Let their families know what you think of their behaviour.”



As Chris Delforce, loon-in-chief for anti-farming nutters “Aussie Farms” – notorious for publishing the home addresses of Australian farmers – has found, it’s not so nice when the boot is on the other foot.

As confrontation looms over Washington and Beijing, it is critical to identify the true nature of this challenge from an international relations perspective before any attempt to devise a counter measure. Wrong presumptions or prejudicial interpretations may lead to dire consequences of unforeseeable magnitude. One past example would be the U.S. government’s belief that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) before the American invasion in 2003. A more current example would be the American nuclear anxiety on North Korea and how President Trump bypassed conventional American strategic thinking and circumvented hawkish threats of preemptive nuclear annihilation to resolve a “draconian crisis” via “smart diplomacy.” These examples may shed light on a pathway to resolution for the current U.S.-China trade conflict.



The United States and China have ample experience of weathering a crisis on the brink of war, whether it was on the Korean Peninsula or in Indochina. China today remains on the U.S. sanctions list for certain high‐​tech products and military equipment. Both the Trump administration and Congress continue to criticize China regularly, ranging from human rights to religious rights, from the rule of law to the autocratic political system, from the state‐​owned banks to restrictive market access to foreign corporations, and from currency manipulation to unfair trade practices.



Recently, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson spoke in Singapore about a growing consensus in the U.S. establishment that views China “not just as a strategic challenge to the United States but as a country whose rise has come at America’s expense.” He warned that the arguments raised by many influential voices for the “decoupling” of the two economies, which have also fueled a new consensus in Washington that China is not just a strategic competitor but a “major long‐​term adversary,” will not be going away anytime soon. After reflecting on a decade of tough‐​minded but cooperative interaction with Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan since the 2008 financial crisis, Paulson stated that he now sees the prospect of an “Economic Iron Curtain” (Paulson 2018).



It wasn’t so long ago that the two nations were working together to ensure the world functioned properly, including the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, and the six‐​party talks on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. In fact, further in the past, the two nations even worked together to contain the Soviet Union. It is difficult to imagine that, after just a few years, one change of government would lead to the current state of friction — with decoupling becoming a major topic among Washington elites, while the FBI and national security agencies are considering restrictions on university and immigration policies to keep Chinese students from studying science and engineering in the United States. If these ludicrous ideas are being bandied about, talks of the two nations spiraling into a new Cold War may no longer seem unimaginable.



There is no doubt that the United States and China are in a state of strengthening competition; denying the potential repercussion is like not seeing an elephant in the room. However, is war or decoupling the only option? Even those who normally advocate force to compel compliance should think twice in this case about alternatives or consequential outcomes. China is not Nazi Germany, certainly not the Soviet Union, and has no place on the so‐​called Axis of Evil that President George W. Bush used to describe North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and other governments that sponsored terrorism. No other label would justify the hostility toward China, a competitor/​partner in economics and politics of more than 40 years. The outdated American framework of thinking of countries as either adversaries or alliance partners no longer fits, especially in the case of China. It is time to heed Paulson’s advice that the stakes for the world are higher than ever before, therefore “we need to craft a new framework that works for today’s world, not the world of the past” (Paulson 2018).



The current state of U.S.-China relations weighs heavily on people from all sectors, including politicians, businessmen, and ordinary consumers. Most would define the current impasse as historical, with unpredictable outcomes, as friction may lead to direct conflict.



China and the United States are two nations with very different ideologies, demographics, social structures, economic development patterns, and power projections based on very distinct global outlooks. It is inevitable that they would need to address clashes in viewpoints with more intensity and deliberation. The outcome could lead to either conflict or partnership between two distinctive development models. Contemplating conflict may ultimately lead to war, with the current trade war only a reminder of a much graver situation. Maneuvering the differences toward partnership would ultimately require intelligent people, and it would lead to a peaceful resolution given time.



China and the United States are in different stages of development, and their ideological perspectives clash. Unfortunately, President Trump overlooks these key distinctions and focuses simply on the balance of trade and the size of the bilateral deficit with China. He thinks in terms of a zero‐​sum game, with one winner (China) and one loser (America). Moreover, he sees the trade imbalance as a threat to U.S. national security. Is this the proper path to examine trade and the overall relationship of two major world powers? Clearly not!



China will soon become the world’s largest economic power in terms of GDP in manufacturing and trade, mainly due to the size of its population. Is China then becoming a threat? Only if the American leaders would like to blindly believe so, or worse, if politicians twist China’s image into the “evil empire.” GDP or trade figures do not accurately represent the actual size of wealth or even power, they merely illustrate that there are many hard‐​working Chinese. As there are four times more people to feed in China than in the United States, intelligent people would notice the rather “unproductiveness” of the Chinese people on a per capita basis.



Henry Kissinger (2011) has dedicated an entire book on China appropriately named _On China_. However, in a previous book focused on U.S. foreign policy published just before the 9/11 attacks, he mentioned China only twice in passing (Kissinger 2001). I asked him then why he left out China in summarizing America’s world outlook. He brushed that aside and simply noted that it might not have been the right time to do so. Yet, if that was not the right time then, was it when President Obama in his 2010 State of the Union address declared that he did not “accept second place for the United States,” or when he announced his “Pivot to Asia” strategy and the establishment of the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP)? Was it the right time when President Trump declared his trade war on China after abandoning the TPP? The rise of China is real, and it will not be stopped. Americans need to examine China’s rise positively and devise comprehensive strategies accordingly, in order to manage the coming new world order.



The rise of China does not necessarily mean the fall of the United States. Indeed, to assume that China’s rise will necessarily be accompanied by America’s decline is inaccurate, if not ignorant — especially by using simply trade and GDP figures for calculation and analysis. Many Americans did not foresee the rise of China, but to further that error by accusing China of intentional diversion would be irresponsible. Even if Americans had become aware of China’s rise earlier, any attempt to repress it would have been futile, just as America’s rise was inevitable, even if the Japanese fantasized that an attack on Pearl Harbor would hold off the United States from the war in Asia.



China’s economic rise will remain the greatest challenge to America for coming generations. How should the United States prepare for it? I believe it is essential to confront the challenges with honesty and openness, and to manage the generational challenges with confidence, strength and perseverance — just as the Chinese did when they were challenged, even humiliated and defeated, in the past two centuries. The Chinese people complained about the West and Japan’s invasion and occupation. However, they also spent time and effort on introspection to recognize their own mistakes and weaknesses and then sought to strengthen their country’s defense through military modernization. China did not exploit others in the process of growing its economy. As the _Analects_ state: “The man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.”1



The economic rise of China should not be perceived as a threat, just as the rise of the United States at the turn of the 20th century was not a threat to Great Britain, Europe, or anyone else. Only to those who would compare China to Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union would the future seem perilous. Zbigniew Brzezinski saw China’s aspiration to world power as “neither revolutionary nor messianic nor Manichean” (Brzezinski 2012: 78–79). He believed that China saw “the rapid decline of America’s global primacy would produce a global crisis that would devastate China’s own well‐​being and damage its long‐​range prospects.”



Trade with China should not be perceived as a threat. U.S. consumers of final and intermediate goods have benefited from China’s opening to the outside world. Imports from China have widened the range of choices open to U.S. citizens and motivated more efficient production at home. Moreover, focusing on bilateral trade deficits diverts attention from the underlying weaknesses of the U.S. policy regime, in particular the unsustainable long‐​run fiscal deficits driven by rapid growth in entitlement spending, the unnecessary rise in defense spending, and tax cuts. The United States should seriously consider economic structural reform instead of empty talk by politicians. The worst threat would be to believe that there is nothing wrong in the U.S. economy or that American problems are caused by unscrupulous foreigners.



The “Belt and Road Initiative” is an attempt to strengthen other economies so that China can benefit economically and foster peace in the greater region. I believe the fundamental premise of western economic thinking is not a zero‐​sum theory, and trade serves as an important lever. Any economically motivated region would have a better chance of fostering peace among members that trade with each other than an isolated country with a significant wealth gap with its neighbors.



Trade works in different ways at different times with different products and among different traders. Either negotiations or war tactics can be used to resolve trade conflicts. In a civilized world, negotiations are the only path forward. The negotiations approach to settle trade disputes between the United States and China has worked well up to now and will likely prevail in the future.



Many authorities argue that the United States is ideologically committed to its liberal capitalist system. However, they do not want to openly admit that the United States is also driven by power, national interest, and world leadership. The obsession in Washington to hold on to the solo superpower status and the fear of losing absolute power have created this current zealous guardian of American national interest. Yet it is counterproductive to hyperinflate U.S. leadership via military and economic might or even the poorly defined “soft power.” The fate of the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and even Imperial China should serve as warning to those who indulge in the dreams of an American empire. Indeed, the size of an economy, dominant position of its currency, industrial strength, supremacy of its technology, military budgetary resources, or the size of a nuclear arsenal have never bestowed the crown on a superpower. As Brzezinski (2012: 2–3) once warned, America simply cannot “retreat into an ignorant garrison‐​state mentality or wallow in self‐​righteous cultural hedonism” just when the world needs guidance on how to engage with the “new East.”



The influence of North Korea and Israel are good cases for the United States to reexamine its definition of power. They are both small nations enclosed in a hostile environment. With political and strategic shrewdness, they have become regional powers that maintain geopolitical balance in the best interest of their own survival. If we look back in history, the fragility of the Soviet Union seemed unfathomable, but its strong military force was defeated in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, in 1969, China, with a very weak economy, had a border clash with the Soviet Union prior to President Nixon’s first visit to Beijing in 1972, and the United States sought out China to jointly counter the Soviet threat. These historical events are clear illustrations that the notion of a superpower needs to be reexamined if not redefined. The 2008 financial crisis struck when the United States was the world’s only superpower. America’s superpower status did not prevent the 9/11 attacks, nor did it allow the United States to achieve an easy victory in Afghanistan and Syria. Likewise, the United States did not successfully prevent North Korea from developing its nuclear capability, nor prevent Crimea from becoming a part of Russia. The superpower status conundrum needs to be reexamined.



The largest structural issue between China and the United States is the American obsession with its superpower status and the size of China’s population. With President Trump and the many ideologues around him, such obsession could intensify as they prepare to confront a large population of 1.4 billion on the rise.



Americans failed to recognize the economic rise of China when it was so evident. Indeed, the United States gets blindsided often, such as with the rise of India and Africa. China is only the first of a whole string of emerging economies that the United States will likely have to cope with in the coming decades. As early as 1997, Brzezinski declared, “America is not only the first, as well as the only, truly global superpower, but it is also likely to be the very last” (Brzezinski (1997: 209). This realization represents an opportunity for economic growth and possibly a more harmonious world, rather than the end of something great. Power never represents greatness, even if we would welcome the humbling of one nation with the emergence of many. A wrong assessment could give rise to costly consequences and derail the trajectory of a great nation.



Most Americans know about the Cold War and how it ended. Our world does not need another one. China is not the Soviet Union, and the United States is also not the same 30 years later. China-U.S. trade and people‐​to‐​people relationships are in no way comparable to the Cold War. Unfortunately, there are politicians on both sides who cultivate fear for their short‐​term advantages. The populist movement in the West is where concern should be focused, and the October 2018 speech by Vice President Pence on China is unfortunately a highly debated illustration (see Pence 2018). Americans should remember how the wrath of McCarthyism harmed its country after WWII and recall the lessons learned from wars fought based on ideology. After many years of instability in Muslim nations caused by the Arab Spring and the continuing war in Syria, there is clearly no victory in sight for American interest. Vietnam remains governed by the communist party and is trading with the United States, after so much money spent and so many Americans killed during the war. North Korea remains after so many decades of conflict, and the U.S. president is still working hard to contain its threat.



No matter what happens to the current trade conflict, the United States and China are going to thrive in the next few decades. They will witness other powers emerge, and possibly challenge whatever dominant position they hold by then. _We should not see such rising powers as a threat, but as an economic opportunity._ Without such external stimulus, we may become complacent; just like what happened to imperial China two centuries earlier, when Great Britain used its gunboats to open up the Chinese market for opium trade, Americans believe China is overtaking them in terms of wealth. However, threat and challenge are not easily differentiated. It is also important not to mistake economic or containable geopolitical challenge as strategic threat and, in turn, overreact in military terms — the Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Syrian Civil War are examples. Russia is clearly less a threat to the world compared to the Soviet Union. Maybe American strategic thinkers should devise an alternative framework with which to view its relationship with President Putin instead of narrowly identifying him as an expansionist.



In his latest book, titled _World Order_ , Kissinger declared, “The reconstruction of the international system is the ultimate challenge to statesmanship in our time,” and “the affirmation of America’s exceptional nature must be sustained” (Kissinger 2014: 371, 373). Hank Paulson also spoke of the negative consequences if the United States and China fail to find a consensus: failure would lead to “systemic risk of monumental proportions — not just to the global economy, as I dealt with, but to international order as we know it and to world peace” (Paulson 2018). Such risk could only be managed if Washington and Beijing provide “strong and wise leadership.”



War and conflict are not solutions to many problems of our time. We may no longer have great wars such as WWI and WWII, but the so‐​called small wars are still causing great sadness to millions of people and families. It is important to properly define the differences we are confronted with, and identify ways to resolve them, so that this world can be more harmonious. President Trump and President Xi have taken a great step forward at the G20 in Buenos Aires, when they agreed to resolve differences between the two countries through dialogue. They also interrupted any further escalation of trade tariffs in order to give negotiations an opportunity to work out. The current trade war between the two largest economies has already damaged the growth dynamics in the world. It is crucial that they manage to contain their economic differences and prevent the world from moving toward another recession.



Both China and the United States are great countries. Such greatness is not the result of their military strength or wealth. The American elite on foreign policy must not indulge in the self‐​fulfilling prophecy about America’s abstract greatness. True greatness can be achieved only after it withstands the test of history.



In the past, China suffered great humiliation under Western imperialism. In the search for its role and identity in the modern age, China also suffered greatly from civil wars, economic confusion, and human disaster caused by policy failure, which was best illustrated by Mao’s Cultural Revolution. Only when the Chinese leadership and elites reckoned with these past failures did reform begin. During the past 40 years, China has achieved great success in reforming the economy and promoting a higher standard of living and has gained respect from the international community. It is not difficult to learn from history, but lessons will be difficult if we resist the call of history. Both the leaders of China and of the United States clearly have enough intelligence to know when the time has come to heed the call for peaceful development.

"NICOSIA, Cyprus  —   As the United Nations geared up for negotiations that it declared the “best and last chance” to unite Cyprus after more than four decades of acrimonious division, Russia’s ambassador attended a seminar dedicated to derailing any prospect of an agreement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The presence of the ambassador, Stanislav Osadchiy, delighted   Greek Cypriot politicians in Nicosia, the capital of the   south of the divided island. They had helped torpedo a 2004 reunification plan supported by the United States and have now rallied together to defeat a new push for a settlement that began on Jan. 12 with an international conference in Geneva. But Mr. Osadchiy’s attendance at the seminar, which Western and other diplomats shunned, angered Nicos Anastasiades, the   president of the Republic of Cyprus and a strong supporter of efforts to resolve an interethnic dispute as intractable and nearly as protracted as the   conflict. In an interview in Nicosia, Mr. Anastasiades said that, when questioned, the ambassador had apologized and said he had misunderstood the nature of the seminar, despite its clear   agenda and the fact that it had been organized by five small political parties all bitterly opposed to a compromise deal in Geneva. The president said he accepted the ambassador’s explanation and his insistence that he had not meant to endorse the   rejectionists by attending. But, Mr. Anastasiades added, “I consider any intervention by any third country as not what we are looking for. ” Like countless previous diplomatic efforts to reunite Cyprus since Turkey invaded in 1974 and split the country in two, the recent Geneva talks failed to achieve a breakthrough, though they did make some progress. Mr. Anastasiades said the two sides were “halfway” to an agreement but still had deep divisions, notably on the issue of whether Turkey, Greece and Britain, the former colonial master, should retain their status as “guarantors” of the island’s security, a setup that Russia rejects. Bound to Russia by a shared Orthodox Christian faith and its role as a financial and banking center for Russian business, the Republic of Cyprus, the   nation in the south of the island, has long looked to Moscow as a protector rather than a troublemaker. But accusations that Moscow intervened to skew the United States presidential election and supported   forces across Europe have stirred a wave of alarm about Russia in the European Union, of which the Republic of Cyprus is a member. This alarm, which Russia dismisses as Russophobic hysteria, has given new force to voices in Cyprus warning that Russia’s geopolitical interests have made it determined to upset a Cyprus settlement. Makarios Drousiotis, a   researcher who has long bucked   sentiment in Cyprus and sought to expose what he sees as Russian meddling, said events in the United States and Europe were shaking his compatriots’ view that Moscow had only their best interests at heart. “What they have been doing in America and Europe they have been doing for 50 years in Cyprus,” said Mr. Drousiotis, who in 2014 published a book, “The Cyprus Crisis and the Cold War,” that demolished what he called a   “myth” that the West is to blame for Turkey’s 1974 invasion of the island and the decades of division that followed. The book, denounced by Russia’s diplomatic mission in Nicosia as “politically unacceptable,” portrayed Moscow as a duplicitous partner that had for decades used disinformation, front organizations and other tools of subterfuge to woo support among   while working behind the scenes to stoke tensions to ensure that Cyprus never aligned too firmly with the West or became a NATO member. To Moscow’s fury, this once taboo view that Russia wants to block a settlement has in recent weeks been discussed openly in some Cypriot media outlets. The Cyprus Mail, for example, described Russia’s ambassador, Mr. Osadchiy, as “the darling” of   forces “because he regularly says things aimed at undermining the talks or making the pursuit of a deal more difficult. ” Maria Zakharova, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said Moscow was “surprised by the   comments in the Cyprus media” and accused the media of creating “a smoke screen for the real problems that need to be tackled as part of the Cypriot settlement. ” Mr. Drousiotis said the Russian ambassador’s apparent support for   rejectionist politicians ahead of the Geneva talks fit a long, but previously mostly ignored, pattern. “Every time there has been an attempt to solve the Cyprus issue, the Russians have jumped in to block a settlement,” Mr. Drousiotis said. A solution in Cyprus would end a deep rift within NATO between Turkey and Greece, both members, and open the way to the development of large gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean that could upset the grip of Gazprom, Russia’s   energy giant, on the Turkish market. Turkey imports nearly 99 percent of its natural gas, more than half from Russia, its biggest supplier by far. Gas from Egyptian, Israeli and Cypriot fields in the Mediterranean would be cheaper than supplies from Gazprom, but it has little chance of reaching Turkish consumers so long as arguments over territorial waters and other matters between Greek and Turkish Cypriots obstruct the development of pipelines. In 2004, ahead of a referendum in Cyprus on whether to accept a reunification plan proposed by Kofi Annan, who was the secretary general of the United Nations at the time, Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution relating to security arrangements on the island that all other Council members supported. Hopes for the   Annan plan then took another big blow when AKEL, the influential   communist party in southern Cyprus, dropped its previous support and, on the eve of the referendum, urged voters to reject the plan, as did the Orthodox Church. In the end, the north voted to accept the plan, while voters in the south rejected it. Yet another international effort collapsed after hackers penetrated the United Nations computer system and, in 2009, leaked emails and documents to a   Cypriot newspaper. Some of the documents were doctored in a way that inflamed   fears of any settlement. The United Nations concluded that only a foreign intelligence service could have orchestrated such an operation. Mr. Anastasiades, speaking at the presidential palace in Nicosia, said that his country counted Russia as a friend, but that it had to take care not to give fuel to those who questioned Russia’s intentions, as the ambassador did by attending the seminar. Russia has responded angrily to accusations that it has been working against its own stated policy in favor of a Cyprus solution. Vladimir A. Chizhov, Russia’s ambassador to the European Union, issued a scathing statement on Jan. 13 to denounce what he called “preposterous” reports that Russia wanted to block a settlement. “Evidently,   hysteria is becoming contagious. Overzealous fighters of the (dis) information front are working day and night trying to implicate Russia in all sorts of problems, including those that are the direct result of shortsighted and arrogant policies of others,” Mr. Chizhov, a veteran diplomat who earlier served at the embassy in Nicosia, said in the statement. Harry Tzimitras, director of the Nicosia branch of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said many obstacles blocked a settlement irrespective of Russia, notably the gulf between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on the issue of whether the Turkish military should be allowed to keep troops on the island after reunification. “The fundamental mistrust” between the two sides, Mr. Tzimitras said, is the main reason for the failure of decades of diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement. “In Cyprus, you rarely fight facts,” he said. “You fight perceptions and ghosts. ” All the same, he added, some think that Russia has many reasons, despite its public position, to want the island to stay divided. “In this view, the status quo is working very well for Russia,” Mr. Tzimitras said. “They don’t want it disrupted. ” Aside from strengthening NATO and damaging Gazprom, a reunification deal would deliver a success to the United States, whose diplomats have been particularly active in trying to prod Greece, Turkey and their ethnic kin in Cyprus toward an agreement. Mr. Anastasiades said the main obstacle to a solution was Turkey, whose increasingly autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, recently said Turkish troops must be allowed to stay in Cyprus “forever. ” Mr. Anastasiades has forged good relations with the leader of   northern Cyprus, Mustafa Akinci, but, he said, “the solution does not depend on the Turkish Cypriots but on Ankara’s will. ” The issue of troops is tightly connected with another big hurdle  —   demands by Mr. Anastasiades, urged on by Russia, that Turkey, Greece and Britain be stripped of their role as guarantors. Moscow has long wanted to scrap this system, continuing a   policy that was based in part on its desire to weaken the role of Britain, a NATO member that has military bases and a listening post in Cyprus. Mr. Anastasiades said it was up to Mr. Erdogan to decide what he wanted. “His rhetoric is that he is in favor, but what remains to be seen is whether in practice he is supporting a solution,” Mr. Anastasiades said. As for Russia and the United States, Mr. Anastasiades said, Cyprus understands “the games superpowers play. ” “We want the support of everyone who can give support,” he added. “It is a matter of survival. ”"
"Record-breaking sunshine has encouraged midsummer butterflies to emerge unusually early, with dozens of species appearing a month before their usual flight season. Butterflies that usually fill meadows and woods in July, including the ringlet, the marbled white, dark green fritillary and the silver-washed fritillary have been widely spotted during the sunniest spring since records began in 1929.  Experts are hailing it as – so far – the best summer for butterflies in nearly 25 years, with an abundance of both common species such as the small heath and endangered ones such as the heath fritillary, a notoriously sedentary butterfly which this year is being found on new sites across Exmoor. Matthew Oates, the author of His Imperial Majesty: A Natural History of the Purple Emperor, a new book about the elusive Apatura iris, has seen 10 species earlier this year than during any other summer for the last 50 years. “Butterflies are climate and weather opportunists par excellence,” he said. “Don’t write a butterfly book – climate change will make it instantly out-of-date.” Oates has spotted the meadow brown, large blue, high brown fritillary, dark green fritillary, silver-washed fritillary, comma, ringlet, marbled white, silver-studded blue and purple hairstreak earlier than any season since he began recording butterflies in 1971. The early emergences are driven by warm dry weather, but global heating is causing drastic revisions to butterfly flight seasons. The purple hairstreak and the gatekeeper – both usually July butterflies – emerged this week. Only three of Britain’s 59 native butterfly species have yet to take flight, according to Butterfly Conservation: the chalkhill blue, the brown hairstreak and the purple emperor. The latter was once rarely seen before 1 July, but despite the weather turning unsettled this week the species is expected to beat its earliest-ever sighting of 10 June 1893, when pupils at Marlborough College caught one in woods beside the school. In the 1980s, the treetop-dwelling purple emperor was confined to woods in the home counties but, according to Oates’s study, climate change – and new spotting techniques – have led to the previously overlooked iridescent purple insect being discovered across the Midlands and East Anglia. Oates predicts it will be seen this year for the first time in decades in Wales, Herefordshire and Shropshire and possibly in Yorkshire, where it has never before been recorded. Many species, including the Essex skipper and marbled white, are moving northwards with global heating. Butterflies may appear to be booming in the short-term but some species’ life cycles risk falling out of sync with the plants that their caterpillars depend upon for food. Oates said: “I worry that the purple emperor can get out of sync with a growth phase in sallow leaves. If we have an early spring followed by a weather collapse, the caterpillars perish – but the hard science needs doing on this.” With butterflies emerging so early, many species could go on to have a second or third brood in the autumn. This is not necessarily a boon for some because it can create a “developmental trap” with the autumn butterflies’ offspring unable to cycle through egg and caterpillar stages so late in the year. According to Oates, the demise of the wall brown butterfly is linked to a late brood in which the species’ offspring die off as winter sets in. This summer is proving good for butterflies so far because it follows two hot, sunny summers, allowing their numbers to build up over the seasons. “Truly great butterfly years are the third good summer in a row – so the abundance of butterflies of in 1976 was helped by fine summers in 74 and 75,” said Oates. “This century we’ve had good summers in 03, 06, 09, and 2013 but not three in a row. If we get a sequence we could be in business. But if the jet stream has suddenly jumped south and we’ve got six to eight weeks of rubbish weather then that won’t happen and we could have had our summer – it was called lockdown.”"

Seventy-five years ago authoritarian bullies determined to ‘unite’ Europe under the banners of collectivism and identity politics were, thankfully, defeated. The cost was horrendous, but so were the stakes. When the forces of tyranny were defeated, “Never again” was the watch-cry.



 **Except…**



20 years ago, genocide again reared its ugly head on European soil. For all its self-proclaimed moral superiority, the EU did nothing to stop it. Now, 75 years after V.E. Day, an authoritarian “United States of Europe” ideology is once again turning out the lights of freedom on the continent – and its bigger, uglier sibling seeks to impose the same dictatorial stamp on the entire globe.



In the West today, there are no obvious Hitlers or Stalins. Rather, **faceless globalists** work the corridors of the multiple United ­Nations agencies and the Euro­pean Commission to project and **amplify their socialist ideology.** They promote an ever-growing list of evils that is uncritically ­embraced by Western teaching ­institutions, the mainstream media and the courts […]



Testament to the influence of the corridor ideologues is the spectacle of Western children parading fear, self-loathing and guilt. “Capitalism kills”, “Revolution is our only hope”, they protest. Socialism is their utopia.



It’s not as if these ignorant children can claim to have forgotten the lessons of the past record of dismal socialist failures: socialism is spectacularly failing once again in Venezuela.



But, it’s no surprise that children are being so rigorously indoctrinated: education has been easily the most successful victory for the [Long March through the Institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_long_march_through_the_institutions).



There is a pattern here that suggests central planning. **After all, is it likely the simultaneous denigration of white men, the deprivation of free speech, the politics of climate change, the push for open borders, the sharp rise in anti-Semitism and the demonisation of Christianity could be random?** Call it guided ideological collaboration but it is imported from somewhere and is anything but spontaneous.



Trump is not the first president to see the suffocating hand of unelected elites stifling freedom. What Eisenhower called the “military-industrial complex” is what today is called, variously, the “Deep State” and “the Swamp”.



When Trump won in 2016, commentator Scott Adams warned that, when you set out to drain a swamp, the snakes and alligators get angry and you get swamp water on your pants. The nomenklatura jealously guards its privileges, as the vicious resistance to Brexit shows.



Trump’s “America first” policies have invigorated globalists within the US establishment. As the presidential election draws nearer and fears of his re-election grow, an unprecedented three-year crusade to impeach him has stepped up a gear. In their eagerness to topple this legitimately elected president, the Democrats, the intelligence ser­vices and the mainstream media have colluded to form what is ­effectively a partisan, hostile branch of government within the governing administration.



Yet, despite having their heads firmly wedged up each others’ arses, singing their own praises into their empty vessels, globalists are too often everything they purport to decry.



Globalists argue their mission is noble because it has a higher purpose. Only a common multilateral approach can achieve true diversity, inclusiveness, social justice and wealth and income equality. Yet, their claims are not supported by evidence. In Europe, indeed across the Western world, political polarisation has intensified.



Instances of identity politics, social division and censorship are on the rise. And […] **globalists are architects of much inequality.** It is their ­seductive cocktail of corporate welfare, regulatory protection and co-ordinated monetary policies that has created extensive wealth and privilege opportunities that crony capitalists fiercely defend.



As [Mark Steyn has said](https://www.steynonline.com/7789/the-midnight-train), globalists “don’t see it because they get the full deal: an increasing share of the wealth, with the cultural benefits of great restaurants and cheap nannies…these people do not live in the world they have built for their subjects”. They really think “socialism will work this time,” because it’s worked so well for **them**. Just as it did for the tiny elite of Soviet nomenklatura.



The tendency is always to hope this time it’s different.



Or to feel powerless, or deluded into believing it’s not what it seems. Like a slow-growing cancer, it’s easy to dismiss the first suspicious signs. Nevertheless, the existence of Western civilisation is not preordained and its survival requires more courage, confidence and determination than is presently in evidence. The longer ­apathy prevails, the nearer the road to serfdom becomes. As Churchill warned, for every day’s delay, how much harder the toil?

"TEHRAN  —   With Iran calibrating how to deal with President Trump, its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, caustically thanked the new American leader on Tuesday for revealing “the true face” of the United States. “We are thankful to this newcomer,” Ayatollah Khamenei told Iranian Air Force commanders, according to a report posted on his official website. Iranian officials had been showing caution since Mr. Trump took office last month. Despite expressing anger at his policies and comments, even   have taken care not to provoke the new American president. But on Tuesday, it became seemingly apparent to Iran’s leaders that Mr. Trump is not easily ignored. After Ayatollah Khamenei spoke out sarcastically about Mr. Trump, others expressed worries. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in an interview with a local newspaper that he expected “difficult times ahead” for Iran, now that Mr. Trump was in charge. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, defended the nuclear agreement between his country and six world powers, including the United States, by saying that the deal was “ ” for all. But Mr. Trump  —   who has described the nuclear agreement as “really, really bad” but has not made any moves to alter it  —   disparaged Iran again on Twitter, this time in a defense against criticism that he is too close to Russia and its leader, President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Trump wondered how President Barack Obama could have made a nuclear agreement with Iran, a country Mr. Trump described as “#1 in terror. ” Mr. Trump seemed to be summarizing comments by his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, who on Sunday called Iran the “biggest sponsor of state terrorism. ” Many Iranians have expressed astonishment and ridicule at such assertions, pointing to terrorist groups that despise Iran and the West. First Al Qaeda, responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and more recently the Islamic State, which has been killing thousands in the Middle East and is responsible for committing and inspiring attacks in Europe and the United States. “Trump is trying to corner Iran, to make us bow before the U. S. and change our behavior, or face confrontation,” said Nader Karimi Joni, a political activist close to Mr. Rouhani’s government. Mr. Trump included Iran on  a list of seven predominantly Muslim countries whose citizens have been barred from entering the United States under an executive order that has been blocked, for now, in the American court system. Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, warned Tehran last week that it had been put “on notice” after an Iranian missile test. Washington imposed new economic sanctions on 25 people and entities after the missile launch, which Mr. Flynn said had violated a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution approved after the United States and other world powers reached an agreement with Iran on its nuclear program. Iran has asserted that its missile tests do not violate that resolution and fall within its rights to  . In another possible move against Iran, Mr. Trump’s advisers are debating an order intended to designate its Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, according to current and former officials in the United States briefed on the deliberations. For Ayatollah Khamenei, Mr. Trump’s ascent appears to have vindicated many suspicions harbored by the Iranian leader, who has said many times that the United States cannot be trusted. “He has proven what we have been saying for more than 30 years  —   we would always speak about the political, economic, moral and social corruption in the U. S. administration  —   this man revealed it during the election campaign and since then,” Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to a translated text of the speech. Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst close to Iran’s leaders, said Mr. Trump’s “threatening and ranting” style reflected a miscalculation of Iran’s power. “He will soon realize Iran will not be intimidated,” Mr. Taraghi said. The history of animosity between both countries is long and deep. Several American administrations, including Mr. Obama’s, have argued for years that Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, because of its support for the Lebanese Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which the United States regards as terrorist organizations. Iran has also been held responsible by the United States for several terror attacks, most decades ago. One of them, of course, was the seizure of 54 members of the American Embassy staff in Tehran for 444 days during the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Iran also has been accused of involvement in a 1983 bomb attack at a Marines barracks in Lebanon, where 241 service personnel died. In 2003, a federal judge ruled that Hezbollah carried out the attack at the behest of Iran. Several judges have ordered Iran to pay billions of dollars in damages. Iran denies the accusations. Iran has pressed several claims against the United States. Iran holds the United States responsible for having supported Saddam Hussein with intelligence, funds and weapons after he attacked Iran in 1980, dragging both countries into a   war where thousands of Iranians and Iraqis died. In 1988, an American naval vessel, the Vincennes, shot down an Iran Air commercial plane, flying over the Persian Gulf to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. All 290 people aboard died. Iran called the attack deliberate and the United States called it a mistake. Under a settlement at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the United States offered no apologies and was ordered to pay around $60 million in damages to families of the victims. Some of Mr. Trump’s top aides apparently view Iran and its clerical leaders as a leading source of evil. During his inaugural speech, Mr. Trump vowed to “unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the Earth. ” At the time, many thought he meant the Islamic State, but in books and speeches both Mr. Flynn and Mr. Mattis said Iran was radically Islamic and described the country as the biggest threat to peace in the Middle East. In a Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump said: “Iran is playing with fire  —   they don’t appreciate how ‘kind’ President Obama was to them. Not me!” Ayatollah Khamenei responded to Mr. Trump’s Friday posting in biting fashion with his own remarks on Twitter. “Iran should’ve appreciated Obama!” he wrote, adding, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State: “How come? Appreciate him for #DAESH, war in Iraq Syria or public support for 2009 unrest?” In a   post, he said that Iranians would hold a rally on Friday, the 38th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, to show “their position toward threats. ”"
"The IPCC’s latest climate change report has made it clear that global temperature rises will be the cause of more extreme weather events around the world. Indeed, weather disasters increasingly provoke the question: “Was this event (directly) caused by anthropogenic climate change?” – as was the case with the flooding that struck the UK this winter. Although this question is scientifically interesting and important for long-term climate forecasting and measuring how humans are influencing the planet, the answers require many months of research. Answering the question of whether or not an extreme weather event is caused by climate change is also not necessarily helpful for preventing such disasters from happening again. Powerful and potentially damaging storms occurred before we evolved onto this planet, and such storms would still occur even if all emissions of greenhouse gases were stopped tomorrow.  This admission does not negate the reality of man-made climate change, just that extreme weather does not demonstrate climate change in the same way that increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere or increasing global average temperatures over time do. Reducing emissions and stabilising the climate for future generations remains the priority, but these should not take place at the expense of developing resilience to individual weather events. Rather, both need urgent attention.  For many types of extreme weather events (windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, thunderstorms), their projected increases over time due to anthropogenic climate change is much smaller than the year-to-year variability in their occurrences. For example, a report from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton concluded that the maximum intensity of hurricanes would increase by only about 5% by 2100. Plus, detecting any trend in the observations would not be possible for several more decades because many more years of data will be required to see any climate trends over the noise of fluctuations in the weather. From this perspective, there is little to be gained by conflating extreme weather events and climate change. Society should reduce its impact on the planet, but it should also take steps to protect itself from weather disasters.  Each year, hurricanes sweep their way up America’s Atlantic coast and this annual event must be planned for accordingly in the areas that will be hit. Similiarly, flooding has historically happened in Somerset.  Recognising this reality is key to reducing the potential damages.  Weather resilience includes making sensible planning decisions such as building away from floodplains and other vulnerable locations. By framing weather disasters as a result of a changing climate, decision-makers may risk otherwise sensible policies as not imperative for action. Or, political differences may lead to sensible action being thwarted.  Consider the $1 billion Climate Resilience Fund proposed in the US by Barack Obama. The reasons given in its announcement were: “A changing climate means that weather-related disasters like droughts, wildfires, storms, floods are potentially going to be costlier and they’re going to be harsher.” This kind of reasoning runs the risk of being rejected by climate change sceptics. If it was a “Weather Resilience Fund”, then the proposal might have a better chance of surviving the Republican House of Representatives. The fund’s aim to “better understand the projected impacts of climate change” gives sceptics more reason to doubt the project, even though much of the focus would be on combating extreme, regularly occurring weather events. Clearly this is something both sides of the aisle would rally behind. Investments in building resilience and weather preparedness is a no-regret policy that might also have benefits at mitigating against climate change. By becoming more resilient to weather events, we also put the focus on adapting to specific geographical threats locally where people live. For example, planting more trees in cities or painting roofs lighter colours to offset the urban heat island will also lead to reduced air-conditioning costs. In turn, this reduces carbon emissions and produces a benefit to the local weather and global climate. Also, strategies like building outside of the floodplain will reduce the carbon emissions from rebuilding when disaster inevitably strikes. There is no single quick-fix or single-cause solution to the problem of human vulnerability to environmental changes. Nor will we ever be able to mitigate completely against natural disasters. The first step is recognising that looking for solutions to weather disasters by addressing climate change is not necessarily the best use of resources. But, there are sensible approaches that can be implemented now to address both."
"PARIS  —   First it was the Netherlands. After President Trump vowed to put “American first,” a Dutch television show made a satirical case for why the president should consider its country second. Now, the race for   has spread. Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland have all joined in with videos that capture the president’s trademark bombast, demonstrating a rare case of European unity through satire  —   and  . In the Dutch video, a     runs through a list of the country’s hallmarks and traditions that may pique Mr. Trump’s interest: the language, the tax code, the windmills and Black Pete, a contentious Christmas tradition in which Dutch people wear blackface. (“It’s the most offensive, the most racist thing you’ve ever seen,” the voice says. It adds: “You’ll love it. It’s great. ”) Arjen Lubach, a Dutch   host whose show, “Zondag met Lubach” (“Sunday With Lubach”) made the video that started the trend, said, “Because we realize it’s better for us to get along, we decided to introduce our tiny country to him in a way that will probably appeal to him the most. ” The     on this video belongs to a   American comedian named Greg Shapiro. “I’ve been working on the imitation for a while,” Mr. Shapiro said in a phone interview on Sunday from Paris. All it takes, he said, is repeating Mr. Trump’s interviews or tweets verbatim. “There’s hardly any heightening necessary,” he said. After the video went viral, Mr. Shapiro said, “it was nice having family from America send me these clips saying, ‘Oh, this is like Dutch and Trump.’ And I’d say, ‘Yeah, that’s my voice.’ My mom did recognize it. ” Mr. Shapiro, 48, has seen a bump on his YouTube channel, where he offers lessons in Trump impressions on his “United States of Europe” show and posted a spoof news conference on Monday, in which he impersonates the president. Germany’s video pleads its case  —   and expresses indignation that the Netherlands beat it to the idea. Its video lists Oktoberfest, the country’s experience with walls and Hitler, who, the video notes, “made Germany great again. ” “Germany wants to be second,” Jan Böhmermann, host of the talk show “Neo Magazin Royale,” said in the video. “Because we are strong, we are big, and who  —   if not us  —   deserves a third chance?” (Last year, Mr. Böhmermann’s satire of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan caused an international incident.) What did the Swiss think Mr. Trump would like about their country? The video championed the nation’s mountains (it’s not flat like the Netherlands) its nonmembership in the European Union and its cleanliness. It also said Mr. Trump, who was caught on video boasting about sexual assault, might appreciate the country’s history on women’s rights. “We also love to treat our women badly,” the Trump impersonator in its video said. “Love it. We didn’t let them vote until 1971. In some places, even until 1990. ” It added: “You love gold? We love gold. During World War II, the Jews gave it to us for safekeeping. They never returned  —   so strange  —   so we melted it, like fondue, our national dish. ” Portugal’s video noted that Portuguese has an untranslatable word, “saudade,” a combination of longing and nostalgia. “We can assure you that ‘saudade’ is something that billions of people are feeling right now about Barack Obama. ” It also jokes that its prime minister, António Costa, like Mr. Trump, came to power without winning the popular vote. “If you have any problems with Putin  —   which you will  —   immediately call António Costa,” it said. Belgium extended an olive branch to Mr. Trump in its video, agreeing with his comments last March that its capital, Brussels, was a “hellhole,” but urging him to check out the   north of the country. (It dismissed the French speaking south as “the Mexicans of Belgium” and told him to steer clear.) Denmark’s video, broadcast by the talk show “Natholdet” (“The Nightshift”) explained the difference between Danes and danishes, and cited Hans Christian Andersen, creator of beloved fairy tales, as a point in the country’s favor. “You have the Statue of Liberty, we have the Little Mermaid,” the video’s Trump impersonator said. “But don’t let the name fool you, O. K.? The Little Mermaid is actually pretty huge. ” In its video, Luxembourg boasted, “We have money, a lot of money,” adding: “And you know what, Mr. President? You don’t even have to pay taxes. None. Zero. Nada. Promise. ” Lithuania, a small Baltic country and NATO member that has been rattled by Mr. Trump’s fondness for Russia, attempted to win him over with its fast internet speed. “Just imagine how fast you can tweet when you have the fastest internet?” The video added that the Lithuanian president is a woman. “She probably rigged the election,” the   said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe general public is realizing that the climate data are showing nothing to be alarmed about. Depending on data study one looks at, global temperatures have stagnated 18 years (have even fallen over the last 10 years), sea level rise is decelerating, and again we are beginning to experience winters like we saw in the 1960s. Climate is cyclic.
So if the data aren’t at all worrisome, then what can be done to convey the message of grave concern and worry to the public? The latest stunt concocted by the imaginative minds of climate hysterics is posing before a camera and to put on the most concerned look they could possibly muster. It’s a black-and-white photography series dubbed “Scared Scientists” by Nick Bowers. Read here.
Climate propaganda has reached Orwellian dimensions.
These scientists have cooperated with a professional photographer to handle this project. Lower the lights, turn your head bit to the right. Don’t blink! Be more tense…imagine your funding is about to be eliminated – yes, perfect! Exactly the photo we want!
Yes, this is exactly the kind of worry they wanted to capture on camera – to convey their fright and worry over man-made climate change.
Just like they are trying to do their best to feign a climate catastrophe with carefully selected and posed data, the climate-alarmism centerfold scientists are now doing their utmost to feign alarmism.

Even other alarmist science journalists are skeptical of the stunt. For example David Appell at his site writes:
It looks as fake as it is, and it also comes across as emotional manipulation. Probably we should be emotional about climate change, but come on, no one sits around all day looking worried, as if their checking account is low and the rent’s past due.”
Moreover he adds:
Look for this to be widely mocked. I can’t honestly blame anyone if they do.”
This is not something to mock. Rather it is something to be very concerned about. These scientists are no longer capable of doing objective scientific work. They’ve succumbed to their emotions and the results of their work will be potentially entirely contaminated and thus untrustworthy.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMedia scientist Sebastian Vehlken: climate models have developed a life of their own, where hard measured data only disrupt
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Media scientist Dr. Sebastian Vehlken works on the theory and history of computer simulation, and studies crowd research and super-computing. In the radio show “Voices of the Sciences” he made very critical statements on computer models’ capability to make prognoses. Quentin Quencher put up a part of the interview at vimeo. In a blog posting at Glitzerwasser, Quencher sorted out an interesting part:
[Vehlken in interview]:
Computer simulations are not necessarily based on sound data that I then project. Here there is always the difference: projections are not prognoses. When I’m dealing with the future with respect to computer simulations, it’s always about generating projections, scenarios – which are always in plural. They are not the future in the system. Here, for example, we can look at climatology.
Recently there was a presentation at our institute. It was about, okay, the claim about climate models is always: ‘Your database isn’t broad enough.’ And then the scientist who made the presentation told us: ‘On one hand the simulators tells that the models run very well, and then we put in data from some sensor in Antarctica…and suddenly it just doesn’t fit.’  Why doesn’t it fit in? Often it’s because the sensor was defective, or the measured data are simply faulty. And so that means I often have systems that are hardly able to produce reliable data.
Yet, I need, so to say, models. And in the meantime, with 20 -30 years of climate research that are simulation-based, the models have become so complex that they have in a sense developed a life of their own – and sometimes measured data simply just disrupt them. In the models there at times assumptions that simply cannot be physically validated. That is they have articifical factors, parameterizations without end. For these there are no empirical databases for them. There is…a complex system..and then there is experimentation with this complex system, which is what my climate model is. And then one sees, okay, when I implement this parameter, which I don’t even know whether or not it really exists.”

In the comments that follows the blog article a friend of models comments and attempts to convince Quencher of their supposedly great use for them. Very amusing. Read for yourself.
==================================
At his Glitzerwasser site here, Quencher sums up what Vehlken says above:
In short, the models, especially the climate models, may be good tools but for making prognoses they are not worth anything, and the projections are fraught with so much uncertainty that they absolutely should not be used as a basis for making policy decisions.”

"Environmentalists cheered by huge improvements in air quality during the lockdown – and the collapse in coal power generation – have another reason to celebrate. Even the stock market has gone in their favour. A detailed number-crunching of environmentally sustainable funds has revealed that they have outperformed traditional funds across the board – beating them during the pandemic as well as during the 10 years up to and including the coronavirus sell-off.  The data, from the global research agency Morningstar, comes amid growing evidence that environmentally focused investing – once pigeonholed by City traditionalists as only for a vegan/hippy minority – is becoming mainstream. This week, Vanguard, one of the world’s biggest fund managers, launched two ethical index funds aimed at UK investors, while Aviva, Britain’s biggest insurer, unveiled a “climate transition” fund. Morningstar examined 745 sustainable funds and compared them against 4,150 traditional funds, and found they matched or beat returns in all categories – whether bonds or shares, UK or abroad. “Average returns and success rates for sustainable funds suggest that there is no performance trade-off associated with sustainable funds. In fact, a majority of sustainable funds have outperformed their traditional peers over multiple time horizons,” it says. Over 10 years, the average annual return for a sustainable fund invested in large global companies has been 6.9% a year, while a traditionally invested fund has made 6.3% a year. The outperformance continued during the coronavirus crisis. “In all but one category considered in the study, sustainable funds outperformed, with average excess returns in Q12020 ranging between 0.09% and 1.83% across categories,” Morningstar says. One reason may be that many US tech stocks, popular among environmental investors, have soared during the crisis, while shares in oil, gas and coal companies have plummeted. The Nasdaq index of US tech stocks has recovered completely from the coronavirus crisis, reaching new highs this week, while the oil giant ExxonMobil is trading at $53 compared with $70 before the lockdown. The Morningstar researchers noted that sustainable funds are longer-lasting than their peers. One of the tricks of the asset management industry is that funds that do badly are quietly removed – usually by merging them with another, better-performing fund. This has the effect of flattering the overall performance figures, suggesting that investors are doing better over the longer term than they really are. Morningstar found that three-quarters of sustainable funds lasted 10 years or more, compared with less than half of traditional funds. Campaigners welcomed the confirmation that sustainable funds are better. Michael Kind of ShareAction – a charity and company that promotes responsible investment – says: “It’s very positive, but also not surprising, to see that funds with robust environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies are overall better performers financially. We hear from savers very often that one of the biggest barriers to action is that there is a perception that you will lose out financially if you switch to investing responsibly.  “But is this enough? No … we would expect more ambitious and authentic ESG funds to deliver better outcomes for stakeholders and the environment but not inevitably to deliver investors more money every time.” Research what funds your pension/Isa/investment provider offers you. Look into the holdings and stewardship/investment policies of your funds, or those you are considering putting money in. These policies show how your asset manager will invest your money and try to influence companies on your behalf. You can either do this on your own or ask your investment (or pension) provider/employer/financial adviser for this information. It is important to see how your investment provider votes at the world’s largest companies’ AGMs. Are they voting for climate action and supporting human rights? ShareAction recently produced an independent global ranking of the most responsible asset managers across many topics. Use it to make an informed decision when selecting a manager. Use resources from organisations such as Climetrics, Boring Money and Good With Money."
"**England's new tiers system has started, but many are complaining areas with lower than average rates of infection have been unfairly put in high tiers.**

The surrounding parts of Berkshire are all in tier two - but Slough, with a higher rate of infection, has been put into tier three.
The price of this approach is low-Covid areas can be swept up into county-wide restrictions.
For example, Tunbridge Wells and Ashford, in tier-three Kent, had about 120 cases per 100,000 in the week to 19 November.
But most local authorities in England saw more than 180 cases per 100,000 people that week.
The document describing the government's rationale for each decision lists four factors on top of the main case rates, however:
Tunbridge Wells and Ashford have seen rising rates in recent weeks, while the rates in the rest of England have been falling.
And with hospitals in Kent already under pressure, the worry is the high rates of infection in Swale and Medway spread out into the rest of Kent.
But many MPs are still unsatisfied with the government's explanations.
Conservative MP Damian Green, who represents Ashford, asked the government to apply rules at ""a local level, districts rather than counties or regions"" as ""restrictions which people feel are unfair to their particular community will simply not be respected or obeyed"".

Share this...FacebookTwitterFrank Bosse at Die kalte Sonne here puts the spotlight on a global warming forecast published by some British MetOffice scientists in 2007. It appeared in Science here.
The peer-reviewed paper was authored by Doug M. Smith and colleagues under the title: “Improved Surface Temperature Prediction for the Coming Decade from a Global Climate Model“.
Using sophisticated methods, the target of the paper was to forecast the temperature development from 2004 to 2014 while taking the internal variability into account.
The claims made in Smith’s study are loud and clear (my emphasis):
…predict further warming during the coming decade, with the year 2014 predicted to be 0.30° ± 0.21°C [5 to 95% confidence interval (CI)] warmer than the observed value for 2004. Furthermore, at least half of the years after 2009 are predicted to be warmer than 1998, the warmest year currently on record.“
The first chart shows their forecast:

Figure 1: Decadal forecast by Smith et al. (2007) for 2004 to 2014 (Source: Figure 4 of the a.m. paper).
Now that it’s 2014 and the observed data are in, we can compare to see how Smith et al did with their forecast. Boy, did they fail!
The following chart shows the actual result of the Smith et al forecast, showing the real observations since 1998:

Figure 2: Observed temperature development as to the MetOffice’s own data HadCRUT4 compared to the claims made in the Smith et al paper. The lower black line shows the linear trend of the observed results. The blue-gray lines show the confidence range of the forecast. The red line shows the linear trend of Smith et al. Chart modified from DkS.

Clearly we see that the Met Office observations show a cooling of 0.014°C over the 2004-2014 decade and is below even the forecast lower confidence limit. Moreover not a single year was warmer than 1998, despite having predicted at least three would be warmer.
According to Bosse, when the 2007 chart was published it was supposed to act as another nail in the coffin for global warming skeptics. The chart was even adopted by a German report titled: “Future information for the government.” Bosse writes:
Here one reads that ‘good decadal forecasts for policymaking and economy are very useful’ (page 6) … as long as they are ignored, one might add.”
Bosse calls the chart a fiasco because it falsely advised policymaking. Bosse adds:
Until today, since the first IPCC report of 1990, they have not made any progress when it comes to the central theme of climate prognoses: How many degrees Celsius of warming results from a doubling of Co2 concentration?”
Bosse writes that the 2007 Smith et al forecast failed neither to take known ocean cycles nor natural factors sufficiently into account and writes that the climate sensitivity value assumed by the IPCC must be reduced.
Now that 2007 is some years behind us, even Smith et al have realized their forecast was overinflated and so they produced a new paper which appeared last year. The latest by Smith has taken natural variability more into account and he is much more careful with prophecy-making. Still, the range of uncertainty the new paper offers makes it “more or less useless”, Bosse writes.

Figure 3: Latest forecast by Smith et al for global temperature until 2022 (Figure 8 of the aforementioned paper)
 Bosse concludes:
As long as man is unable to determine with the needed precision the role natural variability plays in our observed climate, calculating the impact of greenhouse gases will remain prophecy. Do you feel guilty that you are still using incandescent light bulbs? Don’t fret over it!
We’ll be revisiting Smith’s newest forecast in about 5 years time. In the meantime we have to ask ourselves if these people will ever learn. Science can take only so much damage.

Yesterday a bunch of woke wankers decided that their fears and worries should command more attention than honest, hard-working taxpayers and so, aided and abetted by _Stuff_ reporters jizzing their y-fronts, they decided to disrupt Wellington.



Jacinda Ardern got the tone right stating:



“I’m never going to be opposed to someone being able to express their opinion and express their voices but blocking people from being able to go and do their day-to-day job doesn’t necessarily take us closer to the climate action they’re calling for,” 



**They aren’t calling for climate action, they are calling for the destruction of the economy.**



So, what does the Boss Womble of the ~~National~~ Womble party say with regards to the disruption to citizens going about their lawful daily routine?



 **Simon Bridges is telling Extinction Rebellion protesters** in Wellington **to march on the “woke” Government** doing “nothing” about climate change. 



The National leader described the Monday morning protest – blocking the entrance of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) on Wellington’s Stout St – as “nonsense”. 



**“I think climate change is real and think we’ve got to act,”** Bridges told Magic Talk.



Has Bridges not heard of the saying, ‘Go Woke, Get Broke’? 



He’s limper than a week-old lettuce sandwich at a Lambton Quay cafe.



In the contest of ideas in politics, he’s just given up and decided that he wants to out-woke the Greens and Labour.



To paraphrase Henry Curtmantle, will no one rid us of this turbulent weasel? Has he not learned the lesson from the Liberal victory in Australia?



My god, he’s such a womble. Is he saying he’d do something?[ ](https://whaleoil.slack.com/archives/CAWQVDU1H/p1570414967282800)Is he saying he’d be more woke than Labour and the Greens?



It is clear that Simon Bridges believes in climate change and not only that, **he believes that we HAVE to act.**



He clearly doesn’t want to be called a denier. But this shows that **he is definitely in the wrong party.**



Whilst he may think the voting public think he’s cool for singing syrupy renditions of Elvis Presley, most of us just look on in astonishment that the ~~National~~ Womble party caucus think that he’s the one to take them to victory next year.



The reality is becoming more apparent by the day: that he’s a dud. Time for him to go…quietly or otherwise, it matters not, he just needs to go. 



I can’t wait to see Paula Bennett announce that the ~~National~~ Womble Party theme song for the election will be:

The behaviour of virtue-signallers is always marked by hypocrisy and ignorance. Hollywood eco-crites jet from mega-mansion to climate summit in their fleets of private planes. A British study found that the most ostentatiously “green” lifestylers tend to have the biggest ecological footprints, mostly on account of their addiction to overseas holidays.



Food is the ultimate virtue-signal. From ostentatiously posing with their hemp shopping bags at farmer’s markets, to endlessly fretting over how “heirloom” their quinoa is, almond-fussing elites constantly use their food choices to virtue-signal their superiority to the Maccas-guzzling plebs.



 **Yet, they’re flocking like sheep to shovel the ultimate factory-made gunk into their smug gobs.**



The new food guide has advised Canadians to eat less meat and more plant-based proteins, to avoid the health risks associated with eating red and processed meats, like cancer and heart disease.



But [Jim] Thomas says that if consumers are choosing meatless burgers as an alternative, they need to think again.



“These are what we call ultra-processed foods,” he said. “You’re talking about a very processed bean protein basically that’s being mixed in with various other ingredients.”



“The latest Canada Food Guide says very clearly, ‘keep away from highly-processed foods.’ And some of these burgers have something like 19 different ingredients and they’ve been massively processed.” 



Thomas also raised concerns about the nutritional profile of these meat alternatives.



“Not only is the saturated fat pretty much the same but actually … [there is] a lot more sodium than you would have in normal meat.”



The same people who fret endlessly about GMOs are nonetheless happily gobbling fake meat burgers just chock-full of GMOs. Most notably, fake “blood” created by genetically engineering yeast.



Fake meat companies have also relied heavily on marketing themselves as being better for the planet […] But the ecological claims of the fake meat industry have drawn skepticism from those who say that highly-processed plant-based products are still taxing on the environment. 



“These fake meats only really address one part of the problem in the food system,” Thomas said. “They’re still drenched in pesticides. They are still produced in monocultures. None of that gets shifted […]Soybean production, for example, is massively problematic in the Amazon which is burning right now partly because of the clearances and the impact that’s had on the climate,” he said.



So, burning down rainforests in Malaysia to produce palm oil is **bad, mmkay?** But burning down rainforests to make fake meat is just fine?



Fake meat is the ultimate “frankenfood”.



“We’re moving into the idea of food being something that’s produced in a lab, in a factory really, away from the sort of food produced in nature that I think most people want. 



“I think when most people think of the kind of food they would like to feed their family, it grows on a farm and it’s grown by farmers and it’s in the environment and it works with bees and pollinators. That’s 180 degrees from the vision of food of these companies.”



If the almond-fussers really want to consume meat that’s ethically sourced, pasture-grown, and free from hormones, it’s time they wrapped their laughing gear around some [Whale Meat](https://whalemeat.co.nz/) from [The Whale Meat Company](https://whalemeat.co.nz/) which is 100% fake blood free!

A   source of income for Mr. Jammeh, though, had been a   scheme. For years, his government sold residence permits  —   sometimes costing up to $15, 000 apiece  —   to thousands of Chinese millionaires. Why? A special program meant to encourage investment in Hong Kong allowed wealthy Chinese citizens to gain the right to live there if they had permanent residence in another country. As of 2013, some 9, 000 Chinese obtained residence permits for Gambia. The maneuvering went on until 2015, when Hong Kong suspended the program. A review found that many of the people enrolled didn’t eventually settle in Hong Kong. Instead, they used their Hong Kong passports for easier travel to other countries (but probably not Gambia).

"**Ministers have been accused of showing ""disrespect"" to the Welsh Parliament because its members will not get a chance to vote on the latest coronavirus restrictions before pubs have to stop serving alcohol.**
An opposition request for a debate was denied by the Senedd's presiding officer
Elin Jones said a vote would be held in the chamber next Tuesday.
Laws banning alcohol in pubs and restaurants are due to start on Friday.
Hospitality venues will also have to close at 18:00 every night when the law changes on Friday.
The Welsh Government is facing calls to produce more evidence to support the restrictions, including from its own backbenches.
Ms Jones said MSs would be able to table amendments to a Welsh Government debate at the next full meeting of the Senedd on Tuesday.
That meant ""the Senedd has the opportunity therefore to debate and vote on the matter during the next plenary session"", she said.
Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said he understood the presiding officer's ""balancing act"", but that it was ""a missed opportunity"".
He said: ""We are a parliament. We are parliamentarians. If we are to be taken seriously we should have the opportunity to debate the issue and represent the people who put us here.
""I am grateful for your consideration presiding officer and I think it is the government that has missed the opportunity here and has in this particular instance, in my opinion, shown disrespect to the Welsh Parliament.""
Plaid Cymru MS Sian Gwenllian asked whether more pressure could be put on the government to hold a vote on the principle behind the regulations before they come into force on Friday.
""The changes happening on Friday are significant and we also need to see the evidence that has led to their introduction,"" she said.
Defending the alcohol decision on Tuesday, Mr Drakeford said without the rules ""hundreds and hundreds of people in Wales who otherwise would have been alive will not be alive in 2021"".
Earlier, Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said his chain would close its pubs in Wales from Friday, as staying open but only selling food had been ""ruinously expensive"" when tried in Scotland.
He told BBC Radio Wales the rules had been made by ""people who have never run a business"".
""This new puritanism in Wales and elsewhere is madness, is economic madness,"" he said.
""I don't want to wind the Welsh up by criticising their first minister, but he's talking cobblers.
""There's very good evidence that lockdowns - and this is a type of lockdown, it's a quasi-lockdown - simply don't work...
""This scare tactic saying so many people are going to die is nonsense in my opinion.""
Enzo Nigro, the owner of Potters pub in Newport, said he was concerned by the new rules.
""We had 70 to 80 emails come through 10 minutes after the announcement, and everyone was wondering what was going on,"" he said.
""People don't really understand the rules because they thought we would be able to serve alcohol until 6 o'clock and not no alcohol at all.
""It's frustrating.""
Conservatives say the rules are ""completely disproportionate"" in parts of Wales where the rate of infection is comparatively low.
Plaid Cymru, which has backed most of the Welsh Government's restriction during the pandemic, has said ministers should find a ""sensible compromise"" that allows alcohol to be served until 19:00, with closing time an hour later.
Mandy Jones, of the Independent Alliance for Reform in the Senedd, said a petition started by former MEP Nathan Gill ""shows that the public also agree with us in demanding that the Welsh Government publish the science they've used to justify this claim"".
The petition showed more than 18,000 signatures on Wednesday afternoon.
Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises and they will have to close at 18:00. Only takeaway alcohol will be allowed when the new rules kick in on Friday.
On Tuesday, Mr Drakeford pointed out that up to four people from different households will still be able to meet in bars and cafes, but without alcohol.
""Now I am sorry that is a significant deprivation for many people,"" he said.
""But the evidence is that when people drink then their behaviour changes and their behaviour changes in ways that make them and other people more vulnerable to the virus.""
Without further action, he said modelling suggested between 1,000 and 1,700 more deaths would occur this winter.
Mr Drakeford also said his government was publishing more information than any other administration in the UK.
Incident management teams had ""repeatedly"" highlighted problems with alcohol and hospitality venues in outbreaks, he added.
The boss of Brains, the biggest Welsh-owned brewery, has called the new alcohol rules ""closure by stealth"" and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be closed from Friday.
Brains data shared with BBC Wales shows between July and the end of November it served more than 850,000 customers at the 100 pubs it manages and had five inquiries from the Test, Trace, Protect scheme.
The company said three of its pubs were temporarily closed and deep cleaned after staff tested positive for coronavirus.
A new tougher tier system of coronavirus restrictions for England began on Wednesday, as the country emerged from its lockdown, after the plan was approved by MPs, despite a major rebellion on the Tory benches.
Under the highest, tier three, all hospitality venues must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services."

It has been 18 years since the last round of successful multilateral trade negotiations concluded. The so‐​called Uruguay Round, which produced a number of comprehensive agreements to reduce trade barriers and established the World Trade Organisation as an arbiter of trade disputes, remains the high water mark in the annals of multilateral trade accomplishments.



Despite nearly two decades of trying to build on that success — most prominently through the ill‐​fated Doha Round negotiations — international consensus for new agreements has been elusive. Lack of political will, too many governments with disparate objectives, and mission creep raising national sovereignty concerns have all been cited as reasons for Doha’s demise. Yet, this lack of progress has not impeded trade perceptibly. Indeed, world trade as a share of global GDP increased year‐​over‐​year, in every year over the past decade except 2009.



Give some credit to lagged implementation of Uruguay Round commitments, as well as to an increase in bilateral and regional agreements. But trade negotiations may be less important than once thought.



More of the credit for increased trade flows belongs to unilateral liberalisation of import barriers, the emergence of once sluggish and moribund economies in the developing world, and the ongoing revolutions in communications and transportation, which have inspired disaggregation of production processes and enabled the emergence of a truly global division of labour.



In a global economy increasingly characterised by cross border investment, international collaboration in production and integrated, transnational supply chains, the mercantilist “Us‐​versus‐​Them” zero‐​sum game assumptions at the heart of most governments’ trade negotiating strategies have become outdated to the point of being counterproductive.



It is difficult to imagine how negotiations based on the fallacy that import liberalisation is a grudging concession made to secure better access to export markets can persist very much longer, when a growing number of domestic interests in every country require greater access to imports.



One common explanation for why governments did not descend into a spiral of tit‐​for‐​tat protectionism during the Great Recession, as they did at the outset of the Great Depression, is that multilateral trade rules, which did not exist in the 1930s, prevented a trade war in 2009.



That may carry some weight, but a more plausible explanation is that in 2009 virtually all major trading nations had producers, who rely on access to imported intermediate goods to produce their final products, insisting on openness. In the 1930’s very few such entities existed, as nearly all of the components of a final product were usually made in the same country.



In 2009, when G20 trade and finance ministers were pledging and reassuring each other that they would not turn to protectionism, the Canadian and Mexican governments decided to reduce tariffs on most industrial inputs. Why? Because they recognised that business revenues would suffer on account of contracting global demand, and that dropping tariffs would reduce costs of production and preserving some profit margin.



Imports have always produced the enduring benefits of expanded trade — greater choice, better quality, lower prices and domestic efficiencies inspired by stronger competition. But the trend toward transnational production puts a growing number of producers — not just consumers — on the pro‐​import side of the ledger. And that makes current trade policy formulation particularly anachronistic and untenable.



But for the time being, the common fallacies about imports are reinforced by politicians and media, who depend on sports metaphors to confer meaning and to inspire actions, always with the effect of obscuring the real benefits of trade. Hence, in the United States exports are considered Team USA’s points, imports are the foreign team’s points, the trade account is the scoreboard and the several hundred billion dollar trade deficit means that Americans are losing at trade. And they’re losing — so the story goes — because their trade partners cheat.



President Obama has done little to correct those misperceptions. In fact, he’s fanned the flames, as has Mitt Romney, who promises to crack down on China’s rampant unfairness, which he blames for US job loss, on his first day in office. The president exhorts US exporters to “win the future” or to secure foreign market share before other countries’ exporters get there, as if the size of the pie were fixed.



This encouragement, with its incessant emphasis on exports as the benefits of trade and imports as costs we must minimise, only reinforces the misconception that trade is a zero‐​sum game with distinct winners and losers. But trade is a voluntary transaction that occurs, not between countries but, between individuals or businesses seeking to maximise value. The transaction would not occur if both parties didn’t perceive themselves as being made better off. Yet policy and rhetoric enshrine the myth that the party on the import side is somehow made worse off.



The centrepiece of the Obama administration’s trade policy is the National Export Initiative, with its goal of doubling US exports over five years to reach $3.14 trillion by the end of 2014. The NEI identifies all sorts of levers the US government will pull to assist exporters — systematically rigid enforcement of trade agreements, conclusion of new agreements, tax‐​payer‐​backed export financing, government‐​chaperoned and subsidised marketing trips abroad and more.



But the NEI systemically neglects a broad swath of opportunities to facilitate exports by contemplating only the export‐​oriented activities of exporters. Nowhere in the NEI’s 68‐​page plan to double exports is the word “import” mentioned, except with respect to the section that speaks about strengthening the trade remedies laws to better discipline “unfair” imports.



The NEI presumes that US exporters are born as exporters. But before those companies are exporters, they are producers. As producers first, most exporters are consumers of capital equipment, raw materials and other industrial inputs and components.



Many of the inputs consumed by US producers in their operations are imported or the costs of the inputs are affected by the availability and prices of imports. Indeed, “intermediate goods” and “capital equipment” — items purchased by producers, not consumers — accounted for 58 per cent of the value of all US imports last year. That would suggest that imports are crucial determinants of the profitability of US exporters, and not the scourge described in popular rhetoric.



Yet the NEI commits not a single word to the task of eliminating or reducing the burdens of government policies that inflate import prices and production costs — as the Canadians and Mexicans did for their businesses in 2009. By neglecting these domestic impediments, the administration pretends that the obstacles to US competitiveness and export success are all foreign‐​born.



The reform focus must be broadened to include consideration of the full range of home grown policies — such as taxes, regulations, tariffs and contingent protectionism — that affect US producers and put them at a disadvantage vis‐​á‐​vis foreign competitors. And that portends a very different kind of trade policy.



In the 21st century, it is inaccurate to characterise international trade as a competition between “us” and “them”. Because of foreign direct investment, joint ventures and other equity‐​sharing arrangements, quite often “we” are “they” and “they” are “we”.



The largest steel producer in the United States is Mittal, a majority Indian‐​owned company with headquarters in Europe. The largest German steel company, Thyssen‐​Krupp, recently completed a nearly $4 billion investment in Mobile, Alabama to serve, among other markets, the growing number of foreign‐​nameplate automakers producing throughout the southern United States. Nearly 6 million Americans work for foreign‐​owned companies in the United States.



“American” icon General Motors now produces more vehicles in China than it does in the United States. And the multinational production and supply chain through which Apple products famously make their way from drawing boards, laboratories and design centres in the United States to components factories throughout Asia to assembly plants in China and then into the hands of the world’s consumers exposes the banality of national trade accounting, which presumes to confer a “Made in” status on products to facilitate the imposition of import barriers. How absurd.



Current US trade policy, with its tendency toward bestowing favours on chosen exporters and serving as a conduit of corporate welfare and industrial policy, stands in stark contrast to the naturally and rapidly evolving global commercial environment, with its rich soil ready to fertilise competing combinations of labour, physical capital and human talent — tomorrow’s providers of abundance.



Policies that do not try to channel incentives for the benefit of specific groups or specific objectives but instead provide the greatest opportunities for citizens to partake of the opportunities afforded by our increasingly integrated global economy are the ones that will maximize economic growth and national welfare.



Producers operating in the United States, whether they are domestic, foreign or some combination of the two, compete with other producers for US and foreign market share. So do their upstream suppliers and downstream customers. In this competition, policy should be neutral.



Rather than predetermine winners and losers, trade policy should aim to attract human capital and financial investment to the highest value‐​added activities possible. Of course that implies a considerably diminished role for trade policy, which should be focused exclusively on ensuring openness and predictability with respect to import rules and customs procedures. The rest depends on transparent financial regulations, liberal immigration policies, limited frictions in labour, financial and goods markets, and respect for and adherence to the rule of law.



Although trade’s critics speak of a “race to the bottom”, where governments compete for investment by lowering the standards — a concern unsupported by trade and investment flows — it is really more appropriate to speak of a race to the top.



Governments are competing for investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided, where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate, where the spectre of asset expropriation is negligible, where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape, where the local work force is productive, where there are limited physical, political, and administrative frictions and so on. Thus, there is a race to the top, as governments compete to secure for their people the highest value‐​added rungs possible on the global supply chain.



This 21st century economic reality demands better than trade policies rooted in 16th century mercantilist dogma. It demands policies that are welcoming of imports and foreign investment, and that minimise regulations or administrative frictions that are based on misconceptions about some vague or ill‐​defined “national interest”.



To nurture the promise of our highly integrated global economy, governments should stop conflating the interests of certain producers with the national interest and commit to policies that reduce frictions throughout the supply chain — from product conception to consumption — as well as in the flow of services, investment and human capital.

"The big energy policy headline in the budget was well trailed. As expected, the level of the UK’s carbon tax on electricity generation will be frozen from 2016/17 until the end of this decade. Conceived in response to lobbying by energy intensive industries and Labour’s price freeze policy, this change is part of a package that the government claims will save energy consumers up to £7bn. The tax, known as the Carbon Price Floor, was implemented to compensate for the persistently low price of carbon in the European emissions trading scheme. Rather than increasing as planned, it will be capped at £18 per tonne of CO2. This will cost the government £1.8bn in lost revenue between 2016/17 and 2018/19.  Because this measure will make electricity cheaper than it would have been, electricity demand is expect to increase by 3-4%. Emissions may also rise too as a result. The compensation package for energy intensive industries that are liable to pay this tax will be extended to the end of the decade, and additional compensation will be available for these industries to offset the costs of renewable energy support policies. This freeze is unwelcome. It weakens the basic incentive for power generators to switch away from the use of carbon intensive fuels (particularly coal) towards lower carbon options such as gas, renewables and nuclear power. The only exception is a new exemption for electricity from efficient combined heat and power plants. Coal-fired electricity has experienced a revival in the last couple of years at the expense of gas due to low coal prices. This has led to an increase in power sector carbon emissions after many years of decline. From a climate change perspective, it is very important that policies counteract this economic advantage to reduce the risk that coal generation will be locked in for longer than necessary. But it is also important to remember that the Carbon Price Floor received mixed reactions when it was introduced. Many investors were sceptical, and foresaw the political risks associated with a measure that could be adjusted by the chancellor each year. They seem to have been vindicated. Its usefulness as a signal for new investment in low carbon technologies was already questionable – and now it is significantly weaker. To ensure emissions reductions remain on track, other measures may be necessary. The long term contracts for new sources of low carbon generation introduced by the Energy Act 2013 will be even more important. The budget does include positive statements about the government’s commitment to renewable energy through these contracts. In addition to this, further details of the “capacity mechanism” were published on budget day. This is a complex mechanism designed to support new flexible generation to help balance supply and demand for electricity. The duration of capacity mechanism contracts for new gas-fired plants has been increased to 15 years.  This may help to improve confidence among investors who have put plans on hold because of poor economics. But the mechanism can also support existing coal plants, some of which could be awarded three-year contracts to pay for refurbishment. This adds to concerns that coal generation (and wider power sector emissions) will not be reduced quickly enough. The demand side of energy policy was notable by its absence from the budget. A more comprehensive response to high energy bills would have included a greater emphasis on energy efficiency. This is especially the case for households and smaller companies that have limited resources to invest. While the government has an ambitious energy efficiency strategy that aims to avoid the need for 22 power stations by 2020, progress has been mixed.  The Secretary of State for energy Ed Davey MP recently admitted that the uptake of the flagship Green Deal policy had been “disappointing”. Some of the £1.8bn the government will forego as a result of the Carbon Price Floor freeze could have been used to strengthen energy efficiency programmes. While the pressure to relieve the impact of high energy prices is understandable, this budget increased the risks that the UK’s carbon targets will not be met. It also missed an opportunity to improve energy efficiency, and to insulate energy consumers against high prices in future. "

Lance Wallace writes in Tips and Notes:
The Congressional Budget Office has released an analysis of the effects of a carbon tax.
At $20 a ton. they estimate about $1.2 trillion in revenues over a 10-year period. A money quote for me is:


“Without accounting for how the revenues from a carbon tax would be used, such a tax would have a negative effect on the economy. The higher prices it caused would diminish the purchasing power of people’s earnings, effectively reducing their real (inflation-adjusted) wages. Lower real wages would have the net effect of reducing the amount that people worked, thus decreasing the overall supply of labor. Investment would also decline, further reducing the economy’s total output.”

The CBO goes on to soften this by saying that certain ways of spending the revenue (e.g., reducing deficits or marginal tax rates) might result in a net benefit. But just returning the revenues to the low-income homes most affected by the rise in cost of electricity (16%; range 7% (California) to 27% (Illinois, West VA, etc.)) would not decrease the total cost of the carbon tax.

"WASHINGTON  —   Betsy DeVos, a wealthy Republican donor with almost no experience in public education, was confirmed by the Senate as the nation’s education secretary on Tuesday, but only with the help of a historic tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence after weeks of protests and two defections within her own party. The    vote capped an   vigil on the Senate floor, where, one by one, Democrats denounced Ms. DeVos to a mostly empty chamber. But they did not get a third Republican defection that would have stopped Ms. DeVos  —   a billionaire who has devoted much of her life to promoting charter schools and vouchers  —   from becoming the steward of the nation’s nearly 100, 000 public schools. It was the first time a vice president has been summoned to the Capitol to break a tie on a cabinet nomination. Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, demanded before the vote that Republicans explain how they could support Ms. DeVos. “If we cannot set aside party loyalty long enough to perform the essential duty of vetting the president’s nominees, what are we even doing here?” Mr. Franken asked. The two Republicans who voted against the nominee, Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said Ms. DeVos was unqualified because of a lack of familiarity with public schools and with laws meant to protect students. “I have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary of education who has been so involved in one side of the equation, so immersed in the push for vouchers, that she may be unaware of what actually is successful within the public schools, and also what is broken and how to fix them,” Ms. Murkowski said last week when the two announced their opposition. Ms. Murkowski also said she had been influenced by thousands of messages she had received urging her to reject the nomination. For many educators, Ms. DeVos’s support for charter schools and vouchers  —   which allow students to use taxpayer dollars to pay tuition at private, religious and   schools  —   reflected a deep disconnect from public schools. Neither Ms. DeVos nor any of her children attended a public school. Most Republicans described Ms. DeVos as committed to what is best for children. In a fiery speech moments before the vote, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a former education secretary himself, criticized his Democratic colleagues for opposing Ms. DeVos, he said, simply because she was nominated by a Republican president. “She led the most effective public school reform movement over the last few years,” he said. Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the committee that approved Ms. DeVos’s nomination last week in a   split, said she had been “at the forefront” of education overhaul for decades. By midday Tuesday, as the vote in the Senate deadlocked at 50 to 50, Mr. Pence, a former member of the House, took the gavel and at 12:29 p. m. declared his vote for Ms. DeVos. In a procedural quirk, a confirmation vote on Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama for attorney general was scheduled after that of Ms. DeVos so he could vote “yes” before leaving the Senate, securing Republicans a decisive vote. Raised in a wealthy family, Ms. DeVos, who married into the Amway fortune, has a web of financial investments, has also raised alarm among critics who worried about the many opportunities for conflicts of interest. She was the first of Mr. Trump’s nominees not to complete an ethics review before appearing before a Senate panel. She filed her ethics paperwork on Jan. 19, two days after her confirmation hearing. Teachers’ unions and even some charter organizations had protested Ms. DeVos’s nomination across the country. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the committee that approved Ms. DeVos  —   and a former educator herself  —   urged disheartened advocates on Tuesday morning before the vote not to think of their efforts as a waste. “It’s made an impact here and made a difference,” she said. “And I think it’s woken each of us up in this country to what we value and what we want. ” Shortly after Ms. DeVos’s confirmation, Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, a union that protested the nomination, said the public would now have to “serve as a check and balance” to her policies and be “fierce fighters on behalf of children. ” “It’s telling that even when Trump had full control of the legislative and executive branches, he could only get DeVos confirmed by an unprecedented tiebreaking vote by his vice president,” Ms. Weingarten said. “That’s because DeVos shows an antipathy for public schools, a   embrace of private,   alternatives and a lack of basic understanding of what children need to succeed in school. ” David E. Kirkland, an education professor at New York University who has studied Ms. DeVos’s impact in Michigan, said he feared she could badly hurt public education and pull resources out of schools in need of federal funding. “Her extensive conflicts of interest and record of diverting money away from vulnerable students and into the pockets of the rich make DeVos completely unfit for the position she was just confirmed to,” he said. Ms. DeVos has focused on expanding parental choice in education and on embracing charter schools and vouchers. Her ideology was a good fit for Mr. Trump’s education platform during the campaign, which called for a $20 billion voucher initiative aimed at   children. But freeing such an enormous sum would most likely require the reallocation of federal education money, as well as a realignment of congressional priorities. Vouchers were not part of a sweeping education overhaul passed in 2015, and lawmakers from rural areas, where schools tend to be farther apart, are particularly wary of such initiatives. The Trump administration could potentially advance a more limited voucher program and seek tax credits for private school tuition or home schooling costs. Ms. DeVos has also indicated that she would dismantle other pieces of the Obama administration’s legacy, potentially including a rule that denies federal student aid money to   colleges whose graduates struggle to get jobs, as well as an aggressive effort to investigate and adjudicate campus sexual assault claims. Ms. DeVos’s critics said they would continue to fight her as she serves. Some vowed to demonstrate at her appearances at forums and schools and to seek candidates friendly to their view to run for local office. Lily Eskelsen García, the president of the National Education Association, said her union would tap into the vast database of advocates it had built during Ms. DeVos’s confirmation process to help keep her in check. “As soon as she does something alarming, it will be known, it will be seen,” she said. “She won’t be able to hide. ” Mr. Trump’s choice of Ms. DeVos, known for her   lobbying efforts to expand charter schools in Michigan  —   an experiment that even charter school supporters now criticize  —   to lead the Education Department presented senators with a multitude of potential pitfalls. Her background as a prolific    who has donated about $200 million over the years to Republican causes and candidates  —   including some senators, as has been the case for previous presidential nominees  —   came under scrutiny. Democrats have also expressed concern about her family’s contributions to groups that support   conversion therapy for gay people and her past statements that government “sucks” and that public schools are a “dead end. ” Opponents have also focused on the poor performance of charter schools in Detroit, which she championed. Senators and education advocates from both sides of the aisle also expressed concern after Ms. DeVos, during her Jan. 17 confirmation hearing, confused core responsibilities of the department. In one notable exchange that spread across the internet, Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, asked Ms. DeVos whether all schools that receive public money should have to follow the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, the landmark 1975 civil rights legislation. Under that federal law, states and school districts are required to provide special education services to children with disabilities. Ms. DeVos said the issue was “best left to the states. ” In a bizarre moment that made her the butt of   TV jokes, Ms. DeVos also suggested that states should decide whether to allow guns in schools, citing in part concerns about protection from grizzly bears in Wyoming. “I think probably there, I would imagine there is probably a gun in a school to protect from potential grizzlies,” she said. Before the vote Tuesday, Mr. Franken said, “It was the most embarrassing confirmation hearing that I have ever seen. ” In a final push that included demonstrations around the country, constituents and advocates swamped Senate offices with calls, so inundating the Capitol switchboard that it disrupted the Senate’s voice mail system."
"John Blackwell, the new head of the British Veterinary Association, recently waded into the ritual slaughter debate by calling for kosher and halal meat preparation to be banned.  With vets at European level making similar demands, 10 years after the then Labour Government decided not to ban the practice, Jewish and Muslim leaders have united in rejecting the basic assumption that the animals suffer greatly in the process. They have suggested that the objections are motivated by incipient anti-Semitism and Islamaphobia.   As an aside, the vets’ demands made a change from critics focusing solely on halal, which in view of the close similarities between the two practices always suggests it is socially easier to criticise Muslim rather than Jewish traditions. But that doesn’t mean the general point is correct either.  In either case, the objection is that a trained individual uses an extremely sharp implement to slit the animal’s throat in a single cut so that it bleeds to death within minutes. In other words, the problem is the animal being “conscious” at the final moment prior to slaughter.    This raises a number of interesting issues. There is seemingly no interest in the other aspects of the slaughter process. Kosher and halal slaughterhouses are usually very small and non-industrial; most other abattoirs are highly industrialised. In the latter, the animals are carried off their feet from narrow pens to a point where a man uses a large nail gun to fire a pencil-sized bolt into their brains. Once stunned in this way, each animal is hoisted up and its throat is slit to bleed out.   Industrial slaughterhouses can process more than 300 animals an hour. Critics of kosher or halal practices rarely consider the distress animals might experience in the half hour before they die during industrial slaughter. So long as there is a “humane” death at the end, society and its veterinary associations are relatively relaxed about the overall system of industrial meat production.  It might be harsh to suggest this is subtly disguised anti-Semitism or Islamaphobia, but it does point to a societal disquiet about non-standard production practices in this era where people are very removed from the physical production of food, especially meat. Industrialisation might add a level of distance and comfort, but learn a bit more about the meat production methods and you might also conclude that society’s squeamishness about animal killing does not extend to how the animal is reared, transported, penned and processed beforehand.  Anyone who has grown up on a farm will recognise a level of hypocrisy here. I grew up in rural parts of the US, catching, killing and cleaning fish.  Shooting and cleaning deer was a part of life.  A calf was taken each year to the small local abattoir for slaughter and we knew the name of the animal when we ate part of it.   My mother grew up in a world where they slaughtered hogs and steers on site by hand, with local families moving from farm to farm to help.  At no point were they (or we) intentionally inhumane and we would all have been horrified by the assembly line and callous processing of animals in modern industrial slaughterhouses. Likewise, there was no particular glory or superiority in the hands-on aspect of slaughter.  Meat was an essential food and animals, which were known and cared for from birth, had been raised for that purpose.  Slaughter was a very unpleasant and extremely difficult part of that process.   Kosher and halal rituals are very much rooted in religious practices   embedded in that same type of rural culture. The killing is grubby and bloody; and uncomfortable for modern people used to meat in nice packages.   But it is problematic to focus on the distress of an animal at the moment of its death in a very small-scale, hands-on environment while turning a jaded and largely blind eye to slaughterhouses sucking in animals and spitting out meat parcels by their thousands every hour. If those who claim to care about animal rights want to focus on one thing, it should be that.   Related coverage:"

If their models and work consistently produce false results, then it is not long before they find themselves looking for a new line of work. There’s no room for politics in their trade.

No trend to anything unusual
One of Germany’s leading private commercial meteorologists, Dominik Jung of wetternet.de, gives an interview at the online Hessische/Niedersächsische Allgemeine Zeitung (HNA). Jung says storms and variable weather are nothing new in Germany, and that there is no trend pointing to any unusual changes.
So far this summer Germany has seen a fair amount of variable weather, with several periods of a few hot days followed by cooler rainy days. HNA asked Jung if this was unusual and if spells of sunny, hot summerlike weather had not been longer in the past. The HNA gives us Jung’s answer: “No. Weeks-long warm periods with long-lasting heat are not typical for our region.”
Summers getting wetter, contradicting climate models
On whether German summers are becoming drier, as many climate scientists once projected: “In the past years six were wetter than the long-term average. The summer of 2013 was a bit too dry.”
Winters are not getting warmer

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The HNA also brings up the often mentioned claim that German winters are becoming warmer, and that snow and frost will soon become “a thing of the past”. It writes: Also the suspicion that winters are getting warmer cannot be statistically asserted. Over the past seven years many of the winters were very cold with long periods of snow and ice.”
Increased storm activity in Germany?
The HNA also asked Jung about storm frequency and severity. Here as well the high-profile meteorologist sees no statistical basis. The HNA writes : “According to Jung, there is no detectable increase. The UN IPCC report also comes up with the same result. … statistically there hasn’t been any more such storms than there was 100 years ago.”
On rising insurance claims due to storm damage, Jung says that the rising trend has much more to do with the higher number of people insuring their assets, and is not a measure of storm activity.
Jung also says that spring on average is arriving about one or two weeks earlier than it did 3o years ago. Here Jung does not mention that 30 years ago some importanct ocean cycles were in their cold phases. Climate is changing, but that change is due in most part to natural cycles, which even alarmist scientists have been conceding lately every time they claim “the warming is being masked by natural variations.”
Climate change is natural
When asked if the fluctuiations are a tell-tale sign of climate change, Jung dumps cold water on that claim as well. The HNA reports: “For meteorologist Jung there is currently no acute effects of a climate change. Climate has been changing since the earth was created, and it will continue to do so in the decades and centuries ahead.”

"It might seem strange to some that dust from the Sahara is falling on their cars in England. Stranger still, that Saharan sand is mixing with general air pollution from both continental Europe and the UK to bring about the maximum possible health warning for air quality to parts of the country. But air pollution is hardly a new phenomenon – its first mention is by Pliny the Elder who complained bitterly that his wine was spoilt by odour and pollution in Roman times. Recently we’ve heard less about air pollution as problem in the UK than we used to; it has been superseded by climate change as environmental enemy number one.  There are some good reasons for this. In general terms air quality now is very much better than it was 20 or 30 years ago. Some tremendously successful policies were introduced at UK and European level that got to grips with the very worst polluters. Power stations are much cleaner than they were – so much so that sulphur dioxide, one of their main air pollutant emissions, is almost undetectable now in the UK. Improvements to vehicle exhaust emissions over 20 years have also had a big impact, through a succession of increasingly stringent limits on what new cars and lorries can emit. So what about the current air pollution? According to atmospheric and health scientists it is quite an intense event, and there is no doubt that it will affect groups with underlying health conditions. Even the healthy will feel some transient effects like stinging eyes.  Perhaps what is most interesting, however, is that this scale of pollution is now marked out as being unusual. From a policy perspective, an official in government could look on this wide media coverage as a mark of policy success (although perhaps not while in the midst of the event itself).  Defra’s measurement data shows that the worst air pollution events in the UK have decreased in both their frequency and extent, so much so that short-term events like this are surprising. This level of pollution certainly wouldn’t make the news in Beijing. The current air pollution in the south east follows a well established pattern, albeit one with a Saharan twist. Some of the worst pollution events in the UK occur when there are light easterly winds. These take air with high pollution levels from continental Europe to the UK, into which the UK adds its own fresh emissions. There are events of this kind every year, and occasionally, for example in the heatwave of 2003 they become sufficiently significant to puncture public consciousness. The current air pollution is somewhat unusual in that there is a polluted easterly airflow that also holds the remains of dust whipped up in the Sahara. It seems slightly fanciful that Saharan dust can find its way so far from home, but this is actually rather common. Mostly, dust flows out from the Sahara into the Atlantic, where it is a source of nutrients to the ocean, but events are common in Southern Europe, and this material even flows across to South America. Air pollution of this kind lasts as long as the prevailing weather patterns hold. Predictions indicate that the poor air quality will remain for a few days and then a shift in air mass will bring us back to more normal, cleaner conditions. The current conditions do highlight the rather limited room for manoeuvre that exists for controlling these infrequent but severe pollution events. The UK is largely at the mercy of polluters in upwind nations, and there isn’t much that can be done about natural effects such as dust. It is wrong, however, to focus too much on short-term extremes, important though they are to some individuals. Cumulatively we are exposed to air pollution year-round, and reducing that overall exposure is a key public health objective. We need to reduce air pollution when it isn’t making the headlines as well as when it is. And this is where things get sticky.  Despite the significant improvements in air quality over the past few decades, in recent years, those gains have stalled. Increasingly tight controls, for example on new vehicle exhaust emissions, do not seem to be translating through to the real world. The UK is currently subject to potential EU fines for excessive nitrogen dioxide, and this has come about because projected improvements in air quality haven’t been realised.  There is much academic debate on why this is, and it is a controversial subject. There is no doubt that in the same way as few drivers get the miles per gallon claimed by the manufacturer, few cars now emit what is predicted. There have been shifts in pollutants from one source to another, growth in wood-burning at home is just one example. And the UK is also subject to pollution imported, albeit at diluted levels, from as far away as the US and beyond. So one might consider that the current ill wind blows some good. It keeps minds focused on what remains a damaging and costly toll on public health."

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
There’s an interesting measure of atmospheric CO2, called the “airborne fraction”. The airborne fraction is the fraction of the CO2 emitted each year which remains in the atmosphere. When humans emit say 9 gigatonnes of carbon, only about half of that remains in the air. The other half of the emitted carbon is absorbed, “sequestered” in some semi-permanent fashion, by various carbon sinks in the land and the ocean.
Dr. James Hansen of NASA, another in the long line of climate alarmists who don’t mind shafting the poor with expensive energy, has come out with a most surprising statement in his latest paper, Climate forcing growth rates: doubling down on our Faustian bargain, hereinafter Hansen 2012. The statement involves Hansen et al.’s explanation for a claimed recent decrease in the airborne fraction. Here’s their graphic showing the changes in the airborne fraction since 1960.
Figure 1. Hansen 2012 Figure 3. I’ve added a vertical line highlighting June 1991. 
[ORIGINAL CAPTION] Fossil fuel CO2 emissions (left scale) and airborne fraction, i.e., the ratio of observed atmospheric CO2 increase to fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Final three points are 5-, 3- and 1-year means.
I do wish people would show the underlying data and not just averages, but setting that aside, here are the authors’ claims about the drop in the airborne fraction (blue line) post 2000:
We suggest that the surge of fossil fuel use, mainly coal, since 2000 is a basic cause of the large increase of carbon uptake by the combined terrestrial and ocean carbon sinks. One mechanism by which fossil fuel emissions increase carbon uptake is by fertilizing the biosphere via provision of nutrients essential for tissue building, especially nitrogen, which plays a critical role in controlling net primary productivity and is limited in many ecosystems (Gruber and Galloway 2008). Modeling (e.g., Thornton et al 2009) and field studies (Magnani et al 2007) confirm a major role of nitrogen deposition, working in concert with CO2 fertilization, in causing a large increase in net primary productivity of temperate and boreal forests.
This is an interesting argument, but it has a few moving parts. Let me list them.
1) Increased coal use leads to increased net primary productivity (NPP) .
2) Increased NPP is evidence of increased carbon absorption.
3) Increased carbon absorption leads to increased biologically driven carbon sequestration.
4) Increased biologically driven sequestration explains the post-2000 decrease in airborne fraction.
I’m good with claims number 1 and number 2, but from there they get increasingly unlikely for various reasons. I’ll go get the data and show the actual airborne fraction, but first, let me quote a bit more from Hansen 2012, this time regarding Pinatubo.
Remarkably, and we will argue importantly, the airborne fraction has declined since 2000 (figure 3) during a period without any large volcanic eruptions. The 7-year running mean of the airborne fraction had remained close to 60% up to 2000, except for the period affected by Pinatubo.
and also …
Thus we see the decreased CO2 airborne fraction since 2000 as sharing some of the same causes as the decreased airborne fraction after the Pinatubo eruption (figure 3).
I looked at the chart, and I looked at the dates. Pinatubo was in June of 1991. Here’s what I get from the data:
Figure 2. Annual airborne fraction (red line), along with 7-year average (blue). Green line shows theoretical airborne fraction assuming exponential decay of excess CO2.
So to start with, from both his graph and mine I’m saying absolutely no way to Hansen’s claim that there was a “decreased airborne fraction after the Pinatubo eruption”. Hansen seems obsessed with Pinatubo. He previously has claimed (falsely) that it represented a successful test of his GISS climate model. See here, here , and here for a discussion of how poorly the models actually did with Pinatubo.
He is now claiming (again falsely) that there is some drop in the airborne fraction after Pinatubo. I’m sorry, but that’s a totally false statement. There’s no sign of any unusual drop post-Pinatubo in this record at all, neither in the annual data nor in the average data. The majority of the drop he seems to be pointing to occurred well before Pinatubo occurred …
In passing, let me comment that any reviewer who let any of that Pinatubo nonsense past them should resign their commission. It was the first thing I noticed when I looked at the paper.
There’s a second problem with what Hansen et al. have done. They say regarding their 7-year average (blue line) that: Final three points are 5-, 3- and 1-year means. Sadly, this means that the final point in the 7-year average is forced to be equal to the last point in the raw data … easily the worst choice of ways to handle the final points of any average, almost guaranteed to have the largest error.
But that method does have one advantage in this case. It greatly exaggerates the amount of the recent drop. Note for example that had the data ended one year earlier, the final point in his average would have had a value 60% … here’s what the 7-year average figured their way would have looked like if the data had ended in 2010.
Figure 3. As in Figure 2, but with the 7-year average ending in 2010 using their method. Note that the final point is forced to equal the 2010 value.
As you can see, their curious treatment of the 7-year average at the end of the data is the only thing that makes the trend look so bad. When changing the data length by one year makes that kind of change in an average, you can assume that your results are far, far from robust.
But neither of those is the main problem with their claim. The main problem is that the general slight decrease in the airborne fraction is an expected result of the exponential decay of the excess atmospheric CO2. As the green line shows, the actual results are in no way different from the value we’d expect to see. The green line shows the result of the exponential decay of the excess CO2 if we assume a half-life of about 46 years. The expected value decreases slightly from 1970 to 2011.
It’s worth noting that if CO2 emissions leveled off entirely, the airborne fraction would gradually decay to zero. This is because if emissions level off, eventually the excess CO2 level will be such that the annual sequestration will equal the annual emission with nothing to remain airborne.
To close, let me return to their claim:
We suggest that the surge of fossil fuel use, mainly coal, since 2000 is a basic cause of the large increase of carbon uptake by the combined terrestrial and ocean carbon sinks.
I must confess that I hadn’t looked at fuel use by type in a while, so I was unaware of a large spike in coal use.
Figure 4. Carbon emissions by fuel type. Note the steady rise of natural gas, which will only increase with the advent of fracking.
So yes, coal use has indeed spiked since 2000, with a jump in coal emissions putting it back out in front of oil. I assume, although I’ve not checked, that this is the result of the huge increase in coal for electricity generation in India and China. And good on them, the folks in that part of the planet desperately need cheap energy.
Returning to the claims in Hansen 2012, it is true that the carbon uptake by the various sinks has constantly increased over time. This increase, however, appears to be much more related to the exponential decay of the CO2, and has less to do with the changes in the biosphere. We know this because the change in the amount sequestered is much larger than the change in the NPP.
Here are the figures. In 1960 the natural sinks were sequestering about 1 gigatonne of excess carbon annually. By 2011, this had risen to 4.5 gigatonnes annually. I agree that CO2 fertilization is real, but clearly this 4.5-fold increase in total tonnage of excess carbon sequestered cannot all be the result of increased NPP from CO2 fertilization.
So while I’m glad to hear that Hansen thinks that coal is good for something, I fear his explanation for the increase in the amount sequestered is not correct. The increases in the amount sequestered have been much, much larger (450% since 1960) than the increase in the amount of sequestration due to greater NPP.
Before I leave, let me remind folks what cheap electricity and energy from coal does for us all, rich and poor alike, every day of the year.
Figure 5. Daily output of coal energy. SOURCE 
That huge benefit to the poor and the rich is what Hansen is trying to get rid of … but he and others have very little with which to replace it. So all that happens is that the price of energy goes up, and the poor once again are impoverished the most.
Brilliant plan, that fellow Hansen truly cares about the future … he just doesn’t seem to care if he hurts people in the present.
My best to everyone,
w.

During the last three years, since 2011, the ice around Antarctica has been growing, in most seasons, more than during any similar periods of the satellite era where we have that data.
At first, the climate catastrophists ignored this phenomenon. When that became embarrassingly inconvenient, they began to blame it on instrument problems.
They detected a step-change in the data in 1991, but couldn’t decide which side of the step was the correct data, and the fault only excused about 5% of the increase. The step change supposedly occurred in 1991. 
Figure 1 is from the paper as described above. The step occurs at the end of 1991.
 Figure 2 is the satellite (RSS) lower troposphere temperature data for the southern hemisphere south of 20° South.
Note the step in July 1991. The step in temperature occurs in July 1991. What happened in the summer of 1991? Mount Pinatubo blew up on the 15th of June. How long does it take for volcanic equatorial cooling to reach 70° South? About six months. Can you see the step in the ice data? I can’t. It doesn’t show in the annualized ice date (Figure 4) either

Figure 3: Hemisphere sea ice anomaly data in the satellite era. Source 
If a real step was detected in the ice anomaly data, it coincides with a cooling step in the southern hemisphere temperature, and is real, not an instrumental artifact. To make it easier to see the trends, the next figure is annualized data, sea ice anomaly and temperature anomaly from satellite (RSS) for the latitudes of coastal Antarctic, 70°south to 60°south, with the trends. Temperature has been inverted to match the ice.

Figure 4: Plot of the ice anomaly (annualized) and the temperature anomaly (also annualized) for the latitudes of coastal Antarctica.
It is apparent in Figure 4 that most of the changes in the ice anomaly plot match changes in temperature. Keep in mind that the temperature plot is inverted, cold is upward, warm downward, to match the behavior of the ice. The recent increase in ice is because it has gotten colder.
Though the temperature trend in the last 35 years is only slightly cooler, the ice has increased dramatically. Here are trend maps of the temperature changes in the polar regions in the last ten years from GISS. Compare the temperature changes along the coast of Antarctica to the ice anomaly map.

Figure 5 is a map of the global temperature change over the last ten full years from GISS.
Note that the Global temperature trend from 2003 to 2013 in Figure 5 above, (top right corner) matches the 70° to 60° South decade trend in Figure 4.

Figure 6 (right) is the current ice anomaly map for Antarctica. I turned it 90° counter clockwise to match the Antarctic as seen in Figure 5.
There is more ice where it has been colder. There are many gaps in the temperature data around Antarctica, especially ocean data. But even on the continent, station data is quite sparse and subject to UHI (Urban Heat Island) problems for the larger stations. That large orange spot in Antarctica in Figure 5 is due to McMurdo Station, the largest and most populous base on the continent.
The next largest heat source is the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.
The ice around Antarctica is not increasing due to global warming. It is increasing due to global COOLING!

From Stanford University encouraging news, a rechargeable Zinc-air battery would put electric cars into the realm of reasonable practicality, where with lead-acid batteries they are currently not.
Stanford scientists develop high-efficiency zinc-air battery
Stanford University scientists have developed an advanced zinc-air battery with higher catalytic activity and durability than similar batteries made with costly platinum and iridium catalysts. The results, published in the May 7 online edition of the journal Nature Communications, could lead to the development of a low-cost alternative to conventional lithium-ion batteries widely used today.
This is a rechargeable zinc-oxide battery in a tri-electrode configuration with cobalt-oxide/carbon nanotube and iron-nickel/layered double hydroxide catalysts for charge and discharge, respectively. Credit: Yanguang Li, Stanford University
“There have been increasing demands for high-performance, inexpensive and safe batteries for portable electronics, electric vehicles and other energy storage applications,” said Hongjie Dai, a professor chemistry at Stanford and lead author of the study. “Metal-air batteries offer a possible low-cost solution.”

According to Dai, most attention has focused on lithium-ion batteries, despite their limited energy density (energy stored per unit volume), high cost and safety problems. “With ample supply of oxygen from the atmosphere, metal-air batteries have drastically higher theoretical energy density than either traditional aqueous batteries or lithium-ion batteries,” he said. “Among them, zinc-air is technically and economically the most viable option.”
Zinc-air batteries combine atmospheric oxygen and zinc metal in a liquid alkaline electrolyte to generate electricity with a byproduct of zinc oxide. When the process is reversed during recharging, oxygen and zinc metal are regenerated.
“Zinc-air batteries are attractive because of the abundance and low cost of zinc metal, as well as the non-flammable nature of aqueous electrolytes, which make the batteries inherently safe to operate,” Dai said. “Primary (non-rechargeable) zinc-air batteries have been commercialized for medical and telecommunication applications with limited power density. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop electrically rechargeable batteries, with the stumbling blocks being the lack of efficient and robust air catalysts, as well as the limited cycle life of the zinc electrodes.”
Active and durable electrocatalysts on the air electrode are required to catalyze the oxygen-reduction reaction during discharge and the oxygen-evolution reaction during recharge. In zinc-air batteries, both catalytic reactions are sluggish, Dai said.
Recently, his group has developed a number of high-performance electrocatalysts made with non-precious metal oxide or nanocrystals hybridized with carbon nanotubes. These catalysts produced higher catalytic activity and durability in alkaline electrolytes than catalysts made with platinum and other precious metals.
“We found that similar catalysts greatly boosted the performance of zinc-air batteries,” Dai said. both primary and rechargeable. “A combination of a cobalt-oxide hybrid air catalyst for oxygen reduction and a nickel-iron hydroxide hybrid air catalyst for oxygen evolution resulted in a record high-energy efficiency for a zinc-air battery, with a high specific energy density more than twice that of lithium-ion technology.”
The novel battery also demonstrated good reversibility and stability over long charge and discharge cycles over several weeks. “This work could be an important step toward developing practical rechargeable zinc-air batteries, even though other challenges relating to the zinc electrode and electrolyte remain to be solved,” Dai added.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeomar scientist dares to go public, criticizes publication censorship: criticism of IPCC models unwanted!
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Vladimir Semenov is a scientist at the Geomar Institute in Kiel, Germany. In 2009, together with colleague Mojib Latif and other colleagues, he submitted a manuscript to the Journal of Climate in which the authors feared that the CO2 climate sensitivity in the climate models was possibly pegged too high. During the peer-review process the reviewers requested that all passages containing doubt over Co2’s impact on climate be deleted, otherwise the paper would not get published. And so it happened: An entire section had to be removed before the study finally got published in 2010:
Semenov, V., Latif, M., Dommenget, D., Keenlyside, N., Strehz, A., Martin, T. und Park, W. (2010) The Impact of North Atlantic-Arctic Multidecadal Variability on Northern Hemisphere Surface Air Temperature Journal of Climate, 23 (21). pp. 5668-5677. DOI 10.1175/2010JCLI3347.1.
In the wake of the mobbing affair concerning the former director of the Hamburg-based Max Planck Institute, Lennart Bengtsson, Mr. Semenov gathered the courage to take the issue to the public. He criticized that deleting the part challenging the IPCC model in his paper was a form of censorship.
The respected British daily The Times prominently reported on the matter on 8 July 2014 on the front page of its Environment section:
Voices of dissent drowned out by climate change scientists
Research that questioned the accuracy of computer models used to predict global warming was “censored” by climate scientists, it was alleged yesterday. One academic reviewer said that a section should not be published because it “would lead to unnecessary confusion in the climate science community”. Another wrote: “This entire discussion has to disappear.” The paper suggested that the computer models used by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were flawed, resulting in human influence on the climate being exaggerated and the impact of natural variability being underplayed. The findings could have profound implications. If correct, they could mean that greenhouse gases have less impact than the IPCC has predicted and that the risk of catastrophic global warming has been overstated. However, the questions raised about the models were deleted from the paper before it was published in 2010 in the American Meteorological Society’s Journal of Climate. The paper had been submitted in July 2009, when many climate scientists were urging world leaders to agree a global deal on cutting emissions at the Copenhagen climate change summit in December that year. Vladimir Semenov, a climate scientist at the Geomar institute in Kiel, Germany, said the questions he and six others had posed in the original version of the paper were valid and removing them was “a kind of censorship.”

Also a presentation made by the Geomar team in July 2013 in den USA fits nicely (see our blog article “Mojib Latif in presentation in the USA: Climate sensitivity is set too high by the IPCC CO2“). With one exception (T. Martin), all the authors took a position that is identical to that in the publication in the Journal of Climate of 2010. In the conclusion of the presentation, the scientists state on slide no. 30:
(1) ‘MOC variability appears to be predictable about a decade ahead.’
(2) ‘The most recent decades contain a strong contribution from the AMO (MOC) even on a global scale,’ see also slide no.16.
(3) ‘This raises questions about the average climate sensitivity of the IPCC models,’ see also slide no. 21: ‘Implication: Climate sensitivity is too high’.

"**Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins owner Arcadia has gone into administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk.**
The High Street giant has hired administrators from Deloitte after the pandemic ""severely impacted"" sales across the group.
No redundancies would be announced immediately, it said in a statement.
And Arcadia's stores will continue to trade as Deloitte considers all options available to the group.
All orders made over the Black Friday weekend will also be honoured, the administrators added.
Sir Philip Green's retail empire had failed to secure extra funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic.
The group, which runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, said 9,294 employees are currently on furlough.
The administration will give Arcadia breathing space from creditors, such as landlords for its shops or clothing suppliers, while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. Arcadia executives will still hold day-to-day control over the business.
Ian Grabiner, the boss of Arcadia, said it marked an ""incredibly sad"" day for the group.
""The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the forced closure of our stores for prolonged periods, has severely impacted on trading across all of our brands,"" he said.
""Throughout this immensely challenging time our priority has been to protect jobs and preserve the financial stability of the group, in the hope that we could ride out the pandemic and come out fighting on the other side.
""Ultimately, however, in the face of the most difficult trading conditions we have ever experienced, the obstacles we encountered were far too severe.""
Matt Smith, joint administrator at Deloitte, said that it would be working with Arcadia management to assess all of the options available to the group's brands, which also include Evans and Outfit.
He said Deloitte would rapidly seek expressions of interest and expected to identify one, or more, buyers to hopefully ensure the future of the businesses.
Fashion retailer Boohoo is seen as a potential buyer for some of Arcadia Group's big name brands, such as Topshop. In the past it has bought struggling brands Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast.
The prospects for the 13,000 workers look very challenging. There is a lot of industry chatter that online-only retailers might want to snap up the names that still have some consumer power - such as Topshop and Topman.
But while the likes of Boohoo and Asos may want the brands, they will not want to take on a portfolio of physical stores - which is where most of the jobs are. Other brands like Wallis, Evans, Dorothy Perkins and Burton are not considered very relevant to a new generation of consumers.
And what of Sir Philip? His gruff and combative style belies - or is perhaps explained by - the fact he is much more thin-skinned and sensitive than you might think. He will feel this failure personally - but that will be little comfort to the thousands of employees facing an uncertain future with Christmas round the corner and rising unemployment limiting their other job options.
He is also very stubborn. That resistance to change, and insisting he knew best, was at the heart of Arcadia's demise. It's hard to see another act in what has been a career full of drama and controversy.
As many have said, at heart he was not really a retailer - he was a shrewd financier - a money man. The future of retail requires a very different skill-set.
Arcadia was once a darling of the High Street, but long before coronavirus, Sir Philip's brands were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing.
Julie Palmer, partner at professional services firm Begbies Traynor, said: ""While the Covid-19 crisis has undoubtedly accelerated the company's decline, in reality, the writing had been on the wall for Arcadia for some time.
""Its competitors forged ahead with high-profile online propositions that it simply failed to match.""
In its most recent accounts for the year to 1 September 2018, Arcadia reported a Â£93.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£164.6m profit in the previous 12 months. It also said sales fell 4.5% to Â£1.8bn.
The pandemic did also lead to a huge drop-off in sales as stores had to shut for long stretches.
While the business persuaded its landlords to lower its rents in June, it was not enough to steady the ship.
Arcadia's 13,000 workers now face an anxious wait. One store manager told the BBC they felt ""angry, sad and disappointed"" on Monday.
""I've now got a large team that's all terrified of what's going to happen to them and their futures"", they said.
""I am just hoping that something can be done to preserve the brands and the employees' jobs.""
Dave Gill, from retail trade union Usdaw, said: ""It is crucial that the voice of staff is heard over the future of the business.
""We are seeking urgent meetings [with the administrators] and need assurances on what efforts are being made to save jobs, the plan for stores to continue trading and the funding of the pension scheme.""
Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund, which has 10,000 members.
Stephen Timms, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, called on Sir Philip to cover a shortfall in the pension scheme and urged the pension watchdog to fight on behalf of the group's workers.
Business Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted on Monday that the independent Pensions Regulator ""has a range of powers to protect pension schemes"", and that he would be keeping a ""very close eye"" on the administrators' report on director conduct.
Sir Philip previously faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m.
Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. Meanwhile, Mr Chappell was recently sentenced to six years for tax evasion.
Arcadia is the latest major retailer to have been hammered by store closures during the pandemic.
Competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed in March.
The collapse of Arcadia could also affect Debenhams as it is feared it could scupper a sale of the department store chain to JD Sports.
Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. It sells brands such as Miss Selfridge and Evans across the department store chain.
JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year.
Debenhams has already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has about 12,000 employees across 124 stores.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate scientists on both sides of the debate agree on one thing: the earth’s surface and atmosphere have (unexpectedly) stopped warming; there’s been no temperature increase in over 17 years and counting.
While global warming scientists insist the pause is only temporary and that warming will resume in earnest sometime in the future (once the missing heat comes out of hiding), other scientists are very skeptical. Today a growing number of distinguished scientists all over the globe believe the earth will be cooling due to the forces of natural cycles that have recently come into play.
Yet as many scientists are making forecasts of cooling, there’s one fact that seems to have escaped them: the datasets of the world’s leading climate data institutes clearly show that planetary cooling is already taking place and has been happening for over a decade.

Chart source: www.woodfortrees.org. 
Danish solar scientist Henrik Svensmark recently declared: “Global warming has stopped and a cooling is beginning.” The cold reality, however, is that the cooling actually started 12 years ago!
There are more signs other than temperature readings that show global cooling is in full swing. Antarctica has just set a new record positive sea ice anomaly. Global sea ice has been mostly above average for a year and half, flying in the face of stunned scientists who warned just 5 years ago that the Arctic could soon be ice-free in the summertime. Moreover Asia, Europe and North America have been hard hit by a string of unexpectedly harsh winters.

So how cold is it going to get and for how long?
Although a large number of scientists agree on cooling, they differ widely on how much and for how long.
Geologist and climate researcher Sebastian Lüning of Germany in a just released video forecasts a global cooling of 0.2° by 2030, before it starts to warm up again. However, many scientists see this as too mild of a forecast. Russian solar physicist Habibullo Abdussamatov, for example, predicts another Little Ice Age by 2055. Also Russia’s Pulkovo Observatory claims we “could be in for a cooling period that lasts 200-250 years.”
Long list of experts
At his Climate Depot website, Marc Morano has a list of a number of renowned scientists who believe the data are clear on what’s ahead.
Prominent geologist Dr. Don Easterbrook warns that “global cooling is almost a slam dunk” for up to 30 years or more. The Australian Astronomical Society warns of global cooling as the sun’s activity “significantly diminishes”.
The reason for the cooling? Scientists agree that it’s natural solar and oceanic cycles overpowering the overhyped effects of greenhouse trace-gas CO2.

"The uncertainty of the future is a universal concern. Humans have always tried to see into the future with the aid of specialist knowledge – from the days when rulers consulted haruspices and diviners, to our contemporary obsession with risk assessment. Exposed to natural hazards throughout different phases of human history – from predators when we were hunter–gatherers to droughts and pests when we became agriculturalists – we’ve tried to find ways of knowing more about what might be around the corner. Today we handle the future using probabilities rather than animal entrails. Scientific tools, of which statistical analysis is one, have allowed us to intervene in the natural world in ways our ancestors would not have imagined possible. At the same time, we share with them some of their vulnerability to natural hazards. But thanks to our ability to transform the world around us, we also increasingly face hazards that are no longer simply natural.  Climate change and bacterial antibiotic resistance are two examples, both being unintended and unwanted outcomes of natural processes combined with human interventions. The recent floods in the UK, and their relationship to flood management practices, represent another example – in which climate change is also implicated. The question vexing policymakers in the wake of these events is: how to decide what to do about their likely future recurrence? Here, statistics may be less helpful. The reliability of the picture they give us of the future is dependent on future outcomes being statistically comparable to past ones. What we may fail to recognise is that this assumption is often wrong.  Estimates of probability based on past data treat past outcomes as random. But when humans act the outcomes are not random. We act with particular goals in mind.  Our capacity for changing the world – particularly when our efforts combine with complex natural processes – can even create phenomena that are entirely novel in human experience, such as human-caused climate change and ozone depletion. Scientists studying climate change concur. They point out that the novel nature of human-caused climate change means that past estimates of the probability of flooding will no longer be reliable guides to the future. Oxford University’s Myles Allan suggests “just looking back at the historical record to plan flood defences or set insurance premiums is increasingly misleading”. And Reading’s Nigel Arnell says: “We have long been exposed to risk from flooding, but climate change is loading the dice.” Of the rest of us, 80% suspect this is true. The extent to which such conclusions are shaping public policy is, however, debatable.  The Enlightenment taught us to make (or at least, claim to be making) decisions about what we should do, now and in the future, on the basis of reliable knowledge about the past. For us, this has come to mean rigorous statistical research. Much of our way of thinking about decisions is therefore tied up with the consequentialist moral philosophy implicit in this belief. We want to know what the outcomes of our actions are likely to be, so that we can weigh up risks and benefits and then act accordingly.  Bureaucrats bind themselves by rules that prescribe decision making procedures of this kind, such as those in the Treasury’s Green Book. Yet when faced with a genuinely novel phenomenon like human-caused climate change, we find ourselves in a situation in which we do not have access to the data our consequentialist habits of mind require. We cannot wait for this data to become available. Whatever we do about human-caused climate change, we will need to make decisions in a state of uncertainty. However well-constructed climate models are, we cannot afford to test them by waiting to see if the scenarios they outline are in fact correct. The underdeveloped branch of moral philosophy that deals with the ethics of risk gives us some pointers on how we can proceed when the outcomes of possible courses of action are unknown. For example, if we face situations where our actions create greater uncertainties about how the future will turn out, then we should not act as if business as usual will continue.  This is, however, often not what the rules encourage bureaucrats to do. Following economic orthodoxy, they tend to assume, for example, that future generations will continue to be better off than present ones. The Green Book accordingly instructs policymakers to discount the future – to set a lower value on outcomes in the future than on ones nearer to the present.  But if there are plausible reasons to think business will not continue as usual, then the welfare of future generations has to count for more in policy than it does now. If the future facing us is, thanks to human activity, no longer what it used to be, then uncertainty is a reason for acting to prevent harm rather than for waiting."

 _The Limits of the Market: The Pendulum between Government and Market_  
Paul De Grauwe  
New York: Oxford University Press, 2017, 165 pp.  
  




In the preface to _The Limits of the Market,_ Paul De Grauwe, an economics professor at the London School of Economics, begins with two basic premises: first, that a centrally planned economy does not work; second, that pure market systems do not exist anywhere. According to De Grauwe, “The only relevant question, then, is how precisely that mixture should look”—that is, the correct mix of market freedom and public policy oversight.



He writes of a “Great Economic Pendulum”—that swings between greater and lesser government intervention—“cyclical movements” in economic history. To illustrate this, he describes a general decline in government involvement in the world economy during the first part of the 20th century. Then the Great Depression ushered in greater government involvement that continued through the middle decades of the century. That gave way to renewed market liberalization in the 1980s, which ended with the Great Recession. With this brief overview of modern economic history as his departure point, he begins to explain what he sees as the limits of capitalism.



“The limits of a market system relate to the fact that the connection between individual and collective rationality can be severed,” De Grauwe writes. He identifies two types of situations in which large numbers of people do not believe that their own interests are being met satisfactorily by markets. The first type, which he labels “external limits,” and others commonly call “externalities,” involves individual decisions that have a positive or negative effect on others. The second category, “internal limits,” involves the conflict between individuals’ “System I” decision-making—relying on intuition and emotion—and “System II” decision-making—relying on reason. These two systems are connected and require a satisfying balance between emotional and rational demands in order for the market system to work effectively. Often, however, this balance of individual and collective rationality is not maintained.



DeGrauwe argues that individuals do not take into account the external effects of their individual decisions. He offers three examples of this: climate change and global warming (“carbon dioxide as a harmful gas generating external costs across geographic borders”); financial markets (“a banking crisis where the system reaches its limits before collapsing and requiring a government bail‐​out”); and public goods and the free‐​rider problem (“the market system has no mechanism for creating public goods”).



He discusses how the expansion of the market system brings it to its “internal limits.” He identifies three mechanisms that lead to the discrepancy between individual and collective well‐​being.



The first mechanism has to do with markets and distribution, whereby the price system leads to an inequality of income and wealth, a sense of injustice, and a desire for individual charity on the part of those able to purchase a good (“sharing with those not able to pay for a product”), as well as a possible revolt by those individuals in the lowest income groups (“protests and violent revolutions”).



The second mechanism has to do with intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation means “that people are motivated to put their effort into their work or other activities because they are fulfilled by the work or activity itself.” Extrinsic motivation means “that people make an effort for the sake of the financial reward for a particular activity.” Reconciling these two diametrically opposed motivations is inherently challenging, as managers find it easier to focus on extrinsic motivations involving financial bonuses (which are easily eliminated when managers are confronted by company financial duress).



The third mechanism has to do with competition and cooperation in the market environment. Though both can encourage good market behavior, competition and cooperation can conflict with each other on both emotional and rational levels, resulting in an internal tension between individual and collective well‐​being.



De Grauwe next addresses what he refers to as the “utopia of market self‐​regulation.” While so‐​called market fundamentalists argue that problems concerning the environment and public goods are grounded in a lack of property rights and solutions lie in somehow creating those rights, De Grauwe questions how such rights are possible. For instance, how can government establish ownership rights when people all over the world are negatively affected by air pollution? How does one identify billions of harmed people who will seek legal compensation from billions of other people who are responsible for their injuries, and in what court of law (De Grauwe calls this a “complicated information problem”)? But, as he notes, even if one were able to solve this information problem—that is, through the highly unlikely scenario of negotiating voluntary agreements with billions of people—the legislative branch will have to assign property rights in law (or negotiate those voluntary agreements), and the courts and police will have to enforce those rights—thus inevitably involving government institutions.



Given this need for government to ultimately save the market from its own destruction, De Grauwe discusses three domains where government policy and normative theory have a role in managing the market: externalities (by levying taxes on those engaging in undesirable behavior), supplying public goods (and eliminating the free‐​rider problem in market responses), and redistribution (of income and wealth on the highest incomes, thus providing the socially and politically stabilizing effects of greater equality). However, he recognizes that, while the government may know what it must do, that does not always mean that it will implement such policies. Why? Because government is also subject to limitations.



According to De Grauwe, politicians are prevented from following the normative prescriptions of economic theory. The external limits of government, he writes, involve externalities related to the collective interest, say for environmental protection. This is a similar discrepancy that exists with the external limits of markets, but, unlike the market where individuals resist the efforts of governments to harm private interests in favor of the collective, the discrepancy works in the opposite direction: individuals make decisions that harm the collective good. In this case, the challenge for government (especially in democratic societies) is to close the difference between individual and collective rationality, thus gaining broader support from their citizens for the government’s decisions.



As De Grauwe points out, the free market appeals to the individual’s rational, calculating side at the expense of his or her emotional side. Thus, government appeals to the emotional side—or the dissatisfaction gap left by the free market—and is the mechanism through which emotions are expressed. To this end, government focuses its efforts on distribution problems, motivated by a universal sense of fairness. Emotional appeals to “fairness” win out over rational appeals to profit and efficiency.



Government, however, faces two limits. The first—redistribution at the expense of efficiency—holds that neither excessive equality nor excessive inequality is good for efficiency. Most capitalist regimes tend to reflect this principle. The second—a balance between emotion and reason—recognizes that the more governments work on redistribution the more they tax individuals and limit individual freedom. An example of this is embodied in a public‐​pension system, where, if government does not keep moral hazard under control, the citizen’s sense of fairness is overwhelmed by too many “free‐​riders” exploiting the system.



De Grauwe notes that discussions on the role of markets and government have been ongoing for centuries “between people who believed that the market system was the foundation of economic organization (and creates the economic value that makes it possible to maintain the public sector) or that the task was reserved for government (as it establishes and enforces property rights).” That traditional view is espoused by both market fundamentalists and government fundamentalists, and is often portrayed as a pyramid hierarchy, with either the market or government at the top. So who is in charge?



De Grauwe argues that such hierarchical thinking is wrong, as both the private and public sectors are necessary and it is equally important for both sectors to operate effectively. To that end he offers a nonhierarchal, elliptical portrayal of the relationship of market and government. As he explains:



If the government does not succeed in making those who generate external costs from market activities pay for them, then at some point the market system will come to an end. In the same way we can conclude that a government which does not succeed in providing essential public goods such as infrastructure, law and order, public safety, and education will lead the way to the downfall of the market system



The only relevant question worth asking, he writes, is how the division of labor between markets and government can best be organized.



De Grauwe next reviews theories of the linear historical demise of capitalism proposed by Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Schumpter, and Karl Polanyi. In response to their critiques, he explains that the empirical data of the last 200 years have shown a cyclical—not linear—movement. The market system hits its limit, wanes temporarily, and is replaced by a state system that is full of internal contradictions that will lead to its demise, eventually to be replaced by a resurrection of the market system.



De Grauwe also views the creation of the eurozone (and by extension, the euro) as a threat to national governments. He explains how a eurozone government issues debt in a currency over which it has no control. Thus, the national government cannot offer any guarantee to bondholders that the euros will be available to pay them on the maturity date. Thus, without a national guarantee, the implication is that the financial markets can force national governments into insolvency against their will, which will lead to a dangerous supremacy of the markets. De Grauwe believes that the market has forced many eurozone countries (such as Greece, Portugal, and Spain) to adopt excessive austerity budgets that have led to increasing unemployment and the collapse of parts of the public pension system.



To better understand the limits of capitalism, he refers to the results of Thomas Piketty’s _Capital in the Twenty‐​First Century_. Piketty begins his analysis by evaluating the long‐​term development of the quantity of (net) capital in the economies of the western world, focusing his historical analysis on France and Great Britain (although referencing the United States). He finds that, in the very long term, capital income is higher than the growth of the economy, thus the return on capital is greater than the growth of gross domestic product. De Grauwe believes the implications of Piketty’s research are reflected by the increasingly large proportion of top incomes in capitalist societies that go to the _rentiers_ —the investors in capital. To save both democracy and capital, Piketty’s solution is to offset the great inequality in _rentier_ assets by instituting a progressive wealth tax, thereby saving capitalism from the capitalists.



In his concluding chapter, De Grauwe acknowledges there will always be pendulum swings between market and government. In the 21st century, he views the natural environment as an external limit toward which the market system is rapidly headed, and the tendency for greater income inequality as an internal limit of the market system. A reformist scenario, however, has governments raising taxes on high incomes and wealth, thus making inequality less extreme and more acceptable to society in the 21st century. By instituting this policy, governments would allow the market system to softly come up against its internal limits. Likewise, citizenry would apply democratic pressure on governments to combat pollution (such as carbon dioxide) by using taxes and regulations, and to provide subsidies for alternative energy sources. Therefore, this policy response halts environmental degradation and allows the market to more gently approach its external limits.



De Grauwe’s basic framework offers a plausible explaination for how the pendulum swings between a mix of market freedom and government oversight and intervention. Modern economic history, with the cyclic swings in western democracies embracing capitalism bears this out. What that “mix” should be, however, is less convincing. He admits that he has evolved into less of a supporter of market forces, which is reflected in the title of his book. His argument is based on his belief that “neither market nor government is more important,” yet he emphasizes examples of market failure far more than examples of government failure, though the latter includes such drastic examples as failed communist regimes or the potential for eurozone failure to back sovereign‐​issued debt. This book would have been improved if De Grauwe had dealt in finer detail with the true limits of government, for example by including the theory on nonmarket failure in democratic and capitalist societies as developed by Ronald Coase and Charles J. Wolfe, among others.



For example, De Grauwe uses the economic recession of 2008, specifically the financial services sector, as an example of market failure. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a U.S. commission charged with investigating the causes of the financial crisis, reported in 2011 that, while the modern financial system was evolving, government regulation did not keep pace with the rising risks in the U.S. economy. As the report states, “We had a 21st century financial system with 19th century safeguards.” That was not a market failure, but a government one—specifically, an egregious example of how the federal government performed inadequately and did not sufficiently intervene. This form of nonmarket failure is characterized as regulatory arbitrage, where financial institutions take advantage of the differences between economic risk and the existing regulatory position.



On the market side, De Grauwe discusses market failures in self‐​regulation but does little to explore rich examples of successful private ordering. Recent work by economist Edward Stringham ( _Private Governance: Creating Order in Economic and Social Life_ ) offers a rational approach to addressing when government or markets are warranted to solve societal problems. Private governance is practiced by clubs and voluntary associations in the marketplace, through electronic payment processing, for example. Other examples include best industry practices, as well as codified industry standards, which are developed in the United States by associations without direct government involvement. (Such standards are often later incorporated by reference in administrative rules.) While often requiring a certain level of government intervention, for example, to adjudicate and enforce contracts, such private ordering is an example of how markets can operate creatively and effectively with limited government intervention and oversight.



In conclusion, De Grauwe offers the reader a thought‐​provoking book and a basic theoretical and empirical departure point for further work on an important topic relevant to the future of democratic capitalism. Public policy issues of income inequality (especially a stagnant or declining economic middle class), crushing national debt, public pension and health insurance funding shortfalls, and the ever intrusive and coercive regulatory state (and loss of liberty) are coming due. The important question still remains: What is the right mix of market and state?

"In a connected world, with scientists warning rapid emissions cuts are needed to address the climate crisis, the Marinus Link reads as an elegant solution. A proposed 1,500 megawatt undersea electricity cable between Burnie, in north-west Tasmania, and Gippsland in Victoria, it would quadruple the amount of electricity that can be sent in either direction across Bass Strait.  As of Monday, the $3.5bn project is earmarked to have its environmental and planning approvals fast-tracked after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, included it on a list of 15 priority projects. But while Marinus Link has broad political support, it is three years from a final investment decision, does not yet have anyone to pay for it and has been sharply criticised by Tasmania’s most high-profile environment campaigners. Some energy analysts say it is unclear when, or even if, its electricity will be needed. The case for the link is straightforward. Unlike the rest of the country, Tasmania already runs on near 100% clean hydro energy. The federal and state governments plan to increase hydro capacity through the “battery of the nation” project, which would introduce pumped hydro storage – additional generation capacity that could be called on when needed to back up wind and solar. The north of Tasmania is also particularly gusty, making it well suited for wind farms. The Liberal state government has set a target of 200% renewable energy by 2040 and is eyeing possible clean export industries. Victoria, on the other hand, gets about three-quarters of its electricity from the dirtiest coal power stations in the country. As these ageing plants close in the years ahead, it and other mainland states will need to be able to call on a range of flexible energy sources to “firm” variable renewable energy. Better connection between the states is considered a key part of this. Guy Barnett, the Tasmanian energy minister, puts it simply. “We have what the rest of Australia wants and needs – affordable, reliable and clean electricity.” With the existing 500 megawatt Basslink often running at full capacity, Barnett says Marinus Link is needed to deliver this vision. The state has three earmarked renewable energy zones for development. “There are rich pickings for wind developers and the opportunities are massive,” he says. Government-owned agency TasNetworks says the project is expected to be delivered in two 750 megawatt halves, two years apart. Some appraisals have suggested it could be the first of many further cable links across the strait. The proponents estimate the project would create 2,800 direct and indirect jobs during construction, pumping stimulus into the two states’ economies. But little of that stimulus would be immediate. An investment decision is not expected until 2023-24, and it would then take about four years from manufacturing to commissioning. Among the unanswered questions is who will pay for it. Some Tasmanian analysts have expressed concern that the state will be picking up the tab for a project built to solve a problem across Bass Strait. Barnett says the Coag energy council commissioned an assessment of the fair distribution of costs, with a report expected in September. Morrison’s priority listing is unlikely to bring forward the development, but Bess Clark, general manager of the project at TasNetworks, says it will make a difference. “Having a more streamlined process is very helpful because it helps to de-risk the project investment decision,” she says. The renewable energy industry strongly backs the project. Kane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, says it will be critical to bring on more wind and solar projects in southern Australia and drive down power prices. “These are long-term projects that will provide steady, secure and value-adding employment in Australia.” But views within Tasmanian environment groups are mixed. Among the strongest opponents are Tasmania’s best known conservationists and campaigners, the former Australians Greens leaders Bob Brown and Christine Milne. Brown argues the project does not stand up economically without subsidies, and some of the proposed wind farms would turn pristine wilderness areas into an “industrial landscape” with little benefit for locals. He is particularly incensed by the 100km-long easement that would need to be cleared to connect the cable to the proposed $1.6bn Robbins Island wind farm in the state’s far north-west, fearing it would cut through Tarkine wilderness. The hero of the Franklin Dam campaign says renewable energy is developing rapidly and would continue without Marinus Link. “The idea that Tasmania is somehow the saviour from fossil fuels is absurd,” Brown says.  Barnett accuses Brown of “appalling hypocrisy” and says all projects would be “subject to rigorous development and environmental approvals” and measures to minimise impacts on threatened species. One of the most challenging questions about the project to answer is what the electricity market would look like in the latter part of the decade should it go ahead. Sceptics point out that a draft feasibility study published in December suggested 7,000MW of coal-fired power – equivalent to five or six large plants on top of the Liddell power station, which is scheduled to close in 2023 – would need to exit the market for it to be economically viable. While the federal government is a strong supporter of Marinus Link, it has previously indicated it wants coal generators to run as long as possible. No plan has been laid out for plants to shut at a certain timeframe to make room for new planned major investments such as those in Tasmania and the expansion of the Snowy Hydro. Clark says the suggestion that 7,000MW of coal would need to be retired was as result of “trying to be simple” in explaining what a future grid might look like. In reality, she says, complex modelling suggests Marinus Link is an optimal part of a future grid under a range of scenarios. Others think there are plenty of questions yet to be answered. Tennant Reed, an energy adviser at the Australian Industry Group, says Morrison’s announcement of a more rapid approval process does not hurt, but the main thing holding the Tasmanian plans back is uncertainty about when mainland power stations will shut. “Unless that comes, you could approve the project tomorrow and it still wouldn’t commence til past 2030,” Reed says. “Marinus and the battery of the nation sit among many options for grid flexibility as old coal retires. We don’t know which will be best, but getting the whole economy to net zero emissions by 2050 is going to require a lot of smart investments.”"

Earth, covered in ice. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)
It makes you wonder what created all that CO2 millions of years ago.
From Louisiana State University
LSU researchers find new information about ‘Snowball Earth’ period
It is rather difficult to imagine, but approximately 635 million years ago, ice may have covered a vast portion of our planet in an event called “Snowball Earth.” According to the Snowball Earth hypothesis, the massive ice age that occurred before animal life appeared, when Earth’s landmasses were most likely clustered near the equator, precipitated relatively rapid changes in atmospheric conditions and a subsequent greenhouse heat wave. This particular period of extensive glaciation and subsequent climate changes might have supplied the cataclysmic event that gave rise to modern levels of atmospheric oxygen, paving the way for the rise of animals and the diversification of life during the later Cambrian explosion.
But if ice covered the earth all the way to the tropics during what is known as the Marinoan glaciation, how did the planet spring back from the brink of an ice apocalypse? Huiming Bao, Charles L. Jones Professor in Geology & Geophysics at LSU, might have some of the answers. 
Bao and LSU graduate students Bryan Killingsworth and Justin Hayles, together with Chuanming Zhou, a colleague at Chinese Academy of Sciences, had an article published on Feb. 5 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, or PNAS, that provides new clues on the duration of what was a significant change in atmospheric conditions following the Marinoan glaciation.
“The story is to put a time limit on how fast our Earth system can recover from a total frozen state,” Bao said. “It is about a unique and rapidly changing post-glacial world, but is also about the incredible resilience of life and life’s remarkable ability to restore a new balance between atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere after a global glaciation.”
Bao’s group went about investigating the post-glaciation period of Snowball Earth by looking at unique occurrences of “crystal fans” of a common mineral known as barite (BaSO4), deposited in rocks following the Marinoan glaciation. Out of the three stable isotopes of oxygen, O-16, O-17 and O-18, Bao’s group pays close attention to the relatively scarce isotope O-17. According to Killingsworth, there aren’t many phenomena on earth that can change the normally expected ratio of the scare isotope O-17 to more abundant isotope O-18. However, in sulfate minerals such as barite in rock samples from around 635 million years ago, Bao’s group finds large deviations in the normal ratio of O-17 to O-18 with respect to O-16 isotopes.
“If something unusual happens with the composition of the atmosphere, the oxygen isotope ratios can change,” Killingsworth said. “We see a large deviation in this ratio in minerals deposited around 635 million years ago. This occurred during an extremely odd time in atmospheric history.”
According to Bao’s group, the odd oxygen isotope ratios they find in barite samples from 635 million years ago could have occurred if, following the extensive Snowball Earth glaciation, Earth’s atmosphere had very high levels of carbon dioxide, or CO2. An ultra-high carbon dioxide atmosphere, Killingsworth explains, where CO2 levels match levels of atmospheric oxygen, would grab more O-17 from oxygen. This would cause a depletion of the O-17 isotope in air and subsequently in barite minerals, which incorporate oxygen as they grow. Bao’s group has found worldwide deposits of this O-17 depleted sulfate mineral in rocks dating from the global glaciation event 635 million years ago, indicating an episode of an ultra-high carbon dioxide atmosphere following the Marinoan glaciation.
“Something significant happened in the atmosphere,” Killingsworth said. “This kind of an atmospheric shift in carbon dioxide is not observed during any other period of Earth’s history. And now we have sedimentary rock evidence for how long this ultra-high carbon dioxide period lasted.”
By using available radiometric dates from areas near layers of barite deposits, Bao’s group has been able to come up with an estimate for the duration of what is now called the Marinoan Oxygen-17 Depletion, or MOSD, event. Bao’s group estimates the MOSD duration at 0 – 1 million years.
“This is, so far, really the best estimate we could get from geological records, in line with previous models of how long an ultra-high carbon dioxide event could last before the carbon dioxide in the air would get drawn back into the oceans and sediments,” Killingsworth said.
Normally, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are in balance with levels of carbon dioxide in the ocean. However, if water and air were cut off by a thick layer of ice during Snowball Earth, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could have increased drastically. In a phenomenon similar to the climate change Earth is witnessing in modern times, high levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide would have created a greenhouse gas warming effect, trapping heat inside the planet’s atmosphere and melting the Marinoan ice. Essentially, the Marinoan glaciation created the potential for extreme changes in atmospheric chemistry that in turn lead to the end of Snowball Earth and the beginning of a new explosion of animal life on Earth.
While previous work by Bao’s group had advanced the interpretation of the strange occurrence of O-17 depleted barite just after the Marinoan glaciation, there was still much uncertainty on the duration of ultra-high CO2 levels after meltdown of Snowball Earth. Bao’s discovery of a field site with many barite layers gave the opportunity to track how oxygen isotope ratios changed through a thickness of sedimentary rock. As the pages in a novel can be thought of as representing time, so layers of sedimentary rock represent geological history. However, these rock “pages” represented an unknown duration of time for the MOSD event. By using characteristic features of the Marinoan rock sequence occurring regionally in South China, Bao’s group linked the barite layer site to other sites in the region that did have precise dates from volcanic ash beds. Bao’s group has succeeded in estimating the duration of the MOSD event, and thus the time it took for Earth to restore “normal” CO2 levels in the atmosphere.
“To some extent, our findings demonstrate that whatever happens to Earth, she will recover, and recover at a rapid pace,” Bao said. “Mother Earth lived and life carried on even in the most devastating situation. The only difference is the life composition afterwards. In other words, whatever humans do to the Earth, life will go on. The only uncertainty is whether humans will still remain part of the life composition.”
Bao says that he had been interested in this most intriguing episode of Earth’s history since Paul Hoffman, Dan Schrag and colleagues revived the Snowball Earth hypothesis in 1998.
“I was a casual ‘non-believer’ of this hypothesis because of the mere improbability of such an Earth state,” Bao said. “There was nothing rational or logic in that belief for me, of course. I remember I even told my job interviewers back in 2000 that one of my future research plans was to prove that the Snowball Earth hypothesis was wrong.”
However, during a winter break in 2006, Bao obtained some unusual data from barite, a sulfate mineral dating from the Snowball Earth period that he received from a colleague in China.
“I started to develop my own method to explore this utterly strange world,” Bao said. “Now, it seems that our LSU group is the one offering the strongest supporting evidence for a ‘Snowball Earth’ back 635 million years ago. I certainly did not see this coming. The finding we published in 2008 demonstrates, again, that new scientific breakthroughs are often brought in by outsiders.”
Bao credits his research ideas, analytical work and pleasure of working on this project to his two graduate students, Killingsworth and Hayles, as well as his long-time Chinese collaborators. Bao brought Killingsworth and Hayles to an interior mountainous region in South China in December 2011, where the group succeeded in finding multiple barite layers in a section of rocks dating to 635 million years ago. This discovery formed a large part of their analysis and subsequent publication in PNAS.
“Nothing can beat the intellectual excitement and satisfaction you get from research in the field and in the laboratory,” Bao said.

"ISTANBUL  —   Several hundred people suspected of being Islamic State operatives were arrested in a series of coordinated raids by the Turkish police on Sunday, in what constitutes one of Turkey’s largest operations against the jihadist group on the country’s soil. Nearly 450 suspects were rounded up in the early hours of Sunday, according to the Anadolu Agency, a   news wire. Independent television reports later said 690 suspects had been held by the end of the day. At least one attack was said to have been thwarted in the process, according to Anadolu. The operation was distinct from crackdowns on those accused of being supporters of last summer’s failed coup, and on members of the country’s political opposition. More than 130, 000 Turks have been arrested or fired from government posts in the past seven months as part of those efforts, according to government data. Sunday’s raids were the latest salvo in a   conflict between Turkey and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. In the early years of the Syrian revolution, Turkey was accused of turning a blind eye to the movement of thousands of Islamic State fighters over its southern border with Syria, where they joined the war against the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar  . But the Turkish Army is now in direct conflict with the group in northern Syria, where Turkey is leading attempts to expel the Islamic State from the strategically important city of Al Bab. Turkey has suffered numerous attacks linked to the Islamic State since 2014, most recently in the early hours of this year, when a fighter killed 39 people at a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city. The group is also believed to be behind an October 2015 bombing in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, that killed more than 100 people, and was accused of organizing the killing of 45 people at Istanbul’s main airport last summer. This weekend’s raids occurred across an unusually wide area, with suspects seized in 18 provinces. The move is a change in strategy by the Turkish police, who have usually detained only small numbers of jihadists at a time, said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat, and an analyst who focuses on Turkey for Carnegie Europe, a think tank. But the detentions may not necessarily lead to court cases. “Over all, Turkey’s efforts to combat the influence and network of the Islamic State at home is still handicapped by discrepancies between the different arms of the Turkish state,” Mr. Ulgen said. “An effort led by law enforcement is sometimes handicapped by the decisions of the Turkish judiciary, which as we have seen in the recent past has let go people associated with the Islamic State. ” Ahmet Yayla, a former counterterrorism chief in Turkey and a critic of the Turkish government, also questioned the effectiveness of such a large raid, which he argued could overwhelm the capacity of the counterterrorism police. Officers may not be able to properly handle the paperwork, interrogations and bureaucracy associated with processing more than 50 suspects, said Dr. Yayla, who headed counterterrorism operations in a southeast Turkish province from 2010 to 2012. “It is impossible to process that many terrorists in one operation,” said Dr. Yayla, who now lives in the United States, and who began to publicly criticize the Turkish government after his teenage son was jailed on suspicion of a connection to the coup attempt."

Earlier this week, Vox’s Sean Illing asked 10 law professors whether President Trump’s sweeping refusal to cooperate with congressional investigators has plunged the nation into “a constitutional crisis.” I recommend the article, and I also observe that I’m 100% on Congress’s side regarding the legitimacy of its information queries. Indeed, I’m with my colleague Gene Healy, who has rightfully Tweeted that, “#ExecutivePrivilege is something judges just made up out of penumbras and emanations of Article II.”   
  
  
For this post, however, I argue that congressional oversight, _per se_ , is in its own state of “constitutional crisis” wholly independent from Trump. Specifically, I will make two claims. First, I explain why congressional oversight always has been sub‐​optimal. Then, I explain why contemporary oversight is acutely awful.   
  
  
Even decades ago, when Members of Congress were policy savants relative to now, congressional oversight was known as the body’s “neglected duty.” In a famous 1984 article, Professors Mathew McCubbins and Thomas Schwartz lent a conceptual framework to explain this inadequacy. Their core insight was to identify two types of congressional behavior regarding oversight. The first was the “police patrol,” which describes ongoing monitoring of the law’s execution. The second type was “fire alarm” oversight, by which the professors meant that lawmakers snap to attention only when hot‐​button issues become sufficiently politicized.   
  
  
Quite obviously, the “police patrol” method is superior because, if it is done faithfully, then such supervision could head off the crises that lead to “fire alarms.” Nevertheless, the “fire alarm” approach takes less work, and it reaps more political currency in the form of attention. Due to these incentives, Congress has underinvested in oversight for as long as legislators have delegated power to execute the law.   
  
  
In this manner, oversight was shortchanged in Congress during the first three quarters of the Twentieth Century. Back then, however, a decentralized power structure within the legislature provided a counter‐​incentive for the use of preferable “police patrol” techniques. As I explained in a prior post, Members of that period cared about policy because policy chops were necessary to succeed in Congress. At that time, committees and subcommittees competed with the president to manage administrative agencies, and, as with life generally, competitors do their homework.   
  
  
Starting in the 1980s, however, power in Congress shifted from committees to party leadership. Many factors were at play in causing this change. Crucially, congressional leaders, such as Reps. Tip O’Neil and Newt Gingrich, altered the rules to facilitate centralization. The modernization of mass media played another important role, in that it allowed to party leadership to push a national message. Finally, recurrent impasses with the president over spending and budgets—known as the “fiscalization” of politics—facilitated the centralization of power by creating the necessity for high‐​level negotiations, which, naturally, would be conducted by congressional leaders and thereby enhanced their power accordingly.   
  
  
Due to this shift, partisan affinity now trumps institutional prerogative, such that one party loses interest in oversight whenever “their guy” occupies the White House. Also due to the shift to centralized power, Members of Congress know less about policy‐​making because there’s little incentive to have such knowledge. Each of these factors works to undermine the occasion and performance of “police patrol” superintendence of the administrative state.   
  
  
Yet the current contretemps between Congress and the Trump administration reveals that the legislature’s oversight function has withered further, such that “fire alarm” investigations, too, are falling by the wayside. To be precise, they’ve altered from an inferior form of oversight (relative to “police patrols”) to a worthless form.   
  
  
Historically, “fire alarm” oversight pertained to catastrophes or governing scandals. In either case, the investigatory lodestar was reform. That is, congressional investigations traditionally sought to discern how something bad happened, and then how to try to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Even investigations that don’t easily fit this usual framework—such as Watergate—shared a nexus with governmental reform. Nixon’s excesses inspired institutional responses, including the 1974 Budget and Impoundment Control Act and the 1977 Legislative Reorganization Act.   
  
  
As I survey the current landscape of fire‐​alarm investigations, I see a qualitatively different application in the present day. When it comes to resource allocation for oversight, I can think of any number of “fire alarms” to sound, including:   




Despite these—and many more—worthy targets for serious congressional oversight by opponents of the Trump administration, House leadership is pouring resources into getting Trump’s tax returns and relitigating the Mueller Report. I find Trump as off‐​putting and dangerous as anyone, but these strike me as the silliest possible subjects for oversight.   
  
  
On the one hand, I think these investigations don’t inform anyone. Who doesn’t think Trump would fire subordinates—and then Tweet about it—to head off an investigation? And who doesn’t think Trump exaggerates his wealth all the time? Notwithstanding these qualities, which are baked into Trump’s brand, the American people elected him president, alas. The upshot is that I’m not convinced that these investigations bring much new to the table.   
  
  
More importantly, I fail to see any prospect for reform. Neither of these investigations bears any relationship to a specific policy outcome. It’s all about Trump, the man, and none about Trump, the policymaker. Nor am I sanguine about the prospect that these investigations ultimately could inspire institutional reforms the way that Watergate did. Well into the third year of this presidency, I have not once seen the democrats reach out to Never‐​Trumpers to explore curbing the power of the office. Instead, the majority in the House seems to want only to damage Trump politically, and otherwise maintain the president’s power for when their party takes control.   
  
  
In sum, I wholeheartedly support Congress’s right to information from President Trump, but I also bemoan its present use of that right.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
Since we’ve been discussing smoothing in datasets, I thought I’d repost something that Steve McIntyre had graciously allowed me to post on his amazing blog ClimateAudit back in 2008.
—————————————————————————————–
Data Smoothing and Spurious Correlation
Allan Macrae has posted an interesting study at ICECAP. In the study he argues that the changes in temperature (tropospheric and surface) precede the changes in atmospheric CO2 by nine months. Thus, he says, CO2 cannot be the source of the changes in temperature, because it follows those changes.
Being a curious and generally disbelieving sort of fellow, I thought I’d take a look to see if his claims were true. I got the three datasets (CO2, tropospheric, and surface temperatures), and I have posted them up here. These show the actual data, not the month-to-month changes.
In the Macrae study, he used smoothed datasets (12 month average) of the month-to-month change in temperature (∆T) and CO2 (∆CO2) to establish the lag between the change in CO2 and temperature . Accordingly, I did the same. [My initial graph of the raw and smoothed data is shown above as Figure 1, I repeat it here with the original caption.]

￼Figure 1. Cross-correlations of raw and 12-month smoothed UAH MSU Lower Tropospheric Temperature change (∆T) and Mauna Loa CO2 change (∆CO2). Smoothing is done with a Gaussian average, with a “Full Width to Half Maximum” (FWHM) width of 12 months (brown line). Red line is correlation of raw unsmoothed data (referred to as a “0 month average”). Black circle shows peak correlation.
At first glance, this seemed to confirm his study. The smoothed datasets do indeed have a strong correlation of about 0.6 with a lag of nine months (indicated by the black circle). However, I didn’t like the looks of the averaged data. The cycle looked artificial. And more to the point, I didn’t see anything resembling a correlation at a lag of nine months in the unsmoothed data.
Normally, if there is indeed a correlation that involves a lag, the unsmoothed data will show that correlation, although it will usually be stronger when it is smoothed. In addition, there will be a correlation on either side of the peak which is somewhat smaller than at the peak. So if there is a peak at say 9 months in the unsmoothed data, there will be positive (but smaller) correlations at 8 and 10 months. However, in this case, with the unsmoothed data there is a negative correlation for 7, 8, and 9 months lag.
Now Steve McIntyre has posted somewhere about how averaging can actually create spurious correlations (although my google-fu was not strong enough to find it). I suspected that the correlation between these datasets was spurious, so I decided to look at different smoothing lengths. These look like this:

Figure 2. Cross-correlations of raw and smoothed UAH MSU Lower Tropospheric Temperature change (∆T) and Mauna Loa CO2 change (∆CO2). Smoothing is done with a Gaussian average, with a “Full Width to Half Maximum” (FWHM) width as given in the legend. Black circles shows peak correlation for various smoothing widths. As above, a “0 month” average shows the lagged correlations of the raw data itself.
Note what happens as the smoothing filter width is increased. What start out as separate tiny peaks at about 3-5 and 11-14 months end up being combined into a single large peak at around nine months. Note also how the lag of the peak correlation changes as the smoothing window is widened. It starts with a lag of about 4 months (purple and blue 2 month and 6 month smoothing lines). As the smoothing window increases, the lag increases as well, all the way up to 17 months for the 48 month smoothing. Which one is correct, if any?
To investigate what happens with random noise, I constructed a pair of series with similar autoregressions, and I looked at the lagged correlations. The original dataset is positively autocorrelated (sometimes called “red” noise). In general, the change (∆T or ∆CO2) in a positively autocorrelated dataset is negatively autocorrelated (sometimes called “blue noise”). Since the data under investigation is blue, I used blue random noise with the same negative autocorrelation for my test of random data. However, the exact choice is immaterial to the smoothing issue.
This was my first result using random data:

Figure 3. Cross-correlations of raw and smoothed random (blue noise) datasets. Smoothing is done with a Gaussian average, with a “Full Width to Half Maximum” (FWHM) width as given in the legend. Black circles show peak correlations for various smoothings.
Note that as the smoothing window increases in width, we see the same kind of changes we saw in the temperature/CO2 comparison. There appears to be a correlation between the smoothed random series, with a lag of about 7 months. In addition, as the smoothing window widens, the maximum point is pushed over, until it occurs at a lag which does not show any correlation in the raw data.
After making the first graph of the effect of smoothing width on random blue noise, I noticed that the curves were still rising on the right. So I graphed the correlations out to 60 months. This is the result:

￼Figure 4. Rescaling of Figure 3, showing the effect of lags out to 60 months.
Note how, once again, the smoothing (even for as short a period as six months, green line) converts a non-descript region (say lag +30 to +60, right part of the graph) into a high correlation region, by the lumping together of individual peaks. Remember, this was just random blue noise, none of these are represent real lagged relationships despite the high correlation.
My general conclusion from all of this is to avoid looking for lagged correlations in smoothed datasets, they’ll lie to you. I was surprised by the creation of apparent, but totally spurious, lagged correlations when the data is smoothed.
And for the $64,000 question … is the correlation found in the Macrae study valid, or spurious? I truly don’t know, although I strongly suspect that it is spurious. But how can we tell?
My best to everyone,
w.

"LONDON  —   To celebrate Queen Elizabeth II’s sapphire jubilee on Monday, marking 65 years on the British throne, there were new coins, a new stamp, gun salutes, and a reissued portrait taken by a famed photographer. The only thing missing? The queen, who, in keeping with past practice on the anniversary itself, planned to observe the day privately, with a quiet reflective commemoration at her estate in Sandringham, in eastern England. Grander celebrations are in the works for the platinum jubilee in 2022. Royal jubilees commemorate the life and reign of monarchs. Elizabeth, 90, the world’s   monarch, is the first British sovereign to hold a sapphire jubilee. The events were relatively muted compared to the silver (25 years) gold (50 years) and diamond (60 years) jubilees, which were celebrated with   festivities across Britain. There was a ruby jubilee to mark Elizabeth’s 40 years as queen, but that anniversary was also  . Few British monarchs have reached the   milestone. King George III and Queen Victoria marked their golden jubilees with huge celebrations. Elizabeth was expected to spend the anniversary at Sandringham, and there will be no broader celebrations in coming days, as there had been for previous jubilees. She was apparently in “good spirits” at a church service on Sunday, local news outlets reported. There have been concerns about the queen’s health ever since she missed church services on Christmas Day and on New Year’s Day because of what Buckingham Palace described as a “heavy cold. ” Those absences were the first time in about 30 years that she had missed a holiday service. The queen made her first public appearance this year on Jan. 8, after a month’s absence. She celebrated her diamond jubilee, in 2012, with a series of events, including a floating pageant on the River Thames and a tour across Britain. A traditional   royal salute was held at Green Park in London. That was followed by a   salute at the Tower of London. A 2014 portrait of the queen, taken by the British photographer David Bailey, wearing sapphire jewelry given to her by her father, King George VI, as a wedding gift in 1947, was published as part of the commemoration. The Royal Mail issued a stamp worth 5 pounds, or about $6. 25, to mark her accession to the throne, and ranges of special jubilee coins have been cast by the Royal Mint to mark the occasion, with one worth about £50, 000. Prime Minister Theresa May congratulated the queen on behalf of the nation, calling her an “inspiration. ” “It is a testament to her selfless devotion to the nation that she is not marking becoming the first monarch to reign for 65 years with any special celebration, but instead getting on with the job to which she has dedicated her life,” Mrs. May said in a statement."
"The number of climate change laws on the statue books of the world’s leading economies grew from less than 40 in 1997 to almost 500 at the end of 2013. Most leading countries now have legal provisions on renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon pricing, land use change, transport emissions, adaptation to climate risks and low-carbon research and development. These efforts do not yet add up to a credible global response that will limit the rise in global temperatures to less than two degrees Celsius – the objective of international climate negotiations. So we may expect not just more laws but also more rigorous laws over the coming years. But what relation does this have to financial markets? Britain’s Environmental Audit Committee has recently warned that global efforts to combat climate change could in due course pose a risk to financial stability. Coal, oil and gas companies are a substantial part of the stock market, certainly in the UK, and their share price is determined, among other factors, by the size of their fossil fuel reserves. The carbon contained in these reserves is three times more than we can burn if we are to avoid dangerous climate change. In other words, unless we find a cheap way to capture and store carbon, two-thirds of the fossil fuel reserves of coal, oil and gas majors will have to remain under ground. These companies, it would appear, are overvalued. There is little evidence that the market shares this concern. Optimists and green investors point to a growing interest in environmental, social and corporate governance investment. Green bonds are booming, although they are issued mostly by blue chip companies and investors are sheltered from actual green risk.  But much of the energy industry has a very different view. Here, the talk is of a new age of fossil fuels, of abundant new reserves from unconventional sources – in particular shale gas, which has already transformed the energy market in the US. So who is right: those who look forward to a resurgence of fossil fuels or those who warn about unburnable carbon?  It is hard to blame hard-nosed city analysts for being doubtful about tight carbon constraints, especially if their valuations focus on the short-term. Few countries have made a significant dent into their greenhouse gas emissions. Where emissions have come down, it has often been because of unconnected factors, such as the economic crisis in Europe or the advent of shale gas in the US. City analysts will also point out that climate laws do not guarantee policy certainty. In the 2008 Climate Change Act the UK has one of the most sophisticated climate change laws, which gives UK climate change policy a clear long-term direction. But it has not prevented short-term policy alterations, as today’s budget statement may again show. Australian investors will make a similar observation about their policy environment. It is also the case that not all climate change laws are as authoritative as the UK’s Climate Change Act or Mexico’s General Law on Climate Change. Particularly in developing countries climate policy is often made by executive order rather than passed by parliament. But these provisions can be powerful too: China’s current five-year plan includes constraints on carbon emissions per GDP that are on a par with Britain’s carbon budgets, if these were expressed in the same way. The UK’s third carbon budget translates into a reduction in carbon intensity of 39% by 2020, relative to 2005, compared with China’s ambition of a 40-45 per cent cut.  More tangibly, policy makers are increasingly willing to penalise emissions by putting a price on carbon. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme may be ailing, but through a combination of taxes, trading schemes and regulation OECD countries impose carbon penalties. Prices range from less than £8 per tonne of CO2 produced in Mexico, New Zealand and the United States to over £70 per tonne of CO2 in Germany, Japan, Norway, South Korea and Switzerland.  The impact of these measures on firm performance has so far been modest, but they have given an edge to firms that are willing to cut their emissions. A tentative finding from the analysis of the 500 climate laws so far is that one of the most powerful drivers of climate legislation is the number of climate laws passed elsewhere. There appears to be a strong element of peer pressure and intergovernmental knowledge exchange. If this is confirmed, it would point towards a self-reinforcing cycle.  The more climate change laws are passed – and the current pace is one new law per country every 18-20 months – the more ready policymakers become to take further action. The financial sector would do well to take note."
"Mary McCormack Hughes has a vivid recollection of the phone call she got 35 years ago this week from Robert Durst, her   . “Have you seen Kathie?” he asked. Kathie was Kathleen Durst, Ms. Hughes’s younger sister, who at 29 was in the final months of medical school. Her marriage to Mr. Durst, the eccentric scion of a prominent New York real estate family, had splintered under Mr. Durst’s efforts to control her, repeated rounds of quarreling and, finally, violence. No, Ms. Hughes, said she had responded, but I’ve been meaning to talk to you about Kathie. Mr. Durst cut her off, saying he was going to the police, and abruptly ended the call, she said. Ms. Hughes remembers that as she hung up the phone in her East Side apartment that February evening in 1982, she turned to her husband, Tom Hughes, and said, “I think he killed her. ” Today, Mr. Durst, 73, sits in Los Angeles County Jail awaiting trial on a charge of murder  —   not of Kathie, but of Susan Berman, a confidante who, investigators say, knew his secrets and shielded him from newspaper reporters after his wife vanished. John Lewin, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles, claims that Mr. Durst shot Ms. Berman in the back of her head at her Los Angeles home in December 2000, fearing that she would cooperate with a newly revived investigation into Ms. Durst’s disappearance. Mr. Durst was never charged with his wife’s killing, nor was anyone else. (Ms. Durst’s body has never been recovered.) He and his battery of lawyers have insisted that he did not kill Ms. Berman and does not know what happened to his first wife. Ms. Hughes has not paid much attention to events in Los Angeles. “I think it’s going to be a disaster,” she said, with bitterness, of the coming trial during her first interview in more than three decades, at an Upper East Side apartment building where her sister once lived with Mr. Durst. A large photograph of Kathie Durst dressed in an Annie   dress and a   hat from the Wild West hung over the fireplace. “Hollywood and publicity,” Ms. Hughes said. “They’re not really interested in my sister  —   they’re interested in Bob. I just want to find out what happened to my sister. ” The obsession nearly destroyed her. Kathie was the youngest daughter and the fifth child of a telephone company representative, who died in 1966, and a working mother. After graduating from high school in New Hyde Park on Long Island, Kathie trained as a dental hygienist and moved to a building owned by the Durst family on the East Side of Manhattan. Mr. Durst oversaw the building and when the two met, there was an instant attraction. “It was a mutual attraction, a chemistry,” Ms. Hughes recalled. “He had a magnetism. Kathie had the same thing. ” The Hugheses liked Mr. Durst when he started dating Kathie, then 19, in early 1971. He was nine years older and from another world. His father, Seymour Durst, presided over a Manhattan real estate company whose towers formed the skyline. The Dursts were low key, not the stereotypical    developers. For a while, Ms. Hughes said, her sister was unaware just how wealthy the Durst family was. After their second date, Mr. Durst asked Kathie to move with him to Vermont to run a health food store. But after a short time in Vermont, the couple returned to New York, and Mr. Durst resumed working at the family real estate business. They were married in a private ceremony on his birthday, April 12, in 1973. The couple partied at Studio 54, the   disco that was a haunt for celebrities and others. They sailed on the Mediterranean Sea and traveled to Thailand. Bob and Kathie socialized with Mary and Tom, even buying a racehorse together from a friend who was a breeder. “He heard it was a tax deduction,” Tom Hughes said. “I think he liked that part of it. ” But the Dursts’ relationship took a dark turn after 1976, when Mr. Durst forced his wife to have an abortion. He didn’t want children she did. “That’s when it went south,” Mr. Hughes said. Ms. Durst sought independence, enrolling in nursing school in Danbury, Conn. The couple bought a cottage nearby, on Lake Truesdale in South Salem, N. Y. in northern Westchester County, but also had a   on Riverside Drive in Manhattan and rented an apartment on the East Side. After graduating from nursing school, Ms. Durst immediately started medical school at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, hoping to become a pediatrician. “She was excited to be a medical student,” recalled a classmate, Dr. Alicia  . “She worked hard. She always took a seat in the front row and took notes. ” By 1980, the couple quarreled frequently, Ms. Hughes said, adding that her sister often called her with accounts of their latest fight. Ms. Durst contacted a divorce lawyer. She gathered damaging material about her husband and the Durst family, she told friends and her sister. Mr. Durst has long acknowledged his marijuana use, and his wife used cocaine, according to friends and members of her family. Both had affairs, his and her friends and relatives say. Mr. Durst, they say, cut off her credit cards to keep her close. “Bob’s possessiveness was escalating into physical violence,” said a nursing school classmate of Ms. Durst’s, Eleanor Joy Schwank, during an interview in 2000. “I never witnessed it, but Kathie would call me saying, ‘Bobby is really violent. ’” Mr. Durst, impatient to leave a McCormack family gathering, yanked his wife’s hair, shocking her family, Ms. Hughes said. On another occasion, he stormed into their East Side apartment, where Ms. Durst was talking with friends, and kicked an acquaintance in the face. The man later settled a lawsuit over the episode with Mr. Durst. Three weeks before Ms. Durst disappeared, she was treated at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx for bruises she suffered during an argument with her husband, according to several friends and medical records later recovered by investigators. Ms. Durst told her sister, her friends and virtually anyone who would listen, “If anything happens to me, don’t let Bob get away with it. ” Geraldine McInerney, a friend of Ms. Hughes’s, said she had met Ms. Durst at the couple’s East Side apartment on Jan. 29, 1982. Ms. Durst wanted someone she knew to sublet the apartment so that if “the situation between her and Durst became too threatening, she would have an alternative place to stay,” Ms. McInerney said in a 1983 affidavit. It was the last time Ms. McInerney saw her. A week later, Mr. Durst walked into a Manhattan police station to file a missing person’s report. He carried a copy of New York magazine with his father’s picture and the headline “The Men Who Own New York. ” Mr. Durst told the police that he had put his wife on a train to Manhattan from Westchester County on Sunday night so that she could attend school the next day. He said he had later spoken to her by phone, after she arrived at their Riverside Drive  . Soon, the story was splashed across New York’s tabloids. Mr. Durst, who hired detectives and offered a reward, told his family, friends and the police that his wife might have run away with a drug dealer. Her family found that implausible, since she was only months away from graduating. “She always wanted to take care of children,” Mr. Hughes said. Decades later, in an interview with the producers of the   HBO documentary “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,” Mr. Durst acknowledged that much of what he had told the police was a lie. Why did he lie? “I wanted them to leave me alone,” he explained to Mr. Lewin, the Los Angeles prosecutor, during an interrogation after his 2015 arrest in New Orleans on gun charges. “I wasn’t used to somebody questioning my veracity. ” Frustrated by what they regarded as a desultory investigation by New York City detectives, Ms. Hughes and a small band of friends became amateur sleuths, tracking sightings of her sister and Mr. Durst and scouring phone records. By March 1982, they were making furtive   visits to what they believed was the scene of the crime, the stone cottage at the edge of Lake Truesdale. On one trip, Mr. Hughes found an ominous list in Mr. Durst’s handwriting in a garbage can: “town dump, bridge, dig, boat” and “shovel. ” They found Ms. Durst’s diamond earrings in her drawer at the Riverside Drive apartment, which Mr. Durst had told the police she was wearing when she disappeared. To this day, Ms. Hughes is shocked that New York City detectives never searched the cottage. Ms. Hughes and Ms. McInerney pored over pages and pages of phone records from the cottage, the apartments and the Durst Organization that they had gotten from the detectives. Night after night, the two women matched the phone numbers to names until they discovered that Mr. Durst had made collect calls to his family’s business from Ship Bottom, N. J. shortly after his wife vanished. The calls, coupled with the list of words, led them to suspect that Ms. Durst might be buried somewhere in the nearby Pine Barrens of New Jersey. Ms. Hughes and Ms. McInerney borrowed a car and drove the investigating detectives down to Ship Bottom. But the detectives seemed uninterested, Ms. Hughes said, and the case was no longer generating headlines. Mr. Durst was not charged with any crime. Ms. Hughes and her family wrestled with Mr. Durst in Surrogate’s Court for control of Ms. Durst’s estate, but suffered another defeat in 1983. “I was just so fed up,” Ms. Hughes said. “I broke down. I couldn’t do it anymore. ” For a long time, she refused to drive a car or even leave her apartment. She focused on her two daughters, whom she had long neglected. In the end, Ms. Hughes was left without answers as to her sister’s fate. But she never lost her conviction about Mr. Durst’s culpability. Ms. Hughes, her husband and Ms. McInerney cooperated with an investigation into Ms. Durst’s disappearance that was started in 2000 by an enterprising State Police investigator, Joe Becerra, only to be disappointed again when the local district attorney did not indict Mr. Durst. In recent years, Ms. Hughes and other members of her family have gone back to Surrogate’s Court to fight Mr. Durst and to have her sister declared dead as of Jan. 31, 1982. Their mother, Ann McCormack, died in May at 102, without knowing what happened to Kathie. “It’s absurd that after 35 years New York has not charged him with murder,” Robert Abrams, whose law firm, Abrams Fensterman, is representing Ms. Durst’s family, said of Mr. Durst. “If they’re not going to do it criminally, we’ll do it civilly. ” Whatever happens in Los Angeles, Mr. Durst will return to federal prison to serve the remaining time on a   gun conviction. “We want some sort of peace, some answers as to where she’s at,” Ms. Hughes said. “Why couldn’t he just tell us? He has nothing to lose. He’s going to stay in jail. ”"
"**A director of public heath said care home residents may not get the newly-approved Pfizer coronavirus vaccine.**
Care home residents and staff are top of the government's provisional priority list for any vaccine.
But Northamptonshire's health chief, Lucy Wightman, said the Pfizer vaccine's storage and transportation requirements made that a ""challenge"".
She said care home residents may have to wait for the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine.
The UK became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it was safe for roll-out next week.
The vaccine is made in Belgium, must be stored at around -70C (-94F) and, once delivered, can be kept for up to five days in a fridge.
However, speaking during a BBC East live stream on Tuesday, Ms Wightman said: ""It can only be transported four times and once it's been delivered to a local area that is its fourth transportation, so it then can't be sent out to anywhere else.""
She said this meant its delivery would have to be straight to mass vaccination centres or hospitals.
""But obviously what the government wanted to do was vaccinate care home residents first, and the challenge is you can't do that as you can't break up that delivery to a county,"" she said.
Ms Wightman said she would wait for the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine for care home residents.
That vaccine, which is yet to be approved, can be kept at regular fridge temperature making distribution easier.
Prof Wei Shen Lim, chairman of the government's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said whether vaccines could be delivered to care homes was ""dependent on deployment and implementation.""
Prof Lim said there would be ""flexibility"" in roll-out of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine and more than one type of vaccine would be needed to reach all vulnerable groups.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the first load of the Pfizer vaccine would be delivered next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December.

"Phytoplankton are the microscopic plant-like cells that float in the sea’s sunlit surface. They underpin the marine food chain and controversy over their stocks means it’s necessary to better understand their existence across the globe. To combat the lack of data on phytoplankton levels, colleagues at Plymouth University and I initiated a project to map them in oceans across the world. Lacking the manpower to do this on our own, we are enlisting seafarers across the globe to get involved in the project. Phytoplankton are the ocean’s main producers – their abundance determines the productivity at every step of the marine food chain above them. This means they determine the numbers of fish in the sea, crabs on the seashore, seabirds in the sky and polar bears on the ice. So when three Canadian scientists published research in Nature describing a 40% decline in phytoplankton in the world’s oceans over the past 50 years, alarm bells were raised. The 2010 study speculated that a warmer ocean surface due to climate change had reduced vertical mixing and the supply of nutrients to the sea surface from deeper waters. Controversy abounded, however, as some scientists viewed contradictory results and others no changes. One problem suggested with the Canadian study was the reliability of the data used (and available). Since the phytoplankton begin the marine food chain, we need to know more about if, how and why they are changing in order to understand the effects on the ocean’s biology. We are asking sailors around the world to take Secchi Disk readings to add to the historical dataset collected by scientists over the last 150 years. Using this data, we hope to build a map of the oceans, charting the seasonal and annual changes of phytoplankton from now and into the future. A Secchi Disk is one of the simplest pieces of marine scientific equipment. It is a round, 30cm white disk attached to a tape measure with a small weight hanging below. It was first invented in 1865 by the Pope’s astronomer Pietro Angelo Secchi and is used to determine the clarity of seawater.  When lowered over the side of a ship the depth at which the white disk just disappears from sight is recorded and it indicates the clarity of the seawater. In water greater than 25 m deep and more than 1km off shore, the main influence upon water clarity is the phytoplankton, and so the recording determines the amount of phytoplankton in the water. It is a simple and robust measurement. A Secchi Disk can be made of any material, as long as it is 30cm in diameter and plain white. Part of the project involves seafarers making their own Secchi Disks. As we expected, sailors have used a very diverse range of materials. The more unusual items we have heard about include an aluminium road sign, a frisbee and a disk cut from a ship’s toilet seat lid. To make it simple for seafarers to take Secchi depth readings, colleagues from Plymouth’s School of Computing and Mathematics created the Secchi smartphone app. The app can be used anywhere in the world – whether or not they have any signal. In parts of the world without internet connection, participants record as many Secchi readings as they like on the app and these are stored as “pending readings” on the phone. Exactly how many pending readings can be stored depends on the capabilities of the phone, but the number is very large. These can then be uploaded at a later date when an internet connection is available. In the hands of so many different seafarers, it was important to design an app that would keep errors to a minimum. The participant’s location is taken from the phone’s GPS to eliminate any transcription errors. The user interface has been designed to work well on a boat at sea: small and unfussy layouts are used. The “depth disk” uses a logarithmic scale to enable shallow readings to be entered quickly and accurately. The Secchi Disk project has just celebrated its first birthday and we are thrilled with the enthusiasm of sailors to take part. After one year, a sailor is measuring phtyoplankton from somewhere in the world’s oceans almost every day. So far, the most southern Secchi Depth was recorded by near Wananga in waters of New Zealand and the most northern reading taken in the sea of the Northern Isles of Scotland. Entering its second year, the project has several goals over and above recruiting more participants and growing and using the database. For example, we would like to see Secchi Disks included onboard holiday charter yachts, included as an item with every new yacht, and, although we like the DIY approach, we are keen to find someone to produce an inexpensive Secchi Disk apparatus for sale in shops. As more data is collected, we hope to soon start analysing it and mapping the world’s phytoplankton."
"Iran will bar the United States wrestling team from a major international meet this month in response to President Trump’s order severely limiting travel from several   countries, including Iran. Bahram Qasemi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, announced the decision Friday morning, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The agency reported that the decision had been made by “a special committee, which opposed to presence of the team after necessary studies. ” Mr. Qasemi said the ministry opposed the Americans’ participation because of Mr. Trump’s order. “We’re in talks about it right at the moment,” said Christina Kelley, the chief international ambassador for U. S. A. Wrestling. “We’re pretty devastated. ” A U. S. A. Wrestling statement, while noting that the group had not received official confirmation of the decision, said: “If these reports are true, U. S. A. Wrestling is extremely disappointed about this, which we believe would be an unacceptable situation. Wrestling is about competition and good will through sport, and is no place for politics. ” The event, the Freestyle World Cup, is scheduled for Feb. 16 and 17 in Kermanshah, Iran. Held annually, it pits the best wrestlers in the world in team competition. Last year, the event was held in Los Angeles, and it is scheduled to be held in Iowa City in 2018. Iran has won the event five years in a row. Americans and Iranians regularly wrestle in each other’s countries, with few problems, if any. Wrestling is one of the most popular sports in Iran: 43 of the nation’s 69 Olympic medals have come in wrestling. The United States and Iran worked together in 2013 to persuade the International Olympic Committee to keep wrestling in the Summer Games when it was threatened with removal. There is an international wrestling meet scheduled for May in Times Square, an annual contest pitting top Americans against international stars. But it is not clear if Iranians will be granted sports visas to compete. Mr. Trump’s order bars visitors from seven nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Nenad Lalovic, the president of United World Wrestling, the international federation, said in a statement: “Though we had hoped for a different outcome from Iran’s Foreign Ministry, we appreciate the complex nature of this decision. We are currently working to find a solution for the Freestyle World Cup as soon as possible. ” “United World Wrestling hosts a full calendar of events every season, and we’re certain to see American and Iranian wrestlers on the same mat again in the very near future,” it added. Mr. Trump’s order is a complicated issue for the United States Olympic Committee, which calls itself “the steward of the Olympic movement in the United States. ” The organization does not want to antagonize the president, so its response has been relatively muted. The committee is invested in a bid to bring the 2024 Summer Games to Los Angeles, and that bid’s chances have been damaged by the executive order, which alarmed some of the International Olympic Committee members who will select the host city. “We are disappointed for our wrestlers, who have been warmly welcomed by the Iranian public on many occasions,” said Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee. Jordan Burroughs, an American who won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics and who was to participate in the World Cup, told The Associated Press: “These executive decisions are always so far beyond your reach. You always feel like, ‘Well, the presidency or these strict laws or these Muslim bans or whatever you like to call them, they’ll never affect me.’ This is one of the few times where something so personal has occurred. ” “There is such a common respect for wrestlers in Iran,” Burroughs told NBC. “They love wrestling. They’re huge fans of mine. I’m bummed about that. I really wanted to be part of something great in what I consider a great country. Obviously, my views and our country’s views are different. ” Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump’s order. But American wrestling officials had been hopeful that an exception could be made to allow the American athletes to participate."

From the University of Alberta, this news release is making the rounds, but what many of the alarmists don’t get (Joe Romm for example) is that these plants had to have a warm environment to grow in first, then they were covered by ice, emerging again after the LIA ended. Many reports are only looking at the current emergence in a warmer period as if it is unique. – Anthony
400-year-old plants reawaken as glaciers recede
UAlberta researcher discovers plants exposed by retreating glaciers regrowing after centuries entombed under ice.

(Edmonton) When Catherine La Farge threads her way through the recently exposed terrain left behind by retreating glaciers, she looks at the ancient plant remains a lot closer than most. Now, her careful scrutiny has revealed a startling reawakening of long-dormant plants known as bryophytes.
La Farge, a researcher in the Faculty of Science, and director and curator of the Cryptogamic Herbarium at the University of Alberta, has overturned a long-held assumption that all of the plant remains exposed by retreating polar glaciers are dead. Previously, any new growth of plants close to the glacier margin was considered the result of rapid colonization by modern plants surrounding the glacier.

Using radiocarbon dating, La Farge and her co-authors confirmed that the plants, which ranged from 400 to 600 years old, were entombed during the Little Ice Age that happened between 1550 and 1850. In the field, La Farge noticed that the subglacial populations were not only intact, but also in pristine condition—with some suggesting regrowth.
In the lab, La Farge and her master’s student Krista Williams selected 24 subglacial samples for culture experiments. Seven of these samples produced 11 cultures that successfully regenerated four species from the original parent material.
La Farge says the regrowth of these Little Ice Age bryophytes (such as mosses and liverworts) expands our understanding of glacier ecosystems as biological reservoirs that are becoming increasingly important with global ice retreat. “We know that bryophytes can remain dormant for many years (for example, in deserts) and then are reactivated, but nobody expected them to rejuvenate after nearly 400 years beneath a glacier.
“These simple, efficient plants, which have been around for more than 400 million years, have evolved a unique biology for optimal resilience,” she adds. “Any bryophyte cell can reprogram itself to initiate the development of an entire new plant. This is equivalent to stem cells in faunal systems.”
La Farge says the finding amplifies the critical role of bryophytes in polar environments and has implications for all permafrost regions of the globe.
“Bryophytes are extremophiles that can thrive where other plants don’t, hence they play a vital role in the establishment, colonization and maintenance of polar ecosystems. This discovery emphasizes the importance of research that helps us understand the natural world, given how little we still know about polar ecosystems—with applied spinoffs for understanding reclamation that we may never have anticipated.”
The research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Abstract
Across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, widespread ice retreat during the 20th century has sharply accelerated since 2004. In Sverdrup Pass, central Ellesmere Island, rapid glacier retreat is exposing intact plant communities whose radiocarbon dates demonstrate entombment during the Little Ice Age (1550–1850 AD). The exhumed bryophyte assemblages have exceptional structural integrity (i.e., setae, stem structures, leaf hair points) and have remarkable species richness (60 of 144 extant taxa in Sverdrup Pass). Although the populations are often discolored (blackened), some have developed green stem apices or lateral branches suggesting in vivo regrowth. To test their biological viability, Little Ice Age populations emerging from the ice margin were collected for in vitro growth experiments. Our results include a unique successful regeneration of subglacial bryophytes following 400 y of ice entombment. This ﬁnding demonstrates the totipotent capacity of bryophytes, the ability of a cell to dedifferentiate into a meristematic state (analogous to stem cells) and develop a new plant. In polar ecosystems, regrowth of bryophyte tissue buried by ice for 400 y signiﬁcantly expands our understanding of their role in recolonization of polar landscapes (past or present). Regeneration of subglacial bryophytes broadens the concept of Ice Age refugia, traditionally conﬁned to survival of land plants to sites above and beyond glacier margins. Our results emphasize the unrecognized resilience of bryophytes, which are commonly overlooked vis-a-vis their contribution to the establishment, colonization, and maintenance of polar terrestrial ecosystems.

"The IPCC has re-iterated its concern that climate change is a serious threat to human safety and security in its latest series of reports. And while energy, transport, water, tourism and health are highlighted as being particularly vulnerable, markets connect different sectors to each other in a way that puts many more at risk too. We need bright ideas to help industries in this turbulence and in doing so, we will produce technologies and services that will make life better for us all in the long term. The impacts of climate change in one area spill over into others. That has never been more true than in the present day, when digital technologies allow us to overcome space and time and cause industries to blur into each other. Technology is often touted as a tool to help face up to climate change and organisations are seen bringing in technological measures all over the world. In Oslo, intelligent street lighting aims to decrease “wasted” light and in Vancouver the hope is that data can be gathered from other cities to make more informed environmental choices. This is a crucial point in economic history where digital technologies are in the process of tearing down traditional barriers and increasing spillovers between sectors. Mobile applications, cloud computing and all kinds of advances in computer functioning and usability mean users and customers can access a broad range of information, be it about their daily commute or their buying patterns.  All this information could be used to help make smarter choices but there is a huge amount of it to process. Governments can be just as befuddled. Armed with technology, they can be good at identifying what sustainable transport and food looks like, but they can struggle to promote a sustainable society. They can see how many food miles a certain product clocks up but that isn’t enough information on its own to recommend we stop buying it. In the past, we worried that technology could not meet our needs, now we are overloaded with information from all angles.  Our future vision is informed by horizon scanning to identify areas where digital technologies can be applied to make our lives better over the long term, be that environmentally, socially or in terms of economics.  This thinking is needed in areas as diverse as energy utilities, food, retail, governance, financial services and transport.  We are considering issues such as whether the broadband networks we have in place can serve us effectively in the future or how our energy use affects our sociability, not just our wallets. When the cost of turning the kettle on at home is known, will you really gather the family for tea? Industry and government are very interested in the answer as they design and sell products and policies.  We are also looking at the positive contributions that social media makes to modern problems. We’ve recently seen how social media can be used when a disaster such as a flood strikes and can be used to start sharing economies between individuals looking to spend less or use fewer resources. The path to a sustainable society that is safe and secure from climate change will not be smooth. It will need what Sikdar calls “a wise balance among economic development, environmental stewardship, and social equity”. As technology breaks down barriers between sectors, it also encourages change in ways that we could not have anticipated. We can start by improving energy, transport, water, tourism, and health, as the IPCC suggests, and then we can see the solutions they develop spread into the parts of society that are largely insulated from the more direct impacts of climate change. That in turn will empower individuals to make better decisions about their lives."
"They key phrase spoken in BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on the findings of the latest IPCC climate change report was “it’s about people now”. It’s a statement likely to carry great weight with a body of listeners who have tended to conceive of climate change as a remote, distant issue, the effects of which they had never really imagined having to face. The programme’s discussion laid out the report’s findings of threats to human health, homes, food and security, and those listening at home grabbing a slice of toast on their way out of the door would be in no doubt that “no one will be untouched”. But those still listening later might well be. The next interviewee was Professor of Economics, Richard Tol, an IPCC contributor who announced he wanted his name removed from this report, stating he was unhappy with the final draft’s tendency to be “alarmist”. In terms of appeasing the listening public now wide awake at the prospect that climate change can’t just be ignored, he was highly effective. Meanwhile on the BBC’s 5Live there was a similarly powerful rebuttal to the main, pull-no-punches headlines about the conclusions of the IPCC – a synthesis of the work of hundreds of scientists from more than 70 countries – when climate scientist Professor Judith Curry opened her interview with the words “the climate always changes”. She went on to highlight the great challenges of differentiating between “what’s natural and what’s anthropogenic” [man-made]. Scouring the media, as research has shown people now do routinely, audiences were subject to a reinforced message of reassurance regarding the IPCC’s headlines. Channel 4 News that night asked “Was the climate change report alarmist?”, and Richard Tol again played down warnings about the economic impact of climate change, including those of the comprehensive Stern Review in the Financial Times and also here. For one dissenting voice among the hundreds contributing to the IPCC, Tol receives rather disproportionate air time and column inches. The arguments about the inclusion of sceptical voices, and the links to lobbying groups, are strongly put elsewhere. But in terms of audience response, it is significant that this same week Parliamentary Science and Technology committee criticised the BBC for “failing to clearly and effectively communicate climate science to the public”, and giving undue weight to marginal opinion. Actually the committee was equally critical of the government, as well as other news outlets. Despite two invites, neither the Daily Mail nor the Daily Telegraph – the newspapers displaying most scepticism - bothered to show up. While the BBC is not the only, nor indeed the worst, offender in terms of communicating climate change, there is a strong argument that it is the most important. As evidence to the committee from Glasgow University Media Group and others emphasised, it carries the most trust with audiences and therefore a weight of responsibility that other news outlets don’t. This is particularly so in an over-saturated media environment in which credibility is increasingly difficult to attribute. In response to the criticisms, a BBC spokesman re-affirmed that “as part of our commitment to impartiality it is important that dissenting voices are also heard”, and that the BBC does not believe “in erasing wider viewpoints”. Achieving impartiality is, of course, in the BBC’s DNA, but in this case it appears to be prioritised over informing audiences. As a strategy it seems to function as one of almost deliberately confusing them. Listening to the 5Live report with Judith Curry, the reporter himself sounds confused. It’s very difficult to justify claims that this is in the audience’s interests as they are torn from unequivocal reports that climate change is going to have “severe, pervasive and irreversible” effects, to being reassured that it probably won’t be all that bad. Especially so when there is no clarification of which side carries most weight. That audiences are confused about climate change has been demonstrated by research. More specifically, that the media has sown the seeds of doubt about the pressing need to take steps to slow or prevent it. And yet there is evidence that the public would in fact accept quite radical policy change on the issue if the communications were improved. But the most likely outcome of some of the coverage this week is that heads will continue to spin."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn ugly pedophilia chapter of Germany’s environmentalist Green Party refused to be forgotten – and will now be dealt with through a hotline for “victims of sexual violence“.
The German Greens have scrambled to keep an embarrassing reality under the carpet of history, away from the public’s view. That notorious chapter is their once strident advocacy for the legalization of pedophilia, see background here.
On Wednesday Germany’s leftist Berlin-based TAZ published an article reporting the German Green Party has, after months of stalling, finally set up an official “telephone hotline for the victims of sexual violence.” The TAZ calls the move “surprising”.
Hat-tip DirkH
What was the extent of pedophile involvement in the Green Party? Spiegel wrote in-depth here (my emphasis):
No political group in Germany promoted the interests of men with pedophile tendencies as staunchly as the environmental party. For a period of time in the mid-1980s, it practically served as the parliamentary arm of the pedophile movement.” […]
When the Green Party was founded in 1980, pedophiles were part of the movement from the start […] were joined by the so-called ‘Urban Indians,’ who advocated the ‘legalization of all affectionate sexual relations between adults and children’.”
These “Urban Indians”, Spiegel wrote, “were often a visible part of Green Party gatherings.”

That dark past obviously has become an unbearable thorn for the Greens in the present. The TAZ writes that for years the top honchos of the environmentalist-pacifist party refused to take the step of setting up a contact-center for victims, preferring to downplaying the whole messy . But, to her credit, current party chief Simone Peter has decided to set up the hotline at Green Party headquarters, following the recommendation of the Green Party working group “AG Rehabilitation” which, according to the TAZ, has been since last December pursing the subject of pedophile involvement within the Greens.
Wikipedia presents a comprehensive overview (in German) of the Green Party’s debate on the topic and provides quotes from prominent Green Party leaders, such as Daniel Cohn-Bendit who in 1982 said on a French Antenne 2 (today, France 2) talkshow “Apostrophes“ on 23 April 1982:
You know, the sexuality of a kid is something absolutely fantastic. […] You know when a little girl of five years starts to undress herself, it’s just great because it is a game, a fantastically erotic game.”
Though some have attempted to downplay the issue as a past, fringe one within the Green Party, Cohn-Bendit himself insisted that the pedophilia rights were “mainstream” in the Green Party.
Keep in mind that for years leading Green figures such as Cohn-Bendit were welcome darlings of the European media. These are people who, as Spiegel wrote, “tolerated people whose agenda had nothing to do with progress and emancipation, but solely with the exploitation of their position of power and trust in relation to minors”
Perhaps Wikipedia editor and UK Green Party member William Connelly could put the German Wikipedia content up in English. Of course who could blame him for deleting it altogether? In the meantime, the ugly history is well-portrayed by Spiegel here.
Whether a hotline (open only 2 hours a week) will be enough to undo the damage caused by the Green Party’s earlier staunch encouragement of the exploitation of small children by fantasy-obsessed men remains highly doubtful.

"**Emergency laws to ""stamp out dangerous"" anti-vaccine content online should be introduced, Labour has said.**
The party is calling for financial and criminal penalties for social media firms that do not remove false scare stories about vaccines.
It follows news of progress on the first effective coronavirus vaccine.
The government said it took the issue ""extremely seriously"" with ""a major commitment"" from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle anti-vaccine content.
Many social media platforms label false content as misleading or disputed - and all remove posts that contravene terms of service.
But Labour said a commitment by platforms to remove content flagged by the government was not enough.
Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said such content was ""exploiting people's fears, their mistrust of institutions and governments and spreading poison and harm"".
He told BBC Breakfast his party wanted to work with the government on a cross-party basis to build trust and help promote take-up of the vaccine.
He said people would have legitimate questions about what the vaccine means for them, levels of immunity and whether the vaccine was appropriate for those with chronic health conditions.
""There's nothing wrong with asking those questions and strong public health messaging from the government, reinforced by us, will allay those fears,"" he said.
Baseless conspiracy theories about a coronavirus vaccine have been spreading on social media for months - and the latest vaccine news rekindled these pre-existing narratives online.
These includes false claims that the vaccine is a means of inserting microchips into the population, altering our DNA, or are even a weapon of genocide.
Within hours of news breaking about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, comments and memes suggesting it will deliberately harm us were popping up in local Facebook groups, parent chats and on Instagram.
This kind of disinformation is worlds away from legitimate concerns that a vaccine is safe and properly tested.
Despite commitments to tackle falsehoods from social media sites and the government, a constant bubbling of conspiracies online looks to have already eroded trust for some in an effective vaccine.
The anti-vax movement, which pre-dates the pandemic, is not the only thing responsible for the spread of this disinformation online.
Pseudoscience figures with large online followings - who have spread other false claims such as linking coronavirus to 5G or suggesting the pandemic is a hoax - have also turned their attention to vaccines.
There is no truth to the false and harmful claims they make - but that hasn't stopped them spilling into the average social media feed for weeks and impacting those who come across them.
Meanwhile, a member of the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, has criticised ministers' strategy of ""flip-flopping"" between encouraging people to socialise and spend money - and tough lockdown restrictions in England.
Professor John Edmunds said: ""We need to take a long-term view and be sensible and realise that we're going to have to have restrictions in place for some time.
""Yes, we can lift them when it's safe to do so, which will be primarily when large numbers of people have been vaccinated.
""But flip-flopping between encouraging people to mix socially, which is what you're doing by encouraging people to go to restaurants and bars, versus then immediately closing them again, isn't a very sensible way to run the epidemic.""
The national lockdown in England is currently due to end on 2 December, with a return to the tiered system of local restrictions.
Prof Edmunds also criticised that system of lower to higher restrictions, saying it was not ""very well thought through"".
Scotland has moved to a five-tier system of coronavirus restrictions. Wales has now ended a ""circuit breaker"" while Northern Ireland has extended its own temporary lockdown.
A further 26,860 UK coronavirus cases were recorded on Saturday and 462 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported.
Suspicion of vaccines has been around almost as long as modern vaccines themselves. But in recent years, the anti-vaccination - or ""anti-vax""- movement has gained traction online.
Social media has been blamed for allowing unfounded claims about vaccines to spread more easily.
In 2019, the UK lost its measles-free status designated by the World Health Organization - and there has been a marked decline in vaccination rates for all 13 diseases covered in jabs for children.
Since the pandemic, anti-vaccination campaigners have moved their focus to the coronavirus.
In the letter to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, Labour said there were dedicated anti-vaccination groups online with hundreds of thousands of followers who were ""churning out disinformation"" on the issue.
Last week, the government announced that social media companies had agreed a package of measures - including that no company should be profiting from Covid vaccine fake news.
But Labour warned that the measures do not go far enough and has questioned why anti-vax groups are not being closed down.
""The announced collaboration with social media companies last week was welcome but feels grossly inadequate with a promise by them to remove only the content which is flagged by government and which generates profit,"" Labour said.
Labour called for emergency legislation that would see financial and criminal penalties for a continued failure to act, and said they would vote for it.
On Monday, news of a potential vaccine made headlines after preliminary results from Pfizer and BioNTech showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90% of people from catching Covid.
The vaccine is one of 11 vaccines that are currently in the final stages of testing. Pfizer and BioNTech companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November and a limited number of people may be given the vaccine this year.
The UK has bought enough doses for 20 million people.
But it will not be released for use in the UK until it passes final safety tests and gets the go-ahead from the MHRA - the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.
The head of the MHRA said this week it will not lower its safety standards despite the need to get a Covid vaccine quickly.
Earlier this year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called people who oppose vaccinations ""nuts"".
And this week, he said he had ""no inhibitions"" about getting one, adding: ""Anti-vax is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine.""
A government spokesperson said: ""Letting vaccine disinformation spread unchecked could cost British lives.
""We take this issue extremely seriously and have secured a major commitment from Facebook, Twitter and Google to tackle it by not profiting from such material, and by responding to flagged content more swiftly.
""We continue to work closely with social media firms to promote authoritative sources of information so people have access to vaccine facts not fiction."""
"**The government hopes to start distributing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine imminently.**
However, the vaccine needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C.
Most other vaccines do not need this, so how will this be made to work?
In the short-term, Pfizer has a plan.
The vaccine will be distributed from its own centres in the US, Germany and Belgium.
It will need to travel both on land and by air and possibly be stored in distribution centres, before being delivered to anywhere the vaccine will be given.
Pfizer has developed a special transport box the size of a suitcase, packed with dry ice and installed with GPS trackers. Each reusable box can keep up to 5,000 doses of the vaccine at the right temperature for 10 days, if it remains unopened.
Wiltshire-based firm Polar Thermals makes similar boxes for other vaccines and counts Pfizer among its clients, but not yet for this particular purpose.
The box is not likely to be cheap. Head of sales Paul Harrison says a standard chilled transport box, which will retain a temperature of up to -8C for five days and is big enough to hold 1,200 vaccines, costs about Â£5,000 per unit - although they can be reused thousands of times.
His firm uses aerogel as insulation, rather than dry ice - which could be handy if a global carbon dioxide shortage from earlier this year continues to affect the availability of related products, such as dry ice.
The US Compressed Gas Association, however, has said it is committed to meeting demand.
The vaccine can survive for a further five days once thawed, Pfizer has said, but this does not buy a great deal of extra time.
In the longer-term, Public Health England says that in the UK ""national preparations"" are under way regarding both central storage and distribution of the vaccine across the country, but has not given details.
As it stands, extreme cold storage is certainly not commonplace, and your local GP is unlikely to have it.
Some institutions, such as universities and research labs, do have the right storage capacity. In the UK, universities shared resources at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, including PPE-making equipment and ventilators.
The situation in developing countries is even more tenuous.
Burkina Faso, in central Africa, reported last month that it was already short of about 1,000 clinical fridges.
The World Health Organization, in conjunction with UN children's agency Unicef, has an ongoing project mapping cold storage facilities in anticipation of a Covid-19 vaccine.
Unicef wants to have 65,000 solar-powered cold fridges installed in low-income countries by the end of 2021."

**_Congress and state lawmakers (and where appropriate, the president and executive branch law enforcement officials) should_**



• review existing law with an eye toward rolling back overcriminalization and replacing criminal penalties with civil sanctions where feasible;  
• enact reforms such as the model Criminal Intent Protection Act to bolster recognition of _mens rea_ (punishment should ordinarily require a guilty state of mind, not inadvertent noncompliance) as well as the related _mistake of law defense_ in criminal law;  
• codify the common law rule of lenity (ambiguity in law should be resolved against finding guilt), as Texas joined other states in doing in 2015;  
• devise safe harbor provisions that enable economic actors to avoid criminal liability by behaving reasonably and in intended compliance with the law;  
• limit agency discretion to create new crimes without an act of the legislature;  
• enact guidelines to strengthen judicial oversight of deferred prosecution agreements and nonprosecution agreements (explicit court approval, not the unilateral say‐​so of government prosecutors, should be required for appointment of corporate monitors or the extension of time under supervision);  
• enact asset forfeiture reforms such as Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner’s (R-WI) Due Process Act, including requiring that conviction be a prerequisite for forfeiture;  
• review and, where appropriate, reduce or coordinate per‐​offense fines and sanctions to avoid levying penalties disproportionate to the gravity of misconduct;  
• prohibit, as a proposed New Mexico law would do, the allocation of settlement moneys (cy pres) to charities, nonprofits, or advocacy groups not themselves injured;  
• assign penalties, forfeitures, and settlement proceeds to the public treasury or, where appropriate in certain cases, to private parties who can show specific individual injury from the offense (penalties should not fund particular government agencies in ways that incentivize zealous enforcement or insulate the agencies from appropriations oversight);  
• prohibit the payment of public lawyers and forensics experts on contingency, that is, in ways dependent on case outcome or the magnitude of penalties (this principle should apply alike to career prosecutors, other staff public lawyers, experts, and outside law firms); existing contingency arrangements should be terminated;) and  
• impose transparent principles of selection and payment on outside contracting for legal services.



“The increasing criminalization of corporate behavior in America,” noted _The Economist_ in 2014, “is bad for the rule of law and for capitalism.” In fact, the British weekly noted, prosecution as a means of regulating business in the United States has become “an extortion racket… . The formula is simple: find a large company that may (or may not) have done something wrong; threaten its managers with commercial ruin, preferably with criminal charges; force them to use their shareholders’ money to pay an enormous fine to drop the charges in a secret settlement (so nobody can check the details). Then repeat with another large company… .



“Perhaps the most destructive part of it all is the secrecy and opacity. The public never finds out the full facts of the case, nor discovers which specific people — with souls and bodies — were to blame. Since the cases never go to court, precedent is not established, so it is unclear what exactly is illegal. That enables future shakedowns, but hurts the rule of law and imposes enormous costs.”



Many abuses arise from prosecutors’ search for publicity and glory. These include splashy raids on offices and “perp walks” for executives, in situations where a simple request to cooperate would have sufficed, and manipulation of the media through leaks and prejudicial publicity.



The most natural way to address prosecutorial abuse might seem to be disciplinary sanctions based on traditional standards of legal ethics and applied by judges or bar panels. The trouble with relying on that solution is that few prosecutions of large businesses eventuate in trial before a judge. When a business does put up a fight, it sometimes wins big. In 2016, after the Department of Justice (DoJ) indicted the FedEx Corporation on charges that it had knowingly done business with illegal pharmacies, FedEx refused to settle; once before a judge, DoJ’s case collapsed in spectacular fashion and it dropped the charges midtrial. Much more often, however, businesses faced with a doubtful or overreaching prosecution take their lawyers’ advice and fold their hands and try to get the best possible settlement. For businesses based on trust or regulatory permission, the costs and risks of defying federal law enforcement — legal, reputational, and otherwise — are just too high. The government has the upper hand. That is one reason lawmakers need to step in.



There are now more than 4,000 federal criminal offenses, up from approximately 165 in 1900, 2,000 in 1970, and 3,000 in 1982, along with hundreds of thousands of regulations backed up by criminal sanction.



Under the rule of law, citizens should be able to arrange their actions so as to avoid the commission of crimes. Yet the proliferation of highly technical laws, many going beyond the prohibition of intrinsically wrongful acts, makes it more likely that even a careful business with thousands of employees will commit some violations — especially if criminal infraction of regulations can be assessed without reference to _mens rea_ (i.e., guilty intent).



As Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has written, “Congress should enact legislation that requires the government to prove the defendant knowingly violated the law — or that, at least, allows a ‘mistake of law’ defense — for certain classes of crimes that have no analog in the common law or that no reasonable person would understand to be inherently wrong. Where the government has criminalized non‐​blameworthy conduct for regulatory purposes, ignorance of the law should be a valid defense to criminal liability.”



• “When I got there, there were people in SWAT attire that evacuated our entire factory.” Thirty federal agents raided the headquarters of Nashville’s legendary Gibson Guitar, carting away a fortune in wood and instruments and interrogating staff without benefit of a lawyer. The charge was that the company had used small quantities of imported wood without doing enough to ascertain suppliers’ compliance with a federal law called the Lacey Act. Gibson’s chief executive officer — who “had not received so much as a postcard telling the company it might be doing something wrong” — got a letter the next day warning him that if he so much as touched any guitar left in the plant he could be charged with a separate federal offense, with possible jail time, for each “violation.” After much press coverage sympathetic to the company, the feds settled for a relatively low $300,000, a sum far below what Gibson would have been likely to pay in legal defense, and returned the seized instruments.  
• The federal government extracted more than a billion dollars from Toyota in a settlement, even though its own engineers at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration cleared the Japanese automaker of charges that its cars were subject to runaway acceleration. The penalties were mostly premised on minor regulatory infractions unrelated to any injuries or accidents. The Department of Justice’s press announcement employed language suggesting that the problem of mechanical acceleration had been real, though Washington had good reason to know better.  
• The federal government and various states, notably New York, launched enforcement actions against major banks whose actions, it was alleged, had helped propel the mortgage bubble and crash of 2008. No one really knew, and no court ever decided, whether the charges were true or what a suitable penalty level might be. When the dust settled, major banks had agreed to pay record settlements, some going to investors and consumers, but with hundreds of millions also going to nonprofit organizations that the various law enforcement officials saw as worthy causes — which, in the case of the Obama administration and the attorney general of New York, happened also to be close political allies.  
• Several small family‐​owned retailers, including a Maryland dairy farm, a Detroit‐​area grocery, and a North Carolina convenience store, violated the little‐​known federal “structuring” law, which prohibits depositing money into banks in sums under $10,000 so as not to trigger a paperwork filing to the government, even when no tax or other laws are being evaded in the process. Federal agents seized the families’ bank accounts. With volunteer legal help, and amid public outcry, all three businesses managed to get their money back. But many other small businesses swept up by the same law, sometimes unable to pay lawyers because of the freeze on their assets, had by that time capitulated to large forfeitures.



The situation is even worse when laws are so vague that even reading them does not give fair notice of what they prohibit. Courts are inconsistent about applying the “rule of lenity” (ambiguities should be resolved against finding guilt) and the “void for vagueness doctrine” (laws can fail constitutional muster if they leave too much doubt about what they prohibit). As a result, certain areas — including federal mail and wire fraud, “honest services” fraud, antitrust law, and securities law — have proved particularly resistant to clarification.



In recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice has also sought to expand something called the “responsible corporate officer doctrine.” That doctrine allows the government to hold executives criminally liable for the sins of the corporation generally, even when those executives have not been shown to personally hold a guilty state of mind. Although the doctrine somehow passed muster at the U.S. Supreme Court in the cases of _United States v. Dotterweich_ (1943) and _United States v. Park_ (1975), it is ripe with potential for injustice.



Deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) and their close relatives, nonprosecution agreements (NPAs), have become a major tool of white‐​collar prosecution in recent years. Typically, in exchange for avoiding trial, a business defendant agrees to some combination of cash payment, agreement to change behavior, and submission to future oversight by DoJ. Often, DoJ assigns “monitors” with broad, vaguely defined powers to oversee the affairs of defendant companies and report back to Washington on an ongoing basis.



NPAs at the federal level date back only to 1992. But they have multiplied rapidly, from 1 or 2 a year in the nineties to more than 30 a year during the Obama administration. Since 2010, 16 of the largest U.S. businesses have come under Department of Justice supervision, with tens of billions of dollars extracted in settlements.



Notably, in these agreements, a business defendant may pledge to alter its future course of action in ways that a court would never have ordered had the case gone to trial but that the government is interested in extracting as concessions. These deals may have the effect, or even the aim, of helping or hurting third parties who have the ear of the government, such as customers or competitors of the targeted defendant.



“Without any adjudication to establish wrongdoing and without any judicial oversight, businesses have agreed through these settlements to remove or replace key officers and directors; to change sales, marketing, or compensation plans; and to appoint new officers or independent ‘monitors’ reporting to prosecutors but paid by the companies,” write James Copland and Isaac Gorodetski. The two argue that this process adds up to a “shadow regulatory state” lacking many of the administrative law protections of the visible regulatory state. Appointed monitors, in particular, can wield ill‐​defined but wide‐​ranging power with little accountability if it is put to heavy‐​handed use.



What to do? The United Kingdom took an early lead with its 2013 Crime and Courts Act, which, among other provisions, directs judges to determine that the provisions of DPA equivalents are “fair, reasonable, and proportionate.” In the U.S. Congress, a proposal called the Accountability in Deferred Prosecution Act of 2014 attempted to pursue similar principles. Much more is needed if U.S. law is to catch up with the institutional reality of a Department of Justice that has become the nation’s most powerful business regulator without anyone’s having designed it that way.



At base, the case for civil liberties in the business world is much the same as the case for civil liberties generally. Businesses deserve impartial prosecution in the interests of justice, not merely scoring wins for the government; speedy trial and clear exposition of charges; determination of guilt on an individualized, not group, basis; no excessive punishment; protections against baseless search and seizure; and, in general, the full range of due process protections. The marketplace, like the rest of American society, deserves the full protections of the U.S. Constitution.

Hurricane Sandy—which was, technically, not a hurricane by the time it buzzed into the Jersey Shore—was a terribly destructive cyclone. But blaming it on global warming, as did Al Gore, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and NYC’s Mayor Bloomberg, is scientifically ludicrous.



One has to be amazed at how little fact‐​checking the global warming alarmists do. I guess they don’t want the latest storm crisis to go to waste, but they don’t help their cause by mis‐​stating the obvious.



There’s a pretty sizable scientific literature out there on hurricanes and global warming. From the “modeling” end, probably the most cited paper is a 2004 study by Tom Knutson from the government’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton. Although he’s tweaked it a bit since then, the result remains the same. There should be a slight increase (8 per cent) in hurricane power by the end of this century. But the inter‐​annual variability of these storms is so great that this signal will not emerge from the noise until around 2080.



From the “real world” point of view, I published a bunch of papers in response to Tom’s work in which we found, using his assumptions about the amount of oceanic warming, that there would be a similar—again 8 per cent—increase in the number of big (Category 3 or higher) storms in the same time frame. When we adjusted for the pokey rate of oceanic warming being observed, that figure dropped by half.



Chunzai Wang of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has performed a very interesting data‐​based analysis of Atlantic hurricane tracks showing that increasing the area of warm water results in a significant _lowering_ of the likelihood that a storm will strike the U.S., something that should happen with continued oceanic warming. The reason is because storms form further out to sea, and there are more chances for a kink in the mid‐​atmospheric winds to direct them to the north.





One has to be amazed at how little fact‐​checking the global warming alarmists do.



A recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) purports to show an increase in hurricane‐​related storm surges that conveniently begins in 1923, which was during a decade‐​long lull in hurricane activity. Starting something at a low point pretty much insures a trend in any randomly distributed variable. This problem was noted by the above‐​mentioned Tom Knutson.



But the real killer to the hurricane‐​global warming hype comes from Dr. Ryan Maue (pronounced like the island) of Weatherbell Analytics. Using satellite data that gives global coverage beginning in 1972, Maue has calculated what is called the “Accumulated Cyclone Energy” (ACE) index. This is a mathematical integration of storm wind speed and longevity. There obviously is no change in hurricane energy that at all relates to warming, and it is currently near its lowest levels on record.









**Ryan Maue’s Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the globe (blue circles), Northern Hemisphere (black circles) and the Southern Hemisphere (area between the circles) shows no relationship between overall hurricane severity, frequency and global warming. Thanks to Ryan Maue and Weatherbell Analytics.**



I trotted this out once in a discussion with Nick Kristof on CNN’s Piers Morgan show on November 1. CNN, of course, cannot let go of the meme that Sandy (which was not a hurricane at landfall) was amped by global warming, so Kristof’s substantive response was to accuse me of not publishing any scientific papers since 1992. (I emailed him the 8‐​page single spaced list beginning in 1992, presuming he will set the record straight with CNN—and also rag on whomever gave him that little bit of libel.). Morgan’s producer also had copies of the papers dealing specifically with oceanic temperatures, climate change, and hurricane intensity.



What is really modulating Atlantic hurricanes is the distribution of temperature in the Atlantic. It was in an unfavorable mode in the 70s and 80s, which reversed in the mid‐​90s, concurrent with the start of a ten‐​year very active period. Since the big storm outbreak in 2005, the Atlantic hasn’t been unusually energetic since then. In fact, we are now enjoying the longest interval in the modern record (seven years and counting) without a major (Category 3) hurricane strike in the U.S.



The bottom line is that, everything else being equal, warmer oceans should produce stronger or more frequent storms. But the change has clearly been so small that there is simply no detectable signal—and is likely to remain so for a long time. Further, everything else is almost never equal. It would have been nice if Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Cuomo had done a bit of fact‐​checking before stirring the global warming pot. As for Gore, the lack of any increase in hurricane energy related to global warming is just an inconvenient truth.

What government unit has the right to tax you — your local government, regional or state government, federal government or multinational organizations, such as the United Nations, the World Bank and theWorld Health Organization? The reason the question is becoming more important is that rising numbers of politically powerful persons and institutions are calling for global taxes on such things as financial transactions, tobacco, sugar and carbon emissions.



The modern concept of the nation‐​state goes back to the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Among other things, it limited the power of the sovereign to the territory of the state, including the power to tax. The American Revolution was, in part, fought over the demand for “no taxation without representation.” Despite the success of the Revolution, the principle of no taxation without representation was violated from the very beginning, for both good and bad reasons. Once government divides people into classes and allows some classes to tax other classes, people can be taxed without their consent. The original voting franchise was limited to male property owners; hence, the “classes” of women and non‐​property‐​owners were taxed without their consent, along with blacks in the slaveholding states.



People are no longer classified by sex or race in most countries when it comes to voting rights, but it is fashionable to classify people by income or occupation and then tax them differently — thus denying a fundamental human right of equal treatment. Now this concept of unequal treatment and nonrepresentation is being promoted across countries, whereby people (even the non‐​rich) in rich countries should pay more taxes to support people in poor countries — in practice, all too often the corrupt ruling class.



The American founders understood that people would have more say over their government the closer it was to them, which is why the United States was set up as a federal republic. Under the Constitution, the federal government has few powers, and state and local governments have many powers if the people so choose. The power to tax is one of the most coercive powers governments have, so it is extremely dangerous to both liberty and prosperity.



Think of the consequences if international organizations gain the ability to tax. The tax‐​exempt bureaucrats who run these organizations will have an endless list of “unmet needs” and thus will create reasons to have never‐​ending tax increases. The United Nations is pushing a global financial transactions tax “to offset the costs of the enduring economic, financial, fuel, climate and food crises, and to protect basic human rights.”



The World Health Organization, in the name of boosting expenditures for health research for diseases that “disproportionally affect the developing world,” has just proposed in a new report a “Financial Transactions Tax and a Solidarity Tobacco Contribution — that in addition to the airline taxes implemented in some other countries could be used to generate funds to be channeled through an international mechanism to supplement national resources” (global‐​bureaucrat‐​speak for taking your liberty and money and giving it to others).



James Hansen of NASA again recently proposed a “flat‐​rate global tax” on carbon to stop global warming. In 2009, then‐​House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed her support for a Group of 20 “global tax.” In March, Vice President Joseph R. Biden said, “We want to create a global minimum tax.” It goes on and on.



In sum, the global‐​tax advocates are demanding that the world’s most productive people and institutions give more money to global, nondemocratic institutions, which have been rife with mismanagement and corruption, so those within the global institutions can spend it as they see fit with virtually no accountability. The resulting misallocation of capital will make the world dirtier and poorer, with higher unemployment.



Tax money tends to be much better spent when the people can see how it is spent and who is spending it. This is accomplished more easily at local levels of government, where there can be more real representation and accountability, rather than at the national level and particularly at the international level, where there is no effective representation. The problems of poverty and environmental neglect most often occur where the people have no effective representation and accountability — i.e. authoritarian countries.



Switzerland is very prosperous, with little poverty, and has very high health, education and environmental standards. And individual liberty. Most taxation is done at the local and regional level, where there is a high degree of direct democracy, representation and accountability. Ask yourself whether the world would be better off if there were many more Switzerlands — or many more international, non‐​accountable bureaucracies to tax and spend your money.

"**With up to 1.4 million people in line to get a Covid-19 vaccine in Wales in the months ahead, officials say it will be one of the biggest health programmes ever mounted.**
The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe for use.
But how will it be rolled out?
Preparations in Wales started in June and the Welsh Government hopes the first vaccines will be given within seven to 14 days.
To start with, everyone over 50 will be offered the vaccine in the coming months.
Here we ask those behind the rollout what we should expect.
There could well be seven different vaccines, eventually.
The first available is the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTec. The UK government has bought 40 million doses.
Each person getting this vaccine will need two doses, three weeks apart. Wales will get a share of around 4.8% based on its population.
The next will be the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine and there will be many more doses of this available, with the UK government having ordered 100 million doses.
The mRNA vaccine has to be stored at -75 C and also transported at that sub-zero temperature to the central locations where it will be used.
There may be some transportation possible at normal refrigerated temperature, which would enable it to be taken to care homes, but otherwise it will require those on the priority list to get to special vaccination centres.
The vaccines - in nearly 1,000 doses per package - have to be used within five days once opened. And the thawing and preparation process can take up to five days from when they arrive.
""It is tremendously exciting that only nine months on from the declaration of the pandemic, we have vaccines available to offer and a system in place to offer them,"" said Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine preventable disease programme at Public Health Wales.
""Some will be able to travel but some we would want to stay where they are - a care home for example. If we can solve that problem of transporting the vaccine but when the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine comes online, that's a vaccine which we store in the fridge, we can move it around and it lasts six months.""
Older, more vulnerable people and care home staff will be among the first to receive it. The Welsh Government will split the population into age groups to determine priority, based on advice form the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).
The order of priority is set to be:
The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19.
For context, around 900,000 flu vaccines were given over a period of 10 to 12 weeks last year - there are 1.4 million in the priority groups for the Covid vaccines.
""Although more complex because community locations are being used and the logistics with the vaccine, if we can match volume of delivery that we achieve with flu, then it will mean we will be able to roll out as quickly as possible,"" said Dr Roberts.
You will be told.
In the Cardiff and Vale health board, for example, Fiona Kinghorn, executive director for public health, said: ""We are already planning how we might vaccinate those in sequence, and different groups at the same time, and we'll call them, so when we are ready to vaccinate, they will receive a letter, and then in Cardiff and Vale, they will be able to ring our booking centre and book an appointment that is convenient for them.""
Each health board will get its share and vaccines will go across Wales at the same time. Mass vaccination centres will be set up - particularly for the mRNA vaccine, which needs to be kept a very low temperatures.
Cardiff and Vale health board has already said its mass vaccination centres will be at Splott and at leisure centres in Pentwyn and Barry.
Officials say each site will have tight security and the vaccines will be guarded ""like a VIP"", as well as cyber and IT security measures being taken.
Gill Richardson, chief adviser to the chief medical officer, said: ""It's been an incredible logistical exercise - we tested our pharmaceutical logistics colleagues but they've worked tirelessly to ensure there's an effective and safe vaccine across Wales.
""The vaccine can't be transported once it's diluted, it has to be used on the site. This is a vaccine that needs to be made up. It's not like the flu vaccine, where it comes ready-made and in single doses. It will be in vials which can serve five doses and it will be delivered so it can be used at those mass centres.""
Health officials would like to see ""thousands rather than hundreds"" vaccinated in the first few weeks. It's likely those vulnerable and shielded people and those with chronic conditions, who would normally get the flu vaccine, will also be slotted in too as it is rolled down the age groups.
""It's on the scale of the smallpox vaccination campaign [in the 1960s],"" said Dr Richardson.
There is hope that the take-up will be at least 75%.
It will be ""well into next year"" before the entire Welsh population has been vaccinated though, according to the Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Frank Atherton.
""It's fantastic news that we're going to be able to be starting this as soon as next week but everything else depends on when we get stocks and how quickly we can start to roll it out.""
There is a balancing act in staffing the programme from within the NHS, to ensure not too many people are taken away from where they are needed.
In the early stages, those who are already registered to vaccinate - with oversight by senior pharmacists and specialists - will be used to administer the vaccine.
More people, including those that have not administered vaccines before, will be trained up in the coming months.
Health boards are already recruiting retired nurses, midwives, pharmacists and therapists to train up.
Those being given the Pfizer/BioNTec vaccine will receive two doses, three weeks apart.
But the effectiveness of the vaccines will be studied to determine what form of immunity the vaccine gives and how long it might last.
That in future could determine whether people need to be vaccinated again in future. The different vaccines might well have different characteristics on this.
But Dr Richardson said they offered a ""fantastic message of hope""
Public health experts say you will still need to keep to guidelines around social distancing, hand-washing and using masks. Not everyone will be able to have vaccine and certainly not in the first phase. It will take some time to get back to normal.
""While vaccines are part of the answer, they are not the whole part"", said Swansea Bay health board's public health director Keith Reid.
He is worried that people might think ""we are all saved and this will all soon be over"".
You will not be able to mix and match between the vaccines - once you have received the first dose you must stick to it.
It is also not recommended you get the jab within 28 days of testing positive or from when you first have onset of Covid symptoms.
Beyond that, it is worth noting that previous exposure to Covid will not affect your eligibility for the vaccine or position within the priority list."
"How much does climate change cost? What will be the impact on our wallets? The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Working Group II has concluded that global warming of 2.5˚C would cost the equivalent to losing between 0.2-2.0% of annual income.  This seems in sharp contrast to the Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change, which found it would cost 5-20%. How can that be? The Stern Review was prepared by a team of civil servants and never reviewed (before publication) by independent experts. Some argue that the Stern Review served to bolster Gordon Brown’s credentials with the environmental wing of the Labour Party in preparation for his transition to party leader and prime minister. And in fact next week IPCC Working Group III will conclude that the Stern Review grossly underestimated the costs of bringing down greenhouse gas emissions. While interested parties can self-publish whatever they want, such informally published grey literature has no place in the IPCC’s work. Although the Stern Review’s findings were not included in the IPCC’s current, Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the Stern Review draws heavily on the climate change impact estimates of Chris Hope of Cambridge University, whose numbers are peer-reviewed, and were included in the IPCC’s work. Hope calculated a economic loss of 0.9%, slightly lower than the IPCC’s central estimate of 1.1%. So the Stern Review and IPCC AR5 do not contradict one another. If anything, the Stern Review is slightly more optimistic. So how did the Stern Review reach its figure of 5%-20% of income, when in fact its calculations started with an estimate of less than 1%? The reason is an arcane bit of welfare economics. Dr Hope’s 0.9% is a conventional impact estimate. If the world warmed by 2.5˚C, the average person would feel as if they had lost 0.9% of her income. If the world warmed by more, the impact would be higher; if warming is less, the impact is lower. The Stern Review’s 5% is generated like an annuity, taking a stream of payments that vary over time (in this case the predicted impact of climate change) and converting it into fixed annual payments. The Stern Review thus replaces the impact of more than 200 years of climate change – effects that start low and end high – with a number that is the same for each year. Most people find it confusing to replace numbers that vary over time with a single fixed number. In order to calculate an annuity economists apply a discount rate, effectively representing the change in value of money over time. The Stern Review (as it was originally published in 2006) uses a discount rate of about 1.4% – far below what most people use, and indeed far lower than the official discount rate of Her Majesty’s Treasury of 3.5% (and falling further to 1% for those effects more than three centuries into the future). Using such a low discount rate inflates the annuity, and so the reported costs of climate change. Stern’s argument for a low discount rate is a paternalistic one. People’s value judgements are wrong, according to the Stern Review, and the government has the right to overrule them. Stern puts himself in the position of a colonial ruler, governing the savages against their will – but in their own interest, of course. Stern’s 5% figure also reflects the uncertainties about future climate change and its impact on our welfare. Combined with the low discount rate, this means that the headline number of the Stern Review is dominated by unlikely events in 200 years’ time. It does not reflect climate changes’ impact in the near term, or even the best estimate over a century. It is, by and large, a prediction based on the worst case scenario of two centuries from now. Unfortunately, this worst case is internally inconsistent. It assumes both high greenhouse gas emissions and high vulnerability to the effects of climate change. That does not make sense. Essentially, it assumes that, for example, Africans will be rich enough to drive highly emitting SUVs, but too poor to buy mosquito nets to protect their children against malaria spread by increased numbers of insects that the warmer, wetter climate global warming would bring. So while Stern reports a range of 5-20%, those figures do not truly represent upper and lower bounds. The 5% is their best estimate, reflecting all uncertainties. The 20% is an arbitrary number – it is based on assumptions on greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and climate impacts that the authors themselves find less credible. Both studies agree that the economic impact of climate change is small – half a century of climate change at this rate would do perhaps as much damage as losing one year of economic growth. Unfortunately, the Stern Review hides this reasonably optimistic conclusion behind accounting tricks and dubious assumptions, creating a sense of disagreement that is not there.

Aaron M. McCright – duped by the 97% consensus number
But, we all know that 97% consensus talking point is simply based on a handful of actual climate  responding to a broad questionnaire combined with some statistical spin to give the desired result. Apparently, that’s good enough for low information folks, even the researcher in this story, MSU’s Aaron M. McCright is taken in by the spin.
From Michigan State University:
US residents who believe in the scientific consensus on global warming are more likely to support government action to curb emissions, regardless of whether they are Republican or Democrat, according to a study led by a Michigan State University sociologist.
However, a political divide remains on the existence of climate change despite the fact that the vast majority of scientists believe it is real, said Aaron M. McCright, associate professor in Lyman Briggs College and the Department of Sociology.

The study, in the journal Climatic Change, is one of the first to examine the influence of political orientation on perceived scientific agreement and support for government action to reduce emissions.
“The more people believe scientists agree about climate change, the more willing they are to support government action, even when their party affiliation is taken into account,” McCright said. “But there is still a political split on levels of perceived scientific agreement, in that fewer Republicans and conservatives than Democrats and liberals believe there is a scientific consensus.”
McCright and colleagues analyzed a Gallup survey of 1,024 adults who were asked about their views on climate change.
The results reaffirm the success of what McCright calls the “denial machine” – an organized movement to undercut the scientific reality of climate change during the past two decades.
McCright said the first step in dealing with climate change is getting both sides of the political spectrum to accept the scientific consensus. At that point, he said, policymakers can go about the task of coming up with an approach to combat it.
He said both government and industry should be involved in that effort.
“Certainly we can’t solve all our problems with global warming through government regulations – in fact, for some problems, government regulations might make it worse,” McCright said. “And so we need a combination of market-based solutions and government regulations.”
McCright’s co-authors are Riley Dunlap of Oklahoma State University and Chenyang Xiao of American University.

"**Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown.**
A tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into force in the nation, with businesses including hairdressers and beauty salons also able to open.
More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households.
The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"".
Meanwhile, the UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.
The first 800,000 doses will be available in the UK from next week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.
England's new three-tiered system was backed by MPs in a Commons vote just hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan.
There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark.
And people arrived promptly to take advantage of a stock clearance sale at Debenhams department store from 07:00 GMT.
Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown.
It comes after a period which has seen the collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group, women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ© and the failure of Debenhams to secure a buyer \- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk.
Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, but down by 24.1% on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard.
Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates.
She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online.""
Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy.
""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said.
""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month.""
Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.
Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand.
There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels.
British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers, with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"".
Pubs and restaurants are now allowed to reopen in tier one and two areas, although in tier two alcohol can only be served with a ""substantial meal"".
The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus.
And later on Wednesday about 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football League for the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March.
England's new coronavirus restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November.
Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers.
In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors.
And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.
Scotland operates a five-tier system while Wales and Northern Ireland have their own coronavirus restrictions \- with the latter currently in a two-week circuit breaker lockdown.
On Tuesday, a further 13,430 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK while a further 603 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 59,051.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
  
About a year and a half ago, we were co‐​authors (along with Dr. Oliver Frauenfeld from Texas A&M University) on a paper published in the _Journal of Geophysical Research_ in which we presented a nearly 225‐​year reconstruction of surface snow melt across Greenland (Figure 1).   
  
  
Our reconstruction was based on long‐​term temperature records from the southern Greenland coast along with historic indicators of the atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic Ocean. We found that in addition to the period since about the year 2000, there was an extended (multi‐​decadal) period in the early portion of the 20th century where the amount of surface snowmelt was elevated above the long‐​term average. We concluded from this that since there did not appear to be a large increase in the rate of global sea level rise during the early 20th century period of elevated ice melt—a melt driven primarily by warmer than normal temperatures—that Greenland’s contribution to global sea level rise during the current period of high temperatures was likely to remain relatively “modest,” at least for the next few decades.   






Figure 1. Reconstructed history of the total ice melt extent index over Greenland, 1784–2009. Observed values of the ice melt index (blue solid circles), reconstructed values of the ice melt index (gray open circles), the 10 year trailing moving average through the reconstructed and fitted values (thick red line), and the 95% upper and lower confidence bounds (thin gray lines) (from Frauenfeld et al., 2011).   
  
  
Neither our methods, nor or findings were overly controversial—or so we thought.   
  
  
Shortly after our paper was published, one of the reviewers of our paper, a noted snow/​ice researcher who has spent a lot of time studying Greenland, Dr. Jason Box, came forwarded and denounced our work. On his blog (in posts he has subsequently removed), he attacked our work both from a scientific standpoint as well as deriding it with a few _ad hominems_ (for example “Examining the 2nd [Knappenberger] and 3rd [Michaels] authors’ credentials, a climate change denialist pattern emerges”).   
  
  
On both accounts we felt he was wrong (of course) and offered a rebuttal.   
  
  
But perhaps the strongest argument that our results were scientifically sound comes from an ironic source—the results of new research findings from Jason Box himself!   
  
  
These new findings from Box, although not yet fully available, have been incorporated into another research project that has recently been published (Gregory et al., 2012) and thus we can get a sneak peek at them.   
  
  
The solid black line in Figure 2 (below) shows Box’s reconstruction of the sea level rise contribution from Greenland back into since the mid‐​1800s.   






Figure 2. Various estimates of the time series of the Greenland ice‐​sheet mass contribution to global‐​mean sea‐​level rise. The reconstructions are plotted as ten‐​year running time‐​means of the sea‐​level equivalent of the rate of change of mass of the Greenland ice‐​sheet with respect to the mean of 1961–1990. The solid black line, labeled “B” is the net mass balance, including both surface mass balance and ice discharge from Jason Box. The horizontal dotted line indicates zero. The vertical lines indicate the years in which major volcanic eruptions occurred (from Gregory et al., 2012).   
  
  
Notice the strong resemblance of Box’s reconstruction of the sea level contribution from Greenland with our reconstruction of the surface snow melt across Greenland. The snow melt/​sea level contribution is currently very high, was relatively low in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, was high from the mid‐​1920s through the late 1960s, and was lower in the 1800s.   
  
  
Considering that there are other factors besides snowmelt (like snow accumulation and calving glaciers) that contribute to Greenland’s net contributions to sea level rise, the two curves are remarkably similar. This is a strong indication that whatever is driving snowmelt (regional temperature) is also driving the net sea level contribution.   
  
  
All of which we wrote in our paper:   




This record of ice melt indicates that the melt extent observed since the late 1990s is among the highest likely to have occurred since the late 18th century, although recent values are not statistically different from those common during the period 1923–1961, a period when summer temperatures along the southern coast of Greenland were similarly high as those experienced in recent years. Our reconstruction indicates that if the current trend toward increasing melt extent continues, total melt across the Greenland ice sheet will exceed historic values of the past two and a quarter centuries   
  
  
…The forces acting in concert with ice melt across Greenland to produce higher global sea levels currently, should also have been acting during the extended high‐​melt conditions from the mid‐​1920s to the early 1960s.



And we also added this concerning the significance of Greenland’s contribution to the total global sea level rise:   




[T]here is no indication that the increased contribution from the Greenland melt in the early to mid 20th century, a roughly 40 year interval when average annual melt was more or less equivalent to the average of the most recent 10 years (2000–2009), resulted in a rate of global sea level rise that exceeded ~mm/​yr. This suggests that Greenland’s contribution to global sea level rise, even during multidecadal conditions as warm as during the past several years, is relatively modest.



Figure 3 (anther figure from the new paper from Gregory et al., 2012) shows the breakdown of the factors contributing to the global rise in sea level of the past century and a half. Greenland’s contribution (based on Box’s reconstruction) is the pale green line (labeled “Greenland‐​B” in the legend). I think it is pretty fair to characterize this as “modest.”   






Figure 3. Observational (black) and a reconstructed (red) time series of global mean sea‐​level rise (thick lines, with 5–95% observational uncertainty shaded), also showing the contributions to the latter (thin lines), identified by the time series initials in the key (from Gregory et al., 2012).   
  
  
Why was such a big deal was made about our research results and “denialist” credentials when subsequent results, made by the very person who went _ad hominem_ , completely replicate our findings?

Meet the Plonkers.



Plonker-in-Chief is an Austrian-born socialist control-freak with a mental disorder. I’m not sure the world is ready for another one of those.



Nevertheless, she is here, ready to cripple the capital’s transport movements on Monday, extolling her charges to face arrest if necessary, to further her intellectually-stunted world-view and create ‘rebellion’. She is a self-described ‘pre-traumatic stress disorder sufferer’ and ‘activist’. Sea Rottman (although faux-tivist may be a better description), of ‘Extinction Rebellion’ is determined to disrupt Wellington this coming Monday.



Faux-tivist Rottman earns that title for her willingness to encourage her simpleton followers to face arrest in the name of climate-crisis. **But – she is unwilling to risk that same outcome for herself,** because for Precious, “It would be career-limiting if I was … arrested or convicted”. Poor thing. She ‘has to travel internationally’ for her work, spraying exhaust fumes all over her arrested followers in her wake as she jets off overseas to plan for a fossil-fuel-free world by 2025. I kid you not.



The faux-tivist hypocrite plans to disrupt our commute, to protest ‘carbon’, but recommends her fondlings, can you believe it, use a car, catch a bus, take the train or ferry to protest. I tell no lie:[ ](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8fe1c11dda9574151efec42a3a0f0f7da100092295b9a6e3a9595f348d00dea1.png)



The clown apparently sees no irony whatsoever in this. Surely she should be extolling the dumpty-doo’s that plan to disrupt our day in order to save the world from deadly carbon, to run, jog, scoot, hop, cycle, crawl or simply walk to protest, allowing them to experience what a fossil-fuel-free world will feel like.



But then again, catching a pic of the behemoth, I suspect she’s not a huge fan of walking. Don’t get me wrong, she is huge and I just strongly suspect vigorous exercise is not her thing:[ ](https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0ab80ee96ed041e9f9883142e36cb4d9713b0b1ebd9b99119d095f10527f93.png)



When her majestic largesse claims “my aim is to make a difference and influence people to be more aware or reducing consumption” I think she actually seeks to ensure there’s more left over for her own plate, the underlying motive of most socialist mickey-mouthpieces.



Our hysterical faux-tivist is **so very concerned about rising sea-levels that she lives right next to the beach** at Wellington’s very lowest-lying place: Moa Point. She’s not even trying to hide her massive hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance. How do even the utterly stupid fall for these side-show charlatans?



She’s claiming to be anti-extinction but I propose the only extinction she possibly faces is falling asleep on the little beach opposite her house and being claimed as taonga by local iwi arriving with a chainsaw to take out her lower jaw.



Transport for me, but not for thee. Consumption for me, but not for thee. Arrest for thee, but not for me. She is truly world-class plonkery writ large. Very large.

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

Dr. Michael Connolly and his son Dr. Ronan Connolly have done an in-depth assessment of weather balloon temperature records. In this video, Dr. Michael Connolly explains that there is a significant difference in temperature between urban temperature monitoring stations and those in rural settings. This is well-known as the “Urban Heat Island” effect, where the heat generated by human activity, as well as the absorption of heat from the sun on black pavement and concrete, is retained in a kind of heat ‘bubble’ around a city, while in the country, daytime heating is dissipated by evaporation and wind. To find out to what extent the claim of ‘global warming’ is affected by this phenomenon (which might be an artificial claim), the Connolly’s sought an independent data source that would not be affected by urban/human activity – they chose weather balloons. Dr. Michael Connolly discusses their findings. Their full presentation can be seen here on our blog: Balloons in the Air: Understanding weather and climate.

"At least $67bn of the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 can be attributed directly to climate breakdown, according to research that could lead to a radical reassessment of the costs of damage from extreme weather. Harvey ripped through the Caribbean and the US states of Texas and Louisiana, causing at least $90bn of damage to property and livelihoods, and killing scores of people.  Conventional economic estimates attributed only about $20bn of the destruction to the direct impacts of global heating. Climate breakdown is known to be making hurricanes stronger and may make them more likely to occur, but separating the effects of global heating from the natural weather conditions that also cause hurricanes is complex. In a study published in the journal Climatic Change, researchers used the emerging science of climate change attribution to calculate the odds of such a hurricane happening naturally or under increased carbon dioxide levels, and applied the results to the damage caused. Similar methods were used in a separate study, published last month in the same journal, that found that droughts in New Zealand between 2007 and 2017 cost the economy about NZ$4.8bn, of which $800m was directly linked to climate change. Floods caused insured losses of about NZ$470m over the same period, of which NZ$140m was linked to the climate. The researchers say the new tools are a more accurate way of estimating the economic damage caused by climate breakdown. “We’re pretty sure the climate change-related damages associated with extreme events have been underestimated in most assessments of the social cost of carbon,” said David Frame, a professor of climate change at the Victoria University of Wellington and the lead author of the studies. “We think this line of research, as it matures, should provide a really valuable input.” Friederike Otto, the director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said the method could make it possible to generate global estimates of the true cost of climate breakdown, which could have a profound effect on how governments and businesses approach the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “We have known about the costs of climate change theoretically,” said Otto. “It’s all very well in the abstract, but the global mean temperature does not kill anyone – extreme events cost money and lives. Being able to attribute these impacts to climate change means being able to convey what climate change really means.” She said it would become possible to compile an inventory of the damage that could be attributed to climate change around the world, which governments and businesses could use to bring about change. “Hopefully this will speed up the process of moving to net zero [carbon].” Estimating the true costs of the climate crisis could also help developing countries seeking recognition of the loss and damage they face as a result of climate breakdown, which they argue should spur rich countries to provide more assistance. Loss and damage is likely to be one of the most vexed issues at next year’s UN Cop26 climate summit. Legal actions around the world would also be affected, said Tessa Khan, a co-director of the Climate Litigation Network. Activists and local governments around the world are taking fossil fuel companies to court over their greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that they knowingly caused damage while profiting from raising carbon dioxide levels. “[The two new studies] are opening to door to stronger evidence to persuade courts that fossil fuel companies should be held accountable for their role,” Khan said. “This will strengthen the legal basis of these lawsuits.”"
"**Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins owner Arcadia has gone into administration, putting 13,000 jobs at risk.**
The High Street giant has hired administrators from Deloitte after the pandemic ""severely impacted"" sales across the group.
No redundancies would be announced immediately, it said in a statement.
And Arcadia's stores will continue to trade as Deloitte considers all options available to the group.
All orders made over the Black Friday weekend will also be honoured, the administrators added.
Sir Philip Green's retail empire had failed to secure extra funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic.
The group, which runs 444 stores in the UK and 22 overseas, said 9,294 employees are currently on furlough.
The administration will give Arcadia breathing space from creditors, such as landlords for its shops or clothing suppliers, while a buyer is sought for all or parts of the company. Arcadia executives will still hold day-to-day control over the business.
Ian Grabiner, the boss of Arcadia, said it marked an ""incredibly sad"" day for the group.
""The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the forced closure of our stores for prolonged periods, has severely impacted on trading across all of our brands,"" he said.
""Throughout this immensely challenging time our priority has been to protect jobs and preserve the financial stability of the group, in the hope that we could ride out the pandemic and come out fighting on the other side.
""Ultimately, however, in the face of the most difficult trading conditions we have ever experienced, the obstacles we encountered were far too severe.""
Matt Smith, joint administrator at Deloitte, said that it would be working with Arcadia management to assess all of the options available to the group's brands, which also include Evans and Outfit.
He said Deloitte would rapidly seek expressions of interest and expected to identify one, or more, buyers to hopefully ensure the future of the businesses.
Fashion retailer Boohoo is seen as a potential buyer for some of Arcadia Group's big name brands, such as Topshop. In the past it has bought struggling brands Oasis, Warehouse, Karen Millen and Coast.
The prospects for the 13,000 workers look very challenging. There is a lot of industry chatter that online-only retailers might want to snap up the names that still have some consumer power - such as Topshop and Topman.
But while the likes of Boohoo and Asos may want the brands, they will not want to take on a portfolio of physical stores - which is where most of the jobs are. Other brands like Wallis, Evans, Dorothy Perkins and Burton are not considered very relevant to a new generation of consumers.
And what of Sir Philip? His gruff and combative style belies - or is perhaps explained by - the fact he is much more thin-skinned and sensitive than you might think. He will feel this failure personally - but that will be little comfort to the thousands of employees facing an uncertain future with Christmas round the corner and rising unemployment limiting their other job options.
He is also very stubborn. That resistance to change, and insisting he knew best, was at the heart of Arcadia's demise. It's hard to see another act in what has been a career full of drama and controversy.
As many have said, at heart he was not really a retailer - he was a shrewd financier - a money man. The future of retail requires a very different skill-set.
Arcadia was once a darling of the High Street, but long before coronavirus, Sir Philip's brands were struggling against newer, online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing.
Julie Palmer, partner at professional services firm Begbies Traynor, said: ""While the Covid-19 crisis has undoubtedly accelerated the company's decline, in reality, the writing had been on the wall for Arcadia for some time.
""Its competitors forged ahead with high-profile online propositions that it simply failed to match.""
In its most recent accounts for the year to 1 September 2018, Arcadia reported a Â£93.4m pre-tax loss compared with a Â£164.6m profit in the previous 12 months. It also said sales fell 4.5% to Â£1.8bn.
The pandemic did also lead to a huge drop-off in sales as stores had to shut for long stretches.
While the business persuaded its landlords to lower its rents in June, it was not enough to steady the ship.
Arcadia's 13,000 workers now face an anxious wait. One store manager told the BBC they felt ""angry, sad and disappointed"" on Monday.
""I've now got a large team that's all terrified of what's going to happen to them and their futures"", they said.
""I am just hoping that something can be done to preserve the brands and the employees' jobs.""
Dave Gill, from retail trade union Usdaw, said: ""It is crucial that the voice of staff is heard over the future of the business.
""We are seeking urgent meetings [with the administrators] and need assurances on what efforts are being made to save jobs, the plan for stores to continue trading and the funding of the pension scheme.""
Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund, which has 10,000 members.
Stephen Timms, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, called on Sir Philip to cover a shortfall in the pension scheme and urged the pension watchdog to fight on behalf of the group's workers.
Business Secretary Alok Sharma tweeted on Monday that the independent Pensions Regulator ""has a range of powers to protect pension schemes"", and that he would be keeping a ""very close eye"" on the administrators' report on director conduct.
Sir Philip previously faced controversy for selling off BHS, the former department store chain, for Â£1 to businessman Dominic Chappell. The following year, BHS went bust with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m.
Sir Philip reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator to inject Â£363m into that scheme. Meanwhile, Mr Chappell was recently sentenced to six years for tax evasion.
Arcadia is the latest major retailer to have been hammered by store closures during the pandemic.
Competitors Debenhams, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group, Oasis and Warehouse have all slid into insolvency since lockdown measures were first imposed in March.
The collapse of Arcadia could also affect Debenhams as it is feared it could scupper a sale of the department store chain to JD Sports.
Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. It sells brands such as Miss Selfridge and Evans across the department store chain.
JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year.
Debenhams has already cut about 6,500 jobs since May, and now has about 12,000 employees across 124 stores.

"We all know we have a crisis of housing supply and affordability. Over the past four years we have built on average 110,000 homes a year in England, less than the 150,000 homes built 110 years ago in 1904. Against this sorry state of affairs appears the Campaign to Protect Rural England’s report entitled Community Control or Countryside Chaos?, purporting to reveal the shocking effects of the National Planning Policy Framework two years after its introduction. Like a 17th century tract on how to detect witches, the report’s authors warn us to beware the rapacious developers laying waste the countryside. Examples include a case study of 11 “villages under siege” – stories compiled by local witchfinders – and an account of 58 planning appeals, of which about a third (19) were refused (a not unusual amount) but 39 were allowed. This – which if all were built would total only 8,705 houses – is presented as clear evidence of a conspiracy to concrete over our sacred turf. Another claim, from a study of Local Plans, is that they contain “proposals for more than 700,000” houses built on open countryside. The evidence for this – a survey put together by local CPRE membership groups – reveals an altogether less encouraging picture. Less encouraging, that is, if one hopes ever to build in coming years an even passable number of houses in places where people want and need to live if they are to have access to jobs. The survey makes no distinction between green belt (designated development-protected areas around cities designed to contain them) and greenfield (any land not yet built on). This might be sensible given that so much of greenbelt land is used for intensive agriculture, which provides no environmental benefits or amenity value at all, not least since there is virtually no public access. However the survey of local plans, many still pending approval, looks at potential sites identified for the next 16 years to 2030. If we were very successful we might aspire to build double our current rate, an average of 200,000 houses a year to 2030. In 2009 the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit estimated that we needed to build about 260,000 a year if we hoped even to restore housing affordability to the levels of 2000, so our aspirational and wholly unlikely target of 200,000 homes a year for 16 years – 3.2m homes – would not be enough. If just 700,000 of those 3.2m were on greenfield land, as the CPRE report suggests, that would imply almost 80% were on brownfield sites. That would not only substantially exceed the now-dropped national target of 60%, it would also be neither feasible nor desirable. One aspect of brownfield sites, apart from the additional cost to develop them, is that they tend not to be where the jobs are. According to the Department for Communities and Local Government’s housebuilding tables, twice as many houses have been built in declining, post-industrial Barnsley and Doncaster than in Oxford and Cambridge where there is housing demand and jobs. So the proposed modest expansion of Cambridge into greenfield and perhaps even a corner of its green belt is a positive. Since 74% of the Cambridge green belt is used for intensive farming, these plans would represent a substantial improvement in biodiversity, economic efficiency, and in equity. People who previously had been priced out of the Cambridge housing markets and unable to access the jobs there may be able to live and work there. The real problem is how febrile imaginings are turned into frightening falsehoods. The CPRE report brims with photographs of bucolic villages bearing captions such as “Developers are being allowed to build on greenfield sites”, or of an excavator in an anonymous site captioned “Development pressure is growing on the edge of many villages” (note the weasel word “many”). There is an illustration of a beautiful section of the Devon coastal path below a story that builder Persimmon is “calling for” 257 houses “on a greenfield site on the edge of Sidmouth” (so, not the site depicted) and “the village of Feniton has been targeted by speculators seeking housing developments”. Again, and in each case, the area presented, beautiful and deserving of protection, is under no threat at all. A close reading of the survey from which the report reaches its total of 700,000 houses proposed for greenfield/green belt sites over the next 16 years shows it comes with all sorts of caveats. “Proposal of 20,230 houses met many objections”; “full numbers not available”; “local reports – no numbers specified”; “no allocations at present”. But in each such case a figure – 20,230, 9,100, whatever – is inserted. Thus even the very low total of 700,000 houses over 16 years, or 43,750 a year, is not documented as a set of proposals. It is essentially a scarenumber. In fact for a 16-year period it seems not worryingly large, but in fact too small to be credible. As is well known only a small fraction of proposed or rumoured houses are ever built, and even if every one of them was, it would still represent only a tiny inroad into our housing shortfall. Looking at what has been actually built since 1969 (table 209) is depressing. Between 1969-1989 we built 4,302,270 houses in England, but between 1994-2012 it was only 2,687,040, fewer by more than 1.6m. In order to restore housing supply and affordability, according to the NHPAU analysis, would require 4,940,000 houses in a 19-year period, 2,252,960 more than were built between 1994-2012. So we have a building deficit of between 1.6-2.3m houses to make up even before we start to cater for future growth in demand. Some facts, then, rather than alarmist rumours: according to DCLG, planning applications for the last quarter of 2013 were close to the lowest since 2003, only about two thirds of the average between 2003 and the financial crisis in 2008. Approvals were not quite so dire, but still only at about 70% of 2003-2005 levels. The numbers of housebuilding starts are even less encouraging, given the housing shortfall. In successive booms we have managed to build ever fewer houses : 287,310 in 1969/70, 219,950 in 1988/89, and 183,360 in 2005/06. In the most recent data for 2012/13 it was only 107,820, below even the level of the post crisis trough. The real scandal is not the houses it is rumoured we might be planning on greenfield sites, but the actual number we are failing to build in the here and now – and, it would appear, in the foreseeable future, unless adequate land can be freed up to tackle the housing crisis."

In a hearing by the Lower Saxony Environment Committee on June 16, 2014, Professor Stefan Rahmstorf (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research) once again announced panic warnings of melting ice in the Arctic and ocean-acidification. EIKE reports here.

German geologist Prof. F.K. Ewert (photo) takes a close look at how these claims are exaggerated and how activist scientists attempt to use natural processes to create panic.
What follows is Prof. F.K. Ewert’s piece at EIKE in English (translated/edited by P Gosselin):

Expansion of Arctic sea ice, ocean acidification?
Statement on the presentation made by Prof. Dr. Rahmstorf (PIK) to the committee for Environment, Energy and Climate of the state parliament of Lower Saxony, 16 June 2014.
As is usual in so-called “climate science’, Prof. Stefan Rahmstorf is very selective with the facts: When they contradict the zeitgeist of man-made climate change, they get ignored. This way of conducting science is not new –– there have always been scientists who have served authority – and their own interests. Karl Popper recognized that science becomes ideology as soon as one stops to ask questions and only allows repetition instead. Plenty of examples are known.
German writer Goethe once said (18 Dec 1828): ‘One must always repeat what is true because fallacy is also constantly preached around us, and not from just one person, but by the masses in newspapers and encyclopedias, at schools and universities.’ At his presentation before the Committee for Environment, Energy and Climate at the state parliament of Lower Saxony on 16 June 2014, Prof. Rahmstorf once again practiced pseudoscience, this time it concerned Arctic sea ice extent and the ocean acidification.
Alleged shrinking of Arctic sea ice
The shrinking of Arctic sea ice up to the year 2012 was used by Rahmstorf as proof of the ongoing CO2-induced global warming. However the fact that sea ice grew 40% from August 2012 to August 2013 never got mentioned. The ice comes and goes because periodic, episodic fluctuations in temperature development also take place in the Arctic.

Prof. Rahmstorf informed that ‘our anthropogenic CO2 was causing an acidification of the ocean, which has increased 30%, and as a result the coral reefs are in danger.’
Are we really seeing the alleged acidity? No. This is because with a pH = 8.1 they are still very much alkaline. Foremost ocean researcher and climate agitator Rahmstorf apparently does not know about the chemistry of the ocean, let alone the coral reefs. Yet he sees himself qualified to judge this.
It is a fact that atmospheric CO2 concentration over the course of the earth’s history was far greater than it is today. And if that is the case, then so were the oceans. It is a fact that the pH value of the oceans has dropped from 8.2 to 8.1. This is nothing more then a small drop in alkalinity because water does not become acidic until the pH drops under 7.0. Whether the current pH change from 8.2 to 8.1 is new and unique, or can also be greater and how it was in former times, is unknown because no long-term measurements are available.
CO2 and H2O don’t want anything to do with each other and so they separate immediately after their first connection to carbonic acid. Only 1% of carbonic acid reacts and bonds with the plentiful amounts of calcium found in water to form calcium carbonate, which in water is only 0.0114 g/l soluble. While constantly new calcium carbonate forms, as lime slurry it has to settle and form limestone.
The biochemistry is more complex and involves many facets: One is that the skeletons of many animal species are formed with calcium carbonate. But not only clams and the like. Our limestone Alps for example were formed in large part from the calcium carbonate skeletons of protzoa. CO2 made it possible for their there calcium carbonate skeletons to be created.
Moreover CO2 is the building block of coral reefs. Their growth begins with algae that live in the corals, and they need CO2 in order to live and grow, and thus provide for the growth of calcium carbonate skeletons that eventually lead to the formation of the reefs. In addition to the large coral reefs of today’s tropical seas, there are countless relics made of large masses of calcium carbonate, also in our Central German mountains we are able to see them – e.g. in the Harz, Sauerland and Eifel regions. They were all once coral reefs in the ocean. Their CO2 content was considerably higher than today – and that was good because it produced huge quantities of limestone.
Therefore: without the building block of CO2 there would be no limestone and so no coral reefs! Admittedly the CO2 concentrations were greater than today. But it is unknown whether the pH value was maybe lower or higher than it is in our geological time and whether and how it changed.
And last but not least: What is the impact of the huge quantities of CO2 that are constantly pouring out of vents and volcanoes at the seabed? We neither know their quantities nor their temporal or spatial changes. One thing is certain: They are also involved in the formation of calcium carbonate and coral reefs.
Rahmstorf’s acidification theory leads us to ask on thing: What does this kind of climate and ocean research have to do with natural sciences?

The “Delay”
By Ed Caryl
There has been some interest in the lag in ice cores between temperature as measured from oxygen isotope differences, and the CO2 content as measured directly in gas bubbles. The literature seems to agree that the lag is something between one millennium and 800 years. As I had downloaded the EPICA Dome C data for both, resolved to 100 years, I decided to play with the numbers.
The first thing discovered is that the CO2 data resolution for times older than 22,000 years was not 100 years, but a variable number much coarser than that, interpolated in 100 year intervals, The original data resolution is up to more than a thousand years for some stretches of time.
The other thing discovered in the charted data are three groupings in time: the ice age time up to 20,000 years ago, the melt interval from 20,000 to 10,000 years BP, and the recent 10,000 years. The following charts show what the whole 100,000 year time interval looks like. The first figure is an XY plot of temperature versus CO2 concentration for the last 100,000 years.

Figure 1a is the CO2 plotted against temperature with no delay. Figure 1b is a plot of best fit for delays between plus 1000 years and negative 2500 years. For best R2 value the delay is 900 years. For highest temperature response versus CO2, the steepest linear trend line, it is at 2200 years.
An 800 to 1000-year value is what most researchers are finding looking at ice core data. Look here, here, and here. But in the current era, the last 50 years, lag times are less than a year. Look here, here, and here.
But notice the grouping in Figure 1a. There seems to be a difference between colder and warmer times, and a large gap where the temperature was increasing rapidly. What do we see when these groups are isolated and measured?

Figure 2a is the CO2 plotted against temperature with no delay for the time period from 100,000 years BP to 20,000 years BP. Figure 2b is a plot of best fit for delays between plus 0 years and negative 2500 years. For best R-square value the delay is 2100 years. The highest temperature versus CO2 response (the steepness of the trend line) is 2200 years.
During the ice age, the data has low resolution leading to low R2 values, but the delay is longer than 900 years. It is now measured at 2100 and 2200 years for the R2 and temperature response values, a much longer delay. For the emergence interval when the ice is melting and temperature and CO2 are rising sharply, and the CO2 data resolution is much higher, we should get a clearer picture of the delay, and indeed we do.

Figures 3a and 3b are of the time period from 20,000 years BP to 10,000 years BP. During this interval the delay is much shorter, the R value much higher, and the delay is about 400 years. It is longer at 1000 years for the maximum temperature change for a CO2 change (the trend slope).
So now that it has warmed up, and again holding a more or less constant temperature and a more or less constant CO2 value, what is the delay during the last 10,000 years?

Figures 4a and 4b show a multiple number of delays, including zero delay, 300 years and 700 years for the last 10,000 years. It looks like multiple delays are happening in this interval.

In Figure 4a, there appear to be two groups of data points, above and below 265 ppm CO2. The dividing point happens to be at 5000 years ago. If we split the data at 5000 years BP, we get these two sets of plots.

Figure 5a and 5b are plots from 10,000 year BP to 5000 years BP. In this period the delay is 700 years and both methods agree.

Figures 6a and 6b are plots from 5000 year BP to the present. The delay is zero but the R2 values are very low. The relationship between temperature and CO2 appears to be very low.
I will summarize with two more plots. Figures 7a and 7b are summaries of the previous plots:

Figure 7a is a plot of delay versus the R2 value, and 7b is the delay versus the average CO2 concentration during each interval.
As the CO2 concentration goes up, the delay, and the R2 value goes down, until at the present time, and indeed for the last 5000 years since the CO2 concentration has reached 265 ppm, there has been no delay.
There are several possible interpretations for these observations.
First, there is a delay dependent on CO2 concentration. The difficulty with this interpretation is that no one has proposed a mechanism for such a delay. Indeed, few have even noticed that the delay changes over time.
The second possibility is that there is no delay, and that what we observe is simply due to gas rising in the firn before it closes off. This has been proposed, here, as at least a partial explanation. But this doesn’t explain the variation in the delay, and certainly does not explain why there is no delay at all for ice less than 5000 years old.
A third explanation might be that the delay is due to the thermohaline oceanic circulation. When the ice age is at maximum, the circulation slows and large temperature fluctuations (see Dansgaard–Oeschger events below) during the ice age get embedded in the circulation, reappearing as large CO2/temperature differences when sea water returns to the surface after one cycle. When it warms up, the circulation speeds up again. When it gets as warm as it is now, the constant ocean surface temperatures completely hide the delay as the temperature differences are lower, and short term temperature versus CO2 solubility in the surface ocean dominates.
A fourth explanation might be that the delay is related to Dansgaard–Oeschger (D-O) events. These occur at multiples of 1470 years, and a few missing ones in the record would account for the average delay measuring 2200 years with a rather broad peak. The third and fourth explanations might be combined. The equivalent Bond events in the Holocene are of a much lower magnitude, and may not appear in the last 5000 year record.
During the ice ages the atmosphere was much drier than during interglacials. We know this because we know that deserts and grasslands were much larger and rain forests smaller. There is much less evaporation over ice than over open water. The greenhouse effect would be lower due to both CO2 and water vapor reductions. During the Holocene, CO2 increased along with water vapor. The temperature response to both is logarithmic, the same added CO2 and H2O has less and less effect. However, the larger variable is H2O. It can vary from nearly zero over deserts to saturation over tropical seas. Of these two gases, water vapor in all forms is the control on temperature, not CO2. This is why we see temperature driving CO2, and not the other way around.
Nowhere here do we see any indication that CO2 is driving temperature.

"Smog has become an unfortunate feature of Chinese city skylines. Air pollution has gotten so bad in recent years that citizens have rallied and the government has declared a war upon it. One weapon in their arsenal is to plant an army of trees that will help neutralise pollution particles in the air. Beijing, the seat of the government, is on China’s industrial east coast and has been affected as much as the next city by polluted air. Faced with the challenge, the local Beijing government initiated a program in 2012 that will invest a total of 30 billion RMB (US$4.7 billion) to construct 67,000 hectares of trees around Beijing in the next few years. That’s the equivalent of two hundred Central Parks, spread across the city. Adopting this unconventional control measure on such a large scale is a bold move for the local government in Beijing. But, studies have shown that trees can reduce smog particles in the air both directly and indirectly. To directly reduce them, tree canopies can intercept particles already existing in the air. Indirectly, trees can lower air temperatures through providing shade and evapotranspiration (when water is taken up into the atmosphere off and through vegetation).  The cooling effect this has reduces the need for energy-using fans and air conditioners, which further lowers emissions. Also, the rates of photochemical reactions in the urban atmosphere are slowed down by the lowered air temperature and less secondary air pollutants are produced. The species of trees to use and where to plant more than 100 million of them can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of this control measure in Beijing. Trees can actually become a source of air pollution too. Some tree species are high emitters of biogenic volatile organic compounds. These react with nitrous oxides and other chemicals in the air to form ozone and secondary organic aerosols, which are tiny “tar balls” found to have bad health effects. Ozone is the main component of urban smog and secondary organic aerosols are also a source.  It has even been suggested that more vegetation in urban environments could reduce the dispersion of smog particles from urban areas. Urban forests can potentially decrease the strength of convective mixing – where air pollutants are lofted up and away from the surface, taking them out of contact with people. The “urban boundary layer” of the urban atmosphere is also lowered, trapping heat and pollutants closer to the the earth’s surface. So it’s important that the right trees are planted. Supported by the National Geographic Air and Water Conservation Fund, my group is currently studying just how effective urban forests could be in Beijing. The initial results from our study are mixed. Trees planted in the last two years can reduce pollution particles from Beijing’s air, but the magnitude of removal is far lower than the government would hope. Six tree species that have been used extensively in planting across the city are high emitters of the potentially problematic biogenic volatile organic compounds, which could add to problems down the line. Currently we are still in the process of modelling what the long-term effects will be once all the trees have been planted and matured. This means it’s too early to say what the final impacts of trees are on smog particles in Beijing.  But, based on a study of ten US cities, urban trees did remove smog particles and improve the air quality of those cities by 0.05%-0.24%. Based on this, the improvement would be higher in Beijing due to the higher concentration of smog particles, though the reduction is unlikely to be as significant as hoped for by the government. So, what is the message for other cities? Making cities greener by planting urban forests should not be treated as a stand-alone air pollution control measure. In fact, measures that are more effective but also more painful to implement should be giving the priority, such as reducing the use of cars.  Urban forests can play an important role in making cities nicer places to live and they do have cooling, pollution-reducing effects. But, it’s important to remember that it is our growing use of cars and industrial emissions that are the source of the smog; sadly no amount of trees can counteract this."
"**People in Scotland will start to receive a Covid-19 vaccine from next week, Nicola Sturgeon has said.**
The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as being safe for use.
The first minister said it was expected the first jabs could be administered in Scotland on Tuesday 8 December.
She said this was ""without a shadow of a doubt the best news we have heard since the pandemic started"".
Ms Sturgeon warned that ""we are not at the end of this pandemic yet"" and added that the vaccination programme would be a massive logistical exercise.
But she added: ""Today does feel like it may well be the beginning of the end of this horrible experience"".
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said the vaccine - which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness - is safe to roll out, and immunisations for people in priority groups could start within days.
The UK government has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each.
About 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK next week, with a share being made available for Scotland.
Ms Sturgeon said this was ""fantastic news"", and that there was a ""high probability"" that people could start receiving the first of two required doses in the next week.
She said: ""If we receive the first doses as soon as we are expecting to, I can confirm the first vaccines will be administered on Tuesday, 8 December. That is just six days from now.""
Ms Sturgeon said rolling out the vaccine across the country would be a ""massive operation"", and said people ""must not ease up in our effort to control"" the virus in the meantime.
She added: ""For all the difficulties that lie ahead, this should give us real hope that the end of this pandemic is in sight.""
Ms Sturgeon said she would be getting vaccinated as soon as she could - and would be prepared to get the jab live on TV if it encouraged others to get it.
The vaccination will not be mandatory and the first minister stressed that the government was ""not planning sanctions"" for those who decide not to get it.
But she added: ""We will put everything we've got behind persuading everybody to get this vaccine as soon as they become eligible.""
The UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, said British Army planners have already been working with the Scottish government and a number of health boards to provide strategic planning expertise to help ensure people in Scotland get the vaccine as quickly as possible.
It is thought that big venues such as the Edinburgh International Conference Centre are being lined up as the type of venue that will be transformed into vaccine distribution ""hubs"" once the second phase is rolled out for the wider population.
The vaccine doses will be rolled out as quickly as the company in Belgium can make it, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December.
But the bulk of the rollout will be next year, he added, while predicting: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better.
""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.""
Scottish Labour MSP Iain Gray welcomed the vaccine announcement as ""the day we have all been waiting for"".
But he said the Scottish government's recent track record on logistics has ""not been so good"", citing problems with delivery of PPE and expanding the testing programme.
Mr Gray said it was important that lessons were learned from that, and said it needed to be ""all hands to the pump to make this work"".
Everyone in Scotland over the age of 18 will be offered a vaccination - that's 4.4m people.
The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has drawn up advice on how people should be prioritised.
It has said that the priorities for the first wave of vaccine distribution, from December to February, are:
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials.
The vaccine must be stored at around -70C and will be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge.
The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people.
The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said despite the speed of approval, no corners have been cut.
Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.
Another vaccine from Moderna uses the same mRNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and offers similar protection. The UK has pre-ordered seven million doses that could be ready by the spring.
The UK has ordered 100 million doses of a different type of Covid vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca. That vaccine uses a harmless virus, altered to look a lot more like the virus that causes Covid-19.
Russia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics. Both work in a similar way to the Oxford vaccine. There are some other promising vaccines that could also be approved soon.

"WASHINGTON  —   Some of the current members of the Supreme Court had written books before they were nominated. Remember “Civil Procedure in Sweden,” by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Or “Regulation and Its Reform,” by Justice Stephen G. Breyer? Perhaps not. But a book by Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s pick for the Supreme Court, may make a more lasting impression. It is called “The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,” and it opens a window into Judge Gorsuch’s thinking not only on those topics, which are interesting enough, but also on the relationship between them and abortion. The book, published in 2006, is ambitious, learned, balanced and unusually lucid, at ease in philosophy, law and empirical research. It discusses the Supreme Court’s abortion jurisprudence in detail, but Judge Gorsuch’s goal was not to critique those cases. He asked, rather, whether a constitutional right to abortion necessarily implies a right to assisted suicide and euthanasia. Sure, there are general statements about the value of human life, drawn from what Judge Gorsuch called “secular moral theory. ” “Human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable,” he wrote, adding that “the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong. ” This led him to support existing laws barring assisted suicide and euthanasia. But that broad statement does not answer the question of whether a fetus is a human life in the sense that Judge Gorsuch meant, or where he stands on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. Asked about the book at his 2006 confirmation hearing, after President George W. Bush nominated him to the federal appeals court in Denver, Judge Gorsuch first said that his personal views did not affect his judicial work. “My writings, just to clarify, have been largely in defense of existing law, that is, they are consistent with the Supreme Court’s decisions in this area and existing law in most places,” he added. “So, I do not think there is actually much tension between my writings and anything that might come before the court. ” That is about right. In the book, Judge Gorsuch argued that bans on assisted suicide and euthanasia should be retained, based partly on his understanding of the limits of the constitutional logic of the Supreme Court’s abortion decisions. His account of Roe v. Wade, for instance, is straightforward. “Under Roe’s express holding,” Judge Gorsuch wrote, “a fetus does not qualify as a person. ” In a footnote, he described a contrary view from a 1986 dissent. Notably, it came from a mentor, Justice Byron R. White, for whom Judge Gorsuch worked as a law clerk in 1993 and 1994. “The right to terminate a pregnancy differs from the right to use contraceptives because the former involves the death of a person while the latter does not,” Judge Gorsuch wrote, describing his old boss’s views. The important point for Judge Gorsuch was that the debate over assisted suicide was different from the one over abortion, as there was no doubt that there was a person involved when suicide was at issue. The task there, he said, was balancing “the interests of those persons who wish to control the timing of their deaths and those vulnerable individuals whose lives may be taken without their consent due to mistake, abuse or pressure in a regime where assisted suicide is legal. ” Judge Gorsuch also worked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy during his clerkship for Justice White, who had by then retired. As it happened, Judge Gorsuch arrived at the Supreme Court soon after another major abortion decision, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, issued in 1992. In a carefully hedged statement that avoided reliance on firsthand knowledge, though he doubtless had some, Judge Gorsuch described the atmosphere at the court in the wake of the Casey decision. “Rumors persist,” Judge Gorsuch wrote, “of considerable acrimony among court members during deliberations in Casey, arising perhaps in part because Justice Kennedy reportedly switched his vote after the court’s conference on the case, thereby altering the outcome in the case. ” The Casey decision is generally said to have reaffirmed Roe’s core holding. In the book, Judge Gorsuch argued that the decision should be read narrowly, in an apparent attempt to limit its implications for a right to assisted suicide or euthanasia. He acknowledged that the controlling opinion in Casey  —   from Justices Kennedy, Sandra Day O’Connor and David H. Souter  —   contained sweeping language, and he quoted what he called its “mystery of life” passage, which is generally attributed to Justice Kennedy. “At the heart of liberty is the right to define one’s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life,” the joint opinion said. But the opinion also relied on a second and narrower ground, saying that respect for precedent  —   stare decisis, in legal Latin  —   required the court to follow Roe. Judge Gorsuch argued that the flowery stuff was an aside. “Usually, though not always, only the narrowest rationale is said to control future courts,” he wrote. “Casey may come to be dominantly read as a stare decisis decision  —   a ruling, in essence, that we must respect the abortion right out of traditional deference to settled law  —   rather than creating any new,   right to ‘define one’s concept of existence,’” Judge Gorsuch wrote. At bottom, then, Judge Gorsuch saw no necessary constitutional connection between a right to abortion and one to assisted suicide or euthanasia. But Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year and whom Judge Gorsuch hopes to replace, said the questions were related, if only because the Constitution was silent about all of them. “We have now determined,” Justice Scalia said in a 2004 speech, “that liberties exist under the federal Constitution  —   the right to abortion, the right to homosexual sodomy  —   which were so little rooted in the traditions of the American people that they were criminal for 200 years. ” He added that his colleagues might be prepared to discover a right to assisted suicide in the Constitution. “We’re not ready to announce that right,” he said, sarcastically. “Check back with us. ”"
"**The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has been approved for widespread use in the UK.**
British regulator, the MHRA, says the jab is safe to start being used from next week.
The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus.
It is a new type of jab called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack.
The genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells.
The exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective.
The vaccine is given in two doses - three weeks apart - and offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19.
This is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans.
The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases.
The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use.
In the UK, older care home residents and their carers are top of the priority list in the first phase of the vaccination programme. They are followed by frontline health and social care workers and the over-80s.
Out of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list.
The first jabs may take place within days now approval has been given.
There will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population.
The vaccine will be delivered through care homes, GPs and pharmacists as well as ""go-to"" vaccination centres set up in venues like sports halls.
However, there are logistical challenges to overcome:
It is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting.
If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu.
The vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggests it works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities.
Some people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine.
Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks.
The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported.
If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent.
However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised.
Hopefully yes, but not for some time.
If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures.
However, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time.
So testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet.
The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property.
They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further.
The announcement gave us the headline, but there is a still lack of fine detail.
We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups.
These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used.
It is good news - it shows that a coronavirus vaccine is possible,.
About a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages and those produced by Oxford University/AstraZeneca and Moderna have also proved successful in trials. The UK has ordered supplies of both."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new study by researchers in England claim that people who eat lots of meat emit much more CO2 than vegans. Worse: the nutty scientists are urging governments to change dietary guidelines.
At the journal of Climatic Change, Peter Scarborough et al claim that “reducing the intake of meat and other animal based products can make a valuable contribution to climate change mitigation.”
Moreover they urge: “National governments that are considering an update of dietary recommendations in order to define a ‘healthy, sustainable diet’ must incorporate the recommendation to lower the consumption of animal-based products.”
The team of scientists computed the average daily CO2 emissions for 6 different diet groups. Here are their results:
1. high meat eaters: 7.19 kg/day
2. Medium meat-eaters: 5.63 kg/day
3. low meat-eaters: 4.67 kg/day
4. fish-eaters: 3.91 kg/day
5. vegetarians: 3.81 kg/day
6. vegans: 2.89 kg/day
The paper’s abstract follows:

The production of animal-based foods is associated with higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than plant-based foods. The objective of this study was to estimate the difference in dietary GHG emissions between self-selected meat-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans in the UK. Subjects were participants in the EPIC-Oxford cohort study. The diets of 2,041 vegans, 15,751 vegetarians, 8,123 fish-eaters and 29,589 meat-eaters aged 20–79 were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Comparable GHG emissions parameters were developed for the underlying food codes using a dataset of GHG emissions for 94 food commodities in the UK, with a weighting for the global warming potential of each component gas. The average GHG emissions associated with a standard 2,000 kcal diet were estimated for all subjects. ANOVA was used to estimate average dietary GHG emissions by diet group adjusted for sex and age. The age-and-sex-adjusted mean (95 % confidence interval) GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents per day (kgCO2e/day) were 7.19 (7.16, 7.22) for high meat-eaters ( > = 100 g/d), 5.63 (5.61, 5.65) for medium meat-eaters (50-99 g/d), 4.67 (4.65, 4.70) for low meat-eaters ( < 50 g/d), 3.91 (3.88, 3.94) for, 3.81 (3.79, 3.83) for vegetarians and 2.89 (2.83, 2.94) for vegans.
In conclusion, dietary GHG emissions in self-selected meat-eaters are approximately twice as high as those in vegans. It is likely that reductions in meat consumption would lead to reductions in dietary GHG emissions.”

The science road to disaster
It’s rather frightening that scientists are now attempting to urge governments to promote extremely dubious if not dangerous diets onto the population, all based on the junk science of global warming. Should scientists narrowly focused on one topic be in the business of advising governments on matters concerning nutrition.
The low-fat/high carb diet massively promoted by western governments and corrupt food and pharmaceutical industries over the course of the 21st century, and based on junk science, has already led to a nutrition genocide where tens of millions of people are now dying slow/painful deaths from cardiovascular disease, cancer, record obesity and diabetes. Now a worsening of the human diet is being pushed.
Governments are gearing up to take an already catastrophic nutritional situation and to turn it into global mass murder by mal-nutrition and starvation. It’s mass human sacrifice, all being justified by the superstition and nonsense of a man-made climate catastrophe – in the year 2100 or 2200.
Skeptical climate scientists who have remained silent so far better start speaking up very soon. This movement has been taken over by some real nut-cases, and threatens to really get out of hand.

 _Global Science Report_ is a feature from the _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
We know this: Every holiday season some of our readers make some offhanded comment at a party, to the effect that, well, global warming (or its effects) appear to have been a bit overblown. Before you finish, you’re likely to be assaulted by a sharp ranch dressing-laden carrot stick or you might get a face full of dill-dipped broccoli.   
  
Fight back! Before things escalate to the level of food assaults, trot out some of the facts in this, our annual guide for holiday parties.   
  
First of all, the tendency for prominent findings about the impacts from human-caused global warming to be “worse than we thought” is not only a pure play for press coverage, but also strains, if not obliterates, scientific credibility.   
  
The unscientific preponderance of “worse than we thought” stories is starting to become more widely recognized (although we have been talking about it for years). And it is having consequences. Fresh from accepting his Nobel Prize for physiology/medicine, University of California’s Randy Schekman announced that his lab would no longer be sending any research papers to “luxury journals” like _Science_ and _Nature_ because of their preference to select papers “that will make waves because they explore sexy subjects.” Schekman explains that “These journals aggressively curate their brands, in ways more conducive to selling subscriptions than to stimulating the most important research.” Global warming alarmism is a prime example of this.   
  
In fact, there _are_ scientific studies that conclude that things aren’t likely to be worse than we thought, but looking to the “luxury journals” or to the press to highlight them is a fool’s errand.   
  
But that’s where we can help!   
  
In the spirit of this season of good cheer, and as a respite for the increasing number of those out there suffering from “apocalypse fatigue,” your obedient servants at the Center for the Study of Science are here to bring you a little holiday joy and good news.   
  
Below, we’ve collected some clips and quips culled from the recently published scientific literature (and observations) that show that perhaps the impacts from climate change resulting from our production of energy from fossil fuels isn’t going to worse than we thought—and, in fact, may not prove to be so bad at all.   




**Coral Reefs**   
  
Coral reefs are supposed to suffer badly under a process called “ocean acidification” in which the pH levels of the oceans drop as more carbon dioxide (a result of burning fossil fuels) is absorbed by ocean waters. The resulting pH drop is supposed to erode the shells of calcifying organisms such as those that build coral reefs. A recent study summed up the doom and gloom outlook:   




Coral communities may have limited capacity to adapt to levels of acidification projected for the 21st century, and that healthy coral reefs could cease to exist within this time frame. [citations omitted]



Yikes!   
  
But new research by Kathryn Shamberger and colleagues describes the existence of coral reefs in locations that, for a variety of reasons, have naturally occurring acidification levels on par with those projected to result from human carbon dioxide emissions. The authors write:   




Here, we report the existence of healthy, diverse coral reef communities living under levels of natural acidification approaching those projected for the tropical western Pacific open ocean by 2100. Understanding the combinations of genetic and/or environmental factors that enable coral reefs to thrive under relatively extreme conditions … will help to improve projections of reef health.



Apparently, in the real world, coral reef communities can well-adapt to the prevailing conditions.   
  
**Arctic Sea Ice**   
  
A new paper characterizes the situation with Arctic sea ice:   




The observed reduction in sea-ice extent has been significantly faster than projected by most numerical models using realistic anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. The mismatch between observations and models can arise from: model underestimation of the sensitivity of sea ice to radiatively forced climate change, incorrect or missing types of radiative forcing, and/or nonmodelled natural variability. [citations omitted]



The first two potential reasons why the observed Arctic sea ice decline (note that in the Antarctic, sea ice has increased contrary to model projections) has been faster than model projections imply things are “worse than we thought.” But this new research favors the latter explanation—that is, the decline from global warming has been boosted (temporarily) by natural variability acting in the same direction. From a paper by Martin Miles and colleagues:   




These results imply that the AMO [natural variability operating over the Atlantic Ocean basin] may be an important factor in the faster-than-projected decreases in sea ice, in qualitative agreement with a recent modelling–satellite-data analysis [ _Day et al._ , 2012] that attributes up to 5–30% to the satellite-era (1979–2010) summer sea-ice decrease to the concurrent AMO warm phase, and an even higher proportion for the winter sea ice.



In other words, the influence from human-caused global warming is not “worse than we thought.”   
  
**Great Lakes Water Levels**   
  
Another doom and gloom climate change projection is that the water levels in the Great Lakes will fall dramatically, interfering with (degrading) all sorts of environmental and economic activities. Last year’s Midwestern drought was a sign to some that things were even worse than we thought.   
  
A new paper by Carl Watras and colleagues sums up the situation:   




During the past decade, unusually low water levels have been observed in both the NHLD [Northern Highland Lake District of Wisconsin] and the upper Great Lakes. Following a peak in 1998, NHLD water levels have trended downward for roughly 12 years—reaching a record low elevation in 2010. Similarly, the water level of Lake Michigan-Huron recently dropped at a rate not seen since the 1930s mega-drought. Both Lake Superior and Lake Michigan-Huron have been consistently below average level for the longest sustained period in their historical records; and in January 2013 Lake Michigan-Huron reached an all-time low water level. [citations omitted]



Watras et al. go on to conclude that the low water levels of the past 12 years may “mark the onset of a new hydroclimatic regime.”   
  
But, in what is an incidence of unfortunate timing, just as the Watras paper was being published, Mother Nature has made her own announcement. After reaching historic (or nearly so) low lake levels during the beginning of 2013, over the course of this year, and as a result of ample precipitation, the water levels in the Great Lakes have risen rapidly. The _Detroit Free Press_ observes:   




A snowy winter and wet spring and summer led to an almost unprecedented recovery of Great Lakes levels this year, officials with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association said Wednesday.



The extended lake level forecasts keep the water levels near or just-below normal for the foreseeable future.   
  
Perhaps a new climate regime of low Great Lakes water levels is not upon us. In fact, the situation doesn’t look to be worse than we expected after all.   
  
**Gulf Stream**   
  
Global warming has been variously predicted to slow down, or even shut down, the Gulf Stream, wreaking havoc on the climate on both sides of the North Atlantic and leading to sea level rise along the U.S. East Coast that may even be worse than expected from warming oceans and melting ice.   
  
Last summer, an article in _USA Today_ stoked these fears with its coverage of a just-published article in the one of the “luxury journal” offshoots— _Nature Climate Change_ :   




From Cape Hatteras, N.C., to just north of Boston, sea levels are rising much faster than they are around the globe, putting one of the world's most costly coasts in danger of flooding, government researchers report.   
  
U.S. Geological Survey scientists call the 600-mile swath a ""hot spot"" for climbing sea levels caused by global warming. Along the region, the Atlantic Ocean is rising at an annual rate three times to four times faster than the global average since 1990, according to the study published Sunday in the journal _Nature Climate Change_.   
  
It's not just a faster rate, but at a faster pace, like a car on a highway ""jamming on the accelerator,"" said the study's lead author, Asbury Sallenger Jr., an oceanographer at the agency.



Now, a newly-published study says “nonsense” to this claim. Tom Rossby and colleagues looked at 20 years of direct measurements of Gulf Stream behavior and found no evidence at all that it is slowing down or effecting sea level rise along the East Coast. Rossby et al. took direct aim at the findings highlighted by _USA Today_ :   




Recently, two papers have suggested that the [Gulf Stream] may be weakening based on the well-documented accelerated Sea Level Rise (SLR) along the U.S. east coast (Sallenger et al., 2012; Ezer et al., 2013). …In contrast to these recent assertions of a weakening Gulf Stream our direct measurements of Gulf Stream currents for the past 20 years indicate no such trend...”



Not only is the situation not “worse than we thought,” but it is leaning toward being even “not as bad as we thought.”   
  
**North American Pika**   
  
And we’ll end with something warm and fuzzy—the North American pika. This little critter has long appeared on global-warming-is-going-to-kill-all-things-cute-and-cuddly posters, alongside polar bears, puffins, sea turtles, etc. The story goes that as the climate warms, the high-altitude, cold weather-loving pikas will be pushed off their mountain-top refuges and into extinction.   
  
New research, however, shows that the pikas aren’t quite so prone to climate change extermination after all. According to the authors of a soon-to-be-published paper in the _Journal of Mammalogy_ , by altering their foraging behavior and diet,   




""[Pikas] may be more resistant to climate change than we thought.""



Call us stunned—not!   
  
So there you have it, a stocking’s full of good news regarding climate change.   
  
All of this could come in handy during holiday cocktail parties and post-dinner conversations—FIGHT CARROT STICKS WITH FACTS!!!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe days of an open welcome to “environmentally-friendly” wind parks in Germany are over.
When the turbines were small-scale and novel, people were generally open to them. But now that they have reached skyscraper dimensions, have proven to be unsightly, and have demonstrated poor performance, they are not welcome anymore.

German developers plan to install 60 wind turbines, each 700-foot tall, in one of Central Europe’s last remaining untouched regions, the Palantinate Forest, a UN designated natural monument. Photo beauty-places.com/palatinate-forest
Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the picturesque southwest German region of Palatinate, where the online Die Welt here reports on the mounting fierce opposition that wind turbine developers are facing. The developers have their sights aimed at the hilltops of Germany’s fairy-tale-like Palatinate forest…an area that has been designated by UNESCO as a natural treasure and biosphere reserve. Here they hope to install wind parks with skyscraper-dimensioned turbines. Die Welt writes of the area:
It was the first cross-border natural reservation of this type in all of Europe because it also includes the Alsatian mountain range. Not very many Germans know that it is the largest uninterrupted landscape in Central Europe. Whoever wishes to see it, had better hurry up.”
850,000 sq m of virgin forest to be cleared
According to Die Welt, hungry wind park developers with deep pockets plan to install 60 wind turbines, each 209 meters (700 feet) tall in the area. Unsurprisingly this looming large-scale green industrialization of this particularly idyllic landscape has become too much to take, even for the most avid climate activist groups. Die Welt writes that for the first time all ten local environmental groups have closed ranks against the project, says Bernd Wallner of the Pfälzerwald-Verein (Palantinate Association). Opponents are rallying, calling it a matter of “homeland defense”.
Die Welt provides the technical details of the monster-size turbines: Each blade is 60 meters long and they will need elaborate roads to allow their transport to the site where they are to be installed. Each turbine will require 3000 tonnes of concrete and 100 tonnes of steel. In total 200,000 tonnes of concrete and 130,000 cubic meters of gravel will have to be hauled in by 60,000 trips by heavy cargo vehicles, which will involve the burning of 600,000 liters of diesel fuel and the clearing of 850,000 square meters of virgin forest.

Like putting turbines on Ayer’s Rock!
Environmentalists are fuming. Opponents accuse the wind turbine developers and the local and state authorities of covering up the environmental costs and impacts of the project and misleading the public. Critics say the senselessness of the project is tantamount to putting wind turbines on Ayers Rock.
Unrealistic profit projections used to “bait the public”
Opponents also accuse the wind park developers of putting out overly optimistic figures for expected wind turbine performance in order to bait the public. Die Welt writes:
Ernst Gerber believes the promises of profitability, with which investors and local representatives are being baited, are estimates from a naïve milkmaid: ‘Despite the subsidies, things are moving towards the lower limits of profitability.'”
Die Welt itself characterizes the promise of profitability made by the wind park developers as “rotten”, and that the region is one that is “low in wind”.
Threat to wildlife…violates the law
The wind park opponents also say that the monster turbines are a threat to wildlife and birds. What’s more, turbine critic Rainer Becker thinks they would violate the law, “The construction of the wind parks are clearly in violation of the existing laws and the international species protection act“.
Other opponents claim that big business and power companies in Luxemburg are ramming the projects through and ignoring the wishes of the local inhabitants, Die Welt writes.

"**Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are two of only three areas in England which will be in tier one from next Wednesday.**
MPs and businesses have welcomed the news and spoken of ""relief"" at ""the end of a difficult year"".
The Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are the only areas in tier one.
One Cornwall MP warned against the grading being ""grounds for complacency"".
Amy Newland, from the White Hart pub in Chilsworthy, said: ""I'm extremely relieved, at least we know that we can trade normally.""
She added that she felt sorry for pubs in neighbouring Devon which will be under tougher tier two restrictions.
""It's mixed emotions but a huge relief for us,"" she said.
Paul Eaton, who runs the Royal Inn at Horsebridge, near Tavistock, just inside the Devon border, said: ""Some of my regulars are already planning where they can go in Cornwall.
""It's a long border, with pubs scattered both sides.""
Kim Conchie, chief executive of Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, said it had been ""a difficult year"" but this marked ""the first stage of securing jobs and companies for our future"".
Holiday homes letting agent Lin Wallis in Cornwall tweeted she had five inquiries in 10 minutes after the announcement.
In the seven days to last Saturday the rate of infections in Cornwall was 59 per 100,000 people, the England average was 169.
In the same period there were 337 new cases, down by 176 on the previous week.
Steve Double, Conservative MP for St Austell and Newquay, said Cornwall returning to tier one restrictions was ""particularly good news for the thousands of hospitality businesses"".
He added: ""However whilst we can welcome this news it should be no grounds for complacency.""
Tier one means people can meet indoors and out up to a maximum group of six, pubs and restaurants can re-open, closing at 23:00 GMT but people will still be encouraged to work from home.
Differences between the new tiers include restrictions on where households can meet up:
The system will be regularly reviewed and an area's tier level may change before Christmas - the first review is scheduled for 16 December."
"**The wearing of face masks in Jersey shops will be legally required from Tuesday at 10:00 GMT.**
Anyone older than 12 years old going into an indoor workplace as a customer must wear one, unless exempt for medical or disability reasons, the Government of Jersey said.
Failure to wear a mask could lead to a fine of up to Â£1,000.
The States Assembly voted to give ministers the power to introduce laws mandating masks on 24 November.
Mask-use will be compulsory in indoor public spaces which cannot guarantee physical distancing or other public health measures, including:
Mask exemption cards will be available for people whose health conditions mean they cannot wear them safely.
Application forms will be available online and in public locations, including parish halls, larger supermarkets and the bus station.
The law also includes a provision requiring passengers and drivers in taxis to wear masks, except where their use might impede safe driving.
This is also advised for car journeys involving people from different households, but is not required.
Masks remain strongly advised when close contact between people who do not live together is likely, particularly if it is likely to be for longer than 15 minutes, the government said.
Health minister Richard Renouf argued the law was needed to combat rising winter case numbers and the ""mixed success"" of the government's ""strong recommendation"" for indoor mask use.
He said: ""We are doing all we can to protect islanders and our health care system, while also keeping the island functioning as far as possible.""
Ministers have also been given the power to impose restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people but ministers have not yet enacted this - current guidance suggests a limit of 10 for indoor gatherings.
An order to limit gatherings in the island in some capacity will be ""signed as soon as it is ready"", the government said."

On May 17th, Willis Eschenbach posted “Sailing on the Solar Wind” on WUWT. In it he used a graph of the daily solar wind data since 1963. I wish to thank Willis for his effort in tabulating the daily data AND for making it available for the rest of us.
That graph had some shapes that were hauntingly familiar. Here it is, repeated, but with the vertical axis reversed. Less solar wind is warming, more is cooling.

Figure 1 is a plot of the daily solar wind data since 1963, courtesy of Willis Eschenbach, here.
I saw two large white-space notches in this plot, one at 1996-7, and another at 2008-9, where the solar wind decreased for long periods. These are just before the two recent El Niños of 1998 and 2010. I downloaded Willis’s data and converted it to monthly averages so that it could be compared to the various available temperature data. Here (Figure 2) is that data with a three-month centered average applied to both the solar wind data and the Hadley Center HADSST3 sea-surface temperature.

Figure 2 is a plot of the solar wind (inverted) and sea surface temperature since 1963.

Note the similarity. The solar wind acts similarly to the cosmic ray impact described in Cosmic Rays and the Impact On Climate. A decrease in solar wind occurs just prior to an increase in temperature. This probably happens because the solar wind acts in a similar fashion as CME’s in producing Forbush decreases in Neutron flux. Both produce an increase in cosmic ray production of cloud nuclei. But why the delay? Several temperature data bases were investigated and compared, using one-month delay steps and computing the R-squared value in Excel for each comparison. Figure 3 resulted:

Figure 3 is a plot of the response to a solar wind change (reduction) on various temperature databases. All temperature data were obtained from www.woodfortrees.org. and de-trended.
Two questions are suggested by this data. Where is the initial temperature change taking place? And why is there a delay? The answers seem to be: 1) The initial warming is in the tropics, specifically in the central Pacific in the El Niño region. In that area, there is no delay, the warming occurs immediately and for the following 3 or 4 months. (The green trace.) The other sea surface temperature data base, HADSST3, and its 3-month average, also reflect the initial immediate warming, but also have a peak at 8 months after, probably for those areas away from the tropics that are warmed later, either by moving currents, or by moving atmosphere.
The land data, HADCRUT4, shows a peak at 8 months and again at 11 months. The reason becomes a little clearer when the hemispheric components are examined. The southern hemisphere reacts quickly then drops off after 8 months, probably because the oceans react faster than the land. The northern hemisphere reacts at 8 months and 11 months because the northern hemisphere has greater land mass.
I recognize that this relationship is speculative. But the relationships seen in Figure 3 are consistent and devoid of “noise”. Delays outside of the range shown have consistently very low R-squared values. It is suggested that this research area bears further study.

Over the years, I’ve shared some outrageous examples of overpaid bureaucrats. 



Hopefully we’re all disgusted when insiders rig the system to rip off taxpayers. And I suspect you’re not surprised to see that the worst example on that list comes from California, which is in a race with Illinois to see which state can become the Greece of America.   
  
  
Well, the Golden State has a new über‐​bureaucrat. Here are some of the jaw‐​dropping details from a Bloomberg report. 



The numbers are even larger in California, where a state psychiatrist was paid $822,000, a highway patrol officer collected $484,000 in pay and pension benefits and 17 employees got checks of more than $200,000 for unused vacation and leave. The best‐​paid staff in other states earned far less for the same work, according to the data.



Wow, $822,000 for a state psychiatrist. Not bad for government work. So what is Governor Jerry Brown doing to fix the mess? As you might expect, he’s part of the problem. 



…the state’s highest‐​paid employees make far more than comparable workers elsewhere in almost all job and wage categories, from public safety to health care, base pay to overtime. …California has set a pattern of lax management, inefficient operations and out‐​of‐​control costs. …In California, Governor Jerry Brown hasn’t curbed overtime expenses that lead the 12 largest states or limited payments for accumulated vacation time that allowed one employee to collect $609,000 at retirement in 2011. …Last year, Brown waived a cap on accrued leave for prison guards while granting them additional paid days off. California’s liability for the unused leave of its state workers has more than doubled in eight years, to $3.9 billion in 2011, from $1.4 billion in 2003, according to the state’s annual financial reports. …The per‐​worker costs of delivering services in California vastly exceed those even in New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Ohio.





Actually, it’s not just that he’s part of the problem. He’s making things worse, having seduced voters into approving a ballot measure to dramatically increase the tax burden on the upper‐​income taxpayers.   
  
  
I suppose the silver lining to that dark cloud is that many bureaucrats now rank as part of the top 1 percent, so they’ll have to recycle some of their loot back to the political vultures in Sacramento.   
  
  
But the biggest impact of the tax hike—as shown in the Ramirez cartoon—will be to accelerate the shift of entrepreneurs, investors, and small business owners to states that don’t steal as much. Indeed, a study from the Manhattan Institute looks at the exodus to lower‐​tax states. 



The data also reveal the motives that drive individuals and businesses to leave California. One of these, of course, is work. …Taxation also appears to be a factor, especially as it contributes to the business climate and, in turn, jobs. Most of the destination states favored by Californians have lower taxes. States that have gained the most at California’s expense are rated as having better business climates. The data suggest that many cost drivers—taxes, regulations, the high price of housing and commercial real estate, costly electricity, union power, and high labor costs—are prompting businesses to locate outside California, thus helping to drive the exodus.



Yet another example of why tax competition is such an important force for economic liberalization. It punishes governments that are too greedy and gives taxpayers a chance to protect their property from the looter class.

"Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • The U. S. Justice Department urged a federal appeals court to reinstate President Trump’s targeted travel ban, saying immediate action was needed to ensure the nation’s safety. Almost 100 U.

Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for the invitation to testify regarding corporate welfare, entrepreneurs, and economic growth. This testimony will address the problems caused by corporate welfare and discuss why spurring entrepreneurship is a better approach for generating economic growth.



Rising spending and huge deficits are pushing the nation toward an economic crisis. There is general agreement that policymakers need to find wasteful and damaging programs in the federal budget to terminate. One good place to find savings is spending on corporate welfare. 



Some people claim that business subsidies are needed to help fix market failures in the economy. But corporate welfare is just as likely to create failures by misallocating resources and inducing businesses to spend time on lobbying rather than on making better products. Corporate welfare transfers wealth from average families to favored businesses, and it creates corrupting ties between government officials, politicians, and business leaders.



Policymakers are rightly concerned about the competitiveness of American businesses in the global economy. But the way to address that concern is not through subsidies, but through broad‐​based reforms such as permanent reductions to capital gains and corporate income tax rates. 





**The Taxpayer Cost of Corporate Welfare**





A forthcoming Cato Institute study finds that federal business subsidies total almost $100 billion annually.1 That is a fairly broad measure of subsidies to small businesses, large corporations, and industry organizations. The subsidies are handed out from programs in many federal departments including Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development.



However, there is no precise measure of “corporate welfare.” As part of the national income accounts, the Bureau of Economic Analysis calculates that the federal government handed out $57 billion in business subsidies in 2010.2 A 1995 Congressional Budget Office Study put the total at $30 billion in spending subsidies for businesses at that time.3



Ending business subsidies would be one step toward reducing the federal deficit, but there would be other benefits as well. The following sections discuss the unfairness of corporate welfare, how it harms the economy and generates corruption, and why entrepreneur‐​led growth is a better alternative.





**Corporate Welfare Is Unfair**





The Constitution empowers the federal government to take steps to ensure an open national economy. The Commerce Clause gives the government the authority to “regulate Commerce… among the several States,” but the purpose was to remove barriers to trade, not to actively favor some businesses over other businesses and individuals.



People disagree on the meaning of “fairness,” but surely it includes supporting the bedrock American value of equality under the law. The government’s proper role should be that of a neutral referee in the economy facilitating the free exchange of goods and services. Yet corporate welfare advantages certain businesses at the expense of taxpayers, families, and other businesses, as some examples illustrate:



 ** _Farm Subsidies._** Farm subsidies redistribute wealth from taxpayers to often well‐​off farm businesses and landowners. “Farm income stabilization” payments have recently fluctuated between about $13 billion and $33 billion annually. 4 This is a welfare hand‐​out like food stamps, yet it goes to higher‐​income households. In 2010, the average income of farm households was $84,400, or 25 percent above the $67,530 average of all U.S. households.5 Moreover, the great bulk of farm subsidies go to the largest farms.6



 ** _Sugar Subsidies_**. The federal government also enriches certain businesses in an off‐​budget manner, as sugar subsidies illustrate. The government runs a Soviet‐​style system of price supports, quotas, and import barriers for sugar. The effect is to push up the domestic price of sugar to the benefit of U.S. sugar producers while imposing extra costs on consumers.7 Artificially high sugar prices also hurt American businesses that use sugar, and numerous U.S. food companies have moved production to Canada and Mexico where sugar prices are lower.8



 ** _Economic Development._** The government runs many so‐​called economic development programs that distribute corporate welfare. As one small example, the Community Development Block Grant program recently handed out $220,000 to a craft brewery in Michigan.9 Meanwhile the Value Added Marketing program hands out money to selected wineries across the country.10 These hand‐​outs are not fair to taxpayers or the breweries, wineries, and other businesses that don’t receive such special favors.



Polls show that the public understands the unfairness of corporate welfare, and most people want it cut. Most people are against the federal government providing loan guarantees to small businesses; only 29 percent think that the government should help large corporations finance their export sales; and a plurality (46 percent) think farm subsidies should be abolished.11 Polls have also found strong opposition to federal bailouts of financial institutions.12





**Corporate Welfare Distorts the Economy**





Some policymakers think that subsidies are needed to help U.S. businesses compete in the world economy. But the more we subsidize businesses, the more we weaken the market’s profit‐​and‐​loss signals, and the more we undermine America’s traditions of entrepreneurship and gutsy risk‐​taking by the private sector.



People argue that business subsidies are needed to fix market imperfections. But subsidies usually don’t work as intended, and they often distort markets rather than fixing them. Robert Novak once said that “the mind‐​set underlying corporate welfare is that of the central planner,” and yet we know that central planning does not work.13



Consider the energy industry, which Republicans and Democrats have been manipulating with subsidies for decades. An early subsidy effort was the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, which was an experimental nuclear fission power plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee in the 1970s. This Republican‐​backed boondoggle cost taxpayers $1.7 billion and produced absolutely nothing in return.14



Then we had the Synthetic Fuels Corporation (SFC) approved by President Jimmy Carter in 1980, who called it a “keystone” of U.S. energy policy. The government sank $2 billion of taxpayer money into this scheme that funded coal gasification and other technologies before it was closed down as a failure. The SFC suffered from appalling mismanagement, huge cost overruns on its projects, political cronyism, and pork barrel politics in dishing out funding.15



Both parties have backed dubious “clean coal” projects for decades. The GAO found that many of these projects have “experienced delays, cost overruns, bankruptcies, and performance problems.“16 In a review of federal fossil fuel research, the Congressional Budget Office concluded: “Federal programs have had a long history of funding fossil‐​fuel technologies that, although interesting technically, had little chance of commercial implementation. As a result, much of the federal spending has not been productive.“17



With the poor record of energy subsidies over the decades, it is no surprise that the Obama administration is having trouble with its green energy activities. The administration’s failures keep piling up—Solyndra, Raser Technologies, Ecotality, Nevada Geothermal, Beacon Power, First Solar, Abound Solar, and Beacon Power.18 These subsidy recipients have either gone bankrupt or appear to be headed in that direction.



Why don’t business subsidies work very well? One reason is that political pressures undermine sound economic choices. The _Washington Post_ found that “Obama’s green‐​technology program was infused with politics at every level.“19 The decision to approve the Solyndra loan, for example, appears to have been rushed along by high‐​level politics.



Perhaps more importantly, subsidies change the behavior of businesses. An economist recently quipped to me: “I don’t know whether the government is better at picking winners rather than losers, but I do know that losers are good at picking governments.” When the government starts handing out money, businesses with weak ideas get in line because the businesses with the good ideas can get private funding. Enron, for example, was able to grab huge federal support for its disastrous foreign investment schemes.



At recent House hearings on green energy subsidies, most witnesses lined up in favor of Department of Energy loan programs, except for one witness who heads a solar power firm that does not receive federal subsidies.20 James Nelson of Solar3D said that subsidizing green energy commercialization “is a wasteful mistake because it doesn’t work.“21 Here are some of the problems he pointed to:





The House hearing included testimony from green energy firms that had received subsidies. Their comments revealed how subsidies were eroding their focus on the bottom line. The firms stressed how many jobs they were creating and how their supplier chains covered many states—and thus many congressional districts. One solar firm bragged that it is “creating and maintaining jobs locally and across the nation,” while it is “procur(ing) from a supply chain that stretches across 17 states.“22 Another solar firm bragged that it “spent more than $1 billion with U.S. suppliers in 35 states.“23



Subsidy supporters at the hearing stressed the “nonfinancial objectives” of green subsidies, such as jobs.24 But as Nelson noted, “businesses are not made more successful by more jobs.“25 If businesses want to succeed in tough global competition, they need to minimize their labor and supplier costs, and subsidies erode that lean focus. Nelson concluded that success in the marketplace “requires brains, discipline, and grit. It is rarely aided, and often impeded by government involvement.“26



Another problem with business subsidies is that they can encourage investing in very dubious projects. That is the story of Enron’s international investments, which played an important role in the implosion of the firm. By one estimate, Enron received $2.4 billion in federal aid through the Export‐​Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Company between 1992 and 2000.27 Another study puts total federal government subsidies to Enron for its foreign schemes at $3.7 billion, plus Enron received subsidies from international agencies such as the World Bank.28 All these subsidies made possible Enron’s excessively risky foreign investments, which came crashing down at the same time that the firm’s accounting frauds were being revealed.29



Suppose that the government was capable of channeling subsidies only to well‐​managed companies with sensible ideas. Then the subsidies wouldn’t be needed because they would simply crowd out private investment. That seems to be the case with much of the $7 billion in subsidies for rural broadband in the 2009 stimulus bill, as one detailed study in 2011 found.30



Or consider the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, which provides subsidies to companies to develop green cars. A former executive with Tesla Motors, which received subsidies, concluded that “private fundraising is complicated by investor expectations of government support.“31 Subsidies distort the venture capital market, having “a stifling effect on innovation, as private capital chases fewer deals and companies that do not have government backing have a harder time attracting private capital.“32



A final problem with corporate welfare is that it can create broader distortions in the economy. For more than a century, the federal Bureau of Reclamation has subsidized irrigation in the 17 western states. About four‐​fifths of the water supplied by the bureau goes to farm businesses, and this water is greatly underpriced.33 Because farmers are receiving water at a fraction of the market price, they are over consuming it, which threatens to create water shortages in many areas in the West. Subsidized irrigation also causes environmental damage. 





**Corporate Welfare Generates Corruption**





The creation of corporate welfare programs has spawned an expanding web of lobby groups that demand ever more favors from policymakers. The more that the government intervenes in the economy, the more lobbying activity is generated, and the more new subsidy programs get created. It’s a vicious cycle.



Corporate welfare doesn’t just create direct economic harm, it also erodes support for America’s free enterprise system. Businesses that become hooked on subsidies become tools of the state. They lose their independence, and they may focus more on gaining special benefits from Washington than on making good products. The more special breaks that businesses receive, the less willing they are to speak out against the expansion of big government. 



While some people think that corporations lobby to slash government, they mainly do the opposite. Businesses often lobby in favor of federal intervention if it will benefit them and hurt their competitors. The major airlines, for example, were against airline deregulation in the 1970s because existing rules protected them from competition.34



Business subsidy programs attract corruption like garbage dumps attracts rats, and that has always been the case in Washington. For example, federal subsidies for the first transcontinental railroad, the Union Pacific, led to the Credit Mobilier scandal of the 1870s, which involved payoffs to dozens of members of Congress. In recent decades, scandals stemming from corporate welfare have been a bipartisan problem, as these examples illustrate:



 ** _HUD Subsidies under Reagan._** President Ronald Reagan’s Department of Housing and Urban Development overflowed with corruption in the 1980s under Secretary Sam Pierce.35 Pierce routinely dished out grants, loans, and other sorts of subsidies to friends and business associates. And HUD created programs that involved large subsidies to mortgage lenders, developers, and other businesses, with Republican Party contributors as frequent beneficiaries.



 ** _Commerce Subsidies under Clinton._** President Bill Clinton’s Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, used federal business subsidies as a fund‐​raising tool for the Democratic Party in the 1990s. Corporate executives who played the game were given access to export promotion trips and loans from OPIC.36 In subsequent investigations, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth found that Commerce officials concealed and destroyed documents relating to the scandal, and he compared the officials to “con artists” and “scofflaws.37



 ** _Enron Subsidies under Clinton and Bush._** Enron Corporation is a poster child for the harm of business subsidies, particularly with regard to its disastrous foreign investments. Enron lobbied government officials to expand export subsidy programs, and it received billions of dollars in aid for its foreign projects from the Ex‐​Im Bank, OPIC, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, the U.S. Maritime Administration, the Commerce Department, and the U.S.-backed World Bank. As noted, Enron received about $3.7 billion in financing through federal government agencies.38 These subsidies induced Enron to make exceptionally risky foreign investments, and the resulting losses were an important factor in the company’s implosion.39



During the Clinton and early Bush administrations, high‐​level officials went to great lengths to aid Enron on an Indian power plant deal.40 The _Washington Post_ noted, “President Bush’s National Security Council led a ‘working group’ with officials from various Cabinet agencies to resolve Enron’s troubles over a power plant venture.“41 We saw similar high‐​level involvement in the failed Solyndra investment by the Obama administration. Top government officials should be spending their time on policies in the general interest of all Americans, not on helping individual companies earn higher profits.



 ** _Green Subsidies under Obama._** The _Washington Post_ found, “Obama’s green‐​technology program was infused with politics at every level.“42 The $535 million loan guarantee for Solyndra, is a prime example. The DOE approved the loan after receiving pressure from White House officials to move ahead so that the vice president could announce it at a groundbreaking for the company’s factory.43 President Obama visited Solyndra and called the firm an “engine of economic growth,” but later it collapsed.44



President Obama’s green energy programs illustrate how corporate welfare creates corrupting relationships between businesses and politicians. The _Washington Post_ found that “$3.9 billion in federal [energy] grants and financing flowed to 21 companies backed by firms with connections to five Obama administration staffers and advisers.“45 It also noted that the “main players in the Solyndra saga were interconnected in many ways, as investors enjoyed access to the White House and the Energy Department.“46 According to the _New York Times_ , Solyndra “spent nearly $1.8 million on Washington lobbyists, employing six firms with ties to members of Congress and officials of the Obama White House.“47



American businesses, of course, have a right to lobby the federal government. But given that reality, Congress throws fuel onto the corruption fire by creating business subsidy programs. When subsidy money flows out the door from Washington to businesses at the same time that money flows back from businesses to Washington for lobbying, it’s no surprise that we get influence‐​peddling. Corporate welfare undermines honest and transparent governance, and Americans are sick and tired of the inevitable scandals. 





**Long‐​Term Growth Depends on Entrepreneurs**





Most of America’s technological and industrial advances have come from innovative private businesses in competitive markets. Indeed, it is probably true that most of our long‐​term economic growth has come not from existing large corporations or governments, but from entrepreneurs creating new businesses and pioneering new industries. Such entrepreneurs have often had to overcome barriers put in place by dominant businesses and governments. 



Economic historians Nathan Rosenberg and L.E. Birdzell found that “new enterprises, specializing in new technologies, were instrumental in the introduction of electricity, the internal‐​combustion engine, automobiles, aircraft, electronics, aluminum, petroleum, plastic materials, and many other advances.“48 We can update that list to include cell phones, personal computers, biotechnology, and all kinds of Internet businesses. 



If policymakers want to get U.S. economic growth back on track, they should put entrepreneurs front‐​and‐​center in their thinking about policy. Here are some of the ways that entrepreneurs generate growth:



 ** _Entrepreneurs are Radical Innovators_.** Their advances are usually unexpected and disruptive to existing businesses.49 Personal computers were pioneered in the 1970s by new companies such as Apple. The opportunity was missed both by leading computer firms and by government planning agencies such as Japan’s MITI.50 Big corporations were focused on mini and mainframe computers, while the U.S. government was subsidizing supercomputers. Governments and big companies often overlook niche products that later become revolutionary. In the 1970s, microcomputers were an obscure hobbyist activity, and software for microcomputers—which Bill Gates helped pioneer—was a niche within a niche. The small‐​scale innovations of entrepreneurs in niches often create huge, unforeseen changes. 



**_Entrepreneurs Generate Competition_.** Another crucial role of entrepreneurs is that they challenge dominant firms and governments. One great story is the rise of MCI Corporation in the 1970s and 1980s. MCI helped destroy the AT&T monopoly, which paved the way for the modern telecommunications revolution. Another innovator was Fred Smith of Federal Express. Today we take overnight letter delivery for granted, but it was Smith who battled federal regulatory roadblocks in the 1970s and provided new competition for the U.S. Postal Service by proving that there was an untapped demand for rapid delivery.



 ** _Entrepreneurs Turn Inventions into Innovations_.** America’s long‐​run growth is often portrayed as a steady process of accumulating new _inventions_. Many people seem to think that the government can simply pump money into research and the economy will grow. But that “science push” theory of growth is incorrect. Economies grow because of _innovations_ , which are inventions that are packaged and tested in the marketplace by entrepreneurs. 



The modern economy is steeped in uncertainty. No one can predict the future, not even the best scientists, engineers, and economists in big companies and the government. Many experts have made hugely off‐​base prognostications about the economy.51 Two decades ago, many pundits and policymakers were convinced that Japan was taking over the global economy. Professor and pundit Robert Reich thought that “chronic entrepreneurialism” was undermining the U.S. economy. And past predictions about the computer industry have been laughable, such as this comment in 1977 by the founder of Digital Equipment Corporation: “There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.”   
  
Luckily, expert predictions don’t drive the economy. Rather, successful market economies work by having swarms of entrepreneurs freely testing new ideas. Entrepreneurs are the economy’s guinea pigs. They have the guts to act in the face of uncertainty, and they learn from their mistakes and keep trying until they find ideas that work and generate profits. 



By contrast, government plans to stimulate the economy are often based on ideologies and rigid ideas. Some policymakers believe that particular energy technologies are THE solution to America’s problems, and they support ongoing subsidies year after year regardless of marketplace realities. By contrast, in competitive and unsubsidized markets, mistakes are usually quickly exposed and businesses cut their losses short and change direction.



It appears that the unexpected fall in solar panel prices helped to sink Solyndra. Perhaps businesses that are tethered to governments are slower to make the changes needed to survive. The government tends to work at a turtle’s pace, which doesn’t sync well with the fast‐​paced modern economy. We saw a comparison of the government turtle with the private‐​sector gazelle during the first sequencing of the human genome in the late 1990s. The government’s lavishly funded Human Genome Project was a lengthy multi‐​year research project, but it was upstaged when entrepreneur Craig Venter launched Celera Genomics to complete the job at a fraction of the time and cost.



What are the policy lessons from America’s great entrepreneurial history? One lesson is that because markets have high levels of uncertainty, government agencies and dominant companies cannot be relied upon to secure our economic future. Instead, we should remove hurdles to entrepreneurship every way we can—by tax reforms, by repealing barriers to entry into industries, and by reducing financial industry barriers to private risk financing.



While it has become fashionable to criticize Wall Street, the financial industry has been crucial to funding waves of innovation in the U.S. economy. Risk capital was integral to the railroad and telegraph booms of the 1800s, and the radio, electricity, and automobile booms of the early 20th century. J.P. Morgan Chase has garnered negative headlines in recent weeks, but J.P. Morgan was the company that provided seed capital for Thomas Edison’s Edison Electric Illuminating Company, which became General Electric.52



In recent decades, high‐​yield bonds, venture capital, and angel investment have played key roles in growing new industries. Today, U.S. venture capital and angel investors pump more than $50 billion annually into young companies.53 Tax policy influences investment flows, and funding for high‐​growth ventures is affected by the tax treatment of capital gains in particular. One step for policymakers would be to create investment certainty by permanently extending the 15 percent federal capital gains tax rate. Also, the corporate tax rate should be cut to spur greater capital investment—new capital equipment usually embodies technological advances.



Policymakers should put aside the idea that some sort of big intervention can permanently “win the race” for some particular goal, such as energy independence, solar power dominance, or beating China. In the recent House testimony, an energy consultant said, “clean energy has been targeted by our major international competitors (including China and Germany) as a critical, and perhaps the critical, future growth and export industry… whether the U.S. wins or loses in this race matters because the outcome will have a large impact on future U.S. employment and economic strength.“54 At the same hearing, a solar company executive said that America could “win in the long run” with a particular solar technology.55



However, those sorts of prognostications are refuted by U.S. economic history. There is never any final “win” in the marketplace. Look at how leadership in cell phones and smart phones has shifted from firm to firm and country to country, from Nokia, to RIM Blackberry, to Apple and others. Technologies and markets are always changing, so the only way for America to permanently “win” in the struggle for economic growth is to have the best climate for investing, innovating, and building entrepreneurial companies.



We’ve mainly focused on subsidies to new industries such as green energy. But withdrawing corporate welfare from older, established industries could spur innovation as well. Consider farm subsidies. New Zealand ended virtually all its farm subsidies in 1984, which was a bold stroke because that country is much more dependent on farming than is the United States. The changes were initially resisted, but New Zealand farm productivity, profitability, and output have soared since the reforms.56 Faced with new financial realities, New Zealand’s farmers innovated—they cut costs, diversified their land use, sought nonfarm income, and developed new markets. 



Thus rather than looking for new ways to subsidize businesses, policymakers should be looking for places to withdraw subsidies and deregulate in order to spur innovation. For example, just as the break‐​up of the AT&T monopoly in the 1980s helped to generate growth in the telecommunications industry, ending the U.S. Postal Service monopoly today would spur innovation in that industry. Europe is moving in that direction, with Germany and the Netherlands already privatizing their postal systems.57



The transportation sector is another area where innovation could be spurred by the reduction of federal subsidies. For example, Amtrak is doomed to inefficiency as a government‐​run business pumped full of subsidies and shackled with regulations. It should be privatized.58 Other countries are ahead of the United States in privatizing transportation infrastructure, or at least in bringing private investment into infrastructure.59



The United States subsidizes its air traffic control system, but it doesn’t need to. Canada privatized its air traffic control system in 1996, and it operates as a self‐​funded nonprofit corporation. It has been a big success.60 Another ripe area to cut subsidies and bring the private sector in is space flight. The recent success of the SpaceX flight and the 2004 success of SpaceShipOne indicate that the private sector is entirely capable of bold and risky technological ventures. 



To sum up, the way to spur economic growth is not through business subsidies, but through breaking down barriers to entrepreneurs. Let’s give entrepreneurs a crack at postal services, air traffic control, passenger trains, and other monopoly industries. Let’s pursue tax and regulatory reforms to maximize the flow of financing to new and growing businesses. And let’s stop demonizing entrepreneurs who succeed and the financial system that allows them to grow. If we want to exorcize some demons, we should end the corporate welfare system that is corrupting our government and the American economy.



Thank you for holding these important hearings.

"HOUSTON  —   The chants rang out loud and long at NRG Stadium in South Texas, not from bars or living rooms across New England, until a wall of sound enveloped a team and a quarterback on a mission. “Brady, Brady,” the fans screamed, and it is in moments like this  —   the first overtime in Super Bowl history  —   that Tom Brady appears most comfortable, as if lounging on his sofa in his beloved Uggs. In each of his previous four Super Bowl victories, Brady guided   drives for the Patriots. However sublime, those efforts against the Rams, the Panthers, the Eagles and the Seahawks all seemed quaint before Sunday night. That is when Brady again summoned the sorcery of his right arm to stun the Atlanta Falcons in what is undoubtedly the greatest late surge in a Super Bowl. When James White sneaked into the end zone from 2 yards away, completing a   victory that defied the bounds of credulity and secured the Patriots’ fifth title, his teammates stormed onto the field, flung their helmets and hugged anyone who moved. Across the field, the Falcons watched from their sideline as if fossilized in amber, too exhausted and dumbstruck to move. The Patriots trailed by 25 points with 2 minutes 12 seconds remaining in the third quarter  —   and by 19 with 9:48 left in regulation  —   and they won. They won because of Dont’a Hightower’s critical   and Julian Edelman’s Velcro hands and the clock management and coaching of a maestro, Bill Belichick, but mostly because of a truism that has beleaguered the league’s other 31 teams for 16 years running: the Patriots have Brady, and no one else does, not even the Falcons, who boasted the N. F. L. ’s most valuable player in Matt Ryan. Super Bowl LI Box Score Not including their   possession at the end of regulation, the Patriots, after mustering only a field goal on their first seven drives, scored on their final five possessions. “At halftime, I would say we weren’t down at all,” Brady said. “We were disappointed in the way we played, and we knew that we could go out and do a lot better in the second half. ” Brady completed 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception, a performance that earned him Super Bowl M. V. P. honors for the fourth time in his career. In none of the other three instances did he handle a season as challenging as this, from the illness plaguing his mother, Galynn, to the   suspension served for his role in that protracted saga known as Deflategate, after the underinflated footballs meant to give him a throwing advantage. In accepting the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Commissioner Roger Goodell, who meted out the punishment, the owner Robert K. Kraft did not outright address the scandal. But he did allude it to it in perhaps the strongest possible terms. “A lot has transpired in the last two years, and I don’t think that needs any explanation,” Kraft said. Because of that, he said, this title is “unequivocally the sweetest. ” His reputation sullied, Brady embarked on a nationwide tour of vindication that reached its climax in the venue where he won his second Super Bowl, back in February 2004, long before the Patriots achieved modern dynasty status in an era designed to encourage parity. Brady was 26 then, and it is possible that he is now superior in all facets, six months shy of his 40th birthday, at an age when most of his peers have either retired or entered a noticeable decline. By going   during his suspension, the Patriots created the farcical perception that they no longer needed him  —   that quarterbacks in New England’s ruthless machinery are interchangeable, even Brady. He turbocharged the Patriots’ offense with 33 touchdowns to four interceptions heading into Sunday, when he toiled, misfiring wide and long, until late in the third quarter. Powered by three touchdowns in a 9:54 span of the second quarter, Atlanta led by   with 10 minutes left before the Patriots unleashed 10 minutes of mayhem. Hightower’s   catalyzed the comeback, with Brady capitalizing on excellent field position to find Danny Amendola from 6 yards out. Less than 6 minutes remained, and though the Falcons advanced deep into New England territory, a holding penalty knocked them out of   range, forcing them to punt. This might be the appropriate point to note the travails of the Falcons franchise. Their woeful inaugural season of 1966, completed weeks before the first Super Bowl, presaged Atlanta’s struggles for the next  . It took more than a decade for the Falcons to reach the playoffs, more than three to advance to a conference championship and more than four to stack consecutive winning seasons. The Falcons traded Brett Favre and had a coach, Bobby Petrino, notify players that he was quitting by leaving notes at their lockers. The only other time Atlanta reached the Super Bowl, in January 1999, one of its best defensive players, Eugene Robinson, was arrested for soliciting a prostitute the night before. They have lost far more than they won, endured more agony than ecstasy and been lampooned for everything from their attendance to their uniforms, and for all those reasons  —   and more  —   a city that had not claimed a champion since the Braves won the World Series in 1995 was ready to celebrate with abandon once more. But first, Brady. He still had to contend with a defense overseen by the Falcons’ coach, Dan Quinn, who nearly foiled him two years ago, when he worked in Seattle. For all of Belichick’s experience, Quinn had coached in more Super Bowls recently, three in the last four seasons. The memory of that loss to New England still smolders for Quinn, who from that game remembers not the     interception by Malcolm Butler, but how the Seahawks went ahead to stay with about two minutes left. Quinn may never again coach a defense as fast and physical  —   words emblazoned on a bracelet he has worn  —   as Seattle’s, but for the first three quarters on Sunday, the Falcons harassed Brady, swarmed the ball and created turnovers, converting both of New England’s mistakes before halftime into 14 points. Most obvious was the Falcons’ speed advantage, and how, as Quinn’s Seahawks did against Denver in the 2014 game, they parlayed it into momentum. Robert Alford’s   interception return for a touchdown, the   return in a Super Bowl, had the same effect on the Patriots as Malcolm Smith’s for Seattle three years ago. And that, to an extent, was part of the plan Quinn toted along with him to Atlanta, whose ascension under him began with an evolved way of thinking forged by his time in Seattle: He wanted his players to work as hard as they ever have  —   but have a great time doing it. The Super Bowl was enjoyable, until it wasn’t. “That’s a hard one in the locker room,” Quinn said. “No place to put that one mentally for us. ” One of the Patriots’ underappreciated assets during their dominant stretch has been their resilience, which seems odd given how rarely they tend to lose, or even trail. They fell behind Sunday for the first time since Week 12 against the Jets. But the ethos cultivated by Belichick demands an uncommon fortitude. Those who cannot handle the atmosphere are weeded out like overwhelmed med students. Belichick built this reputation by twice smothering prolific offenses in Super Bowls  —   the 1990 Bills, when he coordinated the Giants’ unit, and the 2001 Rams, in the championship that launched New England’s dynasty. As potent as that Rams team was, it actually averaged fewer points and fewer yards per play during the season, and committed 33 more turnovers, than these Falcons. Scoring 80 points across two playoff victories emboldened Atlanta running back Devonta Freeman to call the Falcons’ offense “unstoppable. ” Except that the Patriots did, in fact, stop Atlanta on all four   possessions, empowering Brady with two timeouts and 3:30 left, chasing an   deficit. They marched 91 yards on a drive extended by a reception by Edelman as absurd as the comeback itself, one that evoked so many catches of past New England Super Bowls. Only this time, instead of watching opponents do the impossible  —   David Tyree hugging the ball against his helmet or Mario Manningham tiptoeing along the sideline or Jermaine Kearse contorting himself  —   it was the Patriots who amazed. While falling, Edelman caught a tipped pass, then dropped it, then cradled the ball just before it would have touched the ground. “It was one of the greatest catches I’ve ever seen,” Brady said. “I don’t know how the hell he caught it. I mean, I don’t think anybody  —   I don’t think he does. ” It only mattered that he did, and after White scored with 57 seconds left and Danny Amendola converted the tying   conversion, the Patriots called heads, won the coin toss and never let Atlanta touch the ball again. Only with a cleareyed view of these last five months, after the completion of another N. F. L. season, can it now be said: The anxiety, anger and exasperation that pervaded New England for months, after the scandal that cost the Patriots their sainted quarterback for a spell and dented their reputation  —   none of it mattered. The Patriots reached the final game, just as they thought they would. And they won, just as they thought they would all along, even if they never could have conjured how they did it. Brady and the Patriots were down for much of Sunday night, but they reappeared in the fourth quarter. And now, after Sunday, after winning yet another Super Bowl, he struck a familiar pose: holding the Lombardi Trophy as confetti fell."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen listening to Al Gore’s numbers and figures, we really do need to worry that he may have completely lost his sense of reality. Otherwise we can only conclude that he is a stunningly unscrupulous fraud.

Image cropped from: Rush Limbaugh site.
In Gore’s self-imagined climate-crisis world, global temperatures are accelerating, the center of the earth is several million degrees, mankind has only a few months left to live, and the ocean will soon swallow ground zero, where the World Trade Center once stood. His latest wild exaggeration: Industrial country Germany is now getting 37% of its energy needs from wind and solar.
“Journalistic fraud”
This and other claims made by Al Gore in a recent article in Rolling Stone Online, however, are completely false and totally foreign to reality. I know because I live in Germany and have written often about this topic. Gore’s portrayal of a German success is completely false. Moreover, Climate Depot here also brings up an interview where German renewable energy expert Steffen Henne calls Gore’s claims “journalistic fraud”.
Early in the Rolling Stone piece, Gore claims:
Germany, Europe’s industrial powerhouse, where renewable subsidies have been especially high, now generates 37 percent of its daily electricity from wind and solar; and analysts predict that number will rise to 50 percent by 2020. (Indeed, one day this year, renewables created 74 percent of the nation’s electricity!)
178% exaggeration
This is complete nonsense and it is obvious that Gore, or his researchers, never bothered to check the readily available facts. Just a quick look at Wikipedia here (hardly a shill for the fossil fuel industry) and we get the de-fantasized figures on the share of total power (2012) that wind and sun have in Germany:
Wind: 8%
Solar: 5.3%
Total wind and solar: 13.3%
Gore’s claim: 37%
Factor of exaggeration: 178%
In fact, all the renewable energies combined, i.e. solar, wind, biogas, hydroelectric, etc. amount only to 25% share of Germany’s total energy supplied as of 2012. Already leading officials concede there is little chance of reaching 40% total renewable energy by 2020, let alone 50% with only solar and wind.

Germany’s skyrocketing electricity prices
Far more significant is that Gore totally ignores the dark side of Germany’s renewable energy push: It has caused Germany’s electricity prices to soar, so much so that 600,000 German households were having their power cut off every year. Peter Altmaier, former environment minister under Angela Merkel, said Germany’s renewable energy obligations will cost consumers almost 1 trillion euros by 2030.
And Gore forgets to mention that almost every solar module manufacturer in Germany has gone bankrupt, resulting in the loss of tens of thousands of “jobs for the future”.
Unstable power grid
In addition, the erratic feed-in of the constantly fluctuating supply of wind and sun is putting the stability of Germany’ power grid in serious jeopardy. Many industries that rely on stable source of electricity are thinking twice about investing in Germany and are increasingly considering moving operations to foreign locations.
Gore also fails to tell his rock-and-roll readers that Germany has brought on-line more coal power over the past years in an effort to stabilize its base power supply. German CO2 emissions are back on the rise.
He fails to mention that many of the generous renewable energy subsidies have since been scaled back in an effort to keep the exploding costs and power grid stability from careening completely out of control.
Biodiversity genocide
Gore forgets to mention that Germany’s biogas industry has turned a large part of the country’s landscape into a giant corn-field monoculture that has resulted in large-scale biodiversity genocide. Germany’s imports of palm oil from tropical countries has also led to the mass deforestation of once pristine rainforests abroad. These biotopes are now lost for a very long time, if not forever.
Already just the first few paragraphs of Gore’s Rolling Stone piece are so detached from reality and false that everything he writes thereafter is likely of the same quality. People should have stopped listening to Gore a long time ago.

In his history of **1970s leftist terrorism** , _Days of Rage_ , Bryan Burroughs writes that, “the most startling thing…is how thoroughly it has been forgotten”. **There were nearly 2000 bombings in the U.S. in 1972 alone.** This is not a history taught in schools or ever mentioned by a media too busy hunting down imaginary “racism” like OK signs.



Although global terrorist attacks have declined slightly in the past few years, they remain at record highs not seen in the last 40 years. Not that you’d know, from reading the legacy media. Any more than you’d have known, from police or social workers, about a decades-long campaign of sexual terror waged in Britain.



The following is just a sample of this week in jihad. Take note of how, when they can’t avoid reporting terrorism, the legacy media and authorities reflexively resort to spin.



A truck drove through a traffic light in Limburg in Hesse into several vehicles […]



Astonishing: a truck drove **itself**? Well, of course there was a driver. Just don’t ask the police to tell you why he did it.



The man was said to have hijacked the truck and deliberately rammed the cars […]“with the driver saying ‘Allah’ on several occasions”[…]



The police of Westhessen wrote on Twitter: “Please note: The suspect has been arrested, our investigations are underway – please hold back with guesswork, no one needs trolls or wild speculation.”



[Translation by Jihad Watch]



The usual spin is at work in this report, too.



A 54-year-old Manhattan man has pleaded guilty to assault as a hate crime for shoving and hurling homophobic slurs at a woman as she road [sic] a subway last year.



What? Just any old, random “Manhattan man”?



 **Allasheed Allah** […]started to argue with a 20-year-old woman […][who] had been with a friend who kissed her on the cheek. Allah, seeing the smooch, yelling out, “Kiss her again, you […]” and incorporated profanity. He followed the pair when they got off the train, then walked behind the victim and hit her once in the head and chest, shoving her into a nearby pole. 



Obviously a Methodist.



When Omar Mateen murdered 49 people at a gay nightclub, he explicitly stated that his motive was revenge for U.S. operations against ISIS. His father also reported that the sight of gay men kissing enraged the young Muslim extremist. **The legacy media and activists chose to blame Republicans and the NRA instead.**



Police in France are similarly determined not to see the (literally) bleeding obvious.



The investigation is today continuing into the [stabbing] attack at the Préfecture de Police in Paris on Thursday that left four people dead and fifth critically injured before the attacker himself was shot dead…A police source told The Local that the suspect, who was deaf, **converted to Islam in recent months,** […]however there was **nothing to suggest he had become radicalised.**



Apart from, y’know, **the terrorist attack**. Or is it that Islamic terrorism isn’t “radicalised”?



The killer […]had tried to justify to a colleague the killings in January 2015 at the magazine Charlie Hebdo and had done the same for other radical Islamist killings.



[…]other potential clues — including a video the killer posted on Facebook that imitated throat-cutting — were missed by the police administration that surrounded him, at the heart of an organization dedicated to fighting terrorism […]The killer also had contacts with “several individuals suspected of being part of the Salafist movement,” Mr. Ricard said.



Nope, nothing to suggest radicalisation here, folks.



Meanwhile, Boko Haram is continuing [its campaign of murderous terrorism against Christians](https://www.christianpost.com/news/boko-haram-militants-execute-two-christian-aid-workers-release-video-footage.html) in Nigeria, and in Sweden, [one in four women now report being afraid to leave their homes](https://summit.news/2019/10/07/sweden-one-in-four-women-are-afraid-to-leave-their-homes/), as that country’s imported rape crisis continues.



And that’s the week in jihad. As you see, nothing to worry about. Go back to your climate strikes and ignore that bearded fellow shouting from the cab of that rental truck.

At all the ‘Meet the Candidates” evenings for the Local Body elections in Tauranga and the Western Bay of Plenty the earnest folk at the ‘Carbon Reduction Group’ have been handing out these flyers:



They did not even bother to claim that it was printed with non-petroleum based inks or printed on paper sourced from sustainable forests or anything.



They simply wasted the earth’s resources in order to ‘reduce carbon’.



And another curious thing … At the Meet the Candidates evenings a Councillor who was behind her Council declaring a ‘Climate Emergency’ and another one who would like his Council to do so, were the only ones bombarding the place with flyers that had a very short life-span before hitting the bin. Also guilty of using coreflute plastic signs.



Saving the planet and caring for the environment? Yeah/Nah.

"CEDARHURST, N. Y.  —   On a brisk October day, Laura Gentile strolled through the orderly aisles stocked with matzo ball soup, apple juice, challah and cinnamon kokosh cake. Packing her cart with fresh peppers, canned tuna, pretzels and cake, she said the food pantry here on Long Island was the first where she felt like any other grocery shopper. It was welcome relief from the long lines and piles of unorganized food at other food banks. “You don’t feel destroyed just walking in,” Ms. Gentile, 45, said. “Renee greets you when you come in, and you can pick out what you want, what you need. You’re not just handed something. ” Renee Harris, the food pantry coordinator, said she knew from experience the importance of creating a welcoming environment. When her husband lost his job in 2009, she found herself shopping at food banks for the first time in her life. “I felt the employees watching me  —   like I might try to steal something,” Ms. Harris said. “And I ran out of the store crying. ” Then one day she stopped by the Rina Shkolnik Kosher Food Pantry. When her family got back on its feet a few years later, Ms. Harris started working there, hoping to replicate her experience for the 350 families who shop at the pantry each month. Emulating a traditional grocery store, the food bank is organized by food groups. Shoppers carry items home in marked bags donated by nearby shops. Ms. Gentile receives $182 a month in food stamps to feed herself, a    son, Malliki Outlaw, and a    daughter, Nevaeh Outlaw, who both have mental illnesses, she said. Once a month, she fills her cart with food from the pantry, a program of the Marion  Aaron Gural J. C. C. a beneficiary of   of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Having groceries in the refrigerator has made a difference in a home filled with difficulty, she said. At 19, Ms. Gentile and her young son were living with her parents, who she said had forced her to get an abortion when she became pregnant again as a condition for staying under their roof. She later moved out and became pregnant again while in an abusive relationship, she said, and gave birth to Malliki. Months later, she found out she was expecting twins. Two months along, she miscarried one of them. She named the surviving twin Nevaeh  —   heaven spelled backward. Abuse marks Ms. Gentile’s body. A white scar runs along her hand  —   the lasting effect of being stabbed by a sharp piece of plastic. She has also endured mental trauma. Ms. Gentile said she had lost count of the number of times her children had been hospitalized or institutionalized, because of the harm they were causing their mother and themselves. But she said the trouble had started after their father died in 2002. Ms. Gentile takes care of both children, who still live at home. Her son has bipolar disorder, and her daughter has anxiety, depression and mild intellectual disabilities. She said that medication and therapy had helped manage their symptoms, and that they had not been hospitalized since 2009. But Ms. Gentile’s own health problems, including depression, high blood pressure and arthritis, exacerbated by years of abuse, have worsened. She had an operation to remove her ovaries because of a precancerous cyst. Doctors have told her that she needs to have gallstones removed and both knees replaced, but she cannot afford the operations and fears leaving her children for the duration of the recovery without another caregiver. Injections would ease the pain in her arthritic knees, but her insurance does not cover the cost. Ms. Gentile, who worked as a medical office assistant and coordinator for a physical therapy clinic, stopped working in 2008 and started receiving Supplemental Security Income a year later. The family now subsists on a cumulative $1, 434 in Supplemental Security Income. The family’s benefits had previously been cut by $733 when her son’s Supplemental Security benefits were terminated in April, because proper documentation was not submitted. The benefits were reinstated this month but reduced by $30. In 2009 she moved from Queens Village to Far Rockaway in Queens. She sleeps on a makeshift bed and gives her children the two bedrooms.

What should’ve been a slam‐​dunk win for those challenging Minnesota’s ban on “political” apparel at the polls was complicated by the plaintiffs’ counsel’s inability to draw clear lines between what the government can and can’t restrict. The voters’ lawyer began his argument by arguing, quite correctly, that Minnesota’s law was overbroad — sweeping in shirts and buttons supporting the Chamber of Commerce, NAACP, and AFL-CIO — and so several justices pushed him on the constitutionality of a more narrow rule, one restricting paraphernalia explictly referencing candidates and parties. Counsel hemmed and hawed but ultimately stated that he would make that “close call” by disallowing such a statute, though it would depend how the legislature worded it.   
  
  
That unsuccessful attempt to play coy opened the door to discussions of how to draw the distinction between electioneering — which the Court 25 years ago correctly held could be banned within a certain distance of the polling booth — and what the law at issue proscribes. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy further expressed concern about the state’s interest in maintaining “decorum” and “solemnity” (which Justice Elena Kagan later made light of by suggesting that it likened a poll to a church). As Justice Kagan put it, “it’s hard to evaluate an overbreadth argument if we don’t know where to draw the line.”   
  
  
This shouldn’t be so hard. Federal and state laws everywhere already prohibit intimidation, deception, disruption, and other attempts to interfere with the right to vote, so the rare t‐​shirt that does one of those things — for example, “Republicans vote tomorrow” or “Mexicans shouldn’t vote” — is already covered. As for the electioneering bit, a voter’s wearing a button is very different from an activist’s waving signs or distributing literature — or even that same voter’s going up to others in line and trying to convince them to vote for a particular candidate.   
  
  
Moreover, Minnesota’s law is so broad and gives so much discretion to poll workers that its enforcement is arbitrary. When the lawyer representing the election officials tried to explain that a political message or insignia could only be restricted if it related to an issue that was part of the campaign — which seemed to be a change from his earlier litigating position — Justice Samuel Alito shut him down with a devastating line of inquiry. Alito asked whether shirts with the following text could be banned: Parkland Strong, NRA, “I Miss Bill [Clinton],” Reagan‐​Bush ’84. Counsel struggled to answer, at which pointed Alito asked whether, in the current political climate, the text of the Second Amendment could be banned. The response was yes!   
  
  
That’s about as much of a mic‐​drop moment as happens at the Supreme Court — and it was followed by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s concern that #MeToo apparel could be banned given that sexual harassment is very much an issue in contemporary discourse. “The [poll workers’] conversation about the shirt seems more disruptive” than the shirt itself, commented Justice Kennedy.   
  
  
The challengers will still win their case — only Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor appeared firmly on the state’s side, so I’m still confident the margin will be more than 5–4 — but it’ll be closer, and the opinion likely narrower, than it needed to be.

As Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s struggle to oust union strongman John Setka from the party stumbles along, another rift is opening in the Labor movement. Labor is still unable to make up its mind whether it wants to return to its blue-collar roots, or just keep on its disastrous path of becoming the party of inner-city watermelon elites.



Nuclear energy policy is shaping up as yet another fault-line for a Labor party which can’t decide if it’s beer’n’parmy Arthur, or quinoa’n’almond milk Martha.



The Australian Workers’ Union will call on Australia to drop restrictions on nuclear power in a significant break from the Labor Party and other unions.



Labor has tried to straddle the barbed-wire between workers and watermelons on nuclear energy since the Hawke government compromised with the Three-Mine policy in the 1980s. Hawke wanted to avoid antagonising the urban left for whom anti-nuclear activism was a totemic fetish, while still not risking votes in mining states. The workers are arking up.



AWU national secretary Daniel Walton on Friday will tell a parliamentary roundtable — chaired by former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce — that Australia’s approach to nuclear energy is “stuck in a time warp”.



Mr Walton told The Australian on Thursday “partisan pigheadedness” on nuclear energy was holding back Australia’s ability to keep up with international competitors.



“Thirty-one advanced economies — the likes of the US, UK, Switzerland, France, Sweden, South Korea, and Finland — all rely on nuclear power in their energy mix. Yet here we’re stuck in a time warp,” Mr Walton said.



“Continuing to adopt a position of ideological extremism on nuclear technology is an economic own-goal we can’t afford to keep kicking … Australia’s energy sector is a shameful mess. In terms of global competitiveness Australia’s energy infrastructure has fallen off a cliff — from 29th in the world in 2009 to 55th today.



This is almost entirely the fault of the green-left and their obsession with climate change. Reliable power supplies, like coal plants, have been forced to close, while starry-eyed Labor state governments are switching to unreliable, ruinously expensive “renewables”.



“Most of our energy crisis is due to partisan pigheadedness — on both sides. So those of us on the progressive side of politics can’t continue to reflexively reject zero-emission compromise options.



“We should drop the federal ban on nuclear power generation as well as the state-based bans on new uranium mines. If industry sees value in the Australian market it should be free to invest without being blocked by outdated fears. Our energy debate should be about pragmatics, not 20th-century ideology.”



His new pro-nuclear move revives calls from his predecessor as AWU secretary, Paul Howes, in 2009 for a review into Australia’s stance on nuclear. Mr Howes’s push at the time was rejected by then prime minister Kevin Rudd.



If Labor should learn anything from its May election loss, it’s that nonsense such as anti-nuclear might please urban elites, but the vast swathes of electorates in blue-collar, mining areas have had enough. Meanwhile, the Coalition government is listening to the growing calls for nuclear power.



“If you want zero emissions and a renewable energy future, nuclear has to be part of the mix,” Mr Joyce said, while commending the AWU for its nuclear stance.

Maryland’s House of Delegates just voted to raise the state’s minimum wage, and the legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration. If you’re thinking, “Didn’t we just raise the minimum wage?” You’re right — it rose to $10.10 per hour last July. That follows increases in 2017, 2016 and two in 2015 in accordance with a 2014 state law.



The new legislation would raise the wage to $15 an hour by 2025 — the latest amount that proponents say will lift Marylanders out of poverty and promote social justice. Opponents respond that such an increase will increase unemployment for low‐​skilled workers who already face heavy disadvantages. Proponents, in turn, deny that will happen.



As a long‐​time follower of economic research on the minimum wage, I’m weary of these political disputes. The consensus empirical understanding of the effects of minimum wage increases is clear on three points in particular:





If Maryland’s lawmakers are committed to their constituents and to better governance, this is the minimum wage law they would approve



First, increases tend to result in an immediate decrease in employment, but it’s slight — sometimes not even statistically significant — and mainly concentrated on young black males.



Second, other low‐​wage workers receive a much‐​appreciated one‐​time boost in wages, but it is not enough to affect poverty rates. This makes sense; poverty typically is the result of no wages, not low wages.



And finally, a new but promising vein of research indicates that minimum wage increases have a more significant negative effect on employment long‐​term. This is not because employers fire workers but because employers slow their hiring and realign their use of labor in light of its higher cost. Employers may, for instance, hire two higher‐​skilled employees for work that would have gone to three lower‐​skilled, cheaper workers. Or employers may use equipment to do tasks that would have gone to employees, such as restaurant food‐​order kiosks and apps, self‐​service stations and checkouts, and retailer use of robots to clean floors and monitor shelves.



This economics literature is robust, and the negative employment effect is broadly accepted across the field. The issue is much like climate change — the expert consensus is clear, and those who say otherwise commit the equivalent of “economics denial.”



However, that consensus doesn’t decide whether minimum wage increases are good policy. That is a matter of values, not economics. Reasonable and honorable arguments can be made both for a low minimum wage (or none at all) that promotes a large number of low‐​paying jobs to complement the many higher‐​paying jobs in the economy, and for a higher minimum wage that forces a shift to higher‐​paying, albeit fewer jobs.



Personally, I strongly advocate there be no minimum wage at all. Society is better off having many entry‐​level jobs so that new workers can more easily gain experience and build work histories that lead to better‐​paying employment. Still, I appreciate the values choices of people who believe differently.



Because this difference in opinion is reasonable, I submit it would be best for Maryland and its jurisdictions to embrace a compromise minimum wage law that supports different values choices, rather than forcing a single choice on the entire state. Specifically, lawmakers should consider implementing specific minimum wages for each of Maryland’s counties and Baltimore City, set by those jurisdictions’ legislative delegations.



If, say, Baltimore City’s delegation believes the moral and economic tradeoffs favor a $15‐​an‐​hour minimum wage (or $20 or $25), then they should be able to write that into the law for their jurisdiction and not have other parts of the state force a different wage on them. Likewise, if Washington County’s delegation believes a minimum wage of only $10 is acceptable (or $6 or even $0), they too should be able to write that into the law for their jurisdiction and not have other parts of the state force a different wage on them.



In both cases, if the legislative delegations make a bad choice, they will be directly responsible to their electorates. In contrast, a single state‐​wide minimum wage would be approved mostly by lawmakers who are not directly responsible to each jurisdiction’s voters.



This proposal should sail through the Maryland General Assembly because it would give each jurisdiction the minimum wage its delegates say it wants. In this era when politicians seem incapable of compromising for the good of the people, such a law would be a welcome change and improvement in politics. If Maryland’s lawmakers are committed to their constituents and to better governance, this is the minimum wage law they would approve.

"LONDON  —   In another era they could have been allies. Both vicars’ daughters and born just a few years apart, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain share an understated pragmatism and conservative roots, and have made their way in the still largely man’s world of politics. But there could be so much more. At a time when President Trump is lashing out at friend and foe, and when the macho politics of strongmen is resurgent from Moscow to Manila, when not just the European Union but   Western values, free trade and security alliances are under attack, the two women might have worked together to defend the liberal global order. Instead, because of Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union, they find themselves on opposite sides of the biggest divorce in recent European history, a chasm that has fundamentally reordered their priorities and is hindering them from cooperating on the broader issues. At a meeting of European leaders in Malta last week, Mrs. May and Ms. Merkel abruptly canceled a planned bilateral meeting after a brief exchange during a sightseeing excursion was deemed enough. After lunch, when it came to discussing the threats facing Europe, Mrs. May was shown the door. Their differing priorities were on ample display this past week as they dealt with both Mr. Trump and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Ms. Merkel, whose overriding strategic ambition as Germany’s leader is to save the European Union, has kept her distance from Mr. Trump. After his election, she firmly outlined the liberal values on which she was prepared to work with him, and she swiftly condemned his travel ban aimed at seven   countries. Mrs. May, whose priority is to sign bilateral trade deals to offset her country’s departure from Europe’s single market, rushed to be the first foreign leader received by Mr. Trump after he took office. Apparently pleased to be caught on camera holding his hand, she extended a speedy invitation for a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II. “Opposites attract,” she beamed. The invitation has since become a polarizing issue in Britain’s sharply divided political landscape, and reinforced a view on the Continent that as Britain cuts ties with Europe, it will become America’s lap dog. “It’s chalk and cheese,” said Timothy Garton Ash, a professor of European history at Oxford. “But none of this tells you very much about the contrasting character of the two women. It tells you about the contrasting positions of the two countries. ” If Ms. Merkel can still afford to be an idealist, Britain’s plan to leave the European Union, or “Brexit,” has turned Mrs. May into a calculating realist. Within hours of leaving Mr. Trump, she was on a plane to Turkey. Upon arriving, Mrs. May waffled in her judgment of Mr. Trump’s travel ban, later stiffening her criticism after a public outcry. She also negotiated a deal with Turkey involving the British defense company BAE Systems. Five days later, Ms. Merkel paid her own visit to Mr. Erdogan and looked far clearer in her resolve when faced with the autocratic Turkish leader, calmly noting that she had raised controversial issues like press freedom and Turkey’s future Constitution. Privately, German officials express some sympathy for Mrs. May’s sometimes clumsy diplomacy, understanding that she needs new partners if she is to make good on her promise of a “Global Britain. ” But only occasionally have there been glimpses of the partnership that might have been. In July, Ms. Merkel was almost effusive in welcoming Mrs. May, who chose Berlin for her first foreign trip as prime minister. The German chancellor emphasized their countries’ “common values. ” During a news conference, both women stiffly answered questions about Brexit. Then a journalist asked about their first impressions of each other. Their body language visibly loosened. Ms. Merkel laughed, and Mrs. May said, “We have two women here who, if I may say so, want to get on with the job. ” Their shared gender has led to many lazy comparisons, said Rosa Prince, the author of a biography of Mrs. May that is to be published this month. “When you are a female political leader of a certain age, you are inevitably compared to Margaret Thatcher and Angela Merkel,” she said. “Theresa May is nothing like Margaret Thatcher, but as it happens has quite a lot in common with Angela Merkel. ” Each cautious and deliberate, they are both childless, have quiet husbands and enjoy watching sports. (Ms. Merkel knows soccer Mrs. May prefers cricket.) An Oxford graduate and lawmaker since 1997, Mrs. May was Britain’s   home secretary of modern times before taking over from Prime Minister David Cameron in the confusion that followed the Brexit referendum. As Ms. Prince put it, “She was the last woman standing after all the men got burned or ran away. ” Ms. Merkel, a scientist before she went into politics, is long used to being the only woman in the room. Evelyn Roll, a German biographer of Ms. Merkel, said that, on the advice of a German actress, the chancellor had deliberately lowered the pitch of her voice to deter men from talking over her. Both women endured condescension and outright misogyny as they rose. Mrs. May has been called a “bloody difficult woman” by a fellow minister. Ms. Merkel’s predecessor and mentor, Helmut Kohl, patronized her as “my girl. ” Even after Ms. Merkel unseated Mr. Kohl as leader of the Christian Democrats amid a party financing scandal, Germany’s   news media belittled her as efficient but bland  —   until she took office in 2005 and gradually became “Mutti,” the mother of the nation. “The only way men can process that a woman is in power is apparently to liken her to their mother,” Ms. Roll said. Ms. Merkel, who grew up in Germany’s former Communist east, has never branded herself a feminist. But on her watch Germany has introduced boardroom quotas for women and created a generous system of paid parental leave shared between mothers and fathers. Mrs. May once wore a   that read, “This is what a feminist looks like. ” In 2005, Mrs. May   a group called Women2Win to elect more women to Parliament and then nurture them, something that Mrs. Thatcher was often criticized for not doing. “They are both serious people who don’t grandstand, who don’t play for the gallery,” said Charles Grant, the director of the   Center for European Reform. But the few times the two women have met privately have been highly scripted affairs with little warmth on display, according to one person who was present at more than one of their meetings. “Theresa May is not good at small talk,” said Ms. Prince, the biographer. “She is not an easygoing, smooth person. She is not a natural diplomat. ” Ms. Merkel, however, is said to respect Mrs. May, considering her the “ ” in the British government, officials close to the chancellor say. For her part, Mrs. May has long expressed admiration for the German chancellor. “There are still people who don’t rate her, are a bit dismissive, perhaps because of the way she looks and dresses,” Mrs. May said in a 2012 interview with The Daily Telegraph. “What matters is, what has she actually done? And when you look at her abilities in terms of negotiation and steering Germany through a difficult time, then hats off to her. ” The two will soon be on the opposite side of the negotiations as Brexit talks commence. There is no wish in Berlin to “punish” Britain for leaving, said Peter Torry, Britain’s ambassador in Germany until 2007, who still lives in the German capital. But Berlin’s tone has grown more distant as Britain’s resolve to leave has hardened and their interests diverge. Mrs. May has said she will turn Britain into a   competitor if no favorable deal is offered by the European Union by the end of a   negotiation. But given her promises for a fairer society, that proposal is not considered credible or workable by many business and political leaders in Europe. Nor is her offer to be a bridge to the new American president. At a news conference in Malta after the European Union summit meeting on Friday, Ms. Merkel was asked whether Germany should lower its corporation tax in line with the reductions signaled by Mrs. May and Mr. Trump. “We have a tax system in Germany that is weathering challenges well,” Ms. Merkel said, suggesting that   societies rely on raising a fair amount of tax. One reason for the difference between the two women’s approaches may be that one is just starting out as head of government, while the other has been in office for over a decade. “May is like Merkel 10 years ago,” Ms. Roll said. Though sometimes accused of lacking a vision for Europe, Ms. Merkel is calm and strategic, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations’ research institute in Berlin. “That’s obviously helpful in a situation where we risk seeing a lot of provocations coming out of Washington over the next few years,” she said. By contrast, Ms. Schwarzer added, Mrs. May seems “more tactical at this point. ” One leader is consumed by preparing Britain’s departure from the European Union, and the other with keeping the bloc together. Could they develop a pragmatic relationship during the Brexit talks and beyond? “It won’t be a smooth ride,” Ms. Prince said, “but it certainly has a better chance of succeeding with these two levelheaded women at the top. ”"
"Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, is in court for breaching a police order on public assemblies and wilful obstruction of a highway – she was taking part in an anti-fracking demonstration. Her trial highlights many aspects of the fracking debate. But while her protest was focused on environmental concerns, there is a human rights element to the debate that must be recognised too. It’s clear that fracking is a divisive issue in the UK. While the government is taking a clear pro-fracking stance, in communities around the UK there are both supporters and opponents fighting over whether or not we should develop our “unconventional” shale gas reserves. On the one hand, supporters argue that it will reduce gas prices, create jobs, provide domestic “energy security”, all the while lowering carbon emissions.  Its opponents, however, question all of these claims in the face of growing evidence to the contrary. They point to its many negative impacts, including the potential contamination of water and soil from toxic chemicals used in the process of fracturing the rock. This toxic contamination could give rise to serious health problems. Plus, the 40,000bhp diesel pumps that drive the injection process pollute the air and have potential health impacts including reports of increased cancer rates in communities close to existing shale wells in the US. Water supplies could also be affected by fracking activities, with the prospect of water shortages due to the considerable volume of water used, and lost, in the process (19m litres). There are significant concerns over subsidence and local earthquakes, such as the tremor produced by Cuadrilla in Blackpool in April 2011, which seriously damaged the well casing. This further threatens water supplies with contamination. Other environmental concerns include fracking’s potential contribution to climate change. Extracting oil and gas by fracking is perpetuating our continued reliance on fossil fuels, at the expense of investing in renewables. Communities faced with the prospect of fracking have raised a number of concerns, such as fears over falling house prices, the fear of the industrialisation of the countryside, and who would cover the cost of clean-ups when things go wrong. While many of these issues have been raised by journalists, activists, and documentary film-makers, to date there has been little in-depth research into the cumulative impact of fracking on the quality of life of local communities who have first-hand experience of the developments. And so, it seems that fracking is fast becoming a human rights issue. As de Rijke notes: “The extraordinary expansion of the unconventional gas industry has … led to questions about social power and the rights of individuals and local communities.” Meanwhile, the “close relationship between governments and powerful multinational corporations brings to the fore questions about political influence and human rights.” The current processes certainly appear to be sidelining the right to live in a healthy and safe environment, where the rights to health and water (including access to safe drinking water) are guaranteed. If this is the case, then the environmental human rights of people in affected communities are at risk. Civil and political rights are also threatened – most obviously exemplified by Caroline Lucas’s arrest for peacefully protesting against fracking. Despite obvious government support for fracking, large sections of the population are clearly opposed to such techniques. We must consider how their rights to make their opposition known are affected. The right to security, the right to information, freedom of assembly and peaceful protest must be ensured, especially to human rights defenders, including local environmental protesters. Local populations should be fully informed of the potential environmental impacts of fracking, as well as both its advantages and disadvantages, through a comprehensive environmental and social impact assessment. There are also economic, social and cultural rights to bear in mind. These include the right to an adequate standard of living, the right to health, right to water and the right to food, which are endangered by the potential for contamination of soils and water systems. Finally, it is essential to consider the broader responsibilities that we have towards the environment. Sustainability is strongly linked with human rights, particularly because of the impact that climate change has for us and for future generations. We have an imperative moral responsibility, in addition to a legal duty under the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to favour the development of renewable energy sources over the exploitation of fossil fuels. Basic human rights standards should trump any other policy considerations – and as yet they have been absent from the fracking debate. In an attempt to address this, our current research project is documenting the experiences of those affected by fracking internationally and analysing the related human rights implications to better understand the potential impact on human rights in the UK."
"WASHINGTON  —   In his first days as President Trump’s pick to lead the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai has aggressively moved to roll back consumer protection regulations created during the Obama presidency. Mr. Pai took a first swipe at net neutrality rules designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet. He stopped nine companies from providing discounted   internet service to   individuals. He withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down, and he scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market. In total, as the chairman of the F. C. C. Mr. Pai released about a dozen actions in the last week, many buried in the agency’s website and not publicly announced, stunning consumer advocacy groups and telecom analysts. They said Mr. Pai’s message was clear: The F. C. C. an independent agency, will mirror the Trump administration’s rapid unwinding of government regulations that businesses fought against during the Obama administration. “With these   tactics, Chairman Pai is showing his true stripes,” said Matt Wood, the policy director at the consumer group Free Press. “The public wants an F. C. C. that helps people,” he added. “Instead, it got one that does favors for the powerful corporations that its chairman used to work for. ” Mr. Pai, a former lawyer for Verizon, was elevated by Mr. Trump to the position of chairman after serving as a minority Republican member for the past three years. Known for being a stickler on conservative interpretations of telecommunications law and the limits of the F. C. C. ’s authority, Mr. Pai said he was trying to wipe the slate clean. He noted that his predecessor, Tom Wheeler, had rammed through a series of actions right after the presidential election. Many of those efforts, Mr. Pai argued, went beyond the agency’s legal authority. “These   actions, which did not enjoy the support of the majority of commissioners at the time they were taken, should not bind us going forward,” Mr. Pai said in a statement released Friday. “Accordingly, they are being revoked. ” The efforts portend great changes at the federal agency at the center of the convergence of media, telecommunications and the internet. The biggest target will be net neutrality, a rule created in 2015 that prevents internet service providers from blocking or discriminating against internet traffic. The rule, which was created alongside a decision to categorize broadband like a utility, was the tech centerpiece of the Obama administration. On Friday, the F. C. C. took its first steps to pull back those rules, analysts said. Mr. Pai closed an investigation into   practices of the wireless providers   ATT and Verizon.   is the offering of free streaming and other downloads that do not count against limits on the amount of data a consumer can download. If a provider like ATT offers free streaming of its DirecTV programs, does that violate net neutrality rules because it could put competing video services at a disadvantage? Under its previous leadership, the F. C. C. said in a report that it saw some evidence that made it concerned. But Mr. Pai said after closing the investigations into wireless carriers that   was popular among consumers, particularly   households. “The speed of the ruling and the chairman’s tone are very encouraging for internet service providers,” said Paul Gallant, an analyst at Cowen. “I think it’s a down payment on net neutrality, with much more to follow. ” Last week, Mr. Pai said he disagreed with the move two years ago to declare broadband a utility. The reclassification of broadband into a service akin to telephones and electricity provided the legal foundation for net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai said he had not decided how he would approach the overhaul of broadband classification and net neutrality rules, but he faces legal hurdles. A federal court upheld the rules last year, and the commission could end up in a lengthy legal battle if he tries to scrap the rules. Mr. Pai will have the help of powerful members of Congress who have promised to attack the classification of broadband as a   service. And he is popular among Republican leaders, including the Senate’s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who with other members viewed Mr. Pai as a loyal voice of dissent during the Obama years. Mr. Pai, 44, the child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, is a fresh face for the Republican Party. Congress could introduce legislation that limits the agency’s ability to regulate broadband providers and enforce net neutrality rules. Also under attack are privacy rules for broadband providers. “The agency has strayed from its core mission,” said Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative from Tennessee who oversees a telecommunications and tech subcommittee. She has called for a hearing within two weeks on the F. C. C. agenda under the new administration. Democrats in Congress said they would fight legislation that waters down net neutrality rules. They said Mr. Pai, described as a   student of telecom law, would be a tough adversary, and they face great opposition from Republicans who have promised to prioritize the overturning of net neutrality rules. “The key here is that it’s already been tested in the courts and the court upheld this,” said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California. “Ajit Pai is intelligent and genial, but he is not on the side of consumers and the public interest. ” Most troubling to consumer advocates was the secrecy around Mr. Pai’s early actions. That included a decision to rescind the permissions of nine broadband providers to participate in a federal subsidy plan for   consumers. None of the providers currently serve   consumers, but Mr. Pai’s comments could foreshadow a   of the Lifeline   subsidy program. On Monday, the F. C. C. is scheduled to appear before a federal judge to defend its push to curb extraordinarily expensive phone call prices from prison. But it told a judge a few days ago that Mr. Pai disagreed with many aspects of the case. Mignon Clyburn, the sole Democrat of the three sitting members of the F. C. C. warned that the actions would directly harm consumers. “Rather than working to close the digital divide, this action widens the gap,” Ms. Clyburn said."
"Michael Eisen, an evolutionary biologist, is among the elite of American scientists, with a tenured position at the University of California, Berkeley, and generous funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for his research on fruit flies. But late last month, dismayed over the Trump administration’s apparent disdain for evidence on climate change and other issues, Dr. Eisen registered the Twitter handle @SenatorPhD and declared his intention to run in the 2018 election for a seat in the United States Senate from California. His campaign slogan: “Liberty, Equality, Reality. ” “I’m not sure I’m the best vehicle for this,” said Dr. Eisen, whose professional attire consists of shorts and   bearing mottos supporting open access to scientific literature, a cause he has championed. “But if we want to defend the role of science in policy making, scientists need to run for office. ” Since Mr. Trump’s election, many other scientists have expressed concern about rumors and public statements on the new administration’s views on science, climate change and the role of federal offices like the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax (although more recently said he would have an “open mind” about it) and appointed some officials to his transition team who dispute mainstream climate science. But there is much that is still unclear about his administration’s attitudes toward science. The president has yet to appoint a science adviser and has not responded to open letters calling on him to do so from science policy groups including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (whose president, Rush D. Holt, is a physicist and former congressman). Few scientists have gone as far as Dr. Eisen, but other researchers are now undergoing a political awakening, contemplating what their role should be for at least the next few years. “There are many conversations going on right now,” said Naomi Oreskes, a historian of science at Harvard who spoke at one of the first     protests, a rally in San Francisco during the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December. “Many scientists do feel that the time for sitting on the sidelines is past. ” A political action committee that seeks to get more scientists and engineers to run for elective office, 314 Action, has seen a surge of interest in its programs, with more than 2, 000 people registering at its website. The group is planning a training program for   whether they want to run for local or state offices or Congress. Other scientists have organized demonstrations  —   including a march now set for Earth Day, April 22  —   submitted letters or opinion articles to news organizations or joined efforts to preserve government data that they fear may otherwise disappear. Individuals and groups have also spoken out against Mr. Trump’s executive order restricting travel for citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other countries, an action that has affected some researchers. But an activist role is not an easy fit for many scientists. “I have plenty of colleagues who say, ‘Leave me alone in my lab,’” said Jonathan Overpeck, director of the Institute for the Environment at the University of Arizona. Still, he has seen more scientists take at least the first steps toward mobilization. “Right now it’s mostly talking about what to do,” he said. “We’re scientists  —   we tend to plan very carefully what we do and then we try to do it well. But certainly there’s an elevated sense that this is very real. ” That sense has motivated hundreds of student and faculty volunteers at nearly a dozen universities to participate in “data rescue” events over the last two months, the most recent of which was held this weekend at New York University. After a brief training session, participants spent six hours archiving environmental data from government websites, including those of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Interior Department. An anonymous donor has provided storage on Amazon servers, and the information can be searched from a website at the University of Pennsylvania called Data Refuge. Though the Federal Records Act theoretically protects government data from deletion, scientists who rely on it say would rather be safe than sorry. “For a problem like climate change, you can’t understand it if you don’t have data,” said Jerome Whitington, an environmental anthropologist and member of the   group Environmental Data Governance Initiative, which sponsored the N. Y. U. event. Much of the concern among scientists has been centered on the E. P. A. which was a favorite target of Mr. Trump during the campaign. Comments by members of his transition team have led to speculation that the new administration would gut the agency’s science staff. Although he said he was speaking only for himself, Myron Ebell, who headed the E. P. A. transition but left on Jan. 19, said in a recent interview that science within the agency had become too politicized. “I’m a great believer in science,” Mr. Ebell said, “but I’m not a great believer in politicized science. ” Many scientists would argue that it is climate deniers and others who are politicized. The question of whether scientists should take sides politically is an old one, with the widespread and   view among many researchers that they should be quiet and let their data speak for itself. Some scientists have objected to plans for the Washington march, arguing that the event will feed the view among many conservatives that scientists have a political agenda. But the idea that they should be above the fray has been slowly unraveling as researchers realize that their own aloofness may largely be to blame for public disregard for the evidence on issues like climate change or vaccine safety. And in the era of Trump, some say it could finally come completely apart. “I think that many people have moved well beyond that,” said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which is enlisting scientists to monitor what is occurring in federal agencies. “It’s nonsense  —   you need to follow your own heart. You can do science and still be a good citizen. ” Youth is leading the way in rejecting the old view, Mr. Rosenberg said. “Early career scientists, younger scientists  —   that’s not an answer for them,” he said. Chanda   a cosmologist and particle physicist at the University of Washington, is one of those younger researchers. She has long been politically active  —   she comes from a family of organizers and attended her first demonstration when she was 2 months old  —   but for her the talk and actions of the Trump administration have led to a new level of concern. Dr.   said she was especially incensed by what she and others viewed as efforts by some science organizations to reach out to the Trump administration. Immediately after the election, she took to social media to criticize a news release from the American Physical Society that urged President Trump to strengthen scientific leadership and quoted his campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again. ” “What history has taught us is that collaboration doesn’t work for science,” Dr.   said. “When we work with extremist, racist, Islamophobic or nationalist governments, it doesn’t work for science. ” The news release was quickly withdrawn and the society apologized for any “offense it might have caused. ” Michael Lubell, a physics professor who was director of public affairs for the society but who was terminated without explanation, said that “initially people were very worried that if anybody criticized Donald Trump there would be retribution. ” “People are now getting to the point where they are understanding that this is a guy in the White House who doesn’t have a firm grasp on science policy at all,” Dr. Lubell said. “Now they are mobilizing. But there’s absolutely no strategy. ” Dr. Eisen, the Berkeley biologist, would seem to have slim chances of winning a race for the Senate, since it is sure to be joined by several prominent Democrats if Dianne Feinstein, the longtime incumbent, decides not to run. But Jacquelyn Gill, a   at the University of Maine’s Climate Change Institute, has been actively recruited to  —   eventually  —   make a bid for a congressional seat by 314 Action, ever since she was quoted in the journal Nature urging her fellow scientists to “do more than write letters. ” Staff members at 314 Action (which takes its name from the number pi) liked her attitude, and she happens to live in a swing district. Like many academic scientists, Dr. Gill employs several graduate students in her laboratory and has received grant funds for research that is still in progress. But the idea of public service, at what she considers an urgent time for climate science, is tugging at her. “I came into this career wanting to do science that’s in the public good,” she said. “And maybe now that means something different than it did before. ”"

Someone called James Renwick (described as a “climate scientist”), managed to get himself on the front page of Granny Herald recently. I’m not sure what a “climate scientist” is. We never used to have such a term – we had geologists, physicists, biologists, chemists, etc.



I think we had a “climate scientist” down the West Coast when I was a kid. Old Harry Watson was the local guru on all things “climate”. He knew if it was going to be a wet summer or a cold winter. He could tell you which week to cut the hay or castrate the lambs. He was always crystal clear, very definite and stuck to his guns. Mind you, predicting a wet summer on the Coast was a pretty sure bet.



But this guy Renwick doesn’t know his job. He is all “ _coulds_ ”. 



It “ _could_ get hotter”. “It _could_ get wetter”. The sea level _could_ rise”. The “Pacific Islands _could_ become uninhabitable”. “New Zealand _could_ become a haven for refugees”.



What wimpish stuff! The Herald called him a Professor. Old Harry leaves Renwick for dead on climate predictions and Harry isn’t a “professor” of anything much, although he does know when the whitebait are running.



What’s the use of “ _could_ ” happen? 



All things “ _could_ ” happen and all things “ _could_ ” not happen. It’s about as useless as it gets. If he is a Professor he should have a list of references to back up his “ _coulds_ ”. That’s what real scientists do.



Come to think of it maybe he got warned off by that guy Hansen, another James – he is one of these professors of climate predictions and he said back in 1998 that New York would be half under water by the year 2000. He should have said “ _could_ be under water”. Kinda safer.



Or maybe it was a warning from that other great Professor – Albert Gore. He even made a movie about all nasty things that were going to happen – no arctic, no polar bears, no snow on Kilimanjaro, no food, no future. Professor James should have told him about “ _could_ ”. But come to think of it, James will probably not ever get a Nobel Prize and a $300 million bank account.



He “ _could_ ” get a job advising _TIME_ magazine though. _TIME_ magazine’s January 31, 1977 cover featured a story: “How to Survive the Coming Ice Age.” It included “facts” such as scientists predicting that Earth’s so-called average temperature _could_ drop by 20 degrees Fahrenheit due to man made global cooling. Dr Murray Mitchell of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned readers that “the drop in temperature between 1945 and 1968 had taken us one sixth of the way to the next Ice Age temperature.”



Now _TIME_ have come out with a totally opposite edition – we are all going to a hot hell in a hand basket. They have dropped the “ _could_ ”. They must be right this time for sure. They would have been better to follow James’s lead and add a “ _could_ ” or two again.



Mind you, it could be that Professor James is onto something with his “ _could_ be hotter, _could_ be wetter” meme. The IPCC, a group set up by the UN to inflict global warming on us, gets all antsy about predictions. They are a bit more sophisticated than Kiwi James. They use lofty terms like “low confidence” or “high confidence”. In other words, they haven’t got a clue and their pride won’t let them be nice and clear cut like my old mate from down the Coast. 



One thing for sure old Harry doesn’t have any “models” to go by although he did have a Model T years ago. It was a darn side more reliable than the models Professor James reveres. Even Harry could have told James to “get real” had he seen the models James is relying on. He would have pointed out that when you are already a degree or more out with your predictions (as the models are), it’s time to give up. “You’d be better off coming down the Coast and catching a few eels while I teach you a few facts about what the climate does” Harry would claim.



I guess they forgot about the “ _coulds_ ” when they called it ‘settled science’. If it’s so settled why not say “will”?



As for “catastrophes” – the only real catastrophe we have is something called a Zero Carbon Bill. It’s all about closing down agriculture and planting New Zealand in trees. It’s a catastrophe for rural New Zealand, for rural businesses and for exports. But when you do not know what GDP is why would you worry about exports and productivity? 



And “emergencies”? Yep, we’ve got a bunch of them. Like: China is building 300 coal fired power stations while we grandstand about reducing our 0.17% of world emissions. Chuck a few cockies and rural businesses under the bus so you can crow at the next IPCC meeting.



What about when the ‘local’ closes and I can’t get beer anymore? That’s a real “emergency”.

President-elect Donald Trump has claimed victory in his effort to preserve employment for Carrier workers in Indiana. Assisted by $7 million in tax incentives provided by the State of Indiana, Mr. Trump persuaded the company not to move 800 furnace manufacturing jobs to Monterrey, Mexico. This works out to a taxpayer-funded subsidy of $8750 per job. 



Another 1300 Carrier jobs still will move to Mexico between now and 2019. Published reports have indicated that the company anticipated cost savings of some $65 million per year from moving all 2100 positions to Monterrey. So Carrier is taking at least a partial step toward maintaining its global competiveness, while at least partially appeasing the incoming president.   
  
I wrote an op-ed in Forbes on August 22, 2016, in which I argued that Carrier no doubt had quite good business reasons for planning the move to Mexico. Carrier’s February 2016 announcement of the decision said that it was due to “ongoing cost and pricing pressures driven, in part, by new regulatory requirements.”   
  
Carrier has been manufacturing products in Monterrey for some years. The company certainly has a clear understanding of why moving production of some air conditioning units makes business sense. It would not be wise for them to explain their reasoning in public because such proprietary knowledge would be of great interest to their competitors.   
  
Some commentators have opined that the decision was driven largely by lower labor costs. Carrier’s expenses for employee salary and benefits average about $34 per hour in Indiana, while those costs in Mexico are only around $6 per hour. It’s possible the move was prompted primarily by labor cost savings, although my analysis of data compiled by The Conference Board suggests otherwise. The value generated by an hour worked in the United States has risen by 40 percent over the past 22 years of NAFTA. In Mexico, the gain has been only 10.5 percent. Productivity has grown faster in the United States, so the incentive to shift production to Mexico today ought to be weaker than it was 10 or 20 years ago. (Note: Those figures apply to the productivity of all workers. If it was possible to analyze just the manufacturing sector, perhaps the findings would change.)   




There is little doubt that Carrier could escape some other costs by moving away from the United States. As I wrote in August:   






What other factors could have inspired Carrier’s move? U.S. businesses frequently are critical of what they see as burdensome regulations imposed by government. Those range from policies dealing with energy and the environment, to rules pertaining to labor relations and taxation. One often overlooked issue is the burden placed on manufacturing firms by antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) measures. AD/CVD duties are imposed to provide protection for U.S. companies that face import competition. Many industries that seek AD/CVD protection are in the business of making basic products that are used as inputs by downstream manufacturers. The simple reality of the marketplace is that protected firms tend to receive higher prices. Those higher prices translate directly into higher costs for value-added manufacturers that use the protected product as an input. 



Steel provides a great example. The United States has imposed roughly 150 AD/CVD orders to limit imports of steel from numerous countries. The extra duties help steel mills to compete, but they also reduce the competitiveness of steel-consuming firms that must pay those extra costs. AD/CVD measures cause a few steel producers to be winners, while a whole lot of other firms end up as losers. 



Since steel is required to make air conditioners, there is little doubt that Carrier is one of the losers from AD/CVD policies. Perhaps more important than steel, AD/CVD measures also apply to imports of copper tubing and aluminum extrusions, both of which are used to accomplish the essential heat-exchange function. Carrier can avoid those policy-imposed costs simply by moving to Mexico.





It may be helpful to look at steel trade remedies in a broader perspective. Downstream manufacturers that use steel as an input are a much larger factor in the U.S. economy than are steel producers. Department of Commerce statistics indicate that “primary metal manufacturing,” which includes steel, copper, aluminum, magnesium, etc., added about $60 billion of value to the economy in 2014. Downstream manufacturers that utilize steel as an input generate value added of $990 billion, more than 16 times larger. Employment by primary metal manufacturers was 400,000, while downstream manufacturers employed 6.5 million, also 16 times greater. (Employment by U.S. steel mills is somewhere around 100,000.)   
  
Steel import restrictions have made the United States a high-priced island in an ocean of low-priced steel. U.S. prices are high enough to give imported manufactured goods an advantage when competing in the U.S. market against domestic firms. How many of the 6.5 million workers employed by value-added manufacturers are vulnerable to import competition from foreign companies that have access to world-price steel? It’s not clear. What is clear is that if only 2 percent of those workers (130,000 people) lose their jobs, more people would be unemployed due to steel import duties than are now employed in the entire U.S. steel mill workforce.   
  
Will the new administration be interested in reforming AD/CVD laws so that an action intended to help one industry does not inadvertently damage another? If so, it should pursue legislation that would balance the potential help provided by such measures against the potential harm they might do. Trade remedy measures should be prevented from going into place whenever quantitative analysis shows that they would have an overall negative effect on the U.S. economy. Although this approach makes great sense, it may not be welcomed by members of the incoming administration’s transition team, some of whom have connections to the steel industry.   
  
One unfortunate aspect of the president-elect’s foray into Carrier’s business decisions is that he missed the opportunity to focus the public’s attention on the need to improve the U.S. business climate. Government policies play important roles in determining whether firms can remain competitive. Non-competitive companies aren’t able to thrive, grow, or hire more workers. The incoming administration would do well to focus on reforming poorly conceived U.S. laws and regulations that make it unnecessarily difficult to conduct business in this country.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt their Die kalte Sonne site here, Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning write how a philosophy professor and a communication professor tried to portray climate science skeptics as ‘conspiracy theorists’ and how their attempt backfired.
It’s the latest example of German academia trying to smear those who express other views made in the true spirit of science.

Scientists at University of Augsburg with dubious study on “climate skeptical emotionalization strategy
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
In March 2014 a study appeared in the journal GAiA which dealt with climate skeptical views. The authors are Jens Soentgen and Helena Bilandzic of the University of Augsburg in Germany:
The structure of climate skeptical arguments. Conspiracy theory as scientific criticism
Climate skeptics go against the mainstream and claim that not only the scientific consensus over the causes of global warming are false, but that they also have been falsified. They assume a conspiracy among climate scientists. The following analysis of climate-skeptical argumentation deals with an assessment of German and English language science books. It reveals the function and basis of the climate skeptic emotionalization strategies.”
Abastract:
Questioning and rejecting the scientific consensus on climate change causes, climate skeptics argue that climate science is involved in a global conspiracy, guided by self-interest and aspirations of societal change. On the basis of 97 climate skeptical non-fiction books, this article reconstructs the logical structure of climate skeptical (or denialist) arguments, with a special focus on the construction of the causes for climate change. The analysis shows that climate skeptical arguments are made on three levels: on the level of insight from climate science, on the level of an intuitive sociology of science and on a political/economic level, thus achieving the desired effect of moving the audience emotionally. The reconstruction of arguments may serve as a basis for more quantitative research, but it is also useful for entering the debate with climate skeptics as it allows anticipating climate skeptical objections.”
The pdf file of the German-language study is available free of charge as a download. Conveniently Soentgen happens to be a co-publisher of the journal. Of course many of us would like to know more about how the peer-review process really took place. In the study the authors also discuss our book “Die kalte Sonne”. Fritz Vahrenholt made the effort to write a letter to the lead author:

Dear Herr Soentgen,
I have read your study sub-titled ‘Conspiracy theory as scientific criticism’. You did not spend much time with the scientific assertions of our book. Thus it wasn’t necessary for you to point out that we hold CO2 does have an impact on climate, but one that is only half as large as what is claimed by the IPCC in its 2007 report. Since then, climate sensitivity has been significantly reduced in numerous peer-reviewed publications – down to one half and even less. Even the IPCC reduced the lower limit of climate sensitivity to 1.5°C in its latest report and found itself unable to assign any supportable probable figure. Shouldn’t that fact alone make us skeptical of the climate models, 95% of which falsely projected the development of the global mean temperature over the last 15 years? These models, which were unable to forecast 15 years ahead, provide the framework for a 100-year prognosis and lead to the adoption of political action of the sort we are already observing in Germany today.
At the end you write: ‘If the global mean temperature continues to remain flat or even drop over the next decade despite continuously rising CO2 emissions, then the position of the climate skeptics in the public will grow.’ Is that your only conclusion? Could one not also reach the conclusion that the climate models obviously do not reflect reality because they are not taking the natural effects (clouds, sun, ocean currents) numerically into account? Shouldn’t that have consequences for the speed and extent of a controversial required CO2 reduction…one that would have a less dramatic, economical and environmental consequences?
But then again this would be skepticism, and that we know is now verboten because it’s part of a conspiracy theory.
Yours truly
Fritz Vahrenholt

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline German DW public radio brings us a report on the latest developments concerning the Prokon Holding GmbH & Co. Verwaltungs-KG wind-park investment debacle.
Image: Prokon
The Itzehoe, Germany based Prokon was founded in 1995 and specialized in the planning, financing and construction of onshore wind-parks in Germany, Poland and Finland. Prokon’s business model had come under scrutiny several times in the past, with some even warning that it resembled a Ponzi scheme. Instead of securing financing from banks and lending institutions, the company attracted capital from private persons, enticing them with promises of high rates of return and a contribution to protecting the climate. Early on many politicians praised the model.
Since it was founded in 1995, the company raised 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion) by “advertising directly to the public, touting profit participation rights and promises of superb annual returns” to potential private investors. In total 75,000 investors took up the offer. But as time went on critics began to accuse the company of using fresh money coming from new investors to pay the returns for the older investors. They warned that it was only a question of time before the scheme would collapse.
The critics were right: On January 22, 2014, the company declared insolvency. Prokon’s pony-tailed managing director Carsten Rodbertus, however, insisted that the company was still “essentially healthy”, and then blamed the investors for the debacle because they demanded the high returns that had been promised, or a refund of their principle, Spiegel wrote.
Spiegel also wrote that the woes were not only unique to Prokon, but to many windpark developers all over Germany. “In courts around the country, complaints are mounting from wind park investors who haven’t received a dividend disbursement in years or whose parks went belly up. Consumer protection activists are complaining that many projects are poorly structured and lack transparency.”
Meanwhile yesterday a number of investors gathered to vote on how the insolvent Prokon company would proceed in order to settle the 391 million euros ($542 million) in outstanding investor claims. They voted to sell off some of Prokon’s assets in a desperate attempt to “recoup at least some of their original investment.”
The Prokon debacle has even led the German government to introduce new rules to regulate how financial products may be advertised to retail investors. However, for the 75,000 Prokon investors, the new rules will come too late.

"A petition on the human right to water, signed by 1.8m people across Europe, was presented last month in Brussels. The petition called on the European Commission to recognise the UN resolution that water is a human right and to ensure that water and sanitation assets are in public control, free from EU market rules. The petition was remarkable for a number of reasons. It was the first European Citizens Initiative – a provision for direct democracy inserted in the recent revision of the EU treaty, which says that the European Commission has to listen and respond to petitions signed by over one million people in at least seven countries. In doing this, the issue was brought before the European Parliament. The biggest support came in Germany, aided by popular TV comedian Erwin Pelzig. The show urged viewers to sign, while mocking EU rules that forbade the campaign’s web address to be broadcast by filming a car on which the address was displayed. The initiative had support from a wide range of organisations and was led by the European Federation of Public Service Unions, which represents public service workers across the continent. Supporting the human right to water is surprisingly controversial for European governments. Though the UN made water a human right in 2010, most EU countries, along with with the USA, did not support this vote – Germany and Spain were notable exceptions. More challenging for the EU is the element of the initiative declaring water is a common good and should not be subject to the competition rules of the internal market. This flies in the face of core EU market principles. But some effect has already been seen. The commission has agreed to exclude water from its new directive on concessions, which is intended to make privatisation easier. It also increases the pressure on the EU to exclude water, and public services in general, from the new trade deal being planned with the USA and Canada. Plus, it strengthens demands for the EU to make more aid available for partnerships with European public sector water operators instead of supporting the failing model of public-private partnerships. The initiative is the latest step by campaigns against water privatisation which have had remarkable success across the globe. Major water multinationals such as French groups Suez and Veolia have retreated from much of their business in developing countries as a result of campaigns. They have also suffered the humiliation of losing their home city, Paris, to a new municipal service in 2010.  Paris has inspired other towns and cities in France and elsewhere in Europe, including Berlin and Budapest, to terminate private water contracts. The Reclaiming Public Water Network estimates that more than 85 cities have switched from private to public in the past decade. Globally, more than 90% of water services are in public hands. This leaves the UK, or more precisely England, looking increasingly isolated – although there have been successful campaigns against water privatisation elsewhere in the UK. In Scotland, water services were spared the Thatcher privatisation and in Northern Ireland the campaign against water privatisation was the lead issue in the first assembly elections. It brought an improbable unity between Sinn Fein and the DUP, which led to the assembly’s first policy decision being to keep water public. Private companies in England, however, are now celebrating their 25th year of lucrative exploitation of their natural monopolies, with most of them now owned by private equity consortia or Asian multinationals. The companies are extracting profits of around £2 billion a year above the cost of a public service funded through low-cost public debt. This means renationalisation would save the average household £83 per year, cutting bills by more than 20%.  This year should have seen the expiry of the original licences awarded in 1989. But a new clause requiring 25 years notice of  termination has effectively extended their contracts indefinitely – the clause seems to be of no concern to the competition authorities of the UK or the EU. Profits of private companies are partly based on relentless price rises. They are nearly double the overall rate of inflation since the 1980s, which have left 23.6% of households in water poverty (defined as water bills at over 3% of household income). Profits are also reinforced by tax avoidance schemes which channel payments through tax havens. Companies resist reinvesting their profits in updating their services – Thames Water insists that government or consumers should pay the lions’ share of the costs of modernising London’s sewerage system. The companies have not found it difficult to convince the water industry regulator, OFWAT, of the need for generous price caps. They do so by overestimating the amounts they expect to spend on capital maintenance and then underspending these estimates by a significant amount. This reinforces their stream of profits, but not our water and sewerage networks. It may not have been a coincidence that the only serious flood in London this winter came not from the storms but from the fracturing of a mains water pipe in Kennington. Despite all this, the Greens are the only UK party to support bringing water back into the public sector. This makes them the only party in line with public opinion on this issue. The most recent poll on the issue found more than 70% of people favour renationalisation of the water sector – almost exactly the same as the proportion which opposed privatisation 25 years ago."

If you were expecting this to be a detailed post‐​mortem on the demise of the USA Freedom Act, you will be disappointed. As others have covered that ground, I want to focus on the consequences of the failure to rein in NSA to date, and what a failure to do so in 2015 will mean for this country.



In the absence of real reform, people and institutions at home and abroad are taking matters into their own hands. In America, the NSA’s overreach is changing the way we communicate with and relate to each other. In order to evade government surveillance, more and more Americans are employing encryption technology. 



The veritable explosion of new secure messaging apps like Surespot, OpenWhisper’s collaboration with WhatsApp, the development and deployment of open source anti‐​surveillance tools like Detekt, the creation of organizationally‐​sponsored “surveillance self‐​defense” guides, the push to universalize the https protocol, anti‐​surveillance book events featuring free encryption workshops— are manifestations of the rise of the personal encryption and pro‐​privacy digital resistance movement. Its political implications are clear: Americans, along with people around the world, increasingly see the United States government’s overreaching surveillance activities as a threat to be blocked.





The failure of the Congress and the courts to end the surveillance state is only fueling the growing resistance movement.



The federal government’s vacuum‐​cleaner approach to surveillance—manifested in Title II of the PATRIOT Act, the FISA Amendments Act, and EO 12333—has backfired in these respects, and the emergence of this digital resistance movement is one result. Indeed, the existence and proliferation of social networks hold the potential to help this movement spread faster and to more of the general public than would have been possible in decades past. This is evidenced by the growing concern worldwide about governments’ ability to access reams of information about people’s lives with relative ease. **As onemeasure, compared to a year ago, 41% of online users in North America now avoid certain Internet sites and applications, 16% change who they communicate with, and 24% censor what they say online.** Those numbers, if anywhere close to accurate, are a major concern for democratic society.



But it’s unclear that the privacy technologies offered as solutions will prove effective over the long‐​term. In the ongoing cat‐​and‐​mouse game between digital defenders and surveillance practitioners, it will only be a matter of time before someone finds a way around today’s latest defenses, which will prompt the creation of fresh defenses. This very interaction can also chill freedom of expression and association. That is, one can imagine that every turn in this game, including each launch of a new counter‐​surveillance technology, will be another reminder to individuals that their digital transactions are potentially being monitored by a government they no longer trust—and why continued efforts to keep the government out are necessary.



Even if commercially available privacy technology proves capable of providing a genuine shield against warrantless or otherwise illegal surveillance by the United States government, it will remain a treatment for the symptom, not a cure for the underlying legal and constitutional malady.



In April 2014, a Harris poll of US adults showed that in response to the Snowden revelations, “Almost half of respondents (47%) said that they have changed their online behavior and think more carefully about where they go, what they say, and what they do online.” Set aside for a moment that _just the federal government’s collection of the data_ of innocent Americans is itself likely a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Harris poll is just one of numerous studies highlighting the collateral damage to American society and politics from NSA’s excesses: segments of our population are now fearful of even _associating_ with individuals or organizations executive branch officials deem controversial or suspicious. Nearly half of Americans say they have changed their online behavior out of a fear of what the federal government might do with their personal information. **The Constitution’s free association guarantee has been damaged by the Surveillance State’s very operation.**



Also at risk is the First Amendment’s guarantee of a free press able to investigate potential government abuses of power in the national security arena without reporters fearing that its communications are being monitored and potentially used to unmask sources.



We now live in an age where the federal government is willing to prosecute journalists in an effort to compel them to reveal their sources in national security leak cases. The most recent example is the Justice Department’s multi‐​year legal assault on _New York Times_ national security reporter James Risen. Even at the height of the Pentagon Papers case four decades ago, the Nixon administration did not go as far as the Bush 43 and Obama administrations have gone in trying to intimidate journalists into revealing their sources in national security leak cases. Since Snowden’s revelations in June 2013, the climate for journalists working issues like the NSA surveillance scandal has only become more hostile.



In the preface to his new book, @War, Shane Harris notes how the executive branch’s war on leakers meant that his sources



“…risked criminal prosecution in talking to me. The Obama administration has historically been hostile to government employees who share information with journalists. The Justice Department has prosecuted more people for disclosing classified information than all previous administrations combined. Simply put, it is a dangerous time to talk to journalists. And this risk extends to former government employees and military personnel. Several former intelligence officials have told me that within the past year they were explicitly told by the intelligence agencies where they’re still employed as contractors that they should stop talking to journalists if they want to continue doing business with the government.”



The failure of the Congress and the courts to end the surveillance state, despite the repeated efforts by a huge range of political and public interest actors to effect that change through the political process, is only fueling the growing resistance movement. Federal officials understand this, which is why they are trying—desperately and in the view of some, underhandedly—to shut down this digital resistance movement. This action/​reaction cycle is exactly what it appears to be: an escalating conflict between the American public and its government. Without comprehensive surveillance authority reforms (including a journalist “shield law” and ironclad whistleblower protections for Intelligence Community contractors) that are verifiable and enforceable, that conflict will only continue.

"**The coronavirus pandemic has inspired the latest Christmas film by a man whose John Lewis-inspired festive shorts have gone viral each year.**
A Gift They'll Never Forget tells a touching story of the power of memory and remembering lost loved ones.

The film shows a mother sending her son a video message to his phone in the future.
The 34-year-old filmmaker, from Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, said: ""Many people will have suffered the unfortunate and premature loss of loved ones.
""In our digital age, now's the time to be saving photos, videos, documents and anything of importance in a safe and secure space, before it's too late.""
Mr Beastall said the pandemic led to extra hurdles when it came to making his latest film in November.
""We faced more challenges than normal when trying to capture this film, due to Covid restrictions,"" he explained.
""We were also hit with another national lockdown not long before our first day of filming.
""However, James Whitehill, our producer, did a fantastic job in ensuring that everything stayed on track despite many last-minute changes that had to be made.""
Mr Beastall has said his films were inspired by the John Lewis Christmas adverts.
After Love is a Gift went viral in November 2018, Mr Beastall set up a video production company with his partner.
This led to him directing Lewis Capaldi's video for his single, Someone You Loved, starring Doctor Who actor Peter Capaldi.
Made for You, his Christmas 2019 follow-up to After Love is a Gift was also a huge hit online.
Mr Beastall is now head of film and video at smartphone app company Memories Group which commissioned A Gift They'll Never Forget."
"**We've looked into some of the most widely shared false vaccine claims - everything from alleged plots to put microchips into people to the supposed re-engineering of our genetic code.**
The fear that a vaccine will somehow change your DNA is one we've seen aired regularly on social media.
The BBC asked three independent scientists about this. They said that the coronavirus vaccine would not alter human DNA.
Some of the newly created vaccines, including the one now approved in the UK developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, use a fragment of the virus's genetic material - or messenger RNA.
""Injecting RNA into a person doesn't do anything to the DNA of a human cell,"" says Prof Jeffrey Almond of Oxford University.
It works by giving the body instructions to produce a protein which is present on the surface of the coronavirus.
The immune system then learns to recognise and produce antibodies against the protein.
This isn't the first time we've looked into claims that a coronavirus vaccine will supposedly alter DNA. We investigated a popular video spreading the theory back in May.
Posts have noted that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology ""has never been tested or approved before"".
It is true that no mRNA vaccine has been approved before now, but multiple studies of mRNA vaccines in humans have taken place over the last few years. And, since the pandemic started, the vaccine has been tested on tens of thousands of people around the world and has gone through a rigorous safety approval process.
Like all new vaccines, it has to undergo rigorous safety checks before it can be recommended for widespread use.
In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, vaccines are tested in small numbers of volunteers to check they are safe and to determine the right dose.
In Phase 3 trials they are tested in thousands of people to see how effective they are. The group who received the vaccine and a control group who have received a placebo are closely monitored for any adverse reactions - side-effects. Safety monitoring continues after a vaccine has been approved for use.
Next, a conspiracy theory that has spanned the globe.
It claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it.
There is no vaccine ""microchip"" and there is no evidence to support claims that Bill Gates is planning for this in the future.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC the claim was ""false"".
Rumours took hold in March when Mr Gates said in an interview that eventually ""we will have some digital certificates"" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips.
This led to one widely shared article headlined: ""Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus.""
The article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection.
However, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study.
The billionaire founder of Microsoft has been the subject of many false rumours during the pandemic.
He's been targeted because of his philanthropic work in public health and vaccine development.
Despite the lack of evidence, in May a YouGov poll of 1,640 people suggested 28% of Americans believed Mr Gates wanted to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans.
We've seen claims that vaccines contains the lung tissue of a an aborted fetus. This is false.
""There are no fetal cells used in any vaccine production process,"" says Dr Michael Head, of the University of Southampton.
One particular video that was posted on one of the biggest anti-vaccine Facebook pages refers to a study which the narrator claims is evidence of what goes into the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. But the narrator's interpretation is wrong - the study in question explored how the vaccine reacted when introduced to human cells in a lab.
Confusion may have arisen because there is a step in the process of developing a vaccine that uses cells grown in a lab, which are the descendants of embryonic cells that would otherwise have been destroyed. The technique was developed in the 1960s, and no fetuses were aborted for the purposes of this research.
Many vaccines are made in this way, explains Dr David Matthews, from Bristol University, adding that any traces of the cells are comprehensively removed from the vaccine ""to exceptionally high standards"".
The developers of the vaccine at Oxford University say they worked with cloned cells, but these cells ""are not themselves the cells of aborted babies"".
The cells work like a factory to manufacture a greatly weakened form of the virus that has been adapted to function as a vaccine.
But even though the weakened virus is created using these cloned cells, this cellular material is removed when the virus is purified and not used in the vaccine.
We've seen arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim.
A meme shared by people who oppose vaccination put the recovery rate from the disease at 99.97% and suggested getting Covid-19 is a safer option than taking a vaccine.
To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the ""recovery rate"" - implying these are people who caught the virus and survived - is not correct.
About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, Senior Statistician at the University of Oxford.
So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme.
However, Mr Oke adds that ""in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19"".
It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who suffer long-lasting health effects.
This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries.
Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It should be seen as an effort by society to protect others, he says.
""In the UK, the worst part of the pandemic, the reason for lockdown, is because the health service would be overwhelmed. Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus"".

At the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires today, the renegotiated NAFTA — in the U.S., the new agreement is referred to as the United States — Mexico — Canada Agreement, or USMCA — was signed by the three parties. The big question now is, what will Congress think of the agreement as it decides whether to ratify it? One aspect of this question is, what will the Democrats who now control the House think of it? And to get even more specific, I’m very curious to see what progressives think of it. While she is in the Senate rather than the House, Senator Elizabeth Warren may be a good indicator of what many progressives think. Yesterday, Senator Warren gave a speech at American University in which she set out “her vision for a progressive foreign policy that works for all Americans.” She covered a lot of ground, and I won’t go through all of it, but here is a key bit on trade policy:   




By the time the 2008 global financial crash came around, it only confirmed what millions of Americans already knew: the system didn’t work for working people — and it wasn’t really intended to.   
  
  
And it’s still not working. Tomorrow, the Trump Administration will likely sign a renegotiated NAFTA deal.   
  
  
There’s no question we need to renegotiate NAFTA. The federal government has certified that NAFTA has already cost us nearly a million good American jobs — and big companies continue to use NAFTA to outsource jobs to Mexico to this day.   
  
  
But as it’s currently written, Trump’s deal won’t stop the serious and ongoing harm NAFTA causes for American workers. It won’t stop outsourcing, it won’t raise wages, and it won’t create jobs. It’s NAFTA 2.0.   
  
  
For example, NAFTA 2.0 has better labor standards on paper but it doesn’t give American workers enough tools to enforce those standards. Without swift and certain enforcement of these new labor standards, big corporations will continue outsourcing jobs to Mexico to so they can pay workers less.   
  
  
NAFTA 2.0 is also stuffed with handouts that will let big drug companies lock in the high prices they charge for many drugs. The new rules will make it harder to bring down drug prices for seniors and anyone else who needs access to life‐​saving medicine.   
  
  
And NAFTA 2.0 does little to reduce pollution or combat the dangers of climate change — giving American companies one more reason to close their factories here and move to Mexico where the environmental standards are lower. That’s bad for the earth and bad for American workers.   
  
  
For these reasons, I oppose NAFTA 2.0, and will vote against it in the Senate unless President Trump reopens the agreement and produces a better deal for America’s working families.   
  
  
…   
  
  
How can we make the system fair for working Americans? Lots of ways.   




Those four changes would fundamentally alter every trade negotiation. 



I disagree with most of her views on the impact of NAFTA, but putting that aside, what I’m curious about here is what it would take to get her to support the new NAFTA. I’ve read through her remarks a couple times now, and I still can’t figure out precisely what changes she wants and expects in NAFTA 2.0 in order to vote for it. First of all, the tax haven and monopoly issues are not likely to be addressed seriously through a trade agreement anytime soon, so we can ignore that part. On the other hand, the labor protections and worker issues are _already in_ the new NAFTA, and the Trump administration pushed for changes in this area that gave labor groups far more than President Obama’s Trans Pacific Partnership did. So what is Senator Warren’s goal with these statements? Is she laying the groundwork for a “no” vote on the agreement, regardless of any additions to the agreement the Trump administration might accept? Or are there changes on labor rights that would satisfy her and get her to vote in favor?   
  
  
My instinct is that she will not vote for any trade agreement negotiated by Trump, but we’ll see. Perhaps there is more potential with the younger progressives in Congress who are not as wedded to the economic nationalist views of senior Democrats. Has anyone asked Alexandria Ocasio‐​Cortez what she thinks of trade liberalization and whether there is a trade agreement she could support? I’m curious whether she and other young progressives who are open to immigration could also be open to trade. I’ve seen her sound skeptical about trade deals on Twitter, but now she will be governing rather than campaigning, and that could make her think more deeply about whether blocking trade with people in other contries is really a good policy.
"
"WASHINGTON  —   Andrew F. Puzder, who as President Trump’s pick to head the Labor Department has come under fire for criticizing worker protections, acknowledged on Monday that he had employed an undocumented immigrant to clean his house. The revelation potentially could derail a nomination that has elicited controversy because of Mr. Puzder’s views on overtime pay, sick leave and automation. The confirmation of Mr. Puzder, a   chain executive, has stalled as he tries to divest holdings. “My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U. S.,” Mr. Puzder said in a statement. “When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status. ” Mr. Puzder added that he and his wife had paid back taxes in full to the I. R. S. and the state of California. Confirmation hearings for Mr. Puzder have been delayed as he works to remove himself from his role as the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, whose holdings include the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s chains. Democrats have suggested that his nomination could be on shaky ground, in part, because he has yet to file standard disclosures and questionnaires to the Senate committee that will consider his confirmation. Progressive groups have echoed that sentiment. “It’s long past time for Mr. Puzder to deliver on his commitment to file paperwork with the Senate and let the American people know what issues are causing so many headaches for the Trump administration,” Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, said on Monday. Mr. Puzder remains “all in” for the confirmation process, a spokesman said on Monday. He is not the first cabinet nominee who has hired undocumented workers. Mr. Trump’s choice to lead the Commerce Department, Wilbur Ross, said last month that he had employed an undocumented household worker for several years. And Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina and the nominee for White House budget director, said that he failed to pay taxes on a nanny that he and his wife employed after their children were born. They had to pay more than $15, 000 in taxes and penalties to the I. R. S."

It’s easy to dislike Greta Thunberg, a scowling _enfant terrible_ with, as my Mum used to say, “a face like a smacked bum”. But that may be too hasty a judgement. As more details emerge of Thunberg’s self-confessed cognitive disabilities, one is more inclined to pity. Thunberg, if all that she says about herself is true, quite literally believes the false tales of climate apocalypse she has been fed.



The anger is better directed at the adults who have deliberately scared the living daylights out of Greta and her army of literal-minded child soldiers. These gullible children are being terrified into a mental health crisis by unscrupulous adults.



It is nothing short of a disgrace that young people are being used in this way.



A youth mental health organisation has found four in five Australian students are “somewhat” or “very” anxious about climate change. And half of them report being so on a weekly basis.



There is no other way of putting it — school students and university students are being brainwashed…



But the real test of these students’ beliefs is just how far they are willing to go live up to them. It’s easy to do the soft stuff – wagging a day off school and hanging out with your friends, collecting social media backpats and taking selfies – but if they **really** believed their own bs, there’s nothing they wouldn’t do to avoid the catastrophe they say they believe is bearing down on the world.



The bulk of the electricity we use for now and well into the future will be provided by coal-fired power.



So, if you are going to turn yourself inside out about coal-fired power, turn off your iPad, your phone and your laptop, instead of charging them with life-threatening coal-fired power.



Turn off the washing machine. Hand-wash your clothes.



Transportation generates about a third of global carbon dioxide emissions. Walking or cycling everywhere, including to and from school every day, as well as refusing to ever, ever take an overseas flight, would be one of the most effective personal actions these kids could take. Yet, less than 13% of students walk to school. As for long-haul flights:



Youth travel has become one of the fastest growing segments of international tourism, representing more than 23% of the over one billion tourists travelling internationally each year.



  
Meanwhile, the kiddies’ hysterical alarmism is badly distorting public policy and wasting trillions of dollars on useless green vanities.



[Bjorn Lomborg] “This year the world will spend $230 billion subsidising renewable energy … the Paris Agreement on climate change will cost the world from $US1 trillion to $US2 trillion a year by 2030.



“Astonishingly, neither of these hugely expensive policies will have any measurable impact on temperatures […]Doom and gloom distort our world view and can lead to bad policy. The future is bright and we need smart decisions to keep it so.”



So, climate strikers, instead of posing for happy snaps with buddies (and the sea of smiling faces posing for selfies at the climate strikes lead me to regard claims about “climate anxiety” with deep scepticism: these kids are clearly having the time of their lives), challenge your teachers and your “woke” elders to swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. Assuming that they even can.



It’s time we had a royal commission into what’s happening to our young people on this climate change issue. Let the apologists and the hoax brigade swear on oath the veracity of what they are preaching in the classroom.



It might be the only way to slow a few people down.



Our children are entitled to the truth and they are not getting it.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
As Anthony discussed here, some Australian climate scientists think that there was an “angry summer” in 2012. Inspired by the necromantic incantations in support of the Aussie claims coming from the irrepressible Racehorse Nick Stokes, I went to take a look at the Australian temperature data. I found out that in response to hosts of complaints about their prior work, in March of 2012 the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) released a new temperature database called ACORN-SAT. This clumsy acronym stands for the Australian Climate Observations Reference Network (overview here, data here)

It’s a daily dataset, which I like. And they seem to have learned something from Anthony Watts and the Surfacestation project, they have photos and descriptions and metadata for each individual station. Plus the data is well error-checked and vetted. The site says:

Expert review
All scientific work at the Bureau is subject to expert peer review. Recognising public interest in ACORN-SAT as the basis for climate change analysis, the Bureau initiated an additional international peer review of its processes and methodologies.
A panel of world-leading experts convened in Melbourne in 2011 to review the methods used in developing ACORN-SAT. It ranked the Bureau’s procedures and data analysis as amongst the best in the world.
and
Methods and development
Creating a modern homogenised Australian temperature record requires extensive scientific knowledge – such as understanding how changes in technology and station moves affect data consistency over time.
The Bureau of Meteorology’s climate data experts have carefully analysed the digitised data to create a consistent – or homogeneous – record of daily temperatures over the last 100 years.
As a result, I was stoked to find the collection of temperature records. So I wrote an R program and downloaded the data so I could investigate it. But when I had just gotten all the data downloaded started my investigation, in the finest climate science tradition, everything suddenly went pear-shaped.
What happened was that while researching the ACORN-SAT dataset, I chanced across a website with a post from July 2012, about four months after the ACORN-SAT dataset was released. The author made the surprising claim that on a number of days in various records in the ACORN-SAT dataset, the minimum temperature for the day was HIGHER than the maximum temperature for the day … oooogh. Not pretty, no.
Well, I figured that new datasets have teething problems, and since this post was from almost a year ago and was from just after the release of the dataset, I reckoned that the issue must’ve been fixed …
…
…
… but then I came to my senses, and I remembered that this was the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), and I knew I’d be a fool not to check. Their reputation is not sterling, in fact it is pewter … so I wrote a program to search through all the stations to find all of the days with that particular error. Here’s what I found:
Out of the 112 ACORN-SAT stations, no less than 69 of them have at least one day in the record with a minimum temperature greater than the maximum temperature for the same day. In the entire dataset, there are 917 days where the min exceeds the max temperature …
I absolutely hate findings like this. By itself the finding likely make almost no difference for most applications. These are daily datasets, with each station having around 100 years of data, 365 days per year, that means the whole dataset has about 4 million records, so the 917 errors are 0.02% if the data  … but it means that I simply can’t trust the results when I use the data. It means whoever put the dataset out there didn’t do their homework.
And sadly, that means that we don’t know what else they might not have done.
Once again, the issue is not that the ACORN-SAT dataset had these problems. All new datasets have things wrong with them.
The issue is that the authors and curators of the dataset have abdicated their responsibilities. They have had a year to fix this most simple of all the possible problems, and near as I can tell, they’ve done nothing about it. They’re not paying attention, so we don’t know whether their data is valid or not. Bad Australians, no Vegemite for them …
I must confess … this kind of shabby, “phone it in” climate science is getting kinda old …

"There was no time to lose when Cyclone Amphan began forming over the Indian Ocean in May. But shelters are not built with social distancing in mind in Bangladesh and the country faced a challenge: how to move 2.4 million people from the destructive path of the storm without delivering them into an even greater danger – Covid-19.   Mass evacuations are challenging at the best of times. People are reluctant to leave their homes unguarded. This time the challenge was far more complex. People were afraid to move to shelters for fear of the virus. First responders also had to make sure the evacuation itself was not a vector for contagion. In a matter of days, Bangladesh prepared almost 10,500 additional shelters – on top of the 4,171 in existence – to accommodate evacuees with a measure of social distancing. More than 70,000 “cyclone preparedness” volunteers across coastal areas were mobilised. Masks, water, soap and sanitiser were distributed. The garment industry, reeling from cancelled export orders, retooled production lines to manufacture personal protective equipment. Coming on top of the pandemic, a cyclone such as Amphan throws into sharp focus the interrelated nature of the climate and health risks facing mankind. In the US, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts this year’s hurricane season will be one for the record books due to unusually warm water temperatures in the Atlantic and Caribbean – a consequence of the climate emergency. As in Bangladesh, the task of keeping people safe across the southern US and the Caribbean will be immeasurably more complicated as a result of Covid-19. Bangladesh’s disaster preparedness, including a network of 55,000 first responders, meant Amphan killed fewer than 100 people in India and Bangladesh. While any death is regrettable, the country’s early-warning systems and well-rehearsed evacuation drills have saved hundreds of thousands of lives over the years. Rebuilding infrastructure and livelihoods, however, is another matter. Bangladesh has rebuilt in the wake of cyclones many times before. As one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to tropical storms – two-thirds of its land lies less than 5m above sea level – rebuilding is a Sisyphean task. The climate crisis makes it even harder. Cyclones are becoming fiercer and more frequent. Rising ocean levels are poisoning wells and farmland. The pandemic and resulting deep economic crisis mean that the government must now deal with overlapping health, climate and economic emergencies all at once.  Cyclone Amphan was the costliest on record in the north Indian Ocean, leaving destruction estimated at $13bn (£10.4m). In Bangladesh, it washed out 415km of roads, 200 bridges, tens of thousands of homes and vast tracts of farmland and fisheries. More than 150km of embankments meant to contain storm surges were damaged. This has been catastrophic, but planning makes countries better prepared when calamity strikes. It is not enough to deal with the immediate effects of a natural disaster; communities need to be better prepared for the next storm. The need to rebuild better led Bangladesh to enact a Climate Fiscal Framework in 2014, becoming the first country in the world to develop a multi-year, multi-sectoral approach to funding climate resilience. The framework includes estimates for the long-term costs of combating the effects and tracks climate-related expenditures across 20 government ministries, including agriculture, housing and energy, with multi-year budgets to match. This was followed in 2018 by an eight-decade climate adaptation plan for the delta region, home to 30 million people. The first decade of Delta Plan 2100 focuses on strengthening infrastructure, such as building higher embankments to resist storm surges. After Amphan, schools, hospitals and houses will need to be built back stronger, with increased resilience, so they can resist cyclones, and storm surges in coastal areas, doubling up as shelters when the next disaster hits. Across the world, Covid-19 is adding a huge strain to government finances, but we believe long-term fiscal frameworks and climate adaptation plans give nations better tools to respond. Health, economic and climate resilience are interrelated. That is why the Delta Plan also includes land and water management projects, and measures to make communities healthier and more resilient: for example, solar home kits that can be used to filter contaminated water to stop disease following every destructive storm. Bangladesh is unlikely to be the only country struggling with health, economic and climate emergencies this year. So international collaboration is vital: as countries we can learn from successes around the world and support each other. It’s by pulling together that we will emerge stronger and more resilient.

"A lawsuit filed by Melania Trump depicts her heightened profile as a “unique,     opportunity” to make millions of dollars in business, once again raising questions about the relationship between President Trump’s official role and his family’s business interests. Mrs. Trump’s suit, filed on Monday in a New York State court, accuses The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, of libel for reporting last year on claims that a modeling agency she worked for in the 1990s was also an escort service. The new complaint does not refer explicitly to the White House or Mr. Trump, or even her status as a candidate’s wife when the article was published and now as first lady. Instead, it refers to opportunities she had “to launch a   commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multimillion dollar business relationships for a multiyear term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world. ” Because of the Daily Mail article, it says, “plaintiff’s brand has lost significant value,” greatly reducing those opportunities. It claims $150 million in damages. A spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump said she was not trying to make money from her role as first lady. Mr. Trump has fended off criticism that his business dealings around the world create conflicts of interest in his official role, and he has put his adult sons in charge of his businesses rather than sell his assets or put them into a blind trust. On the day he took office, the White House altered its online biography of Mrs. Trump, after complaints that the original wording promoted her line of jewelry. The Daily Mail published its article on Mrs. Trump on Aug. 20, quoting from a report in a magazine in Slovenia, Mrs. Trump’s native country, and a book about her. She and her representatives have insisted that the claims it repeated are false. On Sept. 1, Mrs. Trump sued The Daily Mail in a state court in Montgomery County, Md. and on the same day, the tabloid published a retraction. Last week, the Maryland court dismissed the case, saying it did not have jurisdiction. The new case against Mail Media, a corporation that operates the Daily Mail’s website, was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, where the company has offices. Mrs. Trump also sued a Maryland blogger, Webster Tarpley, who published claims like those cited by The Daily Mail. She settled that case on Tuesday, and her lawyer, Charles J. Harder, said in a statement that Mr. Tarpley had agreed to pay Mrs. Trump “a substantial sum as a settlement. ”"

Several researchers have noted that the 11-year solar cycle does not show up in temperature or precipitation data. Most recently, Dr. David Evans has introduced his “notch filter” answer to the problem. I think the answer is much simpler.
The solar influence on earth has several components. The Total Solar Insolation (TSI), varies over the 11-year solar cycle by about 0.1%. Solar UV varies by much more, up to 10%, but those wavelengths carry much less energy than TSI, and affect only the top of the atmosphere. The solar wind has little energy, but influences the cosmic ray influx. Other influx, such as Forbush Events, from Coronal Mass Ejections (CME’s), have short term effects. These last two, the solar wind and Forbush Events, do not follow the solar cycle very closely, so tend not to show up in a time power spectrum of climate, or even of cosmic rays.
So why does the TSI cycle not show up in climate data? Because annual and daily changes completely drown out the signal. First, the earth’s orbit around the sun is not circular, but elliptical. We are closer to the sun during the northern hemisphere winter by 3.4% compared to the distance in the summer. Because the TSI varies by the square of the distance change, the change in TSI is 6.8% from summer to winter. This alone would make the 11-year 1% signal difficult to detect, but there are other, much large variations.

The earth is tilted on it’s axis by 23.5°. This causes a further variation in insolation even at the equator. At the equator, the annual variation is almost 12%, with the maximum occurring at the spring and fall equinoxes, and the minimum occurring on June 21st.
Figure 1: is the insolation seen at three different latitudes. Source here
At 40° latitude, this variation grows to over 100% around the average, and at 80° degrees, to over 200% around the average, including days of 24 hours of sunlight and more days of 24 hours of darkness.
Besides the large annual variations in insolation, there is the diurnal variation, night and day, with another signal that is nearly a square wave. But this isn’t all. The variation in clouds causes albedo changes that are nearly random, and imposed  on the above insolation curves. I say nearly random, because of solar effects on clouds due to changes in cosmic rays. But these effects have only small correlation with solar cycles.
So, a 0.1% TSI change on an 11-year cycle, is buried in the much larger annual orbital and axial tilt cycle, the diurnal cycle, as well as random albedo changes due to clouds. An analogy would be hearing the 50/60 Hertz power supply hum on your HiFi, while playing Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture, complete with cannons, at full volume.

"London’s Olympic Velodrome is opening to the public for the first time. The scene of great triumph for Team GB in the London 2012 Olympics, it should welcome droves of budding cyclists who hope to one day follow in the pedals of gold medallists like Sir Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott.  The velodrome’s re-opening forms part of the wider Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park redevelopment, which promises integrated spaces, affordable housing options, inclusive design and active lifestyle opportunities that would appeal to all walks. Yet, how will these benefits be realised and who will become connected (or disconnected) to these new spaces? London’s Olympic legacy is often spoken of in the vague, but neutral language of “the public good”. Whether that is in terms of the creation of new facilities, greater sport participation or economic benefits, it’s often assumed that these benefits will be universally applicable to all citizens. But a closer look at the way they are set up and marketed betrays certain gender and class-based assumptions. Take facilities like the velodrome – the Lee Valley VeloPark – that opens to the public today. It opens on a user-pays basis to encourage active community participation. But it could be a costly outing for keen adults (and families) who want to try a range of disciplines, with taster sessions for the track cycling at £30, road circuit, mountain bike trails and the re-designed Olympic BMX track all at £15 a pop.  While women are offered several specific taster sessions there are few images of female cyclists around the VeloPark, despite the Olympic and Paralympic role models of 2012 such as Victoria Pendleton and Sarah Storey. This lack of inclusiveness betrays how many of the London 2012 legacies have been redesigned in gendered ways that largely ignore the inequities different women face in sport or everyday life. Gendered assumptions are inherent in the spatial and commercial refashioning of London. For example, advertisements for the new Glasshouse Gardens development that overlook the Olympic Park predominantly feature women walking, shopping, talking, eating with friends, partners and children. Similarly, promotional brochures for the newly converted rental properties at East Village E20, formerly the Olympic Village, uses imagery that creates a brand almost exclusively marketed towards (middle-class) young women. These gender images portray consumption-focused lifestyles where women are assumed to have endless opportunities to enjoy these new urban spaces. Policy makers, urban developers and marketers are promoting the post-Olympic areas of urban renewal as “safe and secure” enclaves, offering desirable qualities for responsible, middle-class, new urban living. Shopping, lattes, leisurely lunches and dinners at Jamie’s Italian are to be enjoyed within close proximity. Yet, distance is maintained from existing communities, limiting the scope for social inclusion.   In accordance with Greater London’s development strategy, the idea is that crime will be eradicated through the design of new areas. Their gentrification creates public spaces that are overlooked by private apartments. The London Legacy Development Corporation who are in charge of transforming the Olympic Park have an urban planning strategy that is meant to reduce feelings of isolation and increase feelings of safety. Features of inclusive design are said to be particularly important for those most vulnerable to “hate crime” such as women, and who are concerned about freedom of movement at night.  Despite the policy of inclusive design the spatial organisation reflects a suspicion of “others” who may pose a threat to the safety of new residents. The association between women and fear is contrasted by the marketing of “safe living” choices in the new urban village, while the social issues connecting crime and inequality are situated beyond the gate. Separate entrances and gates clearly mark the boundaries between public and private territories and demarcate who belongs and who is excluded, despite the rhetoric of mixed private and public space. With the private sector investing heavily in London 2012’s urban renewal legacy, further discussions of how the space is privatised, as well as how these newly designed areas are used, managed and controlled is all the more important.  LandProp, the residential development and investment arm of IKEA, is solely responsible for the creation of the new Strand East community, a mixed-use neighbourhood emerging as one of the many products of post-London 2012 gentrification. IKEA’s involvement with the design and redevelopment of residential, commercial and leisure facilities surrounding the Olympic park, prompts a call to consider whether these developments are purposefully constructed for the same middle-class consumer target market that frequent their familiar department stores.  This reconstitution of urban space by private companies has become representative of an undemocratic approach towards the way our cities are governed. This approach welcomes those with the means into a privately owned and privately policed section of the nation’s capital. But those lacking them are not included. This kind of approach to urban planning presents a rather disturbing vision of London’s cityscape. The newly developed pockets of regeneration seem to be following a model of progression that moves further away from the promise of inclusivity outlined by the London 2012 Olympic legacy.  The way this vision is emerging in reality should be challenged through a review of the policy process, marketing strategies and built environment that currently encourage the encroachment of corporations. Plus, given the gendered nature of the legacy, questions arise about the way women become invisible within certain sporting contexts yet are made visible in other spheres of consumption. The visible, public projection of women in the Olympic legacy should not just play into stereotypes that suit its growing privatisation and targets a narrowly defined minority."
"**When the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March, couples preparing for their big day had to abruptly stop planning.**
Lockdown was eased in June and wedding ceremonies could take place again - but they were subject to strict conditions.
With cases of Covid-19 remaining at a higher level in Northern Ireland, there have been further changes to the rules for weddings, civil partnerships and receptions.
Here's a guide to the rules.
In Northern Ireland, the limit for guests is currently set at 25.
This number includes children under 12 and the officiant.
Guidance from the Executive Office states that indoor and outdoor ceremonies are allowed, but with strict conditions.
Hotels and other venues licensed for ceremonies had to close on 19 October as a result of new Covid-19 restrictions.
Places of worship and local government offices are still permitted for weddings.
In England, only 15 people can attend a ""Covid-secure venue"", in Scotland wedding ceremonies of up to 20 people can be held and in Wales, receptions of up to 30 people are allowed.
In the Republic of Ireland. In Dublin and Donegal, ceremonies can only take place with 25 guests.
The rules on gathering in people's homes changed in Northern Ireland on 22 September, making it illegal for more than six people from two households to meet in a private garden.
There is no exemption in the legislation for larger wedding and civil partnership ceremonies to take place in someone's garden.
However, in the circumstance that one of the couple is terminally ill, a ceremony inside a private home is allowed.
Hairdressers and make-up artists are often an important part of the day, but the coronavirus laws state that close contact services must close until 11 December.
Hair and beauty salons are also closed as of 27 November for two weeks, so cannot carry out services in their premises either.
A photographer or videographer can come to your home, so as long as they can maintain social distancing with no close contact, in line with a completed risk assessment.
No.
The Executive Office guidance says there is no expectation that the couple or their party must wear face masks during the ceremony or reception afterwards.
However, it adds that wearing face coverings in public and indoor places is strongly advised, especially where social distancing is difficult to maintain.
Anyone travelling by public transport to a wedding must wear a mask during their journey - with limited exemptions.
The advice says large groups should not form for the purposes of photographs unless social distancing can be adequately maintained.
The Executive Office says this depends on the venue.
Music - either live or pre-recorded - is permitted for ceremonies within a place of worship, however in venues where alcohol may be consumed, such as a hotel, community hall or marquee, live music is not allowed.
Recorded tracks are permitted.
As of 19 October, no wedding receptions or post-ceremony gatherings are allowed.
No-one can say for sure.
That depends what happens with the spread of the virus in Northern Ireland.
The Executive Office has deemed that indoor marriages and civil partnerships, in the context of Covid-19, must ""still be seen as carrying a serious risk""."
"**The Debenhams website has been overwhelmed by shoppers searching for bargains**after the department store chain collapsed **.**
The firm launched a stock clearance sale on Wednesday at 07:00 as non-essential retailers in England reopen after a four-week lockdown.
But high demand led to long, virtual queues of thousands and by mid morning the site had crashed altogether.
""We have been seeing unprecedented levels of visits,"" a spokesperson said.
In a bid to keep up with the additional demand, the retailer was forced to implement a queuing system for its website, which promised customers: ""We will get you onto the site as soon as possible.""
On Tuesday, the company spelled out how many shoppers were on its site, at one point queues stretched into many hundreds of thousands, but on Wednesday Debenhams was no longer displaying that information.
Some social media users reported as many as 900,000 other customers in the queue for the website.
The company had already been running a 14-day ""Black Friday"" sales event, with discounts of up to 70% from Wednesday onwards in-store and online across clothes and homeware.
For other customers, the website crashed completely on Tuesday evening, either before reaching the virtual queue or having reached the checkout stage for their purchases.
One social media user wrote that they had been given only 30 minutes to complete their shopping online.
""Only problem is once you get in there the homepage keeps crashing. No wonder they've gone bust,"" they wrote.
Twitter user Danielle Harmer said: ""Finally get onto the website, start adding to my basket and then an error message pops up saying my queue number has been rejected and I have to join the back of the queue again! Actually livid.""
All of Debenhams' 124 UK stores are set to close after the failure of last-ditch efforts to rescue the ailing store chain.
It means all 12,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs when the shops cease trading, unless the administrators do a deal for all of parts of the business.
Some social media users expressed sympathies for those staff members now facing uncertainty. Heather Angus wrote: ""If you're planning to go raid Debenhams with the announcement of them selling off stock, please be kind to their staff. This is awful.""
Debenhams had been in administration since April. It is now set to enter liquidation, also known as winding-up, which means it will cease to exist as a company.
The 242-year-old retailer had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May as it struggled to stay afloat.
Hopes of a rescue were crushed after the last remaining bidder for the company, JD Sports, withdrew.
There have been suggestions that JD Sports pulled out of bidding for Debenhams because of the collapse of Arcadia, which is the biggest concession operator in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales.
Tough trading during the coronavirus pandemic proved to be the final blow for both Debenhams and Arcadia, which employ more than 25,000 people between them.
Restructuring firm Hilco will start going into Debenhams stores on Wednesday to begin clearing stock.
Shoppers will still be able to buy items in-store and on the Debenhams website, until all of it is sold.
Anyone who has ordered something on the website, including during the Black Friday sales, should receive it. They should also be able to return these items, under the normal rules, within 14 days, if they do not want them.
The business is also accepting payment cards, such as gift cards. If the business is sold, these cards might continue to be valid.
However, if cards are unspent or items not delivered if Debenhams closes entirely, then shoppers may need to contact their bank, via the chargeback scheme, or their credit card provider (if they spent more than Â£100 on a single order) to get a refund."

From Andrew Montford, who points out the obvious (at least obvious to everyone else) when it comes to the “big oil” and “big coal” meme.


It’s extraordinary how this “massive campaign” by fossil fuel interests has gone almost entirely undocumented. There is, to the best of my knowledge, virtually no evidence to support the claim at all. It is something of an indictment of the standards in academia that this kind of conspiracy theorising goes unremarked and entirely unchallenged.

"Warming in the Arctic has now reached the northernmost sections of the Greenland ice sheet. After a long period of stability (more than 25 years), we have found in a new study of the region that the northeast section of the ice sheet is no longer stable. This means global sea levels may rise even faster than was previously anticipated.  The Greenland ice sheet is a vast body of ice covering roughly 80% of the surface of Greenland. The northeast portion has one of the longest ice streams (rivers of ice) and drains a huge area. It was previously thought to be very cold and therefore stable. Our new study shows how, over the past eight years, it has actually lost an increasing amount of ice. Satellite images show that the ice loss rate here is now the second largest in Greenland – only exceeded by the Jakobshavn Glacier. This means that other models have underestimated the total mass loss and thus Greenland’s future contributions to global sea level change. To date, calculations of future rises in sea levels have not accounted for the large contribution of ice flowing into the ocean from this part of Greenland. Published in Nature Climate Change, our new study points out this mis-prediction. Many modelling approaches used to assess future sea level rises have suggested that the northeastern sector of the ice sheet is relatively stable and therefore not contributing to any significant ice mass loss. They have used data from the last decade to model the Greenland ice sheet’s contribution to sea level rise by 2100, but they assume no mass loss in northeast Greenland, which is incorrect. Our study used a combination of old aerial photographs from 1978, and modern satellite observations to measure the thinning of Greenland’s glaciers. Together, they show that the thinning from 1978 to 2003 in the northeast was very limited. But, since 2006 there has clearly been a sustained mass loss in this section.  This increased loss is due to a combination of warmer summer air temperatures and warmer sea temperatures. This regional warming has reduced the extent of sea ice around the ice sheet, which has a stabilising effect on the glacier margins.  Unlike other large glaciers in Greenland, the Northeast ice sheet has an ice stream, which reaches more than 600km directly into its interior. This implies that changes at the marginal can affect the mass balance deep in the centre of the ice sheet. The fact that this ice loss is associated with a major ice stream that channels ice from deep in the interior of the ice sheet does add additional concern about what might happen. Due to the huge size of the Northeast Greenland ice stream, it has the potential to significantly change the total balance of the ice sheet overall in the near future. The fact that the overall decline of the Greenland ice sheet has generally increased over the past few decades is well known. But the increasing contribution from the very cold northeastern part of the ice sheet during the last seven to eight years is new and very surprising. Over the past decade the front of the glacier has retreated by about 20km from the coast. This compares with a 35km retreat of the Jakobshavn glacier in warmer, western Greenland over the last 150 years. The Greenland ice sheet has contributed more than any other ice mass to sea-level rise over the past two decades. It accounts for an increase in average levels around the world of 0.5mm per year, out of a total increase of 3.2mm per year. If completely melted, the ice sheet has the potential to raise global sea level by more than seven metres."
"BIRMINGHAM, England  —   On Saturday night at the Genting Arena here, a billowing white curtain whipped up and into the ceiling to reveal the singer Ozzy Osbourne, who, for perhaps the last time ever as the frontman of Black Sabbath, plunged into the 1970 song that gave the band its name. The track kicked off the final concert on a tour called “The End,” which the   band has billed as its last performances. After 49 years, the group  —   which formed here in 1968 and has had dramatic ups and downs and a rotating roster of members  —   finally threw in the towel with a hometown concert. “Let’s go crazy,” Mr. Osbourne yelled to the crowd, adding an expletive early in the concert, before turning in thrashing renditions of the band’s   songs, including “War Pigs,” “Into the Void” and “Iron Man,” and deeper cuts like the instrumental “Rat Salad. ” Fans and members of the news media were buzzing before the concert with rumors of possible antics and surprises  —   perhaps even an appearance by the original drummer, Bill Ward, estranged from the group since 2012. But Black Sabbath played it straight, turning in almost two hours of its earliest 1960s and ’70s songs, pretty much unadulterated (but, of course, quite loud). Flanked by the original band members Tony Iommi (on guitar) and Geezer Butler (on bass) and backed by Tommy Clufetos, a younger drummer who rejoined them for the tour, Mr. Osbourne stood center stage and clutched the microphone, undulating back and forth as he sang. There were pyrotechnics for the big numbers, confetti at the end, and at one point a surprise volley of fireworks onstage. Giant black and purple balloons spilled from the ceiling in the penultimate song, and bounced around the arena for the rest of the night. Nearly a   ago, Black Sabbath began as a blues band. It quickly morphed into its own genre. In the band’s early years, its   anthems and vague overtures toward Satanism in its lyrics earned them ridicule from mainstream critics and audiences while mobilizing a growing underground fan base. Mr. Osbourne gained a reputation as a forbidding figure who embraced hard living, and gained notoriety for biting off the head of a real bat during a 1982 concert. But Mr. Osbourne’s fame underwent a surprising shift when he began starring in the 2002 MTV reality TV show “The Osbournes,” which portrayed him as a lovable, murmuring goofball and family man. And at its closing concert, Black Sabbath seemed pretty mainstream. On Saturday, the crowd was dotted with   fans decked out in    Black Sabbath regalia. But most concertgoers wore their fandom more lightly: One man in a Black Sabbath shirt who declined to give his name said that he worked in financial services in London and read an issue of The Economist in the moments before the lights went down. By the time Mr. Osbourne hit the climax of “Black Sabbath,” the magazine was tucked away and the man was on his feet with his hands raised in the shape of devil’s horns, singing gleefully along to the lyrics: “Satan’s sitting there, he’s   those flames get higher and higher. ” The band has always identified as rough and tumble, alternative, working class and distinctly Birminghamian, so the hometown concert had special resonance for some in the audience on Saturday. “Black Sabbath are part of the cultural identity of being in Birmingham,” said Pamela Pinski, 31, who lives and works in the area. Coming to the concert, she added, felt “kind of patriotic to the city,” and like a chance to celebrate “local boys that done good. ” In interviews, the band members have insisted that “The End”  —   which began in Omaha just over a year ago and made stops in Europe, South America and Australia before coming to Britain last month  —   really is their last run. Mr. Iommi, who learned he had cancer several years ago, told Rolling Stone that his “body won’t take it much more. ” And Mr. Osbourne said in a recent interview with the BBC, “This is definitely it. ” Mr. Osbourne has said goodbyes to music before, though, so you could forgive fans for not taking him entirely at his word: In 1992, he went on a farewell tour that he billed as his swan song. Three years later, he was on the road again. Outside the arena, Errol Lynch, 45, was one of several fans who said he thought the band had more in store. “Two years down the line, they’ll say, ‘Let’s put our problem behind us,’” he said, adding that even if the band wouldn’t tour again, “they will do an odd festival. ” Mr. Lynch, originally from Ireland, was in Birmingham to see the group for the third time in the space of a week. (Mr. Osbourne, who has performed with other bands and as a solo act, and who was estranged from Black Sabbath through much of the 1980s and ’90s, has at least one solo date planned for this summer, in Illinois.) Mr. Osbourne had said that he was feeling emotional in the   to Saturday’s concert, but he gave only a fleeting farewell speech, marveling at “what a journey we’ve all had. ” Several times throughout the night he thanked the audience, and at one point he got down on his knees and bowed. When the last song, “Paranoid,” ended, he blew a kiss, took some final bows, then stopped to have his picture taken with his bandmates before loping off the stage. In the arena lobby after the concert, Mike King, 32, who had traveled from San Francisco, said that he ranked the show among Black Sabbath’s better recent performances. “I’m really, really, really going to miss them,” he said, adding, “Once they’re gone, that’s it. ”"
"**The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination.**
Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out.
The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs.
Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff.
But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted.
A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported.
The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people.
The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday.
Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored.
Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales.
The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better.""
There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it.
But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different.
When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it.
From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000.
That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted.
Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first.
This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital.
It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it.
While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.""
Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable.
The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK:
Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now.
It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available.
NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"".
But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation.
""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty.
The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government.
Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021.
Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue.
The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose.
Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group.
The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said.
The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut.
Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.
Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp.
""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today.""
The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing.
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials.
Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice.
Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours.
Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed:
The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"".
He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme ""the vaccine will only start to dent the size of the pandemic somewhat later in the year""."
"Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen strongly to a new peak this year, despite the impact of the global effects of the coronavirus crisis. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere reached 417.2 parts per million in May, 2.4ppm higher than the peak of 414.8ppm in 2019, according to readings from the Mauna Loa observatory in the US. Without worldwide lockdowns intended to slow the spread of Covid-19, the rise might have reached 2.8ppm, according to Ralph Keeling, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He said it was likely they had played a small role, but that the difference was too small to show up against other factors causing year-to-year fluctuations. “People may be surprised to hear that the response to the coronavirus outbreak hasn’t done more to influence CO2 levels,” he said. “But the buildup of CO2 is a bit like trash in a landfill. As we keep emitting, it keeps piling up. The crisis has slowed emissions, but not enough to show up perceptibly at Mauna Loa. What will matter much more is the trajectory we take coming out of this situation.” Daily emissions of carbon dioxide fell by an average of about 17% around the world in early April, according to the a comprehensive study  last month. As lockdowns are eased, however, the fall in emissions for the year as a whole is only likely to be only between 4% and 7% compared with 2019. That will make no appreciable difference to the world’s ability to meet the goals of the Paris agreement, and keep global heating below the threshold of 2C that scientists say is necessary to stave off catastrophic effects. If emissions reductions of 20% to 30% were sustained for six to 12 months, then the rate of increase of CO2 measured at Mauna Loa would slow, according to the Scripps scientists. This year’s rise is slightly weaker than last year’s, but matches the average annual rise for the past decade. The amount of carbon fluctuates based on various factors, including the effects of the El Niño weather system in the Pacific. Carbon dioxide tends to peak each year in late May, when the impacts of the northern hemisphere spring have yet to take effect, so the month’s data is compared from year to year. Measurements have been taken continuously at the remote Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since 1958, providing vital information for climate scientists. The latest data comes from Scripps scientists at the University of California San Diego and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They found that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere first rose above 400ppm in 2014. The annual rate of growth in emissions has been speeding up. In the 1960s, the annual growth averaged about 0.8ppm, doubling to 1.6ppm a year in the 1980s and remaining steady at 1.5ppm in the 1990s. The average growth rate increased to about 2.0ppm a year in the 2000s, and has risen further to about 2.4ppm during the last decade. Environmental campaigners said the continued rise in emissions showed how urgently a green recovery from Covid-19 crisis was needed. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, called on the British government to do more as hosts of the next UN climate talks, Cop26, now postponed until 2021. “Just a few months of lower emissions were never likely to make a dent in the hundreds of billions tonnes of carbon that have built up over a century and a half of burning fossil fuels,” he said. “That’s why the drop in emissions caused by the pandemic will remain just a blip unless governments get serious about building a cleaner, healthier and safer world.” Muna Suleiman, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “ It’s clear that climate breakdown isn’t a distant idea, it’s here right now, and we have to treat it like the emergency it is.”"

A paper published Tuesday in the Journal of Climate finds tiny variations in solar activity over 11-year solar cycles have greatly amplified effects upon climate via changes in the Arctic Oscillation, North Pacific sea surface temperatures & sea level pressure, and via changes in stratospheric ozone from solar UV. The authors find the Arctic Oscillation evolves from a negative mode a few years before solar maximums to a positive mode at and following solar maximums. The IPCC claims the tiny variations in solar activity during solar cycles cannot affect climate, but this paper and many others demonstrate solar activity has greatly amplified effects upon climate via ocean oscillations, atmospheric oscillations such as the Madden-Julian oscillation and Quasi-biennial oscillation, stratospheric ozone, and sunshine hours/clouds.
Here is the paper:

The Surface Climate Response to 11-Yr Solar Forcing During Northern Winter: Observational Analyses and Comparisons With GCM Simulations
Abstract
The surface climate response to 11-yr solar forcing during northern winter is first re-estimated by applying a multiple linear regression (MLR) statistical model to Hadley Centre sea level pressure (SLP) and sea surface temperature (SST) data over the 1880-2009 period. In addition to a significant positive SLP response in the North Pacific found in previous studies, a positive SST response is obtained across the midlatitude North Pacific. Negative but insignificant SLP responses are obtained in the Arctic. The derived SLP response at zero lag therefore resembles a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Evaluation of the SLP and SST responses as a function of phase lag indicates that the response evolves from a negative AO-like mode a few years before solar maximum to a positive AO-like mode at and following solar maximum. For comparison, a similar MLR analysis is applied to model SLP and SST data from a series of simulations using an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. The simulations differed only in the assumed solar cycle variation of stratospheric ozone. It is found that the simulation that assumed an ozone variation estimated from satellite data produces solar SLP and SST responses that are most consistent with the observational results, especially during a selected centennial period. In particular, a positive SLP response anomaly is obtained in the northeastern Pacific and a corresponding positive SST response anomaly extends across the midlatitude North Pacific. The model response versus phase lag also evolves from a mainly negative AO-like response before solar maximum to a mainly positive AO response at and following solar maximum.

Dr. Ryan Maue posted one of his WeatherBell analysis maps on Twitter today, and the result is no Headline maker, it is simply “normal”.
He writes (image follows): 
February 2013 global temperature anomaly compared to 1981-2010 mean: -0.001°C or 1/1000th of a degree below avg.

It will be interesting to see what the other climate data sources show for February.

"Britain needs a green job-filled recovery from the coronavirus crisis. Unlike Germany and South Korea, it is far from clear that we will get one. While Berlin and Seoul are retooling their fossil fuel-reliant economies to be greener and cleaner, the UK has yet to announce a policy that deals with the environmental emergency and the spectre of mass unemployment. Unless a vaccine for coronavirus is found soon, Britain faces a surge in joblessness at the end of October, when all forms of wage support stop. The size of this spike in unemployment will determine how long it is before we may return to normal. Currently, 12 million people are covered by the job retention scheme for furloughed workers and its equivalent for the self-employed. There are few takers for the idea that there will be a sharp bounce-back to business as usual.  Torsten Bell, who worked in the Treasury when the financial crash struck in 2008 and now runs the Resolution Foundation thinktank, told MPs on the Treasury select committee that if unemployment hits 10%, which is about what the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates, it would take at least seven years to return to where we were before the pandemic struck. If none of the workers being supported by wage subsidies get their jobs back, it could take decades to return to normal. Sustained unemployment imposes significant economic, personal and social costs: joblessness leads to ill health and reduced life expectancy, and to the undermining of human relations and family life. The state has been playing the role of “insurer of last resort” to keep the economy running, so that it can be restarted once the emergency has passed. A physically distanced economy will be different to the carefree one we were used to. The furlough scheme has helped lower-paid and part-time staff, and it is hard to see all of these workers returning to their roles in the leisure, travel and hospitality sectors. Yet Boris Johnson was wrong to suggest earlier this month that “many, many job losses” were inevitable. This will only happen if policy choices do not change. The answer to large-scale layoffs is for the public sector to create jobs, especially in those regions where there will be no or few openings, and for such a scheme to be designed to recast the economy in an environmentally sustainable way. Large public spending could transform the economy with an industrial base that would be net zero in carbon emissions. The harm from climate change is not as immediately obvious as that of the pandemic, but it is bigger and longer-lasting. There are encouraging reports that the Treasury is looking at a “green industrial revolution” to create jobs for those made redundant through the economic fallout from the pandemic. But where’s the beef? Leaving lockdown will not be inherently climate-friendly. Mr Johnson must make it so by decoupling future economic activity from carbon emissions and ecological destruction."
"**John was 40 when his relationship broke down. He had been with his partner for 15 years and they had bought a house together, but it didn't work out.**
He carried on with life, working for the insurance company he had worked at for decades, seeing friends and family - but he felt like something was missing.
Then one night, six years later, he was flicking through the TV channels and landed on a programme about single women adopting children.
""It just sparked my interest, really,"" he explained.
""I had always thought I'd be a dad. But I thought it would happen naturally really, but time went on and I had been single for a few years.
""I started to feel like, 'I'm 46 now, time's ticking on a bit, if I want to be a dad it's now or never'.""
He is one of a growing number of men embarking on fatherhood alone.
John, who adopted before the pandemic, phoned his local adoption services department, the Vale, Valley and Cardiff Adoption Service.
After a three-day ""warts and all"" training course, John decided adoption was the route for him.
But social services were concerned he might not have enough experience with children, so for six months he volunteered to mentor a teenager.
""After that we got back into the process - every fortnight or three weeks I had a meeting with my social worker who went through lots of scenarios with me: 'What would you do if this happened? What would you do if that happened?',"" John recalled.
""He met my ex-partner and my other family members to find out more about me and see if it was a solid environment I could provide.""
In 2011, after a three-year process, John was approved by an adoption panel, who decide whether potential adopters are suitable. The next week his social worker came round.
""I went into the kitchen to make a cup of tea, by the time I came back into the lounge he had four photos of boys laid out on the table for me to look at and said 'do any of these strike your interest?'
""Immediately one stood out to me - he is now my son.""
John said he found it difficult to describe the feeling to someone who had not been through the adoption process, but said it was ""like when you're looking for a house and you walk into a house, and you get the feeling that this is the house you want"".
""It's not a great comparison but that's the nearest I can get to it,"" he added.
The photograph John had settled upon was of six-year-old Chris, not his real name, who had been with foster carers for 18 months after being put up for adoption because of concerns he was not being looked after properly.
John met Chris's social worker, then his foster mother and finally - five months later - Chris himself.
""Ten days later he had moved in with me. And that was it,"" John said.
Overnight John had become a dad - and he said it was a big change for both of them.
""It was a bit of a culture shock. You go from being on your own for a certain amount of time and all of a sudden you've got someone there to look after.
""On the first night everything was fine, quite exciting and everything. But on the second evening he went to bed and was crying and he was like, 'I don't like it, I want to go back'.
""My heart sank, I was like 'what do I do, what do I do?'""
Unable to get hold of his social worker that night, John struggled to sleep, worrying whether this was the right thing for Chris.
But the next morning, his social worker called him back.
""He said 'it's fine, it's just a normal reaction, just carry on and see how things go'. And after that he was fine.""
Interest in adoption has gone up ""significantly"" during the coronavirus pandemic, according to Suzanne Griffiths, of Wales' National Adoption Service.
The service had around 250 more enquiries in the first six months of 2020-2021 compared to the same period in 2019-2020 - an increase of more than a quarter.
""Families have had time to think about what's important to them and we believe that's influenced the increase in interest,"" she said.
Although very few single men adopt each year - the numbers are in ""single figures"" in Wales - she said there had been a bit more interest in the last two years.
She added: ""Some of the traditional stereotypes about the role of women being mothers, care-givers and the people that look after children are changing.""
Nine years on, Chris is now a teenager and John says they are a tight family unit.
""It's great for me because I've been a dad and that's what I wanted.
""And it's great for him because I've given him a better opportunity than he would have had.
""It's given me a purpose really, I suppose.
""I just want him to be the best he can be really. What I'm looking for, for him, is to be a good person and to do the best he can with his life and I've played a small part in helping him have a better life than he would have maybe.
""He'd probably say I'm a good dad, apart from banning him from his Xbox and making him do his school work.
""But that's just normal teenage boys isn't it? That's what he is. He's not an adopted boy of mine, he's a normal teenage son.""

As I [reported recently](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/union-goes-nuclear-on-albanese/), nuclear energy is emerging as yet another issue on which the Labor party is moving further and further from its blue-collar base. One of Australia’s biggest unions, the Australian Worker’s Union is advocating that Australia drop its sanctions and adopt nuclear power.



A new survey shows that a majority of Australians agree.



A narrow majority of 51% (up 16% since July 2011) of respondents say Australia should develop nuclear power to reduce Australia’s carbon dioxide emissions. Just over a third 34% (down 24%) say no, Australia shouldn’t, while 15% (up 8%) can’t say.



Much of this support is specifically down to the issue of climate change. Many Australians realise that “renewable” energy just isn’t up to the task of powering a modern, affluent society. If Australians want to go carbon-neutral and still remain a modern society, nuclear is the only viable present option.



However, without the reference to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, only 45% (up 11% since March 2011) of respondents say Australia should develop nuclear power plants to supply electricity to Australians while 40% (down 21%) say no, Australia shouldn’t, and 15% (up 10%) can’t say.



The NIMBY factor is also coming into play.



If Australia were to develop nuclear power plants a majority of 58% (down 17% since March 2011) of respondents would oppose a nuclear power plant being built in their area while 42% (up 17%) wouldn’t oppose. Of those who wouldn’t oppose 23% (up 10%) would be anxious about the nuclear power plant being built and 19% (up 7%) would agree to it being built in their area.



What really stands out, though, is the gender divide. It’s no surprise, perhaps, that protest groups so often seem to be dominated by frightbats and nosey-nannas.



Support [for nuclear power] is driven by men (65% support) rather than women (38% support).



This same gender split is replicated on all the questions asked as part of this survey…



Gary Morgan, Executive Chairman, Roy Morgan says:



“Australian views on nuclear power have changed significantly over the last eight years with a majority of 51% now supporting the development of nuclear power in Australia to reduce carbon dioxide emissions – up a significant 16ppts from July 2011…[The] stark divide between the two sexes indicates the difficulty facing any policy-maker attempting to develop an on-shore nuclear power industry in Australia. The issues surrounding nuclear power are incredibly divisive – even within households.”



At the same time, other surveys show that women are more likely than men to fret about climate change. Which begs the question: why won’t they support the one energy generation technology we have which can keep the lights on and emissions low?



Far easier to glue yourself to a road and frighten a few schoolchildren, I guess.

Guest post by Paul Homewood

http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/mar/27/climate-change-model-global-warming
The Mail on Sunday ran an article by David Rose a couple of weeks ago, pointing out just how woeful most climate models had been in predicting global temperatures in the last decade or so. Added to other media reports in recent months, the public at large, at least in the UK. are now gradually becoming aware that temperatures have flatlined for several years.
Desperate to counter this, the Guardian have reported on some work by Myles Allen, Professor of Geosystem Science at Oxford University. They report:-

Forecasts of global temperature rises over the past 15 years have proved remarkably accurate, new analysis of scientists’ modelling of climate change shows.
The debate around the accuracy of climate modelling and forecasting has been especially intense recently, due to suggestions that forecasts have exaggerated the warming observed so far – and therefore also the level warming that can be expected in the future. But the new research casts serious doubts on these claims, and should give a boost to confidence in scientific predictions of climate change.
The paper, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature Geoscience, explores the performance of a climate forecast based on data up to 1996 by comparing it with the actual temperatures observed since. The results show that scientists accurately predicted the warming experienced in the past decade, relative to the decade to 1996, to within a few hundredths of a degree.
The forecast, published in 1999 by Myles Allen and colleagues at Oxford University, was one of the first to combine complex computer simulations of the climate system with adjustments based on historical observations to produce both a most likely global mean warming and a range of uncertainty. It predicted that the decade ending in December 2012 would be a quarter of degree warmer than the decade ending in August 1996 – and this proved almost precisely correct. 
The new research also found that, compared to the forecast, the early years of the new millennium were somewhat warmer than expected. More recently the temperature has matched the level forecasted very closely, but the relative slow-down in warming since the early years of the early 2000s has caused many commentators to assume that warming is now less severe than predicted. The paper shows this is not true.
   
These claims raise a number of issues, but let’s start by looking at the actual numbers. Plotted below are the annual HADCRUT4 anomalies, (based on y/e August, in line with Allen’s workings).

The decade averages, as indicated by the red lines, have increased from 0.196C to 0.467C, so on the face of it, Allen’s prediction was spot on. But we need to delve a little deeper.
1) Let’s start by making a general observation. The Guardian suggest that the results of this one model somehow vindicate climate modelling in general. This is clearly a nonsense, as we will see later, as is their claim that it “should give a boost to confidence in scientific predictions of climate change”
2) The article also talks about “the relative slow-down in warming since the early years of the early 2000s”. This is more nonsense – warming has not “slowed down”, it has stopped.
3) The first thing to notice about Allen’s prediction is just how low it was, compared with most other models. His forecast of 0.25C warming in 16 years equates to about 1.5C/century, well below other predictions. We’ll compare a couple later.
4) His starting point, the 10 years ending 1996 were, of course, affected by Pinatubo. The years 1992-94 were about 0.15C lower than the years before and after, so it is reasonable to assume the decadal average was about 0.04C lower as a result. In other words, about a sixth of Allen’s prediction of a 0.25C increase is no more than a rebound from Pinatubo.
5) As there was warming between 1986 and 1996, the temperatures at the end of that decade were already higher than the decadal mean. The average of 1995/96 was 0.07C higher than the decadal mean. In other words, part of Allen’s predicted increase between 1996 and 2012 had already occurred before 1996.
6) By the time the paper was written in 1999, Allen, of course, already knew that temperatures had climbed significantly since 1996, with the average of 1997 and 98 being 0.46C. Remember that his model predicted a figure of 0.45C for the decade to 2012, (0.196C + 0.250C).
I wonder why we were not told then that there would be no net warming for the next 13 years?
7) Although the model has, fortuitously, accurately predicted the temperature to 2012, this does not mean that it has been validated. The lack of warming for at least 10 years is a significant feature, and any model that fails to predict this cannot be said to be validated. It is ludicrous to posit that it “should give a boost to confidence in scientific predictions of climate change”. 
8) As I mentioned, many other models forecast much more rapid rates of warming. The Met Office’s decadal forecast in 2007, for instance, which predicted global temperatures in 2012 would be 0.60C higher than 1996.

http://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/met-office-decadal-forecast2007-version/
9) Or Hansen’s famous 1988 model, that predicted more than a degree of warming, even under Scenario B.

http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k247/dhm1353/Climate%20Change/HansenvUAH.png
Conclusion
Contrary to the Guardian’s claims, Myles Allen’s work does not indicate vindicate climate modelling in general, nor does it inspire confidence in current predictions.
Furthermore, Allen’s work fails to explain why temperatures have flatlined in the last ten years, and why his original model did not predict it. More importantly, it has nothing to say about what this pause means for temperatures during the next decade.
But you would not expect to hear any of this from the Guardian.

"**The UK has become the first country in the world to approve mass use of a Covid vaccine for people aged 16 and over.**
Immunisations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, approved by the British medicines regulator, the MHRA, could start early next week for people in some high-priority groups, with 800,000 doses arriving in the UK in the first delivery.
**When will I get a vaccine?**
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has advised that people are given the vaccine in the following order, although there is likely to be some overlap between groups:
The complex logistics of distributing the vaccine mean that hospitals, which have the large-scale storage required at freezing temperatures, will act as vaccination hubs at the start, and NHS staff are likely to be protected first.
The priority groups cover 90-99% of those at risk of dying from Covid-19, according to the JCVI.
The older you are, the higher your risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from the virus - and that risk rises sharply beyond 70. People with underlying health conditions are also vulnerable to the virus.
After these nine priority groups, there will be a second phase of vaccination for younger groups in the population.
Local NHS and public health teams will be given some flexibility to allocate vaccines to other at-risk groups, including people from ethnic backgrounds and deprived communities.
People will be vaccinated twice - 21 days apart - and immunity starts seven days after the second dose.
You'll be invited to book an appointment to get a vaccine as soon as it's your turn, probably by letter.
In England, more than 1,000 GP surgeries will act as local vaccination centres, and sports stadiums and conference centres will act as major vaccination hubs.
The first doses are likely to be given via 50 hospital hubs next week, which means healthcare staff and patients will probably be immunised first, followed by care home residents.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the first vaccines will be administered on Tuesday in Scotland.
Northern Ireland will receive 25,000 doses next week and NHS staff have been told they will be vaccinated on 14 December, although this could be brought forward.
The roll-out of the vaccine in Wales will start in a matter of days.
The NHS is recruiting 30,000 volunteers to help with the rollout, including lifeguards, airline staff and students - who will be trained to give the jabs.
No - this vaccine is being rolled out free to people via the NHS.
You can't jump the queue by paying for it, but there should be plenty of vaccine to go round.
If you're eligible for a flu vaccine, you should get it as soon as possible, particularly if you will also be in a high-risk priority group for a Covid jab.
Having both infections at once this winter could be dangerous.
At its last meeting, the JCVI recommended leaving at least seven days between the vaccines.
The UK medicines regulator does not authorise any vaccine unless it believes it is safe.
The MHRA assesses all the data, ensures a vaccine works and that all the necessary trials and checks have been completed.
It studies:
It is doing this as quickly as possible without cutting corners, because these vaccines are a priority.
Drug companies making the vaccines have continually been sending trial data to the regulator for review, which has also shortened the process.
The MHRA also seeks advice from another independent body, the Commission on Human Medicines, before advising the government on a potential vaccine.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the fastest ever to go from concept to reality, taking just 10 months.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca team has now sent all the data on its vaccine to the MHRA for approval, and other vaccine developers will follow.
In the event the UK has a choice, the JCVI would advise on which vaccine should be used for different groups of people.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is the first to be approved in the UK, is being manufactured and distributed from Belgium.
The vaccine will be packed in specially-designed ""thermoboxes"" containing dry ice, and transported to the UK by lorry or plane.
It will go straight to major hospitals to be stored at freezing temperatures of about -70C, which is required to keep the vaccine stable.
It can only be moved once from there, and must be kept in batches of 1,000 doses.
At that point, it's a race against time - they can be kept at fridge temperatures (2-8C) for five days and up to six hours in a cool bag to enable them to be taken to care homes and other sites.
The first batch of 800,000 doses is expected to arrive in the UK in the coming days.
The eventual aim is that as many people as possible over the age of 16 receive a Covid-19 vaccine.
If everyone over 16 in the UK is offered one, that would be more than 50 million people - a huge challenge.
There is no timeframe on this momentous task, but it's clear that's the long-term plan in 2021.
The NHS has plenty of experience delivering vaccines to huge numbers of people, for example this winter's flu jab should reach 30 million.
A Covid vaccine won't be compulsory though - no other vaccines in the UK are, and experts say this approach doesn't help create confidence in the vaccine.
At present, the government has ordered seven different types of vaccine and expects to receive 355 million doses, including 100 million of the Oxford/AstraZeneca one.
If everyone needs two doses, that would certainly be enough for every adult in the UK."
"“An idea is a good thing,” Ken Downing, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, said on Tuesday, as he bolted in his biker jacket and skinny jeans from one show to another. “But a theme can scare me running away. ” Despite everyone’s best efforts to shut out the world beyond New York Fashion Week: Men’s, a unifying theme emerged: the parlous state of current politics. It didn’t matter that the visitors to the Skylight Clarkson North event space in Lower Manhattan, where most of the shows were held, tried to drink away their worries at the cozy VIP Amazon Lounge or escaped into chatter about Alejandro Gómez Palomo, a young Spanish designer who shocked the front row with a show featuring men in frilly frocks or talked about the head of Ralph Lauren being unceremoniously shoved into the oubliette. Of the dozens of designers interviewed during a   marathon that ended on Thursday, not one failed to volunteer some expression of concern, anxiety, perplexity or stark anger about the barrage of executive orders, tweets and statements recently issued from the White House. “It’s hitting people like a dagger in the heart,” the designer John Varvatos said moments before his best men’s wear show in years, at the Diamond Horseshoe nightclub in Midtown. Mr. Varvatos was referring to President Trump’s order banning the entry of citizens from seven   nations and refugees from any country. “People are in disbelief,” Mr. Varvatos said. “Half the people in my company are from someplace else. ” So, it would seem, are half the personnel in the industry. Consider the major designers anchoring a men’s wear fashion week now in its fourth iteration and gaining strength in terms of its offerings and the breadth of representation. Mr. Varvatos, for example, is a   American whose parents migrated from Greece and settled in Detroit. The   Ralph Lauren is the son of Askhenazi Jewish immigrants from Belarus. Raised in South Boston, Joseph Abboud was born in the United States to Maronite Christian parents who, seeking greater opportunity, fled Lebanon for America. Even the virtuosic   Raf Simons  —   whose finely calibrated collection of satiny topcoats, boxy jackets and slouchy woolens was shown on Wednesday night  —   has only recently transposed his    label to New York, where he also serves as chief creative officer of Calvin Klein. Notably, Mr. Simons chose as the locale for his debut on these shores a Gagosian Gallery, which is run by the   art world powerhouse Larry Gagosian, a California native whose grandparents were immigrants from Armenia. It is not only the big guns who can boast of a hyphenated heritage. The Ovadia twins, Ariel and Shimon, moved to Brooklyn from Israel in the early 1990s. The slick show they presented on Tuesday to an audience peppered with   stars and athletes was inspired, as Ariel said backstage, by a soccer obsession they share with their father, a man who got his start in the garment business selling children’s wear from the back of a   Oldsmobile. A relative newcomer to fashion, Willy Chavarria presented a sublimely deadpan collection on Thursday that he titled “Brown Power” and showed on a group of   models that included a young trans woman and a Honduran food deliveryman. The clothes were inspired, Mr. Chavarria said, by Chicano youths in California towns like the one in the San Joaquin Valley where he was raised, a son of Mexican immigrants who worked in the agricultural fields. “The political moment is hard,” Mr. Chavarria said, over the   din of recorded   at his presentation. “But it’s also a call to action for a generation that maybe got a little lazy. It’s up to us now to be harder ourselves  —   to love harder, to fight harder, to come hard with our ideas. ” Ideas, as Mr. Downing said, are good things. And, as it happened, the week was rife with them. There were Mr. Chavarria’s supersize denim trousers, his   coats of fur or washable alpaca, his knit caps discreetly embroidered with a rebuke to hate speech too coarse to be printed here and his athletic sweatshirts emblazoned with the timely: “Gender Bender Super Bawl Champions. ” There were Mr. Simons’s innovative, oversize intarsia sweaters, developed in collaboration with the Woolmark Company, featuring hems that rode up at the back, kangaroo pockets on the chest and, in some cases, a vaguely ambivalent interpretation of Milton Glaser’s “I ♥ NY” logo. There was a Ralph Lauren Purple Label collection that gave scant indication that his company is in the midst of what one analyst called “brand confusion. ” Seldom bested as a conjurer of narrative fantasy during the   he has been in business, Mr. Lauren made it clear that his Gatsbyesque vision still has legs. Here he reimagined a young man of wealth as having humor enough to leave the house wearing a black satin dinner jacket whose subtle jacquard pattern depicts cowboys riding bucking broncos  —   an image copied from a vintage sleeping bag  —   and confident enough in his taste to wear a   suit of evening clothes in chocolate corduroy. Barely out of Parsons, Matthew Adams Dolan is already a name to reckon with, largely on the basis of an interest taken in him by a single superfan. “Rihanna’s team saw my senior thesis and called in some things,” Mr. Dolan, a   native, said modestly on Thursday, as a cluster of models slumped on a dais at the P3 studio at Skylight Clarkson North. “She gets photographed in them a lot, I guess,” he added, referring to monster denims that resemble the offspring of a Carhartt jacket and a moving blanket. Mr. Dolan’s affection for functional work wear, which he reconfigures in Brobdingnagian proportions, is only half the equation, he said. “My mom was a big quilter, and that’s been a big influence on me,” he said. That Todd Snyder’s brightest ideas are often not original to him is something of which the designer makes no secret. For years, Mr. Snyder has mined thrift stores and the treasure troves maintained by folks like the   wizard Bob Melet for inspiration. As Mr. Snyder made clear in his Thursday show, his design skill lies in taking the   sports jerseys or the weary,   stadium coats he finds and then  —   exploiting his savvy way with fabrics and his tailoring background  —   turning them into covetable stuff like a handsome camel hair overcoat so pilled it looked as though he had skinned a family of teddy bears to create it. The primary idea driving Mr. Varvatos’s latest collection, he said before his show, involved his conviction that millennial men now discovering the suit want something that keeps them from resembling their fathers. “They want to push out the boundaries,” Mr. Varvatos said. He does, too. With his fall 2017 collection, the designer stuck to a restrained narrow silhouette for taut frock coats, biker jackets, barn coats and     jackets. And he confined his experiments to fabrication. Despite the best efforts of moral philosophers like Peter Singer, fur has been steadily making a comeback. The best designs at the Varvatos show were for things like a lynx print calfskin biker jacket that would make anyone want to become rock star or a flimsy topcoat lined with cropped shearling  —   just the sort of stuff to give PETA conniptions. It’s easy enough to guess at the outrage triggered in the mind of an   activist by Mr. Varvatos’s wholesale dispatch of livestock. More challenging, perhaps, is imagining what a traditional male might make of the clothes created by Mr. Palomo. Invited to be a guest of the C. F. D. A. the designer  —   who has generated a lot of press and engendered a small cult following at home  —   brought with him a group of clothes that seemed relatively tame by his standards. It included trousers, that is, and a few items you might term suits. True, they came in purple satin brocade with   portrait collars or gold lamé with flounces and neck frills or constituted little more than a white satin bustier worn with thigh boots and a pair of   briefs. Of all the many design ideas on display during New York Fashion Week: Men’s, Mr. Palomo’s were by miles the most fantastical and giddy. Yet, as the men’s wear industry has been trudging steadily away from gender fluidity and toward masculinity as historically constituted, the sight of a guy kitted out in Cuban heels, a garter belt, a pair of shiny culottes or a flounced   costume seemed less outrageous than, perhaps, passé."
"The White House has issued a list of 78 terrorist attacks, saying most were underreported. The Trump administration, under fire for immigration restrictions and other policies it says are designed to curb terrorism, has portrayed the news media and other institutions as playing down the threat. But the list, which was released on Monday night and details episodes from September 2014 to December 2016, includes dozens of attacks that were covered heavily in the news media, including by The New York Times. (Examples are included in the list below.) Just as striking was what the list excluded: attacks targeting Muslims, who make up the overwhelming majority of victims of Islamist terrorism. The list does not mention, for instance, two suicide bombings in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed dozens in November 2015, or the wave of Boko Haram attacks across northern Nigeria, which have been among the world’s deadliest terrorist assaults. Though there have been many attacks in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, the list mentions only one: a June 2016 bombing that killed Nepali and Indian security contractors. The list describes the target as “a bus carrying Canadian Embassy guards,” which is correct but in keeping with the document’s emphasis on Western targets  —   a focus that is sometimes misleadingly narrow. Prominent attacks carried out by   are also conspicuously omitted. In June 2015, Dylann S. Roof opened fire in a predominantly black church in Charleston, S. C. killing nine. That November, three people were shot to death at a Planned Parenthood office in Colorado Springs. Robert L. Dear Jr. describing himself as a “warrior for the babies,” acknowledged that he had carried out the attack, but he was later declared mentally unfit to stand trial. And in at least one of the attacks on the list, terrorism has been ruled out. A knife attack that killed two British backpackers at a hostel in Queensland, Australia, was found to be a common crime, not one related to terrorism, the Queensland police have said.   violence has been rising in the United States, according to a recent report by the New America Foundation, and has in some years claimed more lives than Islamist attacks in the country. The White House’s list, by focusing on a significant but narrow slice of terrorism, feeds into perceptions that the administration is seeking to target Muslims with other policies, particularly its immigration restrictions against predominantly Muslim countries. Here is the list from the White House, along with our references to news coverage. Some names from the list have been edited to correct spelling.

Make no mistake, a second Asian Financial Crisis is on its way. This storm will not blow over soon. It originated in the US, when the Fed proposed to taper and end quantitative easing.



The frightening thing is that this will happen in stages over the next 12–18 months, and each turn of the liquidity screw can cause a fresh financial storm. Nothing Chidambaram or Raghuram Rajan says can avert the storm.



Learning from the 1997–99 experience, all Asian countries (including India) have built up large forex reserves, reduced leverage compared with 1997, and shifted to floating exchange rates. This makes them far more resilient, so they should not collapse as in 1997–99. But they will suffer severe damage regardless.



Depreciation raises the price of all items that can be exported or imported. Estimates differ, but a 10% depreciation probably sucks out 1–1.2% of purchasing power through inflation.



At Rs 68 to the dollar, currency depreciation is around 25% since May, implying a loss of purchasing power of 2.5–3% of GDP. That is hugely recessionary. It will be reflected in much higher prices of petroleum products, fertilizers, most commodities, and knock‐​on transport and material costs.



Chidambaram wants people to invest, but the coming recession will induce every corporate to postpone investment. A falling rupee keeps making Indian assets cheaper in dollar terms, so foreigners thinking India has good long‐​run prospects will wait till the Fed’s storm ends.



The fall in purchasing power created by a falling rupee cannot be offset by a huge fiscal and monetary stimulus, as in 2008.



 **Storm will Continue**



Chidambaram has sworn to hold fiscal deficit at 4.8% of GDP. With slowing revenues and rising subsidies, only slashing Plan spending can check fiscal deficit.



Money must be kept tight to check inflation. So, the crashing rupee will generate pro‐​recessionary fiscal and monetary forces. This in turn means corporate earnings will crash, a good reason to dump shares.



Corporate’s with large unhedged dollar borrowings will suffer huge balance sheet losses, jeopardizing banks that have financed them. International rating agencies will have good reasons to downgrade India, worsening the climate further.



Rohini Malkani of the finance ministry wrote in this newspaper on Tuesday that using a model based on relative inflation with trading partners, India’s equilibrium exchange rate should be the July level of Rs 58–60 to the dollar.



Many experts say the rupee has overshot and will come back. Really? Remember the same thing was said about the Indonesian rupiah when it depreciated from 2,500 to 3,000 to the dollar in 1997, but it eventually went all the way to 18,000.



Estimates based on fundamentals quickly become meaningless because a crisis changes fundamentals hugely. The crashing rupee has already changed the economy’s fundamentals. Do not think that the rupee has just temporarily overshot, and will revert soon to Rs 60 per dollar. The storm is going to continue well into 2014.

"■ The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, took aim on Monday afternoon at a New York Times story that described President Trump watching television in his bathrobe. ■ Opposition to Mr. Trump’s travel restrictions on certain countries mounted, but the president remained defiant and unbowed. ■ Mr. Trump turned to Twitter early Monday and began challenging polls that showed his travel order was not popular. ■ A bipartisan group of former National Security Council officials filed court documents opposing the ban. ■ The Justice Department corrected the record on how many people had their visas canceled because of the ban. Mr. Spicer denounced The Times’s account, published Sunday night, of the president’s turbulent adjustment to life in the White House. In particular, he zeroed in on one detail among a few paragraphs of the story that he insisted were wrong: that the president has worn a bathrobe while alone in the White House residence. “That is literally the epitome of fake news,” Mr. Spicer told reporters traveling with Mr. Trump. “Start at the top. I don’t think the president owns a bathrobe. He definitely doesn’t wear one. ” The White House staff stocks the official residence with bathrobes. Within moments of Mr. Spicer’s comment, reporters on Twitter posted photos of a much younger Mr. Trump lounging in a bathrobe. Mr. Spicer added that the story was “so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the president an apology. ” He went on, “Literally, blatant factual errors, and it’s unacceptable to see that kind of reporting or   reporting. ” The overall piece, which described Mr. Trump’s first two weeks in office as he attempts a dramatic   of a Washington culture he has never inhabited, was “not an accurate portrayal of what’s really happening,” Mr. Spicer concluded. Mr. Trump appeared not to like the news he was reading Monday morning. In one Twitter post, the president rejected reports of polls showing that a majority of Americans oppose his travel order. In another, he appeared to lash out at suggestions that Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, holds the real power in the West Wing. A CNN poll released over the weekend said that 55 percent of Americans viewed Mr. Trump’s travel order as an attempt to keep Muslims out of the country. The president also seemed angry about the    story line, which was featured in a Time magazine article and in a “Saturday Night Live” skit showing Mr. Bannon as the Grim Reaper directing Mr. Trump’s activities in the White House. On Twitter, Mr. Trump called the reports “fake news” that sought to marginalize him. If you missed Mr. Trump talking to Bill O’Reilly of Fox News during the Super Bowl, you will have another chance tonight. Mr. Trump continued his screed against news coverage of him on Monday, training his fire at The New York Times in an apparent reaction to a portrait of his early stumbles published in Monday’s editions. In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump appeared to characterize The Times’s coverage, which was based on interviews with several of his White House’s most senior officials and others aware of the administration’s inner workings, as “fiction” based on fabricated sources. Mr. Trump has long delighted in denigrating The Times and claiming, falsely, that its coverage of him has led to declining readership. But in a meeting at The Times in November, he called the paper, which is among his first reads each morning, “a great, great American jewel. ” Last week, The Times surpassed three million print and digital subscriptions, adding 276, 000 net   subscriptions in the last three months of the year, more additions than in 2013 and 2014 combined. It’s official: Silicon Valley really, really despises Mr. Trump’s immigration order. Overnight, 97 companies  —   most of them technology firms, including Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft  —   filed a legal brief arguing that the ban is unconstitutional and harms the interests of American businesses. The brief, filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is blunt and direct. The ban, it says, “hinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent increases costs imposed on business makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations  —   and hire new employees  —   outside the United States. ” It is a remarkable statement of unity from the country’s technology companies, many of which rely heavily on foreign workers. And it is a shot across the bow for Mr. Trump, foreshadowing a rocky relationship with Silicon Valley leaders over the next four years. The companies were not the only ones joining in opposition. Susan E. Rice, former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser, was among the leaders of a petition signed by a group of former National Security Council officials. The Justice Department on Monday corrected the record on an   claim that one of its lawyers made in a Northern Virginia courtroom about the impact of President Trump’s executive order on visitors from seven   countries. The government lawyer provoked gasps in the courtroom when he told Judge Leonie Brinkema, one of the Federal District Court judges weighing legal challenges to Mr. Trump’s order, that more than 100, 000 visas had been revoked as a result of the order  —   far more than had been understood to be the case. That number, however, came under question later on Friday, when a spokesman for the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs said that the real number was around 60, 000 and that the larger figure had inaccurately included diplomatic visas that were not affected by the ban. On Monday, the department submitted a filing to Judge Brinkema that corrected its statement in the court. “In response to a question from this court as to how many individuals have been affected by the executive order, government counsel presenting oral argument, based on information he had received, stated that 100, 000 visas had been provisionally revoked as a result of the executive order,” it said. “The Department of State has since provided undersigned counsel with a revised number, which is roughly 60, 000 visas. ” An outside,   political group is adding veteran   and Republican Party strategists, and is also employing one of the president’s campaign ad makers to try to ensure Senate confirmation of his remaining cabinet nominees. The group, 45Committee, has signed Larry Weitzner of Jamestown Associates, which produced most of Mr. Trump’s campaign ads in the general election. Mr. Weitzner’s first spot will air nationally this week, with a gauzy focus on the initial days of the Trump presidency. It’s part of a $4 million effort, with three other ads focused specifically on the nominations of Betsy DeVos for education secretary, Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Tom Price for secretary of health and human services. Some of those ads have been broadcast in states with critical races in the 2018 midterms. The other new advisers are Cara Mason, who worked as the finance director for the Trump Victory committee under Reince Priebus Rob Collins, a former National Republican Senatorial Committee executive director Mike Shields, a former Republican National Committee chief of staff and Rob Simms, a former National Republican Congressional Committee executive director. With Mr. Trump’s administration still evolving, the 45Committee has moved to fill a void, supporting the White House as it finds itself besieged by critics. Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff known for his uncompromising stance on illegal immigration, is back in the news months after losing his bid for  . Now he is asking supporters to help him raise $1 million for his legal defense fund. Mr. Arpaio faced numerous lawsuits alleging abuse and faulty medical care in several jails, and taxpayers in Maricopa County, where he was sheriff, spent tens of millions of dollars for his legal defense. In his email, Mr. Arpaio attributed his   defeat to a host of enemies, including “leftist financier George Soros,” the American Civil Liberties Union and the Obama administration’s Justice Department. Mr. Soros spent an estimated $2 million last year opposing Mr. Arpaio, and the Justice Department under Mr. Obama filed criminal    charges against the sheriff for refusing a judge’s order to stop discriminating against Latinos. As the sheriff of Arizona’s largest county, Mr. Arpaio gained a national reputation for immigration raids that targeted heavily Hispanic neighborhoods in and around the Phoenix area. Thousands of people were caught up in the raids, which were often carried out without any proof of criminal activity, and which critics called racial profiling."
"Solar, wind and other renewable sources have toppled coal in energy generation in the United States for the first time in over 130 years, with the coronavirus pandemic accelerating a decline in coal that has profound implications for the climate crisis. Not since wood was the main source of American energy in the 19th century has a renewable resource been used more heavily than coal, but 2019 saw a historic reversal, according to US government figures. Coal consumption fell by 15%, down for the sixth year in a row, while renewables edged up by 1%. This meant renewables surpassed coal for the first time since at least 1885, a year when Mark Twain published The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and America’s first skyscraper was erected in Chicago. Electricity generation from coal fell to its lowest level in 42 years in 2019, with the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasting that renewables will eclipse coal as an electricity source this year. On 21 May, the year hit its 100th day in which renewables have been used more heavily than coal. “Coal is on the way out, we are seeing the end of coal,” said Dennis Wamsted, analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “We aren’t going to see a big resurgence in coal generation, the trend is pretty clear.” The ongoing collapse of coal would have been nearly unthinkable a decade ago, when the fuel source accounted for nearly half of America’s generated electricity. That proportion may fall to under 20% this year, with analysts predicting a further halving within the coming decade. A rapid slump since then has not been reversed despite the efforts of the Trump administration, which has dismantled a key Barack Obama-era climate rule to reduce emissions from coal plants and eased requirements that prevent coal operations discharging mercury into the atmosphere and waste into streams. Coal releases more planet-warming carbon dioxide than any other energy source, with scientists warning its use must be rapidly phased out to achieve net-zero emissions globally by 2050 and avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. Countries including the UK and Germany are in the process of winding down their coal sectors, although in the US the industry still enjoys strong political support from Trump. “It’s a big moment for the market to see renewables overtake coal,” said Ben Nelson, lead coal analyst at Moody’s. “The magnitude of intervention to aid coal has not been sufficient to fundamentally change its trajectory, which is sharply downwards.” Nelson said he expects coal production to plummet by a quarter this year but stressed that declaring the demise of the industry is “a very tough statement to make” due to ongoing exports of coal and its use in steel-making. There are also rural communities with power purchase agreements with coal plants, meaning these contracts would have to end before coal use was halted. The coal sector has been beset by a barrage of problems, predominantly from cheap, abundant gas that has displaced it as a go-to energy source. The Covid-19 outbreak has exacerbated this trend. With plunging electricity demand following the shutting of factories, offices and retailers, utilities have plenty of spare energy to choose from and coal is routinely the last to be picked because it is more expensive to run than gas, solar, wind or nuclear. Many US coal plants are ageing and costly to operate, forcing hundreds of closures over the past decade. Just this year, power companies have announced plans to shutter 13 coal plants, including the large Edgewater facility outside Sheboygan, Wisconsin, the Coal Creek Station plant in North Dakota and the Four Corners generating station in New Mexico – one of America’s largest emitters of carbon dioxide. The last coal facility left in New York state closed earlier this year. The additional pressure of the pandemic “will likely shutter the US coal industry for good”, said Yuan-Sheng Yu, senior analyst at Lux Research. “It is becoming clear that Covid-19 will lead to a shake-up of the energy landscape and catalyze the energy transition, with investors eyeing new energy sector plays as we emerge from the pandemic.” Climate campaigners have cheered the decline of coal but in the US the fuel is largely being replaced by gas, which burns more cleanly than coal but still emits a sizable amount of carbon dioxide and methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, in its production. Renewables accounted for 11% of total US energy consumption last year – a share that will have to radically expand if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. Petroleum made up 37% of the total, followed by gas at 32%. Renewables marginally edged out coal, while nuclear stood at 8%. “Getting past coal is a big first hurdle but the next round will be the gas industry,” said Wamsted. “There are emissions from gas plants and they are significant. It’s certainly not over.”"

Karl du Fresne writes about the po-faced, weirdo, wowsers starting to infiltrate our supermarkets while annoying good, normal, meat-eating, Kiwi shoppers:



My wife and I don’t always agree about things – just choosing a paint colour for the bathroom can take months. But we celebrated a moment of instant accord over breakfast recently.



In front of us was a newspaper account of the [black-clad vegan protesters](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/115875483/vegans-anger-st-lukes-countdown-customers-during-meat-aisle-protest) who formed a line in front of the meat shelves in an Auckland supermarket.



Shoppers, who were prevented from buying meat, reportedly lost their patience, lashing out at the protesters.



My wife’s reaction was the same as mine. We agreed that if we’d been there, we probably would have been among those doing the lashing out.



I’d like to see these long, lanky streaks of mobile misery try their protest on somewhere like Te Kuiti. You may be sure that there would be Vegan blood noses running down the aisles of the local Countdown as the no-nonsense rural types take umbrage at the group of urban tossers telling them what they can or can’t eat.



I respect the right of vegans to renounce meat and I’m certainly not insensitive to concerns about inhumane treatment of animals. But protesters are inviting a backlash when they arrogantly assert the right to obstruct people going about their lawful business.



Don’t these Militant activists know that for the very best quality meat you need to treat animals well and kill them quickly? Of course, you don’t need to fight your way past these fools if you [buy your meat directly from The Whale Meat Company](http://www.whalemeat.co.nz) as that way it goes straight to your meat-eating door (possibly delivered by your local Hindu, vegetarian courier driver who is unlikely to steal your meat, especially if it contains sacred cow).



The right to protest is an essential item in the democratic toolkit and one I’ve taken advantage of myself. But I’ve never assumed my beliefs were so sacred that they took precedence over the rights of others – which is why, although I marched against the 1981 Springbok tour, I avoided taking part in protests that tried to prevent fans from getting to matches.



It’s also why I get mad when I see activists trying to bar people from attending political events they disapprove of.



Unfortunately, the thing about zealots is that they become so convinced of the righteousness of their cause that it overrides all other considerations. Thus we are now witnessing the rise of militant veganism, as was evident in the meat section of the Countdown supermarket in the Westfield St Lukes Mall.



Food has been well and truly politicised, and with that has come a rising level of strident militancy – hysteria, almost – and denunciation of anyone who doesn’t fall into line with the “meat is murder” agenda.



It’s all part of the so-called culture war – the clash between traditional liberal values and those promoted by the radical and increasingly assertive authoritarian Left.



Yes, I’d bet a dollar to a knob of goat poo that these vegan numpties are Green voters to a “they”…the “male” ones certainly would barely qualify as men given how much soy they likely ingest.



A significant recent development was the convergence of two of the great secular theologies of our age: **militant veganism and climate change alarmism.**



The two came together in fist-pumping union nine months ago with the publication of a report purporting to link climate change with supposedly unhealthy global food production systems.



There you have it: two moral panics rolled into one – pure gold for the ideologues who endlessly lecture us on the supposed failings of capitalism and Western civilisation.



Published in the British medical journal _The Lancet_ , the report – written by a team headed by Professor Boyd Swinburn of Auckland University, a high priest of wowserism – claimed that food production systems, controlled and manipulated by profit-crazed global business interests, are not only driving climate change, but propelling us toward early graves.



How this squares with statistics showing steady worldwide improvements in life expectancy wasn’t explained, but hey – **why nitpick?**



Nah, let’s nitpick. You see the very report that Karl writes about has been slammed for the wonky piece of political agitprop that it was by none other than the Chief Scientist for the Ministry of Primary Industries.



Swinburn and his accomplices even came up with a fancy new term for this looming apocalypse. They called it a Global Syndemic, or a “synergy of epidemics” interacting with each other to produce “complex sequelae” – a bit of Latin always looks impressive – which ultimately threaten the planet.



There should be no mistaking the purpose of such reports. They are aimed at frightening people into meekly accepting radical changes imposed on us by those who insist they know better.



Neither should there be any doubt about the real target of the reformist zealots.



They may not say it in so many words, but their goal is to dismantle international capitalism. That’s the agenda that underpins almost all the moral crusades currently being waged in Western societies.



  
Part of that crusade includes lawfare against industry and confident opposing voices that challenge their agitprop. One must not dare argue against “the science” is the constant refrain we are beaten with. No matter that the “science” is as weak as a vegan weightlifter.



Karl du Fresne better watch out. Boyd Swinburn doesn’t like being challenged and he likes to lawyer up between his frequent trips around the world proselytising in his battle against “Big Food”. Like climate scientists, he never admits when [he’s been wrong](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=11864953) and he’s [never met a tax he doesn’t like](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&biw=2361&bih=1253&ei=1juUXYDXOYWS9QPf3rGgAg&q=boyd+swinburn+tax&oq=boyd+swinburn+tax&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160l3.3764.4802..5934...0.0..0.207.617.2-3......0....1..gws-wiz.......0j33i21.U3PdAPGquG4&ved=0ahUKEwiAmtLw8fzkAhUFSX0KHV9vDCQQ4dUDCAo&uact=5) for the [targets of his opprobrium](http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/early-edition/audio/boyd-swinburn-salt-tax/?region=wellington). 



Karl du Fresne is right, these wowser types are extremely annoying, and wrong.

"Emmanuelle Riva, whose performance in the antiwar film “Hiroshima Mon Amour” in 1959 placed her at the center of the French New Wave  —   and who, more than 50 years later, became the oldest person nominated for an Academy Award for best lead actor or actress, as a woman debilitated by strokes in “Amour”  —   died on Friday in Paris. She was 89. The cause was cancer, her agent, Anne Alvares Correa, said. “Hiroshima Mon Amour,” directed by Alain Resnais and written by Marguerite Duras, was one of the first internationally acclaimed films to emerge from the French New Wave, a movement that rejected classic cinematic storytelling with youthful irreverence. In the United States it was an   hit. “With his first feature film,” Andrew Sarris wrote in The Village Voice, “Resnais has made the most important contribution to realizable film aesthetics since ‘Citizen Kane. ’” The movie opens with Ms. Riva, playing an actress who has come to Hiroshima to make a film promoting peace, and her   Eiji Okada, as an architect, in a lovers’ embrace. Their faces are unseen and their limbs are covered in what appears to be ash, as if from a nuclear blast, that is then washed away. They speak in  . Ms. Riva says she has seen evidence of the bomb’s effects in a hospital and a museum. But Mr. Okada rebukes her, over and over: “You saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing. ” She reveals tortured memories of an affair she had during World War II in her native Nevers, France, with a German soldier. Her living and dead lovers become linked  —   as do the horrors of Nevers and Hiroshima. Looking back at it nearly a   later, the critic Michael Koresky said that Ms. Riva’s performance was “responsible for much of the emotional heft” of the film and that “the range of feelings that run across Riva’s face is perhaps the most unforgettable element. ” Ms. Riva sensed at the time that “Hiroshima Mon Amour” might turn out to be the creative peak of a film career that had just begun. “I think I was particularly blessed because I put my trust in Alain Resnais,” she told an interviewer at the Cannes Film Festival in 1959, when the film was shown there. But, she added: “I feel like I might be a disappointment after this, because Resnais pushed me to excel. He made me reach certain heights. ” Paulette Germaine Riva was born on Feb. 24, 1927, in Chenimenil, in northeastern France, and grew up in nearby Remiremont. Her father, René Alfred Riva, was a sign writer her mother, the former Jeanne Fernande Nourdin, was a seamstress. An only child, she never married and had no children. Ms. Riva had wanted to act since she was a child, she later said, but felt that her ambition was circumscribed by her family’s modest life in a rural village. She began performing in regional theater, but also trained as a seamstress before she entered acting school in Paris in her  . “If I had failed, I’d be dead,” she told the French newspaper Libération. “I did not have a second to lose. ” Her first role on the Paris stage was in Shaw’s “Arms and the Man” in 1954. Five years later, Mr. Resnais cast her as the nameless actress in “Hiroshima Mon Amour. ” In the decades that followed, Ms. Riva toggled from movies to stage work to television series. She distinguished herself in movies like “Léon Morin, Priest” (1961) but she never had another role as sensational as the one she played in “Hiroshima Mon Amour. ” “I refused as many offers as I accepted,” she told The New York Times in 2013. “I refused commercial roles. But it was wrong, I have been too extreme, and I don’t say it was good. ” Then the Austrian director Michael Haneke  —   who told The Times in 2012 that as a young man he had been “captivated” by Ms. Riva’s performance in “Hiroshima Mon Amour”  —   asked her to audition for “Amour. ” “Clearly he wanted to see me again after all these years,” she told The Guardian in 2013. “I was in his head, perhaps. ” In “Amour,” Ms. Riva played Anne, a retired music teacher who is failing mentally and physically. Her husband, Georges, played by   Trintignant, devotedly cares for her. Writing in The Times, Manohla Dargis called them “two titans of French cinema. ”  In an interview with the entertainment news website TheWrap. com, she said that Mr. Haneke had only one direction for her as she worked with Mr. Trintignant. “We were doing a scene,” she recalled, “and he said, ‘It’s very nice  —   very sweet, very tender  —   but it’s too tender. No sentimentality. From here on in, no sentimentality.’ This was the key that opened the horizon of the film. Once I heard that, it became much more clear. ” “Amour” won the Academy Award for best   film. Ms. Riva did not win the Oscar for best actress  —   she lost to Jennifer Lawrence for “Silver Linings Playbook”  —   but she won the César, the French version of the Oscar, and a Bafta film award, from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, for the role. After the release of “Amour,” she said in an interview with The Times, she received a letter from a friend who wondered how she had aged “so tragically in front of our eyes. ” She explained:  “Anne is another person, it isn’t me. It is a journey into someone else, someone I’m not. ”"
"**The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination.**
Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out.
The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs.
Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff.
But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted.
A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported.
The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people.
The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday.
Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored.
Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales.
The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better.""
There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it.
But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different.
When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it.
From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000.
That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted.
Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first.
This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital.
It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it.
While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.""
Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable.
The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK:
Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now.
It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available.
NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"".
But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation.
""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty.
The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government.
Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021.
Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue.
The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose.
Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group.
The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said.
The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut.
Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said.
Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp.
""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today.""
The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing.
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials.
Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice.
Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours.
Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed:
The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"".
He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme ""the vaccine will only start to dent the size of the pandemic somewhat later in the year""."
"The UK Council for Science and Technology recently called on prime minister David Cameron to reassess EU rules on GM crops. Two days later the Observer published an editorial bluntly declaring: “There’s no choice; we must grow GM crops now”. There is a high risk that a new round of the shouting match that mired the debate 15 years ago will begin again, with little real progress. But research since the first failure of the debate on GM crops in the EU suggests there is a better way. Our GM-Futuros project has recently explored the GM debates in depth at national and local levels in India, Mexico and Brazil – highlighting some stark lessons for the EU and UK. Quality engagement with the public is key. Both of the recent UK publications call for a positive move towards GM agricultural technology. Ostensibly this is driven by forecasts of global population increases and a shortfall in food supply from current agricultural land by 2050. The Council for Science and Technology letter also appeals to the current loss of economic opportunity in the UK from present over-restrictive EU regulations. The Observer piece is dismissive of objections: “Thirty years ago, it could be argued that we should proceed cautiously because of potential health dangers. That argument is no longer acceptable.” The dangers of using language like this (and that used by the government itself recently) has become clearer thanks to research into the debate around “troubled technologies” – technologies that touch sensitive public nerves. These are legion: nanotechnologies, nuclear power, GMOs, geoengineering and, more recently, fracking.   Some technology stirs up emotional opposition more than others, and this happens differently across cultures. This suggests that more is going on than an on-the-surface discussion of technological risk, potential benefits and possible harms.  The GM-Futuros project builds on a previous study, which found public concerns over certain new technologies reflected deeply-lying, and often hidden, beliefs. They were full of powerful arguments using narratives such as “the rich get richer”, “we are kept in the dark”, “Pandora’s box”, “messing with nature” and “be careful what you wish for”. If the sources of this scepticism is not recognised and dealt with sensitively, proponents and opponents of policy simply talk past each other. In Mexico, there has been a slow and silent implementation of GM crops but the GM controversy truly exploded with the case of maize, which holds an iconic (almost sacred) national status. It unites urban consumers and rural populations alike: the public resistance to GM maize is such that a recent moratorium has been mandated by a judge.  In Brazil, the growing numbers of urban middle class consumers are largely unaware that they are eating GM foods. When made aware, they feel they have been betrayed and kept in the dark by their government. In India, however, the debate centres around Indian GM science. Part of the national scientific community lobbies for the development of Indian GM technology, while another part argues that Indian science cannot guarantee a reliable assessment of risks and impacts at present.   The three countries show huge differences in how social responsibility is appreciated by scientists. Our experience has been that “the public interest”, while a common broadcast message, has not been a key driver of protest in practice.   The reality is that GM has benefited some (typically large producers) at the expense of others (small producers and other alternative methods of organising agriculture such as agro-ecology). The use of GM crops in India, Brazil and Mexico has also pointed to degrees of “lock-in” (where farmers are left with no alternatives) and few sustainability benefits. The quality of public engagement is a critical element in implementing GM. Brazilian, Mexican and Indian citizens (the consumers) have been more or less wholly absent from the debate, as have many others, including the vital voices of local farmers. When eventually informed they are often angry. This means engaging with the UK public is necessary but likely to prove insufficient unless this is done properly. Real consideration must be given to what constitutes the public good, the conditions under which it is likely to be realised in practice, and the plausibility of these conditions being implemented under current arrangements. Simply calling for the relaxation of regulations on GMOs therefore misses the point to a large extent. The key issue is to move the debate away from an analysis of harms (as assessed exclusively by scientists and regulators) towards a more inclusive discussion of the issues that actually constitute the public interest. What kind of agriculture do we want as a nation? How should different citizens be involved in the process? How contingent will public trust be on how the issue is framed and deliberated? An essential starting point is the realisation that government is not trusted on this issue; indeed, the way they’ve framed the debate has been largely unhelpful, in that GM so far has embraced a model of agriculture that people are uneasy with (for good reason) and about which they feel they have not been consulted. We need to move forward, making scientific decisions more democratic. A new framework for responsible innovation details how this can be done in practice, through anticipating impacts, reflecting on motivations, engaging with the public and then using these processes to influence the direction of the research process itself.  To this end, we are holding a workshop at the Royal Society on 13th June to discuss GM in the UK and EU and to draw research findings together into policy recommendations. We are optimistic, in spite of the hard lessons, that a way forward in framing policy is possible, but only if those lessons are learnt well."

"**Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 GMT.**
A hugely positive bit of news to wake up to this morning. The UK has become the first country in the world to approve a coronavirus vaccine for widespread use. The government says the Pfizer/BioNTech jab will start being made available across the UK from next week. The UK has already ordered 40m doses - enough to vaccinate 20m people, with two shots each. About 10m doses should be available soon. Experts have drawn up a provisional priority list, targeting people at highest risk. Top are care home residents and staff, followed by people over 80 and other health and social care workers.
Lockdown in England is over, but 99% of the population is waking up to tighter restrictions than before it began. Some freedoms have returned though. Non-essential shops and other businesses such as beauty parlours, hairdressers, and gyms are able to reopen in all areas. Spectators can begin returning to sporting venues in tiers one and two, and swimming pools can reopen - although not all will, we're told. The measures were approved by MPs despite Boris Johnson suffering his biggest rebellion to date - see what our political editor thinks. Tiers will be reviewed in two weeks' time - check what you can do right now and why your area is in the level it is.
The health secretary has announced that relatives of all care home residents in England will be able to visit over the Christmas period if they test negative for Covid-19. He promised more than a million tests would be sent to homes over the next month, along with extra PPE. Vic Rayner, from the National Care Forum, said it was ""a huge step forward"". BBC health editor Hugh Pym says the news will be welcomed by families struggling with separation, but there's a danger of hopes being raised only to be dashed again because not all facilities will be able to meet the demand for a visit in time for Christmas.
Retail discounts in the run-up to Christmas are now commonplace, but lockdown has left stores with an excess of seasonal stock to shift. That means prices are falling \- good news for consumers at least - with the biggest discounts at fashion and DIY stores, according to the British Retail Consortium. Debenhams has launched a huge stock clearance - so big its website has been overwhelmed. The retail sector in general is having a really tough time, and it's often young retail staff who are especially hard-hit - we spoke to some feeling the strain.
As part of our CEO Secrets series, we've been looking at businesses that have launched during this very difficult year. This week, we hear from people whose jobs are under threat in hospitality and have decided to try something new. Bruce Tate was in a bad place after the first lockdown. His business, Need Music, handled live bookings for pubs and weddings, but was forced to close. Now he's transformed his office into a cycling cafe. Read his story and others for a much-needed dose of optimism.

"The coronavirus pandemic is “just a fire drill” for what is likely to follow from the climate crisis, and the protests over racial injustice around the world show the need to tie together social equality, environmental sustainability and health, the UN’s sustainable business chief has said. “The overall problem is that we are not sustainable in the ways we are living and producing on the planet today,” said Lise Kingo, the executive director of the UN Global Compact, under which businesses sign up to principles of environmental protection and social justice. “The only way forward is to create a world that leaves no one behind.”  She said there were “very, very clear connections” between the Covid-19 and climate crises, and the Black Lives Matter protests around the world, which she said had helped to reveal deep-seated inequalities and “endemic and structural racism”. “We have seen illustrated to everyone that social inequality issues are part of the sustainable development agenda,” Kingo said. Human rights were “inseparable” from dealing with climate breakdown, she told the Guardian in an interview. “This horrible racism [seen in the killing of George Floyd] is about human rights. We have to make sure that we give the social part of the agenda equal focus.” She called on business leaders to take heed. “We want all chief executives to become social activists – to understand social equality,” she said. Not only was this the right thing to do, but “it creates stable markets for companies around the world” and reflects the desires of young people. “Young people are so engaged, so dedicated to this agenda, they don’t want to work for companies that do not have a solid responsibility strategy,” she said. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said building a fairer society would be essential to the world’s health, as well as to saving the planet from climate breakdown and ecological destruction. “Today, the fabric of society and the wellbeing of people hinge on our ability to build a fair globalisation,” he told the two-day UN Global Compact virtual conference of business leaders, which started on Monday. “Where once ‘do no harm’ was a common approach for the business community, today we are arriving at a new landscape of elevated expectations and responsibilities. But despite progress, serious threats would undermine our future, including climate change, poverty, loss of biodiversity and widening social inequalities. The pandemic has underscored the world’s fragilities, which extend far beyond the realm of global health.” Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, told the conference that the Covid-19 crisis had shown how urgent it was to tackle global heating. “This is a crisis that will involve the whole world and from which no one can self-isolate,” he said. He called for all companies to provide clear information to customers, the public and investors about how they plan to move to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. More than 10,000 companies are signed up to the UN Global Compact, and they are being urged to strengthen their commitments to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Many have pledged to cut carbon in line with the Paris agreement goal of holding global temperature rises to no more than 2C. But scientific studies show that this may not be enough to stave off disaster, and that the consequences of even 1.5C of global heating will be severe. Kingo wants companies to revise their business plans in order to reduce carbon in line with a 1.5C goal. “We need to see leadership to drive this,” she said. A report by the UN for the 20th anniversary of the Global Compact found that only four in 10 companies had targets that would enable them to meet the UN’s sustainable development goals by the 2030 deadline, and fewer than a third thought their industry was moving fast enough. While 84% of companies participating in the UN Global Compact were taking action on the goals, fewer than half were “embedding” those targets into their core business activities, and only 37% were designing their business models to meet the goals. “The human community is completely interconnected and interdependent,” Kingo said. “Without solidarity, especially with those most vulnerable among us, we all lose. We are paying the price for turning a blind eye to obvious injustices in the world.”"

"The world has only six months in which to change the course of the climate crisis and prevent a post-lockdown rebound in greenhouse gas emissions that would overwhelm efforts to stave off climate catastrophe, one of the world’s foremost energy experts has warned. “This year is the last time we have, if we are not to see a carbon rebound,” said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency.  Governments are planning to spend $9tn (£7.2tn) globally in the next few months on rescuing their economies from the coronavirus crisis, the IEA has calculated. The stimulus packages created this year will determine the shape of the global economy for the next three years, according to Birol, and within that time emissions must start to fall sharply and permanently, or climate targets will be out of reach. “The next three years will determine the course of the next 30 years and beyond,” Birol told the Guardian. “If we do not [take action] we will surely see a rebound in emissions. If emissions rebound, it is very difficult to see how they will be brought down in future. This is why we are urging governments to have sustainable recovery packages.” Carbon dioxide emissions plunged by a global average of 17% in April, compared with last year, but have since surged again to within about 5% of last year’s levels. In a report published on Thursday, the IEA – the world’s gold standard for energy analysis - set out the first global blueprint for a green recovery, focusing on reforms to energy generation and consumption. Wind and solar power should be a top focus, the report advised, alongside energy efficiency improvements to buildings and industries, and the modernisation of electricity grids. Creating jobs must be the priority for countries where millions have been thrown into unemployment by the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdowns. The IEA’s analysis shows that targeting green jobs – such as retrofitting buildings to make them more energy efficient, putting up solar panels and constructing wind farms – is more effective than pouring money into the high-carbon economy. Sam Fankhauser, executive director of the Grantham Research Institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in the report, said: “Building efficiency ticks all the recovery boxes – shovel-ready, employment intensive, a high economic multiplier, and is absolutely key for zero carbon [as it is] a hard-to-treat sector, and has big social benefits, in the form of lower fuel bills.” He warned that governments must not try to “preserve existing jobs in formaldehyde” through furlough schemes and other efforts to keep people in employment, but provide retraining and other opportunities for people to “move into the jobs of the future”. Calls for a green recovery globally have now come from experts, economists, health professionals, educators, climate campaigners and politicians. While some governments are poised to take action – for instance, the EU has pledged to make its European green deal the centrepiece of its recovery – the money spent so far has tended to prop up the high-carbon economy. At least $33bn has been directed towards airlines, with few or no green strings attached, according to the campaigning group Transport and Environment. According to analyst company Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more than half a trillion dollars worldwide – $509bn – is to be poured into high-carbon industries, with no conditions to ensure they reduce their carbon output. Only about $12.3bn of the spending announced by late last month was set to go towards low-carbon industries, and a further $18.5bn into high-carbon industries provided they achieve climate targets. In the first tranches of spending, governments “had an excuse” for failing to funnel money to carbon-cutting industries, said Birol, because they were reacting to a sudden and unexpected crisis. “The first recovery plans were more aimed at creating firewalls round the economy,” he explained. But governments were still targeting high-carbon investment, Birol warned. He pointed to IEA research showing that by the end of May the amount invested in coal-fired power plants in Asia had accelerated compared with last year. “There are already signs of a rebound [in emissions],” he said. Climate campaigners called on ministers to heed the IEA report and set out green recovery plans. Jamie Peters, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth, said: “A post-Covid world must be a fair one. It will only be equitable if the government prioritises health, wellbeing and opportunity for all parts of society. As if the case was not compelling enough in a dangerously heating planet, it is even more urgent post-Covid.” Putting the IEA’s recommendations into action would boost the economy, added Rosie Rogers, head of green recovery at Greenpeace UK. “Government putting money behind sustainable solutions really is an economic no-brainer. It can see us build a recovery that both tackles the climate emergency and improves people’s lives through cleaner air and lower bills.” Investors were also keen to put private sector money into a green recovery, alongside government stimulus spending, said Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change, representing funds and asset managers with $26tn in assets. “The IEA has shown [a green recovery] is not only desirable, but economically astute. Investors are fully committed to playing their part in this process.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterEuropean parliamentary elections are slated to take place May 22-25 and parties critical of the Europe’s course on a variety of issues, ranging from the euro-currency, bailouts and climate change, are faring well at the polls and have the establishment spooked. One good example of a climate policy/science-skeptical party is the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), which is now showing strong support in opinion polls.

The UKIP party will soon be getting company in Europe. In Germany a newly formed party named the AfD Alternativ für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany), formed just last year, today is showing strong support, now polling at 7%, according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
In general, as is the case with Britain’s UKIP party, the media have been portraying the AfD as a populist, right-wing party with suspicious leanings. But it appears the public isn’t buying that portrayal. Indeed the AfD represents a party that threatens to rock the coziness and harmony that the German establishment has enjoyed on issues such as climate and Europe. Much of the party’s support is coming from disenchanted conservative CDU/CSU and Free Democrat FDP voters, who have grown frustrated with their own parties.
I’m not a supporter of the AfD, and I’m not even familiar with their overall platform. As a US citizen I’m not even allowed to cast a vote. But one thing about the AfD party that I do support, however, is their skepticism regarding climate science and especially the country’s horribly destructive energy policy.

"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   Months after intense fighting between the Afghan government and the Taliban subsided on the outskirts of Kunduz, Hajji Habib Rahmani’s family decided to go ahead with a delayed wedding. Amid the festivities, Abdul Basit, one of the children playing behind the house, picked up an unexploded shell, and it blew up. Basit, 14, and his brother Haroon, 8, were killed, and 12 other children ages 7 to 15 were wounded. The shell had been “fired from a helicopter during the fighting, and it hadn’t exploded,” said Mr. Rahmani, an uncle of the two brothers. On Monday, the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan reported that 2016 had been another year of record civilian casualties in the country, and it expressed particular concern about a 65 percent jump in the number of children killed or wounded by explosive remnants as fighting has spread to heavily populated civilian areas. The report by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or Unama, said overall civilian casualties had continued their steady increase in recent years. In 2016, 3, 498 civilians were killed and 7, 920 others wounded  —   a rise of 3 percent over the previous year, the report said. “I am deeply saddened to report yet another year of increase in civilian casualties  —   another    figure for the number of civilian casualties,” Tadamichi Yamamoto, the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan and the head of Unama, said at a news conference on Monday in Kabul, the Afghan capital. “The killing and maiming of Afghan civilians is deeply harrowing and largely preventable. ” According to the report, Unama documented “record numbers of civilian casualties from ground engagements, suicide and complex attacks, and explosive remnants of war” in 2016. The report also said casualties caused by aerial operations were the highest since the mission started systematically tracking them in 2009 and had doubled compared with 2015. Afghanistan is still having to clear what remains of the hundreds of thousands of   mines and explosive remnants dating as far back as the   war with the Soviet Union and the subsequent factional fighting, even as newer explosives take lives on a daily basis. Just as the conflict is restricting the movements of demining crews, civilians are being killed and maimed by homemade roadside bombs planted by insurgents, as well as unexploded ordnance left behind by coalition forces around bases they abandoned. And now, more children are dying not long after battles in their neighborhoods have ended, as none of the combatants bother to clear explosive remnants afterward as sought by international conventions. About 61 percent of the civilian casualties are attributed to what Unama calls “antigovernment elements,” largely the Taliban. But civilian casualties caused by local affiliates of the Islamic State also increased tenfold compared with 2015, with 899 casualties claimed by Islamic State in 2016.   forces caused 24 percent of the civilian casualties, the report said, significantly higher than in 2015. The United Nations mission was especially concerned about an overall 24 percent rise in casualties involving children compared with 2015, with 3, 512 such episodes in 2016 causing 923 deaths and leaving 2, 589 wounded. More than half of the child casualties occurred during ground engagements. Afghanistan has successfully carried out one of the world’s largest demining efforts over several decades, removing nearly two million items of explosive material, more than 700, 000 antipersonnel mines and more than 29, 000 antitank mines, according to the United Nations Mine Action Service. The efforts have resulted in a 65 percent reduction in casualties caused by mines and explosive remnants since 2001. But in recent years, as the   international coalition has closed down bases ahead of its withdrawal from the country, more casualties have been reported from ordnance exploding in areas that had been used as firing ranges and then abandoned by coalition forces. From 2009 to 2015, the United Nations recorded 138 casualties resulting from explosive remnant accidents in or around facilities used by the international coalition, and it said that 75 percent of the victims were children. A clearance operation to start getting rid of the explosives was introduced in 2014 to clear dozens of these sites. The United Nations said many of last year’s casualties involving children and unexploded ordnance were caused by new explosive items left behind after recent fighting. “My team tracks the location of every one of the detonations, and the trend we have documented was a direct correlation between casualties from exploded ordnance and areas where the heaviest ground fighting happened,” said Danielle Bell, the director of the human rights unit at Unama. “The majority of casualties resulted from new unexploded ordnance from the current conflict. ” The United Nations is urging the Afghan government to comply with international rules requiring it to clear explosives after a battle."

In an era of misinformation overload, it is disheartening to see the _Washington Post_ perpetuating the ignorance surrounding the issue of outsourcing. To be sure, in addressing the topic in Tuesday's paper, writers Tom Hamburger, Carol D. Leonnig, and Zachary A. Goldfarb were merely presenting the case of Obama’s critics ""primarily on the political left,"" who claim the president has failed to make good on his promises to curtail the ""shipping of jobs overseas."" That conclusion may be accurate. But the article’s regurgitation of myths about outsourcing and trade, peddled by those who benefit from restricting it, gives readers a parochial perspective that leaves them confused and uninformed about the manifestations, causes, consequences, benefits, and costs of outsourcing.   
  
Outsourcing is a politically-charged term for U.S. direct investment abroad. Although the large majority of that investment goes to rich countries, the _Post_ article claims that ""American jobs have been shifting to low-wage countries for years, and the trend has continued during Obama’s presidency."" While that may be factually true, the numbers are likely fairly small. Many more jobs have been lost to the adoption of more productive manufacturing techniques and new technologies that require less labor. And we, overall, are much wealthier for it.   
  
The article attributes 450,000 U.S. job losses to imports from China between 2008 and 2010 – a figure plucked from an ""economic model"" at the Economic Policy Institute that has been criticized by everyone in Washington but Chuck Schumer and Sherrod Brown. That estimate is the product of simplistic, inaccurate assumptions equating the value of exports and imports to set numbers of jobs created and destroyed, respectively, as if there were a linear relationship between the variables and as if imports didn’t create any U.S. jobs in, say, port operations, logistics, warehousing, retailing, designing, engineering, manufacturing, lawyering, accounting, etc. But imports do support jobs up and down the supply chain. Yet, so blindly committed are EPI’s stalwarts to the proposition that imports kill U.S. jobs that they even suggest that the number of job losses would have been greater than 450,000 had the U.S. economic slowdown not reduced demand for imports. In that tortured logic, the economic slowdown _saved or created_ U.S. jobs. But I digress.   
  
Contrary to the misconceptions so often reinforced in the media, outsourcing is not the product of U.S. businesses chasing low wages or weak environmental and labor standards abroad. Businesses are concerned about the entire cost of production, from product conception to consumption. Foreign wages and standards are but a few of the numerous considerations that factor into the ultimate investment and production decision. Those critical considerations include: the quality and skills of the work force; access to ports, rail, and other infrastructure; proximity of production location to the next phase in the supply chain or to the final market; time-to-market; the size of nearby markets; the overall economic environment in the host country or region; the political climate; the risk of asset expropriation; the regulatory environment; taxes; and the dependability of the rule of law, to name some.   




The imperative of business is not to maximize national employment, but to maximize profits. Business is thus concerned with minimizing total costs, not wages, and that is why those several factors are all among the crucial determinants of investment and production decisions. Locales with low wages and lax standards tend to be expensive places to produce all but the most rudimentary goods because, typically, those environments are associated with low labor productivity and other economic, political, and structural impediments to operating smooth, cost-effective supply chains. Most of those crucial considerations favor investment in rich countries over poor.   
  
Indeed, if low wages and lax standards were the real draw, then U.S. investment outflows wouldn’t be so heavily concentrated in rich countries. According to statistics published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, 75 percent of the $4.1 trillion stock of U.S. direct investment abroad at the end of 2011 was in Europe, Canada, Japan, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong (i.e., rich countries). In contrast, only 1.3 percent of total U.S. foreign direct investment stock is in China.   
  
Likewise, if wages and lax standards were magnets for investment, we wouldn’t see the vast sums of foreign direct investment in the United States that we do, and the United States wouldn’t be the world’s most prolific manufacturing nation. At the end of 2010, foreign direct investment in the United States totaled over $2.3 trillion, one third of which was invested in U.S. manufacturing facilities. As the president and his critics (including candidate Romney) drone on about the ravages of ""shipping jobs overseas,"" they should take a moment to note that 5.3 million Americans work for U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies (jobs ""outsourced"" from other countries). And they should note that Europe’s Airbus announced last week that it is making a $600 million investment in a 1000-worker aircraft assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama, just down the road from the $5 billion, 1800-worker steel production facility belonging to Germany's Thyssen-Krupp, which is located within a few hours’ drive of a dozen mostly foreign nameplate auto producers, who employ tens of thousands more U.S. workers and generate economic activity supporting thousands more. These investments, jobs, and related activity are the products of foreign companies outsourcing.   
  
Why do these foreign companies come to American shores to produce instead of producing at home and exporting? Because each company has determined that it makes sense from an aggregate comparative cost perspective. They’re not here because of low wages or lax enforcement of labor and environmental standards, but because all of the factors affecting cost that each company uniquely considers, weigh – in the aggregate – in favor of investing here. One very important factor for a growing number of companies is proximity to market. Shipping products long distances can be costly, particularly for time-sensitive products and parts. And having a productive presence in your largest or fastest growing market is a factor that carries significant weight. Exporting is not always the best way to serve foreign demand.   
  
But outsourcing has been stigmatized as a process whereby U.S. factories are disassembled rafter-by-rafter, machine-by-machine, bolt-by-bolt and then reassembled in some foreign location for the purpose of producing goods for sale back in the United States. There may be a few instances where that accurately depicts what took place, but it is simply inaccurate to generalize from those cases. According to the BEA research described in these two papers (Griswold and Slaughter), between 90 and 93 percent of U.S. outsourcing – investment abroad – is for the purpose of serving foreign demand. Only between 7 and 10 percent of that investment is for the purpose of making sales back to the United States.   
  
In 2009, U.S. multinationals sold over $6 trillion worth of goods and services in the foreign countries in which they operate, which was nearly quadruple the value of all U.S. exports that year. Outsourcing helps make U.S. multinational corporations more competitive, and the profits they earn abroad (even if they’re not repatriated) underwrite investment and hiring by the parent companies in the United States. Typically, the U.S. companies that are investing abroad are the same companies that are investing in the United States for reasons that include the fact that U.S. MNC investment abroad tends to spur complementary investment and hiring in the U.S. parent operations.   
  
The capacity to outsource also serves another crucial, underappreciated function: to safeguard against bad U.S. policy. Like tax competition, outsourcing provides alternatives for businesses, which help discipline sub-optimal or punitive government policy. Because of globalization and outsourcing, businesses can choose to produce and operate in other countries, where the economic and political environments may be more favorable. As more and more companies undertake these comparative aggregate cost-of-doing-business assessments, governments will have to think long and hard about their policies.   
  
Governments are now competing with each other to attract the financial, physical, and human capital necessary to nourish high value-added, innovation-driven, 21st century economies. Restricting or taxing outsourcing as a means of trapping that investment wouldn’t be prudent. It would render U.S.businesses less competitive, and ultimately reduce employment, compensation, and economic activity. In this globalized economy, policymakers cannot compel investment, production, and hiring through threat or mandate without killing the golden goose. But they can incentive U.S.companies to return some operations stateside and foreign firms to invest more here by adopting and maintaining favorable policies.   
  
According to the results of a survey of over 13,000 business executives worldwide published in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report 2011/12, there are 57 countries with less burdensome regulations than the United States. That same survey found that business executives are increasingly concerned about crony capitalism in the United States, ranking the U.S. 50th out of 142 economies in terms of the government's ability to keep an arms-length relationship with the private sector. Then consider the fact that the United States has the highest corporate tax rate among all OECD countries. Add to that the prevalence of frivolous lawsuits, political uncertainty, out-of-control government spending, the dearth of skilled workers, uncertainty about the tax burden come 2013, and it starts to become clear why U.S. companies might consider investing and producing abroad. But policymakers can improve policy -- in theory, at least.   
  
It boils down to this. About 95 percent of the world’s consumers and workers live outside the United States. We live in a world where U.S. companies have much more competition on the supply side, much greater opportunity on the demand side, and far greater potential for tapping into a global division of labor (i.e., collaborating across borders in production) than 50, 20, even 5 years ago. After a very long slumber, the rest of the world has come on-line. We should embrace, not curse, that development.   
  
In a globalized economy, outsourcing is a natural consequence of competition. And policy competition is the natural consequence of outsourcing. Let's encourage this process.

There’s lots of hullabaloo over the supposedly tied all time temperature record of 117°F in Las Vegas on June 29th, and the potential for a new all-time temperature record in Death Valley, which would negate the all time world record of 134F set on July 10th, 1913, since the previous world record in Libya of 136.4°F (58°C) was recently said to be unreliable. More on Death Valley in the next post, but for now let’s look at Las Vegas.
I don’t know where NBC news got 117°F where they say:
The high temperature officially hit 117 degrees at Las Vegas-McCarran International Airport — equaling the airport’s record
Even Drudge reported this.
Did NBC make this up? It wouldn’t be the first time they made up a news report to make it more spectacular. The official report from NWS Las Vegas for June 29th says 115°F:

Interesting to note that NWS Las Vegas has followed the lead of the Surface Stations project, and on their main web page today, provided photos of each weather station…well almost, they don’t have photos of the Ellis AFB weather station, just the tarmac. 5 out of six isn’t bad though, I’ll give them props for effort.

Their caption reads:
Although there are 6 official weather stations in the Las Vegas Valley, our long-term climate station is at McCarran Airport. Most weather stations are located at airports since the aviation community relies heavily on weather data for flights.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe preliminary numbers for August’s weather are coming in from some countries. For western Europe the picture is becoming clear: August was cold and wet, with strong notes of winter.
Germany: 1.5°C cooler than normal, snow
Germany’s Deutsche Wetterdienst (German Weather Service) reports that August in Germany, at a mean temperature of 16.0°C, was 0.5°C colder than the mean of the international 1961-1990 reference period. Compared to the 1981-2010 reference period, August 2014 was 1.5°C colder than normal. It was Germany’s coldest August in 8 years.  The summerlike temperatures at the start of the month faded as the month progressed and the weather turned autumn-like, especially the last third of the month. The result in total was a cooler, wetter and less sunny August.
The Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) collects and evaluates data from 2000 measurement stations scattered across the country. On August 24 it even snowed 4 cm on Germany’s highest peak Zugspitze (Read here).
Overall the data show that Germany’s annual mean temperatures have been dropping over the last 17 years (a period, some scientists say, that is necessary before one can speak of a climate trend):

As Germany cools, one has to ask how much longer the DWD intends to keep misleading the public with its logo at its website, which depicts an accelerating warming. When asked about the reality-remote logo, the DWD said they would consider the matter when it revamps its website in the future. They didn’t seem too concerned about possibly misleading the public (also read here).
Also Germany’s long-term summertime precipitation trends show absolute normalcy, see Grafik 4 at EIKE.
Austria: “1.1 °C colder than climatological mean”

Austria’s national ZAMG weather service also is reporting a cold and dark August: 19% less sunshine, the 14th least sunny August since sunshine measurements started in 1884. In Austria it also was much cooler than normal, posting an anomaly of -1.1°C.
Like Germany, Austria also saw its coldest August since 2006. Austria also had forecasts of snow already in mid August.
UK: “…one of the chilliest in decades”!
Not only Central Europe saw a cold August, but so did the United Kingdom. Once again the once-predicted global warming-caused barbecue summers remain elusive.
The UK Met Office here announced that the UK’s mean August temperature came in at 13.8°C , or 1.1°C below the long-term average. That would make it the coolest August since 1993. Also the UK’s Daily Mail writes of an August charcterised by forecaasts of snow that included warnings of the “coldest August spell in a century“.
The Weather Channel (TWC) earlier this month was calling August in Great Britain and Europe “one of the chilliest in decades“.
Also even last winter’s snow refused to melt. The online SCOTSMAN writes (my emphasis):
RECORD numbers of snow patches have remained on Scottish mountains this year despite warm summer temperatures and the impact of global warming, a new survey has revealed.
The annual study, carried out every August by a team of volunteers and published by the Royal Meteorological Society, showed nearly 300 remnants of last winter’s snowfall have failed to melt.
This is the highest number since a Scottish national snow survey began seven years ago, and a dramatic increase on the 24 to 81 patches recorded in previous seasons.”

"Digital tools offer a ray of hope for conservationists in an era when the need for more data to better understand the natural world is ever increasing. From combating rhino poaching in Africa to tracking polar bears in the Arctic the remit for using digital tools in conservation is vast.  And in digital conservation no project is too big or too small. Every year during the spring and summer thousands of interested individuals submit photos to the Bumblebee Conservation Trust to find out what Bombus species are buzzing in their gardens. Until two years ago each photo was identified, and a response provided by a lone staff member at the charity – an incredibly slow and time consuming job for one person.  The weight of this task, coupled with the question of whether volunteers could learn to identify species themselves, resulted in the formation of BeeWatch. The digital platform used in BeeWatch not only provides a setting where  amateur naturalists can learn valuable identification skills, but also increases the amount of precious data the Bumblebee Conservation Trust can readily access. This boosts knowledge about the distribution of these very important pollinators. The BeeWatch project is far from alone in using digital tools to engage citizens in science projects. The past few years have seen the rise of many platforms that allow citizens to spot, identify and catalogue different species. There’s iSPOT, which allows users to engage with an array of plant and animal species, Spider in da house for spider enthusiasts and Leafsnap to identify trees. Not only do all of these projects increase the amount of data available for research, they also help to foster relationships between people and the natural world. Encouraging this kind of citizen science through the use of digital platforms is a vital exercise for conservation research. Citizens vastly multiply the reach and manpower of projects – the ability to collect more data. But digital tools also hold the potential to provide new data collection techniques for researchers working in the field.  Concerns may still resonate around the reliability of taking a piece of digital equipment out into the field – nobody wants to suffer the loss of hard earned data due to faulty software. Researchers are all to aware that this is rarely an issue with a trusty pencil and paper. But with leaps made forward in engineering techniques to deal with difficult environments, the future is looking very promising. For many years the pioneers in the use of these tools have largely been tracking projects. The discovery of impressive bird migration and movement patterns of sharks for example has come from species monitored with the help of digital aids. Real time data collected by these technologies offers a tantalising snapshot of individual animals’ behaviour.  Advances in other digital tools have also contributed to impressions of species behaviour. Camera traps are automated digital devices that take a flash photo whenever an animal triggers their infrared sensor. Removing the need for a researcher to hide out in the field, they are used to document wildlife. Similarly, drones are being developed for a range of conservation projects around the world. These tools also minimise human disturbance, which is highly important when trying to understand the private lives of species in the natural world. The digital realm is emerging as a prominent and promising area of interest for conservation – but further development in this realm cannot be left in the hands of scholars alone. We all stand to gain from the use of digital tools and we will be hosting a conference to discuss research being done into how technology can be brought to bear to help conservation efforts around the world."

The German catastrophists-in-a-hurry media already see the earth being beyond the tipping point and every weather anomaly as a sign of human sin.
Geologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Professor of Chemistry Fritz Vahrenholt write about a prime example of media climate propaganda that one often finds in catastrophe-obsessed Germany. They write:
Michael Odenwald, who is responsible for the populist climate alarm at the German FOCUS news magazine, has struck again. On June 3, 2014 Odenwald penned the following apocalyptic article at the online Focus:
‘Drought, crop failure, ice melt, greenhouse gas record: Never has so much CO2 been measured
For the first time the concentration of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide has exceeded for an entire month a critical threshold. The consequences are an advancing global warming and the now palpable impacts.’
The 4-page article is chock full climate alarmist ideas. Lots of studies that support the catastrophe theories are listed and cited. But upon closer inspection, almost every single one of the claims is not supported by science. We’ve been through it all in detail, and so it is not necessary to repeat it again. The FOCUS chief editors would be well-advised to have Odenwald’s  articles to first be checked by independent scientists. Of course here we do not mean member of the PIK (Potsdam Institute). When one reads the FOCUS alarm-piece, one gets the uneasy feeling that the PIK scientists may have probably participated in writing the text…
Reading Odenwald’s claim that the 400 ppm level is “a critical threshold” and backs it up with anecdotes, one gets the impression that he thinks we have already gone beyond the point of no return and that CO2 emitted by man is now the sole cause of all bad weather. Years.
What does this tell us about journalism? If you cannot properly analyze anything, thus making you completely useless to do any practical job, then become a journalist.

"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) More than 1, 300 lives are cut short each year in the Los Angeles area because of air pollution, scientists say. Now, after years of work, regulators are getting ready to adopt their most substantial plan in more than a decade to do something about it. The proposal is outlined in   pages from the South Coast Air Quality Management District, whose jurisdiction extends across Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Not surprisingly, it has set off debate, as critics have called the plan too lenient on industry. “California has made clear that it intends to be a leader on environmental issues,” said Angela Johnson Meszaros, a staff attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group. “And here we’ve got the Los Angeles air agency not doing all that it can. ” All sides recognize that industries under the agency’s regulatory power  —   including refineries, ports and warehouses  —   must adopt cleaner technologies. The agreement breaks down over how to get there. The draft blueprint would adopt some tougher emissions rules. But it also calls for a carrot approach: roughly $15 billion in handouts over the next 15 years to encourage polluters to clean up. Some community leaders have portrayed the incentives  —   which would surely involve tax increases  —   as a form of corporate welfare at the expense of   families. But supporters of the plan have argued that they are needed to avoid stifling business. Smaller operators, for example, may not be able to afford a new, cleaner truck. “Obviously you can’t make everybody happy,” said Philip M. Fine, deputy executive officer for the air district. “But we think we’ve developed a sensible, comprehensive and regulatory approach. ” At a public meeting last Friday, the air agency’s board was supposed to vote on a final version of the plan. Hundreds of people showed up, filling overflow rooms. Testimony included stories of the personal toll that asthma is taking on young Californians. Business leaders warned of job losses if the plan were amended to add new rules. In the end, the board postponed the vote, citing the unexpected absence of a member. They’ll try again next month.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a bid to protect consumers and investors. The Berlin-based consumer investor protection organization Verbraucherzentrale für Kapitalanleger (VzfK) has issued a press release here warning Deutsche Bank AG of the high risks of investments in “dubious renewable energy companies” and their projects after a string of spectacular insolvencies.
Hat-tip: EIKE.
What follows is the VzfK press release, translated to English:
The Verbraucherzentrale für Kapitalanleger [Consumer Agency for Investors] has sent an open letter to Jürgen Fitschen, the spokesman of the board of directors of Deutsche Bank AG, warning of engagement in the sector of renewable energies. The VzfK especially requests a critical review of customer relations to controversial project developer juwi AG based in Wörrstadt.
The VzfK argues that the spectacular insolvency of Prokon, Windwärts, Windreich, Solar Millennium AG and many other dubious renewable energy companies leads us to expect further damage not only to capital investors, but also to shareholders of credit institutes due to the sheer grievances in the sector of renewable energies. The VzfK requests the Deutsche Bank board of directors to assure that the damage to Deutsche Bank AG, its shareholders, and customers be minimized through appropriate portfolio measures and credit decisions. Especially requested is a critical review of the credit engagement that has come under fire because of the corruption scandal in Thuringia and controversial wind projects in the Hochtaunus nature reserve by project developer juwi AG.
Referring to the federal government’s Council of Expert Advisors the VzfK expects the EEG renewable energy feed-in system has to collapse and that economic damage of at least triple-digit billions are to be expected. Already today consumers are groaning and German industry are burdened by ludicrously high costs compared to other European countries and internationally. Energy prices are often more than 50% higher than those in neighboring countries or in the USA. In other words: German workers, as electric power customers, are paying for a gigantic job destruction program. The EEG system is only forcing the chemical industry and other energy-intensive industries to move abroad.
Dr. Martin Weimann, Chairman of the VzfK: “We ask the board to use the societal and political influence of Deutsche Bank AG to act to bring about a stop to the EEG feed-in system and to usher a fundamental reform for the interests of the stakeholders.“
In the letter itself, Weimann writes:
Should the renewable energy support continue to develop further and go on unbraked, burdens to the economy to the tune of over one trillion euros are to be feared.”

 _Global Science Report is a weekly feature from the Center for the Study of Science, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
  
The good news keeps coming in about sea level rise—or more precisely, Antarctica’s (minimal) contribution to it. Last time, we reviewed recent scientific findings indicating Antarctica was on the verge of gaining ice mass (and thus acting to draw down global sea level) as a slightly warmer Southern Ocean results in increasing snow accumulation which acts to offset ice loss from its peripheral (marine‐​terminating) glaciers. Without a contribution from Antarctica, alarming visions of a large and rapid sea level rise this century—upwards of a meter (and by some reckoning up to 6 meters)—are pretty much out the door. _Sans_ Antarctica, we are looking at a foot to foot‐​and‐​a‐​half of rise, give or take a few inches. Such an amount will undoubtedly require some adjustment and adaptation, but will not involve a wrenching transformation of society. Most of us probably wouldn’t even notice. Consider that, due to a combination of geology and oceanic warming, this same amount (or more) has been experienced in many East Coast locations in the last 100 years.   
  
  
The good science news may be one reason why global warming has been so absent in the election debates. In response, last week, the Union of Concerned Scientists helped a collection of local government officials and scientists from Florida pen an open letter to the candidates imploring them to address the issue of sea level rise during their third and final debate (held in Boca Raton). They didn’t.   
  
  
It is a good thing that they left the issue alone, for in this week’s _Nature_ magazine comes more evidence that Antarctica is perhaps not going to be the great sea level rise contributor that other research as made it out to be (e.g. Velicogna et al., 2009; Rignot et al., 2011).   
  
  
Matt King, from Newcastle University, and colleagues set out to refine the Antarctic ice mass change calculations that have been performed using data collected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. GRACE determines how the mass is changing underneath the satellite by measuring temporal variations in the pull of gravity. If the strength of the local gravitational attraction increases over time, then it is inferred that the local mass must be increasing (and vice versa). This is a handy tool for assessing trends in dynamic ice/​snow mass in places like Greenland and Antarctica.   
  
  
But, variations in the ice/​snow burden are not the only thing that can change the gravitational pull observed by the GRACE satellite. The ground underlying the ice and snow may be changing as well. And, in fact, it is. The ground in many places around the world is still adjusting to the burdening and subsequent unburdening from the coming and going of the massive amount of snow and ice from the last ice age (and its termination). This process is known as glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA).   
  
  
The problem is that while we understand that GIA is taking place, we really don’t precisely know the details, like where, when, and how fast—especially over sparsely monitored and studied places like Antarctica.   
  
  
Two years ago, a study was published that showed that the GIA model used in most GRACE‐​based studies was in error, and that when it was corrected, the rate of calculated ice mass loss from across Antarctica declined by some 40 percent (from ~150 gigatons/​yr to ~87 Gt/​yr). Since it takes about 374 Gt of melted ice to produce 1 millimeter of global sea level rise, these findings indicated that Antarctica was contributing to sea level rise at a rate of about one‐​quarter of a millimeter per year (or about 1 hundredth of an inch per year). We detailed that finding, by Xiaoping Wu and colleagues, in a Cato _Current Wisdom_ article in October of 2010.   
  
  
Now along comes the new study Matt King et al. (2012) that further refines the local GIA over Antarctica. Here is how they did it:   




Here we applied a new GIA model (W12a) to GRACE data to estimate the ice‐​mass balance for 26 independent Antarctic drainage basins from August 2002 to December 2010. The W12a model comprises a glaciologically self‐​consistent ice history constrained to fit data that delimit past ice extent and elevation, and an Earth viscosity model chosen such that GIA predictions from W12a best fit a suite of relative sea‐​level records around Antarctica. The advance of W12a on previous models applied to GRACE data is illustrated by the misfit to GPS uplift rates being halved. Our use of W12a addresses the dominant GRACE‐​related error in previous Antarctic analyses.



With this new model in hand, they were able to produce a new estimate of the rate of ice mass change over Antarctica from 2002 through 2010. That estimate is a loss of only 69 Gt/​yr (+/- 18Gt/​yr). And further, they found no statistically significant change in this rate when averaged over the whole continent—in contrast to other prominent studies (e.g. Rignot et al., 2011) which claimed a significant acceleration was taking place.   
  
  
So King and colleagues’ latest refinement puts the Antarctic contribution to global sea level rise at a rate of about one‐​fifth of a millimeter per year (or in English units, 0.71 inches per century).   
  
  
Without a significantly large acceleration—and recall the King et al. found none—this is something that we can all live with for along time to come.

David Rose of the Mail on Sunday is having a go at the Committee on Climate Change for their denial of the points raised in his article last week and this graph, which was sourced from NCAR and used in the Economist article noted on WUWT.

Rather stubborn, these blokes.
Excerpt:
The official watchdog that advises the Government on greenhouse gas emissions targets has launched an astonishing attack on The Mail on Sunday – for accurately reporting that alarming predictions of global warming are wrong.

We disclosed that although highly influential computer models are still estimating huge rises in world temperatures, there has been no statistically significant increase for more than 16 years.
Despite our revelation earlier this month, backed up by a scientifically researched graph, the Committee on Climate Change still clings to flawed predictions.
Leading the attack is committee member Sir Brian Hoskins, who is also director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change at Imperial College, London. In a blog on the Committee on Climate Change’s website, Sir Brian insisted: ‘The scientific basis for significant long-term climate risks remains robust, despite the points raised .  .  . Early and deep cuts in emissions are still required.’
He also claimed our report ‘misunderstood’ the value of computer models. Yet in an interview three years ago, Sir Brian conceded that when he started out as a climate scientist, the models were ‘pretty lousy, and they’re still pretty lousy, really’.
Our graph earlier this month was reproduced from a version first drawn by Dr Ed Hawkins, of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science. Last week it was reprinted as part of a four-page report in The Economist.

"If you build it, they will come. They will come because of its proximity to London – even if it now exists “only as a flying bishop, a large station, a dream horse and the future”, as Ebbsfleet was described back in November 2010. But will a new garden city there be a success? Ebbsfleet’s future has been thrust into the limelight, having featured in George Osborne’s 2014 budget. It is to be the first planned English garden city since the founding of Welwyn Garden City in 1920. The budget proposes that Ebbsfleet may be the beginning of a future wave of garden cities, with a government published prospectus on their development due next month.  In light of this, we should revisit the garden city’s origins to understand its social principles and to better assess its reuse in current debates as a model for building new communities. The garden city takes its name from Ebenezer Howard’s book, popularly known in editions published after 1902 as “Garden Cities of To-morrow”. Howard’s book and campaigning inspired the development of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City, both in Hertfordshire. These developments attempted to reconcile the best of urban and rural qualities.  In theory at least they allowed housing densities that reflected those of cities, but were punctuated by private and common garden areas. Their populations and businesses were to be connected to other cities via the rail network and were protected by a green belt, which opened up the countryside to residents, before this was a common planning feature. One way of thinking about garden cities is that they looked and felt like the country, but had the infrastructure of small cities. Although Letchworth and Welwyn were the only sites built that sufficiently corresponded to Howard’s ideals, they have shaped the subsequent progression of 20th-century suburban developments throughout England. They have done so mainly because of their bucolic aesthetic, conjuring images of life in the Home Counties that echo with the cultural scripts of English Conservatism. Indeed, it is the prioritisation of the architectural design of garden cities over the economic, political and social bases of Howard’s ideals that explains the re-emergence of the term in current policy debates. Howard’s book in its earliest 1898 edition was “To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Reform”. Through the garden city, Howard sought to establish a reforming system of land ownership and estate management along co-operative principles, according to which the municipal land was owned by the residents collectively, and in perpetuity. Agriculturally and economically, the garden city was to be self-sustaining, largely serving its population’s food and employment needs.  In Howard’s ideal, one garden city would be connected to other garden cities of equivalent sizes and a slightly larger central city through the rail network. This is a far cry from the over-riding function of the dormitory town that Welwyn would become and that is clearly assumed in the plans for Ebbsfleet, as slim as they are at this stage. Howard offered a utopian model to counteract the inner-city overcrowding that plagued the Victorian city. Osborne’s ventriloquism uses the garden city instead to feed the dystopian logic of the London housing market and further entrench its economic dominance over the rest of the country. Oh, and it will also help to protect the investors in a new Paramount Pictures theme park nearby. By adopting Howard’s terminology for his Ebbsfleet proposals, the chancellor presents a picture postcard version of the “garden city”, all the while eliding its political and social meanings. In reality, this is a thin veil over his rather prosaic and insufficient house-building policy. This tactic is paralleled by the shadow chancellor’s announcement last November that an incoming Labour government would re-activate the New Towns tradition of building. By this, Ed Balls sought to evoke a legacy of state-planning that has its origins in the Attlee administration’s New Towns Act of 1946.  This raiding of the past in search of political times where today’s major parties can draw comfort (another example is Osborne’s contemporary policy of “Help to Buy” evoking the Thatcher administration’s “Right to Buy”) exemplifies the lack of creativity – and weakness – of contemporary political debate.  A new wave of garden cities across the UK is certainly worth considering, but we must at least have a full debate about their location – must they all be located in the south of England? And we really should revisit the social ideas behind the original garden cities, as well as assessing their aesthetic merits. Whatever you think of the eventual architecture, Howard’s plans unsettled orthodoxy about how we should build – and it is this aspect of the garden cities we should aspire to emulate."

"**It is not yet known when all care home residents in Wales will be able to receive a Covid-19 vaccine.**
The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.
But Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton could not say when care home residents would receive it due to storage temperature requirements.
Care home residents and staff are among those identified as a top priority.
Other priority groups include health and social care workers and over-80s.
The jab offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness and the Welsh Government hopes the first vaccines will be given within seven to 14 days.
But Dr Atherton said getting the vaccines to care homes was a ""work in progress"" and ""very difficult"" to do because it needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C.
Initially it will have to be provided to a limited number of sites, he said.
""We're trying to find ways, even with this vaccine, to provide a more disseminated approach to distribution.
""There are of course other vaccines in the pipeline - the Oxford vaccine for example which doesn't have such stringent requirements around temperature management and control.
""As that comes online, as we hope, that will that will give us a further ability to work our way through those priority lists.""
Dr Atherton added: ""I can't give you an exact date or a time frame, but we're working through that process as quickly as we can.
""Because those elderly residents, usually elderly in care homes, are one of our highest priorities.""
Everyone over 50 will be offered the vaccine in the coming months.
The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19.
It will be ""well into next year"" before the entire Welsh population has been vaccinated against Covid-19, Dr Atherton said, adding it would be ""a massive undertaking"".
Vaccines for younger people will be available after the over-50s have had their jabs, according to Gill Richardson, who chairs the Welsh Government's Covid-19 vaccine programme board.
Dr Richardson said the Welsh Government was taking steps to ensure the vaccination programme did not affect other NHS services.
""People will be invited to come and have the vaccine through the NHS - we'll be holding special vaccine clinics to make sure people can receive the jab, while keeping normal NHS services free to see people,"" she said at the Welsh Government press briefing.
""The vaccine is the best way to protect people, but no-one will be forced to have it if they don't want it,"" Dr Richardson said.
Dr Atherton added that a Public Health Wales survey had shown that 70% of people would be willing to have the vaccine, and 60% would want their children to have it.
There are plans for people who have had a jab to be given a record card but it is not anticipated that hospitality businesses in Wales will turn away people who cannot prove they have been vaccinated, according to Dr Richardson.
""We hope that people will come and have this extremely precious and significant commodity for free of their own volition, but there's no compulsion,"" she said.
The Welsh Government said two areas had been identified as appropriate delivery sites for the vaccine and local health boards would collect the vaccines directly from these sites.
Dr Richardson declined to say where the sites were, but added: ""We have looked very carefully at all the storage parameters and also ease of distribution so we can get this vaccine out as swiftly as possible to the immunisers who will need it in each of the health boards and trusts.""
People will be sent appointments with details of the location where they will receive the vaccination, dependent on where they are in the schedule and risk, it added.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""Today's news is a small glimmer of light at the end of what has been a long and dark tunnel...
""We must all continue to do our bit to prevent the spread of coronavirus - regular hand washing, social distancing, and wearing a face covering where required to protect yourself and others.""
Dr Richardson said serious side effects from the new vaccine were ""extremely rare"".
She said people might get a sore arm or occasionally a raised temperature, but ""it's a very safe vaccine"".
She added that the ""safety profiles"" were ""really good"" for the elderly and those that have clinical conditions.
""We are extremely pleased to be offering what we feel is a very safe vaccine to the Welsh population,"" she added.
Dr Atherton said it was not yet known whether the vaccine will stop transmission of the virus.
He said it is known from data submitted by the company ""it's pretty good"" at stopping people getting infected and having serious infections.
""We just don't know yet whether it will stop transmission,"" he told the press briefing.
""That will only be known to us in the fullness of time when vaccines are rolled out.""
Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""This is fantastic news and is what we have all been waiting forâ¦ it is vaccines like this one that will give us the protection needed to reclaim our lives.""
Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader in Westminster and MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, said the news was ""fantastic"" and there was ""a cloud beginning to lift"", especially for those in care homes and people who have been isolated.
""There's this prospect of being reunited with loved ones,"" she said. ""We really need some hope. It's such good news.""
Conservative MS for Aberconwy Janet Finch-Saunders said she had no concerns about the plans for the mass vaccination.
""The concern was always about whether a vaccine could be found and whether it would be approved, so today is a good day,"" she said.
As the NHS prepares for a challenging winter, with the additional pressures of delivering the vaccine, staff welcomed the news.
Dai Samuel, a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital who had coronavirus earlier this year, said: ""Excellent news and reflects the immense efforts and superb work undertaken by the medical research community.""
It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how fight Covid-19 and build immunity.
The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, as two shots are needed.
It is the fastest ever vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same developmental steps that normally span a decade."

Scientists have known for decades that, as global carbon dioxide levels increase, so too does the standing biomass of the world’s plants. Carbon dioxide is a strong plant fertilizer.   
  
As plants grow better, they also increasingly act as carbon sinks as they convert atmospheric carbon dioxide, with a little help from water and sunshine, into carbohydrates stored as biomass. Some of that carbon is returned to the air annually through decomposition, but other portions are are stored for longer periods in the soil, downed logs, houses, etc. This plant-based carbon sink helps to offset the growth of global carbon dioxide emissions from human activities (primarily from the burning of fossil fuels). Together, the terrestrial carbon sink, along with the oceanic carbon sink, annually takes up more than half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions—and remarkably, as global CO2 emissions have increased, so too has the global CO2 sink.   
  
But now comes new evidence that plants may be helping to combat global warming through another mechanism as well, slowing the build-up of the atmospheric concentration of methane (a greenhouse gas some 25 times more effective than CO2 on a molecule-for-molecule bases at adding pressure for the world to warm).   
  
As shown in the fugure below the jump, the growth rate of the atmospheric concentration of methane (CH4)—which is projected by the IPCC to be rising rapidly—began slowing down in the early 1990s and even topped out for a few years in the mid-2000s. Since about 2007, the atmospheric concentration of CH4 has been rising again, but only at about half that of the pre-1990 rate.   






Figure 1. Atmospheric methane concentration (source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).This behavior is not understood by climate scientists. It contravenes alarmist scenarios of runaway global warming fueled by a positive methane feedback (the scenario for which is that warming leads to thawing of the arctic permafrost, which releases methane, which leads to more warming, and so on).   
  
A team of scientists from Lund University and Stockholm University set out to investigate recent claims that some plants release methane and are therefore a source of global methane emissions. They set up instruments to measure methane exchange on a collection of individual branches of four different tree species in a 100-year-old forest in central Sweden. A set of control experiments was also conducted in a laboratory setting. They just published their findings in the journal _Geophysical Research Letters_. Much to their surprise, the researchers found that the trees (both in the field and in the lab) were _taking up_ methane rather than releasing it. They suggest that the presence of a “bacteria with the ability to consume [methane] would be a possible explanation for [the observed behavior].”   
  
That’s not the only good news.   
  
The researchers then executed the extremely risky (and oft ill-advised) maneuver of scaling up from a few tree branches in central Sweden to the level of the global forest canopy. Their research “indicates that the canopy might play an equally important role [in CH4 uptake] as the soil in the global context.” In other words, their results show that trees are playing a large (and hitherto unknown) role as a sink in the global methane cycle.   
  
The culprit? _Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide_.   
  
In the authors’ own words (with my emphasis): 



Two recent studies give alternative explanations to the slow-down in the growth rate of atmospheric methane in the last decades. One of them indicates that it is due to a stabilization of fossil-fuel emissions (Aydin et al., 2011) whereas the other explains it by a decrease in microbial methane sources in the northern hemisphere (Kai et al., 2011). Our results offer a third explanation: _that an increasing amount of CH4 has been taken up_ _by vegetation during the last decades as a consequence of increased greenness (Myneni et al., 1997), NPP [net primary production] (Nemani et al., 2003) and GPP [gross primary production] (Chen et al., 2006) as observed by satellite remote sensing._



This is still highly a highly speculative result and one that will require a heck of a lot more study and independent confirmation. But it is a novel finding and goes to show that there is still a lot of interesting research ongoing in the field of climate (change), and that most definitely the science is not “settled.”

 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**



State governments have been in an expansionary phase in recent years. Even though U.S. economic growth since the last recession has been sluggish, general fund revenues of state governments have grown 33 percent since 2010. Some of the nation’s governors have used the growing revenues to expand spending programs, while others have pursued tax cuts and tax reforms.



That is the backdrop to this year’s 13th biennial fiscal report card on the governors, which examines state budget actions since 2014. It uses statistical data to grade the governors on their taxing and spending records—governors who have cut taxes and spending the most receive the highest grades, while those who have increased taxes and spending the most receive the lowest grades.



Five governors were awarded an “A” on this report: Paul LePage of Maine, Pat McCrory of North Carolina, Rick Scott of Florida, Doug Ducey of Arizona, and Mike Pence of Indiana. Ten governors were awarded an “F”: Robert Bentley of Alabama, Peter Shumlin of Vermont, Jerry Brown of California, David Ige of Hawaii, Dan Malloy of Connecticut, Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, Kate Brown of Oregon, Jay Inslee of Washington, and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania.



With the growing revenues of recent years, most states have balanced their short‐​term budgets without major problems, but many states face large challenges ahead. Medicaid costs are rising, and federal aid for this huge health program will likely be reduced in coming years. At the same time, many states have high levels of unfunded liabilities in their pension and retiree health plans. Those factors will create pressure for states to raise taxes. Yet global economic competition demands that states improve their investment climates by cutting tax rates, particularly on businesses, entrepreneurs, and skilled workers.



This report discusses fiscal policy trends and examines the tax and spending actions of each governor in detail. The hope is that the report encourages more state policymakers to follow the fiscal approaches of the top‐​scoring governors.





  
Governors play a key role in state fiscal policy. They propose budgets, recommend tax changes, and sign or veto tax and spending bills. When the economy is growing, governors can use rising revenues to expand programs or they can return extra revenues to citizens through tax cuts. When the economy is stagnant, governors can raise taxes to close budget gaps or they can trim spending.



This report grades governors on their fiscal policies from a limited-government perspective. Governors receiving an A are those who have cut taxes and spending the most, while governors receiving an F raised taxes and spending the most. The grading mechanism is based on seven variables, including two spending variables, one revenue variable, and four tax-rate variables. The same methodology was used on Cato's 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 fiscal report cards.



The results are data-driven. They account for tax and spending actions that affect short-term budgets in the states. But they do not account for longer-term or structural changes that governors may make, such as reforms to state pension plans. Thus the results provide one measure of how fiscally conservative each governor is, but they do not reflect all the fiscal actions that governors make.



Tax and spending data for the report come from the National Association of State Budget Officers, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Tax Foundation, the budget agencies of the states, and news articles in _State Tax Notes_ and other sources. The data cover the period January 2014 through August 2016, which was a time of budget expansion in most states.1 The report covers 47 governors. It excludes the governors of Kentucky and Louisiana because of their short time in office, and it excludes Alaska's governor because of peculiarities in that state's budget.



The following section discusses the highest-scoring governors, and it reviews some recent policy trends. The section after that looks at the outlook for state budgets, with a focus on the longer-term burdens of debt and underfunded retirement plans. Appendix A discusses the report card methodology. Appendix B provides summaries of the fiscal records of the 47 governors included in this report.





  
Table 1 presents the overall grades for the governors. Scores ranging from 0 to 100 were calculated for each governor based on seven tax and spending variables. Scores closer to 100 indicate governors who favored smaller-government policies. The numerical scores were converted to the letter grades A to F.



 **Table 1. Overall Grades for the Governors**







  
The highest-scoring governors are those who supported the most spending restraint and tax cuts. Here are the five governors who received grades of A:



Paul LePage of Maine has been a staunch fiscal conservative. He has held down spending growth, and state government employment has fallen 9 percent since he took office. LePage has been a persistent tax cutter. In 2011 he approved large income tax cuts, which reduced the top individual rate and simplified tax brackets. In 2015 he vetoed a tax-cut plan passed by the legislature partly because the cut was not large enough. The legislature overrode him, and Maine enjoyed another income tax reduction. In 2016 LePage pushed for more reforms, including estate tax repeal and further income tax rate cuts.



Pat McCrory of North Carolina came into office promising major tax reforms, and he has delivered. In 2013 he signed legislation to replace individual income tax rates of 6.0, 7.0, and 7.75 percent with a single rate of 5.8 percent. That rate was later reduced to 5.75 percent. The law also increased standard deductions, repealed the estate tax, and cut the corporate tax rate from 6.9 to 4.0 percent, with a scheduled fall to 3.0 percent next year. In 2015 McCrory approved a further individual income tax cut from 5.75 to 5.5 percent. McCrory has matched his tax cuts with spending restraint. The general fund budget will be just 8 percent higher in 2017 than it was when the governor took office in 2013.



Rick Scott of Florida says that he wants to make Florida the best state for business in the nation, and tax cuts are a key part of his strategy. In 2012 Scott raised the exemption level for the corporate income tax, which eliminated the burden for thousands of small businesses. In 2014 he signed into law a $400 million cut to vehicle fees. In 2015 Scott approved a cut to the state's tax on communication services and reductions in sales taxes and business taxes. In 2016 he approved the elimination of sales taxes on manufacturing equipment, which is an important pro-investment reform. Scott also scored well on spending, and he has trimmed state government employment by 4 percent.



Doug Ducey of Arizona was the head of Cold Stone Creamery, and he has brought his business approach to the governor's office. He has overseen lean budgets, with general fund spending on track to rise just 2 percent between 2015 and 2017. He approved major pension reforms, including trimming benefit costs and giving new state employees the option of a defined contribution plan. Ducey has approved substantial tax cuts, including ending sales taxes on some business purchases, reducing insurance premium taxes, increasing depreciation deductions, and indexing Arizona's income tax brackets for inflation.



Mike Pence of Indiana has been a champion tax cutter and fairly frugal on spending. In 2013 he signed into law a cut to Indiana's flat individual income tax rate from 3.4 percent to 3.23 percent. He also approved a repeal of Indiana's inheritance tax. In 2014 he cut the corporate income tax rate, which has fallen from 7.5 percent to 6.25 percent since 2014, and is scheduled to fall to 4.9 percent in coming years. Pence also reduced property taxes on business equipment to spur increased capital spending. Indiana's ranking on the Tax Foundation's business competitiveness index has risen to eighth-highest in the nation.





  
Supporters of smaller government lament that politicians of both major parties tax and spend too much. While that is true, Cato report cards have found that Republican governors are more fiscally conservative, on average, than Democratic governors. In the 2008 report, Republican and Democratic governors had average scores of 55 and 46, respectively. In the 2010 report, they had average scores of 55 and 47. In the 2012 report, they had average scores of 57 and 43. In the 2014 report, they had average scores of 57 and 42.



That pattern continues in the 2016 report card. This time, Republican and Democratic governors had average scores of 54 and 43, respectively. And, on average, Republicans received higher scores than Democrats on both spending and taxes.



Three of the 10 F grades on this report went to Republicans, but none of the five A grades went to Democrats. When states develop budget gaps, Democratic governors often pursue tax increases to regain budget balance, while Republicans tend to pursue spending restraint. And when the economy is growing and state coffers are full, Democrats increase spending, while Republicans tend to both increase spending and pursue tax cuts.





  
Figure 1 shows state general fund spending since 2000, based on data from the National Association of State Budget Officers.2 Spending soared between 2002 and 2008, and then it fell during the recession as states trimmed their budgets.3 Spending has bounced back strongly in recent years, growing 4.1 percent in 2013, 4.6 percent in 2014, 4.1 percent in 2015, 5.6 percent in 2016, and a projected 2.5 percent in 2017.



 **Figure 1. State General Fund Spending**  




A key driver of state spending growth is Medicaid. This giant program pays for health care and long-term care for 67 million people with moderate incomes.4 The program is funded jointly by federal and state taxpayers. It is the largest component of state budgets, accounting for 26 percent of total spending.5



Medicaid has grown rapidly for years, and the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) expanded it even more.6 For states that implement the ACA's expanded Medicaid coverage, the federal government is paying 100 percent of the costs of through 2016, and then a declining share after that. As the federal cost share declines, state budgets will be put under more stress. But aside from the federal portion of Medicaid, the state-funded portion of the program is also growing quickly and stressing budgets. State-funded Medicaid spending grew 6.0 percent in 2015 and an estimated 8.3 percent in 2016.7



On the revenue side of state budgets, policymakers have been enacting a mix of tax cuts and tax increases. Overall, the states enacted a modest net tax cut in 2014 and 2015, but they swung to a net tax increase in 2016.8 Cigarette tax increases have been common, with a dozen states enacting them since 2014.9 Gasoline tax increases have also been common, with about half the states enacting them since 2013.10



There is also a trend toward reductions in individual and corporate income tax rates. There have been substantial rate cuts in Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, and Oklahoma in recent years. In some states, the revenues from income tax cuts have been partly offset with revenue increases from higher retail sales taxes.



These income tax reforms are good news, and they should help spur growth by making states more attractive for investment. However, there is also bad news regarding state efforts to attract investment, which is the proliferation of narrow tax breaks and subsidies for particular companies and industries. The classic example of such ""corporate welfare"" is the film production tax credits that most states now offer.



The 2014 Cato governors report card discussed why narrow business tax breaks and subsidies are bad policy, and research for this 2016 report confirmed that such breaks are rampant. Consider Nevada's recent tax policy. Governor Brian Sandoval imposed a huge $600 million per year tax increase on businesses, including higher license fees, an increase in the state's Modified Business Tax, and the imposition of a new Commerce Tax. At the same time, Sandoval has been eagerly handing out narrow tax breaks to Tesla, Amazon, data center companies, and other favored businesses. So Nevada's tax policy entails large increases for all businesses, but special breaks for companies favored by the politicians. That is a prescription for corruption, not long-term economic growth.





  
This report card focuses on the short-term taxing and spending decisions of the governors. But a full assessment of a governor's performance should also examine his or her policies affecting long-term fiscal health. This section looks at state debt levels, unfunded pension obligations, and unfunded retirement health obligations, and ranks the states based on those fiscal measures.





  
State and local governments are major investors in infrastructure, including highways, bridges, and schools and other facilities. A portion of this investment is financed by long-term borrowing, or the issuance of state and local bonds. The interest and principal on government bonds is paid back over time from either taxes or user fees. State and local governments have been issuing debt for infrastructure since at least 1818, when New York floated bonds to finance the Erie Canal.



However, debt is not the only way to fund infrastructure. Indeed, most state infrastructure investment is financed on a pay-as-you-go basis.11 That approach entails governments looking ahead and planning to construct needed facilities over time with an allocated portion of annual tax revenues.



Pay-as-you-go financing is generally preferable to debt financing. The Erie Canal was a big success, and it is thought to have generated positive economic returns. But that success spurred many other states at the time to borrow heavily and spend lavishly on their own, more dubious, canal schemes. State politicians in the mid-19th century overestimated the demand for canals and underestimated the construction costs. It turned out that the Erie Canal was a uniquely high-return route, while most state-sponsored canals in the 19th century were money-losing failures.12



The failures of many debt-backed state projects in the 19th century led to sweeping budget reforms. Nineteen states imposed constitutional limits on state debt issuance between 1840 and 1855.13 Further constitutional limits on state and local debt were passed in the 1870s. The limits took numerous forms, including requiring voter approval of debt issuance, limiting overall quantities of debt, and limiting the purposes for which state debt can be issued.



Today, all state governments operate within statutory and/or state constitutional limits on debt. Limits make sense because politicians have an incentive to issue debt in excess: debt-financed investment is not constrained by the unpopular need to raise current taxes, as it is for pay-as-you-go investment. Political incentives to deficit-spend can create severe economic damage if debt reaches high levels, as we have seen recently in Greece, Puerto Rico, Detroit, and other jurisdictions.



U.S. state and local government debt totaled $3 trillion in 2016.14 Table 2 shows that state and local debt per capita varies widely by state.15 The most indebted states by this measure are New York, Massachusetts, Alaska, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.



Governments in some states, such as Idaho and Wyoming, issue very little debt. They finance most of their capital expenditures on a pay-as-you-go basis. These states have per capita debt loads only one-quarter as large as the highly indebted states, and thus governments in these states are imposing much lower costs on future taxpayers.



California's budget this year discusses how the state is painting itself into a corner with debt: ""Budget challenges over the past decade resulted in a greater reliance on debt financing, rather than pay-as-you-go spending. . . . The increasing reliance on borrowing to pay for infrastructure has meant that roughly one out of every two dollars spent on infrastructure investments goes to pay interest costs, rather than construction costs. . . . Annual expenditures on debt service have steadily grown from $2.9 billion in 2000-01 to $7.7 billion in 2015-16.""16 To politicians, debt might seem like an easy way to fund infrastructure, but the servicing costs eventually eat away at current budgets.



Debt financing costs more than pay-as-you-go financing because of the interest payments, but also because governments pay substantial fees to the municipal bond industry. State and local borrowing creates an overhead cost in the form of thousands of high-paid experts in underwriting, trading, advising, bond insurance, and related activities. A study by economist Marc Joffe found that fees average about 1 percent of the principal value of municipal bonds.17 Since municipal bond issuance has averaged about $350 billion a year recently, fees are about $3.5 billion a year. That is taxpayer money that is not going toward building highways or schools.



A further cost of borrowing is the risk of corruption. The municipal bond industry has suffered from many scandals related to political influence. If you Google ""municipal bond market"" and ""pay-to-play,"" you will find story after story about bond underwriters using bribes and campaign contributions to win bond business from state and local officials.



Debt financing also makes government budgeting less transparent. Capital budgets that rely on debt are difficult for citizens to understand, especially given the myriad and complex ways that governments borrow these days. Also, citizens have less appreciation for the costs of new government projects if they do not feel the bite of current taxes to pay for them.



Perhaps the most important reason to worry about state debt is that other large fiscal burdens are looming over the states. Medicaid costs are growing rapidly, as noted. And retirement plans for government employees have large unfunded liabilities, as discussed next.



 **Table 2. State and Local Government Debt and Unfunded Pension and OPEB Liabilities (Dollars Per Capita, Ranked Highest to Lowest)**  






  
The largest component of state and local government spending is compensation for 16 million employees.18 Total wages and benefits for state and local workers was $1.4 trillion in 2015, which accounted for 53 percent of all state and local spending.19



State and local workers typically receive more generous benefit packages than do private-sector workers. On average, retirement benefits for state and local workers cost $4.80 per hour, compared to $1.23 per hour for private-sector workers. Insurance benefits (mainly health insurance) for state and local workers cost $5.43 per hour, compared to $2.59 per hour for the private sector.20 Most state and local workers receive retirement health benefits, whereas most private-sector workers do not.



The costs of government pension and retirement health benefits are expected to rise rapidly in coming years. Governments have promised their workers generous retirement benefits, but most states have not put enough money aside to pay for them. As a consequence, state and local governments will either have to cut benefits in coming years or impose higher taxes.



Let's look at pensions first. Most state and local governments provide their workers with defined-benefit (DB) pensions. Governments pre-fund their DB plans, building up assets to pay future benefits when they come due. Unfortunately, governments have overpromised benefits and underfunded their plans, creating large funding gaps. Total benefits paid by the nation's more than 500 state and local pension plans are $260 billion a year and rising.21



In a recent study, Stanford University's Joshua Rauh found that state and local pension assets in 2014 were $3.6 trillion, liabilities were $4.8 trillion, and thus unfunded liabilities were $1.2 trillion.22 State and local pension plans have only enough assets to pay 75 percent of accrued benefits.



A study by Alicia Munnell and Jean-Pierre Aubry found similar results.23 They found that the average funding level of pension plans grew during the 1990s, peaked at more than 100 percent in 2000, and then fell to just 74 percent today. That average is quite low, and there are many plans with dangerously low funding. The State of Illinois, Illinois Teachers, and Illinois Universities systems, for example, all had funding levels of 43 percent or less. For the State of Illinois, pension spending soared from $1.1 billion in 2000 to $7.7 billion in 2015, which was a substantial share of the state's $35 billion general fund budget that year.24 Major reforms are needed in such plans to reduce spending and bring liabilities in line with assets.



Pension shortfalls are actually larger than these figures indicate. Those are the officially reported figures, but financial experts think that the discount rates used to report pension liabilities are too high. Higher discount rates reduce reported liabilities and create an overly optimistic picture of pension plan health.



In his study, Rauh recalculated pension plan funding using a 2.7 percent discount rate, rather than the official average rate of 7.4 percent. His recalculated unfunded liability jumps from $1.2 trillion to $3.4 trillion. Similarly, Munnell and Aubry found that their unfunded pension liabilities jumped to $4.1 trillion if plans are estimated using a 4 percent discount rate.25 Under that assumption, the funding level of state and local pension plans averages just 45 percent.



Which states have the most underfunded pensions? Table 2 ranks the states on unfunded state and local pension liabilities per capita using the stated or official figures from Rauh. The level of pension liabilities varies widely. The highest liabilities are in New Jersey, Illinois, Alaska, Kentucky, and Connecticut. Note that using Rauh's recalculated figures at the lower discount rate, the unfunded liabilities are two or more times higher for most states.



Greater media focus on pension plans in recent years has prompted many state and local governments to trim their unfunded liabilities. But a pension report from Pew Charitable Trusts found that still only about half of the states are contributing the full ""actuarial required contributions"" to their plans, with the result that ""pension debt is continuing to increase in many states.""26



A good reform would be for states to scrap their defined-benefit (DB) pension plans for new hires, and instead offer them defined-contribution (DC) plans. Defined-contribution plans reduce risks for taxpayers and are the dominant type of retirement plan in the private sector. Alaska and Michigan have adopted DC plans for new employees, and a number of states have moved to systems that are hybrids of DB and DC.



In addition to pension liabilities, there is another type of liability that looms over state budgets: other post-employment benefits (OPEB). The main component of OPEB is retirement health care coverage, which includes benefits for early retirees before Medicare kicks in at age 65 and supplemental benefits after Medicare kicks in. California, for example, pays 100 percent of retirement medical costs for state workers after they have put in just 20 years of service.27 Very few private companies offer such generous benefits.



Total annual OPEB benefits nationwide are about $18 billion, and the costs are rising quickly as health costs grow and the number of retirees increases. In California, the share of the state's general fund budget spent on retiree health costs nearly tripled from 0.6 percent in 2001 to 1.6 percent by 2016.28



Unlike pension benefits, most state and local governments have not pre-funded OPEB at all. Annual benefits are simply paid from the general fund budget. A few states have started to prefund OPEB, but for the nation as a whole, the funding ratio — assets-to-liabilities — of state and local OPEB plans is less than 10 percent.29



Fortunately, this imprudent approach to financing OPEB has started to change. An accounting rule change in 2007 required governments to calculate and disclose unfunded OPEB obligations.30 Governments must now account for OPEB as they do their pensions, which is by estimating the future stream of promised benefits, discounting to the present value, and comparing those liabilities to plan assets.



How large are OPEB liabilities? A 2016 study by Alicia Munnell and coauthors estimated that unfunded state and local OPEB liabilities were $862 billion in 2013.31 Pew put the number at $627 billion, but the figure calculated by Munnell and coauthors captures a broader universe of plans.32 These figures are the costs of unfunded benefits that have been already accrued. But without reforms, OPEB liabilities will continue to rise as workers accrue more retiree benefits every year.



Table 2 shows that unfunded OPEB liabilities vary widely by state. The largest liabilities are in Alaska, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Hawaii. OPEB liabilities also vary dramatically across local governments. When Detroit declared bankruptcy in 2013, people pointed to the city's $3 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, but finance expert Robert Pozen noted that it also had $6 billion of unfunded OPEB, which compounded the city's fiscal woes.33



To fix OPEB funding gaps, states are beginning to trim retirement health benefits. They can do so by increasing the age of eligibility, reducing the types of benefits provided, or increasing deductibles and copays for plan members. State and local governments have substantial legal flexibility in cutting health benefits for current workers and retirees, but less so with pension benefits.



Some local governments, and at least one state (Idaho), have ended retiree health benefits for new employees. Since the 2007 accounting change, the share of state and local government workers receiving retirement health benefits has fallen to about 70 percent.34 In the private sector, just 28 percent of medium and large businesses offer their retirees such benefits.35



In sum, state governments should reduce their retirement benefits to lighten the load on future taxpayers. Unfunded benefits are not just a problem for the future; they cause problems right now because credit rating agencies assign lower scores to states that have high debt and unfunded liabilities. Standard and Poor's says that they ""differentiate states' credit quality by the status of their long-term liability profile.""36 Lower credit ratings mean higher borrowing costs. So governors should make it a high priority to reduce their states' debt, pension, and OPEB liabilities.





  
This study computes a fiscal policy grade for each governor based on his or her success at restraining taxes and spending since 2014, or since 2015 for governors entering office that year. The spending data used in the study come from the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO), and in some cases, the budget documents of individual states. The data on proposed and enacted tax cuts come from NASBO, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and news articles in _State Tax Notes_ and other sources.37 Tax-rate data come from the Tax Foundation, but is updated by the author for recent changes.38



This year's report uses the same methodology as the 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 Cato report cards. The report focuses on short-term taxing and spending actions to judge whether the governors take a small-government or big-government approach to policy. Each governor's performance is measured using seven variables: two for spending, one for revenue, and four for tax rates. The overall score is calculated as the average score of these three categories. Tables A.1 and A.2 summarize the governors' scores.



 **Spending Variables**



Average annual percent change in per capita general fund spending proposed by the governor.



Average annual percent change in actual per capita general fund spending.



 **Revenue Variable**



Average annual dollar value of proposed, enacted, and vetoed tax changes. This variable is measured by the reported estimates of the annual dollar effects of tax changes as a percentage of a state's total tax revenues. This is an important variable, and it is compiled from many news articles, budget documents, and reports.39



 **Tax Rate Variables**



Change in the top personal income tax rate approved by the governor.



Change in the top corporate income tax rate approved by the governor.



Change in the general sales tax rate approved by the governor.



Change in the cigarette tax rate approved by the governor.



The two spending variables are measured on a per capita basis to adjust for state populations growing at different rates. Also, the spending variables are only for general fund budgets, which are the budgets that governors have the most control over. Variable 1 is measured through fiscal 2017, while variable 2 is measured through fiscal 2016. Variables 3 through 7 cover changes during the period of January 2014 to August 2016, or January 2015 to August 2016 for governors entering office in 2015.40



For each variable, the results are standardized, with the worst scores near 0 and the best scores near 100. The score for each of the three categories — spending, revenue, and tax rates — is the average score of the variables within the category. One exception is that the cigarette tax rate variable is quarter-weighted because that tax is a smaller source of state revenue than income and sales taxes. The average of the scores for the three categories produces the overall grade for each governor.





  
This report uses publicly available data to measure the fiscal performance of the governors. There are, however, some unavoidable problems in such grading. For one thing, the report card cannot fully isolate the policy effects of the governors from the fiscal decisions of state legislatures. Governors and legislatures both influence tax and spending outcomes, and if a legislature is controlled by a different party, a governor's control may be diminished. To help isolate the performance of governors, variables 1 and 3 measure the effects of each governor's proposed, but not necessarily enacted, recommendations.



Another factor to consider is that the states grant governors differing amounts of authority over budget processes. For example, most governors are empowered with a line-item veto to trim spending, but some governors do not have that power. Another example is that the supermajority voting requirement to override a veto varies among the states. Such factors give governors different levels of budget control that are not accounted for in this study.



Nonetheless, the results presented here should be a good reflection of each governor's fiscal approach. Governors receiving an A have focused on reducing tax burdens and restraining spending. Governors receiving an F have put government expansion ahead of the public's need to keep its hard-earned money. In the middle are many governors who gyrate between different fiscal approaches from one year to the next.





  






  






  
Below are highlights of the fiscal records of the 47 governors covered in this report. The discussion is based on the tax and spending data used for grading the governors, as well as other information that sheds light on each governor's fiscal approach.41 Note that the grades are calculated based on each governor's record since 2014, or since 2015 if that was the governor's first year in office.





  
Robert Bentley, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Robert Bentley dropped from a B in the last report card to an F in this one due to his support of major tax increases. In his first few years in office, Bentley generally opposed tax increases, but in 2015 he made a U-turn. He proposed a tax increase of more than $500 million a year, including increases on businesses, cigarettes, automobile sales, automobile rentals, and other items.



The governor's plan was opposed by the legislature, but after months of wrangling they reached a compromise on a $100 million tax package. Bentley signed into law a cigarette tax increase of 25 cents per pack, and higher taxes and fees on nursing facilities, prescriptions, and the insurance industry. In 2016 Bentley supported a gasoline tax increase, but that legislation did not pass.



On spending, Governor Bentley scored lower than average among the governors. He proposed substantial general fund budget increases the past two years.





  
Doug Ducey, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: A; Took Office: January 2015



Doug Ducey has a background in business and finance, and he was CEO of Cold Stone Creamery. As governor, he has overseen lean budgets, with general fund spending on track to rise just 2 percent between 2015 and 2017. In 2016 Ducey approved major pension reforms, which included trimming benefit costs and giving new hires the option of a defined contribution plan.



Governor Ducey has signed into law individual and business tax cuts. He approved legislation ending sales taxes on some business purchases, reducing insurance premium taxes, increasing depreciation deductions, and indexing Arizona's income tax brackets for inflation. Ducey has also been supportive of the corporate tax rate cut passed by the prior governor, which is being phased in over time. The corporate tax rate is falling from 7 percent in 2013 to 4.9 percent in 2017.





  
Asa Hutchinson, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2015



Former U.S. Representative and federal official Asa Hutchinson entered the Arkansas governor's office in January 2015. Hutchinson campaigned on a middle-class tax cut, and he delivered soon after taking office. He signed into law a cut to tax rates for households with incomes of less than $75,000, providing savings of about $90 million a year.42 The governor said, ""Arkansas has been an island of high taxation for too long, and I'm pleased that we are doing something about that.""43 Enjoying substantial budget surpluses in 2016, Hutchinson has promised further tax cuts. On spending, Hutchison scored a bit better than average among the governors.





  
Jerry Brown, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Jerry Brown was graded as the worst governor in America on the 2014 Cato report card. Brown is not the lowest-scoring governor this time, but he is assigned another F based on his support of large tax and spending increases.



California's general fund budget increased 13 percent in 2015 and 2.7 percent in 2016, and it is set to increase more than 5 percent in 2017. The state has been on a hiring spree, with state government employment rising 7 percent over the past three years.44



Perhaps Brown's most wasteful spending project is on the state's high-speed rail system, which has a huge cost but will do little to reduce congestion. The projected cost of the project has doubled from $33 billion to $68 billion. An investigation in 2016 discovered that taxpayers will be on the hook not only for the project's capital costs, but also its operating costs.45 State officials had been promising that passenger ticket revenues would cover operating costs, but it is clear now that will not happen.



On taxes, Brown has pushed a transportation plan to raise $3 billion a year from higher gasoline and diesel taxes and a $65 per vehicle annual fee. Luckily for California motorists, the plan has not passed, although the legislature did approve a small vehicle registration fee increase in 2016.



Californians have been spared major tax increases the past couple of years because money has poured into state coffers from growth in Silicon Valley and other regions in the state. However, the next recession will cause the California budget to descend into crisis, as it has during past recessions. That occurs because California tax revenues are highly dependent on high earners and capital gains. As the stock market faltered earlier this year, for example, state revenue projections were slashed by $2 billion.46 If the California economy slumps, the budget will not be able to support the extra spending that Brown has added in recent years.



Brown recognizes these problems. In 2016 he noted of the state's tax system: ""We are taxing the highest income earners, and as you know, 1 percent of the richest people pay almost half the income tax. . . . That's fair, but it also creates this volatility. So in order to manage this budget, it's like riding a tiger.""47 Brown has favored building up the state's rainy-day fund, but he has not supported reforms to reduce revenue volatility, such as moving toward a more stable consumption-based tax system.



This November, voters will decide on various ballot measures on taxes. One measure would raise $1 billion a year from a cigarette tax hike of $2 per pack. Another measure would extend higher income tax rates on households earning more than $250,000 a year. And yet another measure will ask voters to legalize recreational marijuana. There would be a 15 percent excise tax on retail sales and a separate cultivation tax, which would together raise about $1 billion a year.48





  
John Hickenlooper, Democrat; Legislature: Divided



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2011



General fund spending has ballooned under Governor John Hickenlooper, rising 48 percent between 2011 and 2016. State government employment has soared 22 percent since Hickenlooper took office.49



Hickenlooper pushed for a large individual income tax increase on the ballot in 2013, which would have replaced Colorado's flat-rate 4.63 percent tax with a two-rate structure of 5.0 and 5.9 percent. That increase was rejected by voters, 65 to 35 percent.50 The governor has not pushed for major tax increases since then, but with a growing economy, revenues have poured into state government.



The state has a new source of revenue: marijuana. After citizens legalized the drug for recreational use on a 2012 ballot, Colorado has become ""the first state in history to generate more annual marijuana tax revenue than alcohol tax revenue. . . . The state collected $69.9 million from marijuana-specific taxes in fiscal 2015 and just under $41.8 million from alcohol specific taxes in the same period.""51



While not pushing major tax increases in recent years, Hickenlooper has opposed taxpayer interests by seeking to undermine the state constitution's Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR). TABOR requires voter approval of tax increases and requires the government to refund excess taxes above an annual revenue cap. Revenues have been exceeding the cap recently, which is ""prompting Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) and Democrats in the legislature to look for ways around the law.""52





  
Dan Malloy, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Dan Malloy received poor grades on prior Cato report cards due mainly to his enormous tax increases. In 2011 Governor Malloy raised taxes by $1.8 billion annually, which increased total annual state tax collections by 14 percent.



Malloy received an F on this report for his continued support of large tax increases. In 2015 he signed legislation increasing taxes more than $900 million annually. He increased the top individual income tax rate from 6.7 percent to 6.99 percent, and he extended a corporate income tax surcharge of 20 percent. He increased the cigarette tax by 50 cents per pack and broadened the bases of the sales tax and income tax. He also increased health provider taxes and other taxes and fees.



Despite all the tax increases, Connecticut still faced a large budget gap in 2016 because spending keeps rising and growth is sluggish. Connecticut's economy has lagged the national economy, and the state's fiscal future is very troubled. It has some of the highest debt and unfunded retirement liabilities of any state on a per capita basis, as discussed above.



While neighboring New York has cut business taxes in recent years, Connecticut has raised them. In 2016 General Electric made headlines by moving its headquarters from Connecticut to Massachusetts. In 2015 GE head Jeffrey Immelt sent a letter to his employees saying that the company was looking to relocate ""to another state with a more pro-business environment.""53 GE announced in 2016 that it was moving to Boston, after being headquartered in Connecticut for more than 40 years.





  
Jack Markell, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2009



Former businessman Jack Markell is completing his second term as Delaware governor. He has scored fairly poorly on past Cato report cards. He signed into law large ""temporary"" tax increases in 2009, and then pushed to extend them in 2013. The top individual income tax rate was increased from 5.95 percent to 6.6 percent, where it remains today. In 2014 Markell signed into law a substantial increase in the corporate franchise tax, and he proposed a 10 cent per gallon gas tax increase and a new tax on water service. In 2015 he approved increases in various motor vehicle fees. In 2016 Markell approved modest business tax reductions.





  
Rick Scott, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: A; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Rick Scott received an A on Cato's 2012 report, and he receives an A on this report for restraining spending and continuing to push for tax cuts. Scott often says that his goal is to make Florida the best state for business in the nation, and tax cuts are a key part of his strategy.



In 2012 Scott raised the exemption level for the corporate income tax, eliminating the burden for thousands of small businesses. In 2013 he approved a temporary elimination of sales taxes on manufacturing equipment. In 2014 he signed into law a $400 million cut to vehicle fees and proposed a further increase in the corporate tax exemption level.



In 2015 Scott approved a large cut to the state's tax on communication services and modest reductions in sales and business taxes. In 2016 he proposed more than $900 million in tax relief, including a cut to the sales tax on commercial rents and a full exemption for manufacturers and retailers from the corporate income tax.54 The legislature did not approve those two proposals, but it did pass Scott's plan to permanently eliminate sales taxes on manufacturing equipment, which is a solid pro-growth reform.



Governor Scott scored well on spending in this report. He has proposed low-growth general fund budgets the past three years. State government employment has been cut 4 percent under Scott.55





  
Nathan Deal, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Nathan Deal earned a D due to his poor performance on both spending and taxes. Georgia's general fund budget grew 27 percent between 2011 and 2016, and Deal proposed a substantial increase for 2017.



With regard to taxes, Deal supported a ballot measure in 2012 to increase sales taxes, but voters shot that plan down by a large margin.56 In 2015 Deal signed into law a large increase in gasoline taxes, hotel taxes, and other levies to raise more than $600 million a year. In general, Deal has favored raising broad-based taxes and shown little interest in major tax reform. Meanwhile, he has pushed narrow breaks for favored industries and companies, such as tax credits for the film industry and an exemption for major sports team tickets from the sales tax.





  
David Ige, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2015



Before being elected governor, David Ige was a state legislator and also an engineer and manager in the telecommunications industry. Ige defeated incumbent Hawaii governor Neil Abercrombie in the Democratic primary in 2014. Abercrombie had received poor grades on Cato reports, and Ige pointed to his tax hikes as one of the causes of his political demise.57



Ige let expire temporary income tax increases put in place by Abercrombie, but he proposed increases in gasoline taxes and vehicle registration fees in 2016. However, it was the governor's excessive spending that pushed down his grade on this report. General fund spending rose 7 percent in 2016, and Ige proposed to increase it 12 percent in 2017.





  
C. L. ""Butch"" Otter, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2007



Former congressman Butch Otter is in his third term as Idaho governor. He has a moderately pro-growth record on taxes, but a poor record on spending.



In 2012 he signed legislation cutting the corporate tax rate from 7.6 to 7.4 percent and the top individual income tax from 7.8 to 7.4 percent. In 2015 he proposed cutting income tax rates further, to 6.9 percent, over five years. He also proposed ending property taxes on business equipment, which would have been a pro-growth reform. However, Otter did not push these cuts very hard, and they did not get passed.



In 2015 the governor approved a 7 cent per gallon increase in the gasoline tax. In 2016 Otter said that he was against tax cuts that were being considered by the legislature because they would jeopardize his spending priorities.58



Otter scores poorly on spending in this report. The general fund budget increased 5.6 percent in 2015 and 4.6 percent in 2016. He proposed a 7.3 percent increase for 2017.





  
Bruce Rauner, Republican; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2015



Businessman Bruce Rauner took office as Illinois governor in January 2015 eager to fix his state's severe fiscal problems. Unfortunately, Rauner and the state legislature have been at loggerheads, and so budgeting has mainly ground to a halt the past two years.



The good news for Illinois is that Rauner replaced Pat Quinn, a repeated F governor on Cato reports. It is also good news that large personal and corporate income tax increases passed under Quinn have expired as scheduled. Furthermore, the budget standoff has meant that state general fund spending has been flat since 2014.



The bad news is that Illinois has not tackled its serious fiscal problems, including large structural deficits and unfunded pension obligations. Quinn's temporary tax increases had raised about $6 billion a year for the state, which the government quickly became dependent on as spending rose. When the extra tax revenue disappeared in 2015, large deficits reappeared.



In 2015 Rauner proposed a state budget that partly closed the gap between spending and revenues, and the legislature responded with an even more unbalanced budget. Rauner vetoed the legislature's budget, and the state was in a stalemate until June 2016, when a compromise deal was finally signed.



Rauner had said that he would not agree to higher taxes unless the legislature agreed to some of his Turnaround Agenda, which includes worker compensation reform and lawsuit reform. In a 2016 address, Rauner said, ""I won't support new revenue unless we have major structural reforms to grow more jobs and get more value for taxpayers. . . . I'm insisting we attack the root causes of our dismal economic performance.""59 In the end, a deal was struck that did not include Rauner's reforms, but it also did not give the legislature the extra taxes and spending that it wanted.60



During the budget standoff, the state built up IOUs to businesses providing services to the government. That fits with the state's pattern of pushing its costs to the future. Table 2, above, showed that Illinois is near the top of the 50 states in terms of per capita debt, unfunded pensions, and unfunded OPEB. These problems have been building for years — the underfunding of state pensions, for example, has roots two decades old.61 Rising pension spending is exacerbating budget gaps — pension spending soared from $1.1 billion in 2000 to $7.7 billion in 2015, which is a large share of the $35 billion Illinois general fund budget.62



Governor Rauner is trying to put the state on a more business-like posture, but he is receiving little help from the legislature. In his 2016 State of the State speech, he argued that Quinn's large tax increases hurt the state's economic growth, and he noted that the state's credit rating was downgraded five times during the high-tax Quinn years.63





  
Mike Pence, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: A; Took Office: January 2013



Governor Mike Pence has been a champion tax cutter and fairly frugal on spending. In 2013 he signed into law a cut to Indiana's flat individual income tax rate from 3.4 percent to 3.23 percent. He also approved a repeal of Indiana's inheritance tax.



In 2014 he cut the corporate income tax rate, adding to the reductions made by prior governor Mitch Daniels. The rate has fallen from 7.5 percent to 6.25 percent since 2014 and is scheduled to fall to 4.9 percent by 2021.64 Pence also targeted property taxes on business equipment for reform, and in 2014 he signed off on a plan to allow local governments to cut these anti-investment levies. These and other changes have helped Indiana increase its ranking among the states on the Tax Foundation's competitiveness index to 8th-highest this year.65



At the same time, Pence has restrained state spending growth. The general fund budget increased 2.6 percent in 2015 and 1.1 percent in 2016. It is set to grow 3.0 percent in 2017. Under Pence, Indiana has maintained the top credit rating from the three main credit rating agencies.





  
Terry Branstad, Republican; Legislature: Divided



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2011



Terry Branstad was governor of Iowa for 16 years between 1983 and 1999, and he returned to the governorship in 2011. His main pro-growth fiscal reform was a large property tax cut in 2013. The reform created a growth cap for agriculture and residential assessments, reduced assessment levels for commercial and industrial property, and cut property taxes for small businesses.



In recent years, Branstad has cut some taxes and increased others. He cut sales taxes on inputs to manufacturing and approved other modest business tax breaks. He also created a system of income tax rebates for years with budget surpluses. However, Branstad also approved a 10 cent per gallon gas tax increase, which raised more than $200 million annually.



On spending, Branstad has performed poorly. He came into office promising to cut the size of state government by 15 percent, but instead general fund spending has soared. Spending has increased 11 percent in the past two years, and has increased 34 percent since he took office in 2011.





  
Sam Brownback, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Sam Brownback signed into law major income tax reforms his first few years in office. In 2012 he replaced individual tax rates of 3.5, 6.25, and 6.45 percent with rates of 3.0 and 4.9 percent. The reform increased standard deductions and eliminated special-interest breaks. In 2013 Brownback cut income tax rates further, while reducing income tax deductions and raising the sales tax rate from 5.7 to 6.15 percent.66



Brownback's tax cuts have become controversial. The problem is that the governor and legislature did not fully match the reduced revenues with reduced spending, which created chronic budget gaps. The fairly slow-growing economy in Kansas has not helped matters.



The governor has taken steps to reduce budget gaps. In 2015 he raised the sales tax rate from 6.15 percent to 6.5 percent, increased the cigarette tax by 50 cents per pack, and reduced deductions under the individual income tax.67 The 2015 package raised about $300 million a year.



Those large tax increases pushed down Brownback's grade on this report, but his relatively frugal spending kept his grade out of the basement. Kansas general fund spending increased less than 10 percent between 2011 and 2016, and is expected to increase just 1 percent in 2017.68



Brownback's reforms do not illustrate that state tax cuts are a bad idea, as some pundits have suggested. In most states in most years, government revenues grow as the economy grows. Well-designed reforms, phased in over time, let taxpayers keep some of that growth dividend, and that can be achieved within a balanced-budget framework if spending is trimmed. Brownback's basic reform idea — to cut income tax rates in exchange for sales tax increases — should strengthen the Kansas economy over the long term since sales taxes are less harmful than income taxes.



The challenge for tax-cutting states is to ensure that policymakers fully match tax cuts with spending cuts. Both strengthen the economy, and both are needed to meet state balanced-budget requirements. Brownback has worked to close budget gaps, and in 2016 he proposed various savings options, including across-the-board spending cuts.





  
Paul LePage, Republican; Legislature: Divided



Grade: A; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Paul LePage has been a staunch fiscal conservative. He has held down general fund spending in recent years, and he has cut state government employment 9 percent since he took office.69 LePage has signed into law cost-cutting reforms to welfare and health programs, and he has decried the negative effects of big government: ""Big, expensive welfare programs riddled with fraud and abuse threaten our future. Too many Mainers are dependent on government. Government dependency has not — and never will — create prosperity.""70



LePage has been a persistent tax cutter. In 2011 he approved large income tax cuts, which reduced the top individual rate, simplified tax brackets, and reduced taxes on low-income households. He also increased the estate tax exemption, cut business taxes, and halted automatic annual increases in the gas tax.



In 2013 LePage vetoed the legislature's budget because it contained tax increases, including an increase in the sales tax rate from 5.0 to 5.5 percent. However, his veto was overridden by the legislature.



In 2015 the Maine budget process broke down. LePage proposed a plan to reduce the top individual income tax rate from 7.95 to 5.75 percent, reduce the top corporate tax rate from 8.93 to 6.75 percent, eliminate narrow tax breaks, repeal the estate tax, and raise sales taxes.71



When the legislature rejected the plan, LePage said that he would veto any bills sponsored by Democrats. In the end, the legislature passed a budget that included substantial tax cuts over the veto of LePage, who wanted larger cuts. The plan cut the top personal income tax rate from 7.95 to 7.15 percent, reduced taxes for low-income households, increased the estate tax exemption, and made the prior sales tax rate increase permanent.



In 2016 LePage pushed for more tax cuts. In his State of the State address, he proposed reducing the individual income tax rate to 4 percent over time and repealing the estate tax. Over the years, he has also called for abolishing the state income tax altogether.



While LePage is a strong fiscal conservative, his political combativeness sometimes gets the better of him. In 2016 he even challenged one legislator to an old-fashioned duel, although he later apologized. Surely, the governor would better accomplish his fiscal policy goals by putting aside his anger and trying to work cooperatively with state lawmakers.



On the November ballot, Maine voters will face two questions affecting taxes. Question 1 would legalize marijuana and impose on it a sales tax of 10 percent. Question 2 would impose higher income taxes on households earning more than $200,000 a year. LePage opposes both ballot initiatives.





  
Larry Hogan, Republican; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2015



Larry Hogan won an upset victory in November 2014 in this Democratic-leaning state. Governor Hogan has gained a high favorability rating in polls, and he has nudged Democrats in the legislature toward spending restraint and tax relief. In one popular move, he repealed the ""rain tax,"" which was a new stormwater fee enacted by the prior governor. Another popular move by Hogan has been to use his executive authority to cut highway tolls and fees for many state services.



In 2016 Hogan proposed a package of tax cuts for families and businesses. The plan would have reduced taxes on seniors and low-income families, and also reduced business fees. Furthermore, it would have cut taxes on manufacturers, but in a complex way. New manufacturing firms in some regions would be exempt from the income tax for 10 years, and employees of those firms would also get tax breaks. The legislature did not pass the plan, and such micromanagement of tax relief is misguided. Hogan should instead focus on cutting taxes broadly by dropping Maryland's 8.25 percent corporate income tax rate.





  
Charlie Baker, Republican; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2015



After a career in the health care industry and state government, Charlie Baker was elected Massachusetts governor in November 2014. The governor is viewed as being socially moderate and fiscally conservative, and he is enjoying high popularity ratings.



In running for office, Baker said that he would not raise taxes, and he has stuck to that promise so far. The state income tax rate dropped slightly in 2015 and 2016 after budget targets were met, and the governor was supportive of those reductions.



The Massachusetts constitution requires that the state income tax be levied at a flat rate, currently 5.1 percent. But the legislature has been talking about amending the constitution and imposing a ""millionaire tax."" Baker opposes that idea, and the public likely supports him. Residents of Massachusetts have voted against imposing a graduated income tax five times since 1960.72



A 2014 ballot measure repealed automatic increases in the state's gas tax. In supporting that change, Baker said, ""I'm not talking taxes, period. Not talking taxes, because as far as I'm concerned we have a long way to go here to demonstrate to the public, to each other and to everybody else that this is a grade-A super-functioning [highway department] machine that's doing all the things it should be doing.""73



The spending side of the budget is where Baker's grade is pulled down a bit. The general fund budget rose 6.1 percent in 2016.



This November, Massachusetts will vote on a ballot question to legalize recreational marijuana, and to impose the state sales tax plus a 3.75 percent excise tax on the product. Governor Baker opposes the initiative.





  
Rick Snyder, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2011



After a successful business career, Rick Snyder came into office eager to solve Michigan's deep-seated economic problems. The governor has pursued important reforms, such as restructuring Detroit's finances and signing into law right-to-work legislation. He repealed the damaging Michigan Business Tax and replaced it with a less harmful corporate income tax. In 2014 he pushed through a large reduction in property taxes on business equipment, which should help spur capital investment. The cut was approved by Michigan voters in August 2014.



In 2015 he signed into law a mechanism that will automatically decrease state income taxes whenever general fund revenue growth exceeds inflation by a certain percentage. Unfortunately, the mechanism does not kick in until 2023.



Snyder's grade was pulled down by his tax increases to fund transportation. In 2015 he increased gasoline taxes from 19 to 26.3 cents per gallon and vehicle fees by 20 percent. Those hikes will cost taxpayers about $600 million a year. Snyder and the legislature pushed through the package despite Michigan voters having rejected by an 80-20 margin a sales and gas tax increase for transportation on a May 2015 referendum (Proposal 1). That ""rejection was the most one-sided loss ever for a proposed amendment to the state constitution of 1963.""74 Yet later in 2015, Snyder and the legislature hiked taxes for transportation anyway.





  
Mark Dayton, Democrat; Legislature: Divided



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Mark Dayton has rebounded from his prior Cato grade of ""F."" His poor grade had stemmed from large tax hikes, including raising the top individual income tax rate and raising cigarette taxes. The cigarette tax rate is now indexed and rises automatically every year. In 2014 Dayton reversed course and signed into law tax cuts totaling about $500 million a year, including reductions to income taxes, estate taxes, and sales taxes on business purchases.



But during 2015 and 2016, Dayton proposed various options to raise about $400 million a year from increases in gasoline taxes and vehicle registration fees. Those proposed increases did not pass the legislature.



With a substantial budget surplus developing in 2016, Republicans in the legislature proposed major tax cuts. One reform would have substantially reduced property taxes on business equipment. It seemed as if Dayton might reach some compromise with the legislature on a package of cuts, but the bill that passed the legislature included a drafting error and Dayton refused to sign it.





  
Phil Bryant, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2012



Until this year, Governor Phil Bryant had been a modest tax cutter. He had trimmed some business taxes and repealed motor vehicle inspection fees. But in 2016 he signed into law major tax cuts for businesses and individuals that were initiated by the legislature. The most important reform was phasing out over 10 years the corporate franchise tax, which is imposed on businesses in addition to the state's corporate income tax.75 This reform was a priority of the Senate Finance Committee chairman, who said that the franchise tax ""puts us at an economic disadvantage [and] . . . is really an outdated form of tax.""76 Governor Bryant was hesitant to cut the franchise tax, but in the end he did sign this important reform.



The 2016 tax package included other reductions. It cut taxes for self-employed individuals and cut the bottom individual income tax rate from 3 percent to zero, which provided across-the-board savings. Bryant had wanted to swap income tax cuts for a gas tax increase, but the legislature did not go along with the gas tax idea.





  
Jay Nixon, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2009



Governor Jay Nixon has battled the legislature over taxes for years. In 2013 the legislature passed an $800 million tax cut that would have reduced corporate and individual income tax rates. Nixon vetoed the bill, and the legislature was unable to override. In 2014 the legislature tried again and passed a bill over Nixon's veto. The package of tax cuts reduced the top individual income tax rate from 6.0 to 5.5 percent, and it provided a 25 percent deduction for business income on individual returns. The cuts are to be phased in beginning in 2017. However, they are contingent on state revenue targets being met, and they had not been met as of mid-2016.





  
Steve Bullock, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2013



Governor Steve Bullock scored well on spending in this report. But his grade was pulled down by his repeated vetoes of tax reform plans passed by the legislature. One plan he vetoed in 2015 would have trimmed the corporate tax rate, reduced the number of individual income tax brackets, raised the standard deduction and personal exemption, and scrapped narrow breaks in the code to simplify the system.



Bullock has approved at least one substantial reform, which was a 2013 law that reduced property taxes on business equipment. Bullock's Republican challenger for the governorship in 2016 is calling for further reductions in property taxes on business equipment, as well as individual income tax cuts.





  
Pete Ricketts, Republican; Legislature: Nonpartisan



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2015



Pete Ricketts is an entrepreneur and former executive with TD Ameritrade. He is a conservative who favors tax reductions and spending restraint.



In 2015 Governor Ricketts vetoed a 6 cent per gallon gas tax increase, arguing that the state should solve its infrastructure challenges without tax hikes. The legislature overrode him to enact the increase.



In running for governor, Ricketts campaigned on property tax reduction, and he signed into law relief for homeowners, businesses, and farms in the form of state credits for local taxes. In 2015 the legislature considered various proposals for major income tax reform. Governor Rickets is favorably disposed toward such reforms, but no plan has passed the legislature yet.





  
Brian Sandoval, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Brian Sandoval came into office promising no tax increases. But Governor Sandoval made a U-turn in 2015 and signed into law the largest package of tax increases in Nevada's history at more than $600 million per year. The package included a $1 per pack cigarette tax increase, extension of a prior sales tax hike, an increase in business license fees, a new excise tax on transportation companies, and an increase in the rate of Nevada's existing business tax, the Modified Business Tax (MBT).



However, the worst part of the package was the imposition of a whole new business tax in Nevada, the Commerce Tax.77 This tax is imposed on the gross receipts of all Nevada businesses that have revenues of more than $4 million a year. The new tax has numerous deductions and 27 different rates based on the industry, and it interacts with the MBT.



The Commerce Tax is complex, distortionary, and hidden from the general public. As a gross receipts tax, it will hit economic output across industries unevenly, and it will likely spur more lobbying as industries complain that their tax burdens are higher than other industries. Imposing the tax was a major policy blunder.



The Commerce Tax was imposed to increase funding for education. But Sandoval and the legislature had been directly rebuked by the public in 2014 for their effort to impose a new tax for education. In a November 2014 ballot, Nevada voters overwhelming rejected by a 79-21 margin the adoption of a new franchise tax to fund education.



Meanwhile, in recent years Sandoval and the legislature have been handing out narrow tax breaks to electric car companies, data centers, and other favored businesses. In 2014, for example, Sandoval approved a deal to provide $1.25 billion in special tax breaks and subsidies over 20 years to car firm Tesla. So Nevada's tax policy entails large increases for all businesses, but narrow breaks for the lucky few.



This November, Nevada voters will weigh in on a ballot question, Question 2, to legalize recreational marijuana and impose the state sales tax and a 15 percent excise tax on the product. Governor Sandoval opposes legalization.





  
Maggie Hassan, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2013



Governor Maggie Hassan received a middling grade on this report, as she did on the 2014 report. She performed below average on spending, highlighted by a 7 percent increase in the general fund budget in 2016. On taxes, Hassan has signed into law a mix of increases and cuts. In 2013 she proposed a cigarette tax increase of 30 cents a pack, and the legislature agreed to 10 cents. In 2014 she approved a gasoline tax increase of 4.2 cents per gallon.



In 2015 Hassan reversed course and cut taxes after she initially resisted. She approved small rate cuts to the Business Profits Tax and the Business Enterprise Tax, and she increased the research tax credit. Those changes were a compromise with the legislature after the governor's veto of an initial tax-cut package. The compromise plan includes a second round of tax cuts in 2019 if state revenues hit specified targets.



In 2016 Hassan signed bills increasing business depreciation deductions and repealing a tax that had been imposed on stock offerings.





  
Chris Christie, Republican; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2010



New Jersey has struggled with a sluggish economy, budget gaps, and a large unfunded retirement obligation for state workers. In 2016 the state had to deal with a budget gap when revenue projections were reduced by $1 billion. The state treasurer argued that revenues are volatile because they depend heavily on the incomes of high earners: ""Our progressive tax code makes us far too reliant upon extraordinary sources of income from our highest income earners.""78 To reduce volatility and spur economic growth, the state should move away from income taxes and toward sales taxes in its revenue base.



Governor Chris Christie has tried to reduce income taxes. He signed into law substantial business tax cuts in 2011, and he has proposed across-the-board individual income tax cuts. He has repeatedly vetoed income tax hikes passed by the legislature, insisting that ""income taxes being raised in any way, shape or form will not happen while I'm governor — under no circumstances.""79



In 2016 he said raising taxes would be ""insanity"" and called for lower taxes to ""stop people from leaving New Jersey.""80 The _New York Times_ profiled one New Jersey billionaire who moved to Florida in 2016 and single-handedly appears to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars in lost tax revenues.81 In his 2016 State of the State address, Christie called for elimination of the state's estate tax: ""Our tax structure incentivizes people to move to other states as they age, and when they do they take their businesses and capital with them.""82



Christie and the legislature struggled for months this year to agree on a deal to raise the gasoline tax 23 cents per gallon in return for cutting the estate tax and possibly the sales tax. As of August, Christie, the House, and the Senate could not come to an agreement.



Christie scored quite well on spending in this report, with below average increases in the general fund budget in recent years. State government employment has been cut 5 percent since Christie took office.83



Major fiscal problems loom for New Jersey. The state has one of the lowest credit ratings, partly as a result of its large unfunded retirement obligations. Reflecting on a negative assessment from Standard and Poor's in 2016, Bloomberg noted, ""New Jersey's mounting tab from its employee retirement plans are squeezing its finances because years of failing to set aside enough to cover promised benefits have caused the annually required contributions to soar.""84 To Christie's credit, he established a blue ribbon commission to propose reforms to the state's retirement systems.85 Unfortunately, the reforms have not been enacted.





  
Susana Martinez, Republican; Legislature: Divided



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Susana Martinez scored above average on spending and taxes in this report. Her proposed budget increases have been modest, although the legislature has usually spent more. On taxes, Martinez has pursued reforms to make New Mexico more economically competitive. In 2012 she signed a bill reducing gross receipts taxes on inputs to construction and manufacturing. But her biggest tax policy success was in 2013, when she pushed through a cut to the corporate income tax rate from 7.6 to 5.9 percent, phased in over five years.





  
Andrew Cuomo, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Andrew Cuomo received a grade of B on the 2014 Cato report, and he repeats his B this time around for his impressive tax cutting.



In 2014 Cuomo signed into law a package of tax reforms for businesses. The package cut the corporate income tax rate from 7.1 percent to 6.5 percent, reduced the corporate tax rate on qualified manufacturers from 5.9 percent to zero, ended a separate bank tax system, ended a surcharge on utility customers, and reduced the property tax burden on manufacturers.86



In 2016 Cuomo approved substantial individual income tax cuts in a compromise with Senate Republicans. The cuts will be phased in between 2018 and 2025, at which time they are expected to be saving taxpayers about $4 billion annually. The cuts will reduce statutory income tax rates on taxpayers with incomes below $300,000 a year. The deal did not include tax hikes on high earners, which Democrats in the legislature were promoting.



However, New York's spending is rising briskly. The general fund budget increased more than 8 percent in 2016 and is expected to increase more than 5 percent in 2017.87 Spending has been buoyed by an inflow of cash from legal settlements that the state has extracted from financial institutions. In 2015 and 2016, the state received more than $8 billion in settlements from 20 major companies.88 Cuomo's plan is to spend the money — mainly on capital projects — rather than using it to pay down the state's debt load, which is projected to continue rising.89





  
Pat McCrory, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: A; Took Office: January 2013



Governor Pat McCrory came into office promising major tax reforms and he has delivered. In 2013 he signed legislation to replace individual income tax rates of 6.0, 7.0, and 7.75 percent with a single rate of 5.8 percent. That rate was then reduced to 5.75 percent. The reform also eliminated the personal exemption and expanded the standard deduction. The 2013 law also cut the corporate income tax rate from 6.9 to 4.0 percent today, with a scheduled fall to 3.0 percent in 2017. The estate tax was repealed, and the sales tax base was expanded to cover more services.



In 2015 McCrory approved a further cut in the individual income tax rate from 5.75 to 5.5 percent, combined with an increase in the standard deduction. The 2015 law partly offset the revenue loss from income tax reductions with a broadening of the sales tax base. In 2016 McCrory approved another increase in the standard deduction.



McCrory has a good record on spending. The general fund budget will be just 8 percent higher in 2017 than it was when he took office in 2013. North Carolina retains the highest ratings on its debt from all three major credit-rating agencies.





  
Jack Dalrymple, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: December 2010



North Dakota's boom from energy production has turned into a bust, as the price of oil has plunged since 2014. The strong economy had created a government revenue gusher fueled by rising severance taxes on oil production. Governor Jack Dalrymple and the legislature increased state spending substantially during the boom years.



But now that the economy is stagnant and tax revenues are falling, North Dakota policymakers are retrenching. Dalrymple has ordered broad-based cuts, and one-time appropriations have fallen substantially in the current two-year budget compared to the last one. Also, during the boom years, policymakers transferred substantial revenues into budget reserve funds, and those funds are now helping the state weather the downturn.



Dalrymple has signed into law numerous tax cuts. In 2013 he cut the top individual income tax rate from 3.99 to 3.22 percent and the top corporate tax rate from 5.15 to 4.53 percent. In 2015 he cut the individual rate further to 2.9 percent and the corporate rate to 4.31 percent. Despite the large budget gap this year, Dalrymple has resisted the urge to raise taxes.





  
John Kasich, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



John Kasich has been one of the best tax-cutting governors of recent years. In 2013 he approved a plan that cut individual income tax rates by 10 percent, with the top rate falling from 5.93 to 5.33 percent. The plan also exempted a portion of small business income from taxation. To partly offset the revenue loss, the plan broadened the sales tax base and raised the sales tax rate from 5.5 to 5.75 percent. In 2014 the income tax rate reductions were accelerated and personal exemptions were increased.



In 2015 Kasich signed further income tax rate cuts into law. Individual rates were slashed across the board, with the top rate dropping to 5.0 percent. The 2015 legislation also expanded the small business exemption. Taxpayers can now exempt the first $250,000 of business income, with business income over that amount taxed at just 3 percent.



The revenue losses from the 2015 tax cuts were partly offset by a cigarette tax increase from $1.25 to $1.60 per pack. In his 2016 State of the State address, Kasich promised further tax reforms next year.



Kasich's score was reduced by his substantial spending increases, including a general fund increase in 2016 of more than 9 percent. State government employment is up 11 percent since the governor took office.90





  
Mary Fallin, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Mary Fallin's record on spending has been very good, which pushed up her grade on this report. Partly this is due to the tough budget situation faced by Oklahoma. The depressed energy industry has reduced government revenues, and so Fallin and the legislature have needed to restrain spending. The general fund budget fell 2 percent between 2014 and 2016, and Fallin proposed another reduction for 2017. Oklahoma's state government employment has been on a downward trend since 2013.



However, a large gap in the state budget this year prompted Fallin to pursue tax increases, which pulled down her Cato grade. She proposed hiking the cigarette tax by $1.50 per pack to raise $180 million a year, broaden the sales tax base to raise $200 million, and repeal an income tax deduction for state taxes to raise $85 million. The latter item was enacted.



This pro-tax stance is a reversal for Fallin, who came into office promising tax cuts. In past years, she pursued that goal, and in 2014 she cut the top individual income tax rate from 5.25 to 5.00 percent.



This November, Oklahoma voters will decide on a major tax change at the ballot box. They can support or oppose Question 779 to increase the state sales tax rate by 1 percentage point. As of this writing, Fallin appears to oppose the increase.





  
Kate Brown, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F; Took Office: February 2015



Kate Brown, an attorney and former legislator, became governor in February 2015 after Governor John Kitzhaber resigned during a corruption scandal. Oregon has enjoyed a strong economy in recent years, which has pushed up state revenues and encouraged spending. State government employment has soared, rising 12 percent over the past three years under Kitzhaber and then Brown.91



Even with state coffers filling up from the growing economy, Governor Brown has sought tax increases. She pushed tax and fee increases to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for transportation spending, but that effort did not succeed. She approved an extension of the state's hospital tax. And she signed into law a 17 percent tax on recreational marijuana in 2015, which is the state's first sales tax.



Oregon voters face a big tax decision in November. Liberal groups have placed a question, Measure 97, on the ballot to impose a gross receipts tax on Oregon businesses to raise $3 billion a year. At first, Governor Brown — who is up for election this November — hesitated on endorsing the increase, but in August she announced her support.92





  
Tom Wolf, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2015



Tom Wolf was elected governor in 2014 after a career running a family business. The thrust of Wolf's fiscal policy as governor has been to raise just about every state tax as much as he can. His score is the lowest of all the governors on this report.



In 2015 Wolf and the Republican-controlled legislature battled for nine months over how to close a budget gap, with Wolf pushing for large tax increases and Republicans opposing. One area of possible agreement was swapping a sales tax increase for a property tax cut. In the end, the budget passed with no major tax changes.



In 2016 Wolf's budget proposed many large tax increases. He proposed increasing the individual income tax rate from 3.07 to 3.4 percent to raise $1.3 billion a year. He pushed for a new severance tax on natural gas production to raise more than $200 million. He proposed raising tobacco taxes by more than $600 million, raising sales taxes by more than $400 million, and raising numerous other taxes. At $2.7 billion a year, it was one of the largest tax-increase plans of any state in recent years. In July the legislature agreed to more than $700 million in hikes, including a $1 per pack increase in the cigarette tax.



Wolf reduced his score on this report further by supporting hefty spending increases. General fund spending rose 4.8 percent in 2016, and Wolf proposed to increase it 7.1 percent in 2017. After falling for about 5 years, state government employment has jumped more than 5 percent in the year and a half since Wolf entered office.93



Pennsylvania has spent too much money for too long. On a per capita basis, the state is among the top 10 states for debt and unfunded pension liabilities. Pennsylvania has one of the lowest credit ratings from Standard and Poor's, and earlier this year the agency threatened to reduce its rating further for ""failure to pass a budget package . . . that addresses long-term structural balance.""94





  
Gina Raimondo, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2015



Governor Gina Raimondo is the best-scoring Democrat in this report. Raimondo has a background in economics, law, and the venture capital industry. As Rhode Island's Treasurer in 2011, she made national headlines for successfully pushing through major reforms of the state's pension system, including benefit reductions.



As governor since January 2015, Raimondo has a fiscally moderate record. She has overseen below-average increases in the general fund budget. She has also signed into law a number of modest tax cuts, including reductions in taxes on Social Security and pension income, reductions in sales taxes and alcohol taxes, and reductions in the corporate minimum tax. However, she also signed into law a cigarette tax increase in 2015, and proposed another increase in 2016.





  
Nikki Haley, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Nikki Haley has championed tax cuts, but spending has risen quickly during her tenure. South Carolina general fund spending rose 38 percent between 2011 and 2016. Spending will rise at least 17 percent during the three-year period of this report (2014 to 2017). State government employment has edged up since Haley entered office.



On taxes, Haley has pushed for reforms, but the South Carolina legislature has not been cooperative. In 2012 Haley proposed collapsing the current six individual income tax brackets to three and phasing out the corporate income tax. The plan did not pass, but she did sign into law a cut in the tax rate on small business income from 5 to 3 percent.



In recent years, she has proposed reducing income tax rates in exchange for gas tax increases to fund transportation. One proposal was to swap a 10 cent per gallon gas tax increase for a phased-in reduction of the top individual income tax rate from 7 percent to 5 percent. Unfortunately, the legislature has not moved forward with reform.





  
Dennis Daugaard, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Dennis Daugaard's poor grade is attributable to his large tax increases the past two years. Daugaard began his tenure opposed to tax increases, and he was a defender of South Dakota's low-tax environment. In 2012, for example, he came down on the side of voters who soundly defeated a ballot measure to raise the state sales tax rate from 4 percent to 5 percent.



But Daugaard has reversed course on taxes. In 2015 he signed into law substantial increases in gas taxes, excise taxes on vehicles, and vehicle fees. In 2016 he signed into law an increase in the state sales tax rate from 4.0 percent to 4.5 percent. That hike generated a large increase in overall state revenues because sales taxes are the dominant revenue source in South Dakota. Relative to total state tax revenues, this was one of the largest tax increases among the states in recent years, hence Daugaard's low grade on this report.





  
Bill Haslam, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Bill Haslam has received middling grades on prior Cato reports, but he scored better this year on both spending and taxes. His big fiscal achievement in 2016 was signing the repeal of the ""Hall tax,"" which was a 6 percent tax on dividends and interest. Tennessee has no broad-based income tax, but it has had this special anti-investment levy. Haslam had opposed repeal in the past, but in 2016 he agreed to phase it out over time. The reform reduces the tax by 1 percentage point a year until it is eliminated. Other than the Hall tax repeal, Haslam has approved a smattering of other modest tax cuts and increases in recent years.





  
Greg Abbott, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2015



Greg Abbott was the Attorney General of Texas under Governor Rick Perry, who served 14 years in office. Abbott assumed the governorship in January 2015 with a reputation as a staunch conservative.



On tax policy, Abbott's reputation has been affirmed. He took aim against the state's damaging franchise tax, called the Texas Margin Tax, and signed into law a permanent 25 percent cut to save Texas businesses $1.3 billion annually. He also approved legislation to scrap needless annual licensing fees on doctors and other professionals, saving them $125 million a year.





  
Gary Herbert, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: August 2009



Governor Gary Herbert's low grade on this report stems mainly from his large spending increases. Utah's general fund budget increased almost 7 percent in 2015 and more than 9 percent in 2016. State government employment has soared under Herbert, growing a remarkable 20 percent since he took office in mid-2009.95



In 2015 Herbert approved a number of substantial tax increases. One was a restructuring of the gas tax from a cents-per-gallon levy to a 12 percent tax on the wholesale price, which raised the burden on motorists $75 million a year. He also approved a statewide property tax increase and a law to allow local governments to raise their sales taxes with local ballot approval. Herbert has also proposed raising taxes on e-cigarettes, but the legislature has rejected that idea.





  
Peter Shumlin, Democrat; Legislature: Democratic



Grade: F; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Peter Shumlin has increased taxes and spending substantially, earning him an F on this report. Vermont's general fund budget grew 27 percent between 2011 and 2016 under Shumlin, even though the state's population has not grown at all. State government employment has risen more than 10 percent since he took office.96



Shumlin scored poorly on taxes. In 2013 he approved an increase in fuel taxes. In 2014 he approved an increase in cigarette taxes of 13 cents per pack, and in 2015 he approved another increase of 33 cents per pack. Also in 2015, he reduced income tax deductions, broadened the sales tax base, and increased property taxes. In 2016 Shumlin signed into law a package of tax and fee increases, including $20 million a year of new fees on mutual funds. He has also proposed numerous new taxes and fees to fund expanded health spending.





  
Terry McAuliffe, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: January 2014



Terry McAuliffe is a businessman and long-time political operative. On this report, he scored below average on spending and above average on taxes. He has supported a smattering of tax increases and cuts. His best proposal has been to reduce the state's corporate income tax rate from 6.0 to 5.75 percent. The governor said that he was motivated to cut the corporate tax because of North Carolina's reforms: ""In order to build the new Virginia economy, we have to make the commonwealth competitive in the global market.""97 McAuliffe has also proposed increasing research tax credits and increasing personal exemptions under the income tax. Unfortunately, the tax reductions have not moved through the legislature. The governor has appeared to tie the tax cuts to his proposal for Medicaid expansion, which the Republicans do not support.





  
Jay Inslee, Democrat; Legislature: Divided



Grade: F Took; Office: January 2013



Governor Jay Inslee has pushed for numerous large tax increases, which pushed his grade down to the bottom on this report. Inslee originally campaigned on a promise not to raise taxes, but within months of taking office in 2013 he proposed more than $1 billion in higher taxes in the upcoming two-year budget.98 In 2014 he proposed a new 7 percent tax on capital gains, increases in cigarette taxes, and other hikes. In 2015 he approved a gas tax increase of 11.9 cents per gallon, as well as tax increases on businesses. In 2016 he pushed another package of tax increases, including broadening the sales tax base and increasing business taxes.



The past two years, Inslee has pushed various plans for a state cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, which would raise hundreds of millions of dollars a year for the government.99 Inslee's plans have not passed the legislature, but voters will decide on the November ballot, on Initiative 732, whether or not to impose a new carbon tax.



Inslee scores poorly on spending. The current two-year general fund budget is up 13 percent over the prior budget. State government employment has risen about 5 percent since Inslee took office.100





  
Earl Ray Tomblin, Democrat; Legislature: Republican



Grade: D; Took Office: November 2010



Governor Earl Ray Tomblin was the highest-scoring Democrat on the 2014 Cato report. The general fund budget has been virtually flat in recent years, and Tomblin has approved a smattering of modest tax cuts. Tomblin recently signed into law a reduction in severance taxes to aid the struggling energy industry in his state.



However, as the state developed a budget gap this year, Tomblin threw in the towel on his moderate fiscal approach and proposed a range of large tax increases. He proposed a cigarette tax increase, a broadening of the sales tax base, and an increase in the sales tax rate by 1 percentage point. When the legislature passed the state budget without his hikes, he vetoed it. But then the legislature partly caved in and approved a 65 cent per pack cigarette tax increase to raise about $100 million a year.





  
Scott Walker, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: C; Took Office: January 2011



Governor Scott Walker has reformed retirement plans and union rules for government workers. Act 10, passed in 2011, imposed restrictions on collective bargaining and required increases in worker contributions for health and pension plans. The changes have saved state and local governments — and thus taxpayers — in Wisconsin billions of dollars over the years.101 In addition, Walker signed a law requiring a two-thirds supermajority in both legislative chambers to raise income, sales, or franchise tax rates.



Walker approved individual income tax cuts in 2013 and followed up with further cuts for low- and middle-income taxpayers in 2014. Wisconsin's five income tax rates were reduced to four lower rates. The standard deduction was increased, a new deduction for private-school tuition created, and various modest breaks for businesses were passed. Walker has also approved substantial property tax relief. However, Walker has not reduced Wisconsin's high corporate tax rate, and he only made a tiny trim to the top individual income tax rate.



Walker's grade is pulled down a bit by his spending increases, as was his grade on the 2014 Cato report. The Wisconsin general fund budget is expected to increase 7.3 percent in 2017.102





  
Matt Mead, Republican; Legislature: Republican



Grade: B; Took Office: January 2011



The Tax Foundation reports that Wyoming has the best tax climate for businesses in the nation.103 Wyoming has neither a corporate income tax nor an individual income tax. Governor Matt Mead has not tampered with that efficient tax structure, although he did raise gas taxes in 2013.



There have been no substantial tax changes since then. With the decline in the coal industry and low energy prices, the resource-dependent state is facing a tough economy and falling state revenues. But so far, Mead and the legislature are standing firm against tax increases.



Instead, as the energy boom in Wyoming has turned to a bust, Mead has been focused on closing a large budget gap with spending restraint. In 2016 the governor signed into law a package of spending reductions, combining specific program cuts with across-the-board reductions. He has also frozen state hiring, and total state employment has fallen since 2013. Wyoming general fund spending in the 2017-2018 biennium is expected to be down from the 2015-2016 level. Mead, however, has been a supporter of Medicaid expansion, but he has not convinced the legislature to go along with that spending increase.104

39\. The National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) compiles tax changes proposed by governors and the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) compiles enacted tax changes. However, these data sources have substantial shortcomings, and so I examined hundreds of news articles and state budget documents to assess major tax changes during each governor's tenure. Tax changes seriously proposed by governors, tax changes vetoed, and tax changes signed into law were taken into account. It is, however, difficult to measure this variable in an entirely precise manner. Legislation creating temporary tax changes was valued at one-quarter that of permanent tax changes. Unemployment compensation taxes and local property taxes were generally excluded. Also, earned income tax credits were excluded because they mainly increase spending, rather than reduce taxes.



40\. The tax rate variables also include changes already enacted in law to take effect by January 2017.



41\. For simplicity, all the general fund spending changes mentioned in the text are the overall increases. But the actual scoring was based on the per capita changes. Also note that all spending data refers to state fiscal years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLarge scale oceanic oscillations responsible for most of the post 1980 “warming”
By Joe Bastardi
I think global warming is a misnomer.
There is a distortion of the temperature pattern on the globe, brought about by the natural cyclical warming events of the warm PDO and warm AMO together. I spoke about this at Heartland a couple of years ago – how the sea ice increase in the south and the decrease in the north were the hidden message that here is no “warming” just a distortion.
When the tropical Atlantic and Pacific warm in tandem, there is a natural warming that takes place, especially in the northern hemisphere. The Pacific warming after both oceans being cold is a much more dramatic event, as it is the biggest ocean. The fact we have more land in the northern hemisphere and that the Arctic is surrounded by land means the summer seasons over the land masses can be hotter. Also the oceans in the north near North America are warmer. One can see this on the example of the warm PDO (left):

Modes of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, warm (left); cool (right. Source: jisao.washington.edu.
Notice the warmth near Alaska, yet the cool on the southern side of the globe near Antarctica. NOTICE THE TROPICS, THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF ENERGY TO DRIVE THE CLIMATE, are warm.  This adds more heat and moisture to the air, warming the atmosphere. It’s why we saw the rise in temperatures in the 1980s and 1990s.   In the cool version (right) the heat is where it had been cool earlier.  So the southern oceans around Antarctic are cool in a warm PDO, but warm in a cool PDO.
Look at the graphic of Antarctic ice below: it fits perfectly. At the start of the warm PDO around 1980, the ice was below normal, but the NATURAL cooling, compensating for warming in the tropics and north during the warm PDO, means the stage is set for the Antarctic ice increase:

Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu
Now look at a warm AMO example:

The Arctic’s exposure to the warm oceanic currents is much greater from the Atlantic side. This warm water moving toward the Arctic ocean obviously has a huge impact.
The deck is stacked to warm the northern hemisphere, jack up the global temps and shrink the Arctic ice. But at the start of the period, because the cold PDO and AMO together in the 1970s cooled the Arctic, the Arctic ice cap was way above normal.

Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu
BUT NOTICE THE SOUTHERN OCEANS WHEN THE ARCTIC WARMING IS GOING ON! THEY ARE COOLER!

Bingo, this is compensating cooling. So there is a cyclical distortion. The real key is measuring the water vapor, using temperatures is the wrong metric! Because without the amount of water vapor increasing, there can be no trapping. Co2 is 1/100th of the GHG and it’s likely that’s just about its influence on the entire shooting match of temps. It is estimated that the GHG blanket adds 33°C to the planet’s temperature. Co2 is boxed in at a range of 0.4 to 0.7 of that. It can do nothing because of all that is around it.
This explains perfectly the whole temperature pattern. Given the way we measure temperature, and the fact most of the warming has been in the Arctic in its cold season when there is little overall effect on the water vapor at such cold temperatures, it is highly likely that the subtle compensating cooling in the south over a much more moisture-laden atmosphere means there is no change in the true global temperature. What is happening now is that the atmosphere has adapted to the added warmth in the same way your shower room adapts to the turning on of a hot shower. So what happens when you turn off the shower (i.e. oceans flip their cycles)? It cools.

Notice the cooling in the Antarctic summer, limiting the ice melt season!
We are now in the period of “temperature leveling off”, where the atmosphere is readjusting from the previous increase in heat and moisture from the warmer cycles.
So here is the test we are in. I said in 2007 global temps would come down because of the shift in the PDO. Since 2005, its plain to see a slight downturn in a jagged fashion has started – just as I predicted 7 years ago:

The reason for the fewer, less intense El Ninos is because we are going back to the cycle of the colder PDO periods, plainly evident in the Multivariate Enso Index.

You can see the warm PDO and the major ENSO events that occurred when the globe warmed and the leveling off since then. Naturally, once the Atlantic flips, the global temps will return to where they were, as measured by satellite, at the start of the satellite era, which coincided with the START OF THE WARM PDO!
Its intuitive and natural…if you warm the tropical Pacific, you warm the temperature, but the compensating cooling is waiting in the longer term. That was my idea with the triple crown of climate back in 2007. The sun, the oceans, and stochastic events rule the climate.
So the test is on, and it doesn’t cost 165 billion dollars to justify an agenda (amount US has spent on climate change). It takes a working knowledge of where the climate has  gone in order to know where it is likely to go. Once the AMO flips to its cool phase, global temperatures will begin a descent much like the ascent we witnessed back in the 80s and 90s, which got us to our current plateau.
The Arctic is already showing, with the lack of ice melt this summer, what it will do once the AMO flips for good (in 5-10 years). It will recover. The global temperature will drop, but it will not be a drop representing a coming ice age or true cooling, just the cycle swinging back the other way. Meanwhile the Antarctic cap will retreat, eventually to levels seen in the 1970s and early 1980s.
If the southern ice cap does not shrink, then that will be a problem, but I have confidence it will.
When you are right, there are reasons. And when you are wrong there are often excuses, which is what you see from the people today who label the very people who said there is climate change (naturally) and made the correct forecast, as Deniers. The real danger to the globe is not global warming, it’s the global warming agenda. In a way, that is what the increase in the Antarctic ice cap shows you.
See Joe explain it here at the Saturday Summary.

We all want a cleaner, more sustainable environment, but effective changes won’t come from loony Greens or ranting adolescents. They will come from sensible decision making based on scientific data, not emotional rage.



We should remember this when we are assaulted by strident demands from a generation which rejects eating meat to save the planet from greenhouse gases, which urges us to follow its lead because glaciers are melting, sea levels are dramatically rising and polar bears are starving to death because of man-made climate change.



Of course, very little of this is true, much less their fault and **previous generations are to blame for the “disaster” because they invented the technology** that, incidentally, provides this ungrateful generation with warm, dry, housing, efficient transport, life-saving hospital equipment and procedures, affordable clothing and good food on their tables.



Greta Thunberg rejected air travel because of the environmental cost, choosing instead to sail to her UN platform to berate us about killing the planet and ourselves. But will she reject medical technology, when she needs it, to stand by her principles? Thought not.



Until this generation throws away its computers and mobile phones, ditches fossil-fueled transport and refuses all medical treatment except via herbs and naturopaths, it is simply a generation of hypocrites.



They are typical social justice warriors who refuse to research the facts, instead protesting, shouting and hysterically screaming at the sky – all at someone else’s behest – and always blaming someone else for the impending prophetic doom. Venting doesn’t change anything, but perhaps it makes them feel better.



“How dare you?” thunders the venomous Greta Thunberg, saying “we” have stolen her childhood. Then she contradicts herself by saying “I feel like I’m dying inside if I don’t protest.” So who is to blame for what is happening inside her head? She also says “I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future”. But the media lap up every word, holding up St Greta as the saviour of the planet, and children everywhere follow her lead.



They scream, protest and do little else. They certainly do not listen to the quiet voice of reason. 



Against loud media voices saying Trump didn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell, the quiet American voice of reason was strong enough to buck the liberal lefty trend and elect a sensible president. Australia quickly followed suit with their own sensible prime minister. 



These two talk about reducing unemployment, bolstering national defence, making trade surpluses and better decisions. **They are the voice of the quiet majority.** This unites them along with their “shared objectives” and “looking through the world through similar lenses”. As ScoMo said, “Australia and America are warmed by the same inner fires.”



 **Both leaders measure their success by numbers rather than feelings.**



Australia’s defence spending will be 2% of GDP, second only to the USA. Australia is in its 29th year of economic growth, including a strategic four billion-dollar free trade agreement with China (Trump is still working on theirs). I can only imagine Trump or Morrison’s privately held, un-PC responses to our “Wellness Budget”.



Mike Pence welcomed the Australian prime minister and his wife to the White House describing Trump’s 2016 election by the American **“forgotten men and women”**. Similarly, he said Australia’s **“quiet majority”** elected Scott Morrison. It gives me hope.



 **Pence also said the greatest tie between these two great nations is forged on the lives of those who died protecting freedom.**



“This evening, we honor every Aussie and American hero who has paid the supreme sacrifice so that we might live in safety and in peace.”



Remembering that our heritage is also built on the lives of New Zealanders, we must counter the temptation to treat our freedom with the casual disdain of youth and we must protect it from abuse. For instance, we achieved the freedom to express our sexuality but then went a step too far when people are free to switch from Arthur to Martha, demand non-sexist language and insist babies are born genderless, their gender to be chosen by the infant within its first few years. This is not freedom.



Within _The BDF_ , and elsewhere, we find kindred spirits who remember the real cost of the freedom that we refuse to take for granted, and it gives me hope that a quiet revolution will happen here.

I have confirmed that www.drroyspencer.com has been hacked and rendered inoperable.
Dr. Spencer confirms this in an email exchange with me this AM and writes:

“Apparently some Indonesian female hacker.”
Whether this is a direct attack on his views about climate, an indirect attack via a hired gun, or just some kid looking to hold up a trophy for others to see is unclear at this point.
It does point to the risks though of running an independent server. My best advice to anyone in the climate issue is to run on wordpress.com rather than an independent server as they keep everything running smoothly and up to date against the latest security threats.

About those ‘record’ Death Valley temperatures everybody is waiting for…

UPDATE: 128°F today at Death Valley COOP station. See Record Event Report below.
It seems the media and the alarmists are cheering on the possibility of an all-time temperature record in Death Valley. There’s lots of hullabaloo over the supposedly tied all time temperature record of 117°F in Las Vegas yesterday, which turned out to be false, but was tied today. And there has been lots of news on the potential for a new all-time temperature record in Death Valley, which would negate the all time world record of 134°F on July 10th, 1913, since the previous world record in Libya of 136.4°F (58°C) was recently said to be unreliable due to it being measured over asphalt and having an untrained observer.
But it looks like this anticipated new record for Death Valley may not come to pass. As of this writing, it is 125°F in Death Valley according to the Climate Reference Network site, the last three days of hourly data show it to be well short of the all time record, and the forecasts are ramping down for the predicted high in Death Valley and are expected to fall well short of the 134°F all time record:

Source: http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mesowest/getobext.php?wfo=vef&sid=ISWC1&num=72&raw=0
NWS Las Vegas posted this infographic about the COOP station there:

But that only tells half of the story. You see, about 100 meters away  from the Cotton Region Shelter (CRS) aka Stevenson Screen is was a NOAA MMTS electronic thermometer, which I documented on Wednesday the 31st of October 2007:


Note the proximity to the asphalt and the building, a definite siting no-no. This station would be a CRN4 (unacceptable siting – heat sinks/sources within 10 meters) in this setup since the asphalt is less than 10 meters away.
Source: SurfaceStations.org
Here’s the aerial view:

But, an interesting thing has occurred, and I’d like to think that my work had something to do with it. It seems NOAA has abandoned the MMTS electronic thermometer and has gone back to using the max-min mercury thermometer in the Stevenson Screen.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen this happen, especially since the MMTS was supposed to be the “modernized” version of the COOP station equipment.
Metadata at NCDC confirms this, see below. the max-min thermometer was put back in service on September 19th, 2012:

The MMTS electronic thermometer went in service on May 20th, 1999:

Source: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/homr/#ncdcstnid=10100093&tab=PHR
What the NWS Las Vegas doesn’t mention in their infographic when they say “things have become much more modern today” is that the site was using modernized equipment for over 12 years, but now has “de-modernized” the station.
Here’s another infographic from the high yesterday, showing the thermometer reading. The photo taken by the National Park Service:

Why would this be?
I have two possible confounding factors.
1. As we learned from Menne et al. 2010, the MMTS shelter has a cool bias despite the overwhelming proximity of these sensors to buildings and other surfaces due to cable length/trenching issues putting them closer than the original stations they replaced. This has to do with the Gill shield (the stacked plates on the pole) offering better protection from solar radiation than the older stations. This better exposure and hence a cooler measurement environment is actually of greater magnitude than the warming introduced by proximity to buildings and surfaces.
2. As we learned from the SurfaceStations project, many CRS/Stevenson screen stations are is disrepair due to paint issues and blackening of  wood due to exposure. They tend to read higher temperatures due to absorbing more solar radiation due to flaking paint and darkening wood.
Did NOAA decide to go back to the CRS/Stevenson Screen because they knew it had a better chance of setting a new all-time high temperature record? It’s a possibility. It is also possible that since the El-Azizia record was shot down, purists argued that it would be unfair to record this important temperature with equipment that has a different character. They’d be right.
No matter what the reason, NOAA has done something unprecedented as far as I know: they closed a modernized temperature reporting station in use over a decade in favor of the older technology.
I hope to hear more about this, and I’ll advise if I find an official reason.
One thing is for certain, in 1934, there wasn’t a big parking lot next to the station as we have today:

Now there’s one more station in Death Valley you should know about, placed to obtain an “unofficial record”. The late great johnDaly explains:
Badwater
 by    John L. Daly     
(19th July 2002)
In climatology, record-breaking is of little significance climatically speaking. An all-time hot record in one place can be easily matched by an all-time cold record somewhere else. This year in the U.S. and in Australia, both hot and cold records have been broken at various times and places. They make interesting fare for the Guinness Book of Records, but little else.
However, record-breaking does have one purpose for the greenhouse industry, namely that of heightening public fears about global warming. For this reason, the industry likes to see hot records being broken as often as possible, present a lot of media hype about them, and then go into quick denial and spin-making when cold records are broken, sometimes even blaming the cold record on global warming!
The industry also dislikes a hot record being very old, such as the all-time hot daytime record for Australia of 53.1°C. set at Cloncurry, Queensland in 1889. Valuable research money and academic effort was spent in a futile effort to discredit that one record (Trewin, B., Aust. Met. Mag. 46 (1997) 251-256).
There is one all-time hot record that is the ultimate global prize: 58°C (136°F) set at Al Aziziya, Libya, in 1922. This was the hottest temperature ever recorded anywhere in the world and has stood for 80 years in spite of real or imagined `global warming”. It is even noted in the Guinness Book of Records. But 1922 is a long time ago and the longer it stands, the less convincing are the claims about global warming in the eyes of the public.
To topple this record, the industry has not bothered with the Cloncurry approach – that of seeking to discredit the record itself – as that appeared to be, and was, merely sour grapes and spin.

Fig.1 – Badwater
Instead, the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), has set up their own temperature instrument in Death Valley, even though there is already a long-standing instrument at Furnace Creek right in the open central part of the valley.
The new instrument is located 20 miles south of Furnace Creek at Badwater (Fig.1).
The photo shows the Badwater area with a large salt pan stretching into the far distance, caused by evaporation of salty water welling up from a spring just metres this side of the sign shown in the photo.

Fig.2 – GISS Historical Data for Furnace Creek
It was at Furnace Creek that the all-time hottest record in the USA was broken, 57°C. ( 134°F.) in 1913, just 2°F short of the Libyan all-time record.
The GISS historical data for Death Valley (i.e. Furnace Creek) is presented left and shows no overall warming at Death Valley since the 1950s.
The new instrument at Badwater was installed in the late 1990s, but it must be stressed that the record left is for Furnace Creek, not Badwater. Yet the public plaque on the instrument at Badwater implies otherwise.

Fig.3 – Part of the Badwater Plaque
Here is how the public plaque at Badwater misrepresents Death Valley (Fig.3). It’s red graph line traces the same data as the one above, and it is immediately clear that the ARC graph differs from GISS in that the ARC graph shows a continuous warming whereas the GISS graph only shows warming pre-1950s with little long-term change since. They can’t both be right. The plaque also said –
“During the summer of 1998 – the warmest year on record – we recorded the hottest air temperature anywhere in the world of 53.06°C ±0.1°C (128°F) on 17 July 1998 at 3:15 pm local standard time.”
Having mentioned 1998, that year was conveniently left off the chart. And with good reason, as Fig.2 shows that 1998 was a particularly cool year.

(left) Fig.4 – The Badwater instrument.
What exactly do those skilfully crafted words on the plaque mean anyway? Note, it refers to 1998 as the `warmest year on record’, but omits to say they are referring to the world as whole, not to Death Valley itself. 1998 at Death Valley (Furnace Creek) was actually cooler than usual.
The plaque claims Death Valley recorded the hottest air temperature anywhere in the world on 17th July 1998 – implying it was an all-time world record. It was not. It was referring to 1998 only. Actually, the hottest temperature ever recorded at Death Valley was way back in 1913 on 10th July – a whopping 134°F (57°C).
The sharp dip in temperature near the end of the record (Fig.2) was – 1998 ! – the `warmest year on record’ according to the plaque. In fact, 1998 was the coolest year at Death Valley since 1945, belying the implied claims about 1998.
Note how the ARC plaque refers to `Death Valley’ generally and not Badwater or Furnace Creek specifically. This merging of two quite different locations 20 miles apart is itself misleading to the public who may be unaware that `Death Valley’ now has more than one weather station.
A photo of the weather instrument at Badwater is shown left, the small yellow plaque mounted low down on the structure. I visited there during my trip in April this year.
Unlike the Furnace Creek instrument which is located in the open centre of the big valley, the new instrument has been mounted next to the eastern side of the valley at Badwater. The local topography is such that the instrument sits in a curved hollow (topographical map – Fig.5) so that it is well sheltered from all but westerly winds, and fully exposed to the afternoon summer sun. In fact, the whole area around the instrument is a perfect afternoon sun trap.
On the east side of the instrument is a high west-facing cliff over 500 feet tall, a cliff which will heat up magnificently in the afternoon sun on a hot summer’s day. 280 feet up on that cliff is a large sign which says `mean sea level’ (Badwater is 285 feet below sea level).

Fig.5 – Topographical Map of the Badwater area
Rising steeply above the cliff is the aptly named Dantes Peak, 785 feet high, overlooking what must be the nearest thing to `Dante’s Hell’ on Earth – Badwater in Death Valley.
On the western side of the instrument is a vast white salt pan, caused by salt deposits from a spring bubbling up from underground (the `bad water’) (Fig.1&6). This salt pan has a high albedo to sunlight so that the afternoon sun will reflect light and heat off the white expanse directly onto the cliff and the instrument itself. On a bright afternoon, it will act almost like a mirror to sunlight.


Fig.6 – The vast salt pan and salty spring directly to the west of the instrument
In all of Death Valley, the ARC has chosen just about the hottest spot possible in the hottest valley in North America. They have in effect put it into a natural oven – and done so in the full knowledge of Badwater’s topography. Now all they have to do is wait – wait for the inevitable day when the conditions will be just right – clear skies, still air, a blazing sun, and that instrument will heat up from the combined heating of the air, the immense heating from the nearby cliff only metres behind the instrument, the intense reflected heat radiation from the salt pan, and the mercury will very likely fall over the Libyan line and record the `hottest temperature ever measured on earth’.
Then we will see the champagne corks fly as the greenhouse industry will cry with righteous indignation, announcing the `new hottest temperature ever recorded on earth’, how it’s all due to global warming etc. etc. and all the time, the whole thing will be about as fake as a three dollar bill.
Even the wording on the plaque on the instrument betrays the real intent – the exclusive emphasis on the significance of heat, of global warming, of record-breaking temperatures, of the `hottest year ever’ etc. The plaque speaks of little else. Even the opening words of the text are `Carbon dioxide released by human activities etc. ….’. Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that record-breaking is the primary purpose of the instrument, not genuine climatic research.

Fig.7 – The full information contained on the public plaque
This is further suggested by The Ames Astrogram, February 7, 2000, Page 2, who reported on a field trip by some of its scientists to Death Valley, (among them Dr Chris McKay who is cited on the plaque), and made this reference to the Badwater weather station – “The next stop was Badwater — minus284 feet below sea level, the lowest point in North America. McKay checked on a weather station he had installed at Badwater two years ago to precisely measure the temperature changes there and monitor global warming — which is much more noticeable in an extremely hot environment like Death Valley. In1999, McKay’s weather station recorded the continent’s highest temperature — a toasty 53.01 C.”
Even here, we have the focus squarely on global warming and breaking records just as on the plaque. ARC even reports the breaking of a continental record. If the Libyan world record of 1922 is broken, as seems inevitable at Badwater eventually, we can expect the full media scare treatment.
Death Valley is an interesting natural phenomenon because this valley is so unique, but the only instrument which will be credible in setting records or trends is the one at Furnace Creek, set properly in the open middle of the valley with a long respectable history of temperature data behind it.
If there is a media announcement of a record being broken at Death Valley, the skeptical observer should immediately demand to know if the record was broken at Furnace Creek, or at Badwater. If it is Furnace Creek, then the record will be quite genuine. But if it is Badwater, then the record will be a complete fake.

Someday, in the future, this post may be referenced when a new world record temperature is recorded in Death Valley. If there is a new all time high at Badwater, making it the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth, I hope a future researcher will point out the siting/placement issue of the station at Badwater. – Anthony

"Driving down a tight mountain road in Jarabacoa, a town in the middle of the Dominican Republic, Oscar Pedro Duran Abreu saw the oncoming Jeep weaving in the other lane before it hit him. He remembers trying to swerve. He remembers the Jeep slamming into his side door, pushing his car into the safety blocks on the side of the road, saving him from a steep fall down the mountainside. “And I don’t remember anything else,” he said of that day in September 2010. Mr. Duran learned later that the other driver had been drunk and that his Jeep had flipped. The four passengers in the Jeep were injured, but the driver, unharmed, pushed his way out of the vehicle and fled. “Leaving me for dead,” Mr. Duran said. Unconscious, Mr. Duran was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was in a coma for 29 days. Six years later, seated at a table with his children, Jose and Karina Duran, and speaking through an interpreter, Mr. Duran leaned back in a chair at his son’s school and recalled emerging from the coma with his jaw wired shut. He looked around and thought, “What happened?” The accident left him with injuries to his neck, spinal cord and knee, as well as a broken jaw, extensive memory loss and nerve damage causing numbness in his face. The crash also knocked out eight teeth, which he has not been able to afford to replace. He spent the next 92 days on bed rest. Doctors placed metal plates in his neck and left knee, but he is still unable to bend the knee or kneel and has trouble walking. “Since the accident, my closest friend has been pain,” he said. The sixth of 11 children, Mr. Duran grew up on a farm in Jarabacoa, where his family grew yucca and sweet potatoes, among other crops, until he was 18. With only a   education, he left for Santo Domingo, the capital, working as a shoe shiner and a waiter, and held various jobs in a supermarket, a casino and a hospital. He later began a   career in the national police force, working as a homicide investigator in Jarabacoa until his accident. But his extensive injuries kept him from returning to the national police. Then, in 2012, the   relationship with the mother of his children fell apart. She took the children to live with her, but Mr. Duran eventually had them come live with him. To get them out of the Dominican Republic, his mother, a permanent resident of the United States who often stayed with her children in New York, referred him for a residential visa. He joined the family in New York in July 2013, fulfilling his mother’s wish to have all of her children together in the United States. She returned to the Dominican Republic after settling him in America, and died six months later. Unable to work because of his injuries, Mr. Duran struggled to find his way in a new country. He lived with siblings in Brooklyn for a year but was unable to contribute to the family’s income. So in spring 2014, he found himself homeless with his children in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. “It was cold,” Jose, now 12, recalled of the two nights they spent sleeping on a park bench. Mr. Duran added: “Life has kicked me down. But I have to go forward  —   for them. ” He smiled at his children, who sat quietly on each side of him. Mr. Duran found them a studio at a city shelter on East 178th Street in the Bronx. His request for two rooms  —   one for his daughter, 10, for privacy  —   was later granted. The family does not pay rent, but with Mr. Duran unable to work, it struggles to make ends meet. In March 2016, Mr. Duran briefly worked as a cabdriver. However, the car payments and maintenance, coupled with the pain from his knee injury, soon became too much, and he quit the service. Now the family receives $205 a month in food stamps. Jose, a seventh grader at C. S. 211, a bilingual magnet school in the Bronx, is working to become fluent in English. His sister is already fluent. The   program is run by the Children’s Aid Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In April,   program staff members noticed that Jose was wearing the same   clothes every day. The Children’s Aid Society provided the family with $375 in gift cards to Payless, Old Navy and Modell’s Sporting Goods to buy new school clothes and shoes for the children. Despite the family’s struggles, Mr. Duran said he did not let poverty bother him. He spoke reverently of his father, Pedro Lucia Duran, a forest ranger and village confidant, whom he called “a simple man, an honorable man. ” He added: “There’s no man like my father. He raised 11 children to be serious and honest, and he did it as a poor man. ” For that reason, he also does not seek out riches. “My father always said, ‘In America, the president eats lobster,’” he recalled with a laugh. “‘But in the Dominican Republic, the poor eat lobster. ’” Mr. Duran said he wanted only to raise his own children in the same manner as his father. While in the United States, he hopes his children can work toward their own dreams. Karina, a fifth grader, enjoys painting and drawing and would like to become a pop star, she said with a shy smile. Jose  —   who “really can draw,” according to his sister  —   is fascinated by space, but has no interest in becoming an astronaut. He wants to build the spaceships instead. “And my American dream?” Mr. Duran said. “My dream is that if I die today, my children will be able to do what they want and to remain humble and polite. ” As for Mr. Duran, 52, he worries that he is a burden on a social assistance system that, after a career in the Dominican Republic, he is unable to contribute to here. He would like to return to his country one day, he said, adding that he was happy there. But he fears that politics, drugs and guns have broken an otherwise beautiful nation. “America is the best there is,” he said. “I’m thankful to this country for taking me and my children in. But despite all these problems in my country, if I could, I’d still go back. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRenowned Swedish sea level expert and climatologist Nils-Axel Mörner also responded by e-mail on the Antarctic sea ice expansion.
Here’s his view:
=====================================
The Antarctic sea ice and sea surface temperature
Nils-Axel Mörner
Whilst there is a general hysteria of global warming, increasing temperature and rising sea level, new records from Antarctica indicate the opposite: a significant increase in the extent of sea ice over the last 30 years (in the order of 1 million square km) and a decrease in sea surface temperature south of Lat. 60°S (in the order of 0.4 °C).
Why is this?
First, the global warming hysteria is just what it is: a large-scale hysteria, which is primarily based on disinformation:
– The warming during the 20th century seems primarily driven by the Sun.
– There is negative evidence of CO2-driven process.
– The cooling over the last 17 years and 11 months is predominantly driven by the Sun.
– Sea level is by no means rising at an alarming rate.

Secondly, events taking place south of the Circum-Antarctic circulation belt are bound to be driven by other, often negatively correlated, effects than those recorded north of this belt:
– South of the Circum-Antarctic circulation belt ocean circulation and wind currents may generate climatic signals quite opposite to those in the north.
– An expansion of the sea ice over the last 30 years is not surprising.
– Nor is an increase in sea surface temperature of 0.4 °C since 2003 surprising.
But it all calls for an observationally based view of climate; in stead of a general hysteria.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNowhere have records been falling faster than in Antarctica. And what is shocking is that these records are all tied to cooling – and not warming.
Antarctica has been setting new maximum sea ice records almost daily, and never has Antarctic sea ice been so high for so long since satellite measurements began some 35 years ago. Sea ice anomaly has averaged over 1 million square kilometers for over one year.

Figure 1: Antarctic sea ice anomaly. The mean of the past three decades has been rising for 30 years. Approximate mean bars added by author. Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu
Almost daily observers of southern hemispheric sea ice have been hearing of a new record for ice extent for the date. The overall trend is not something that can be regarded as a recent anomaliy attributed to natural weather-like variability. Rather it really has to do with multidecadal trends that are unrelated to manmade CO2 emissions.
Iciest Antarctic decade ever
Figure 1 above shows how each south polar decade is icier than the one before. There is only one reason for this: There is less and less heat down there to prevent ice from forming, which seems to squarely contradict claims of a warming that is global.
In total the global (Arctic and Antarctic combined) sea ice mean for the last one and half years has been above the long-term mean. Scientists are scrambling to find out what has gone wrong with their model calculations. It wasn’t supposed to be so.
Figure 1 also shows how Antarctic sea ice has remained steadfastly above normal for more than two and half years, something that has never happened since satellite measurements began. Moreover, Anthony Watts here writes: “We are now on day 1001 of positive anomaly based on the 1979-2008 baseline.” Scientists who have long claimed the globe is warming are baffled and a few are even so shocked that they are denying it altogether.
The year of daily sea ice records
2014 for Antarctica has been especially icy. Figure 2 below shows how 2014 daily sea ice extent, depicted by the bold red curve, has been setting new record daily highs for the last 5 months.

Figure 2: Sea ice extent for 2014 depicted by red curve. Source: sunshinehours. 
Not only has the sea ice area expanded at the South Pole but so has volume, this according to Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute last October. In a German language press release the Bremerhaven-based AWI concluded that “from various studies the total volume of the Antarctic sea ice has grown over the last years.”

Record low temperatures
Not only record sea ice extent and volume are telling us that Antractica is cooling dramatically, but so are the thermometers. For example last year the National Geographic reported here that NASA had recorded the coldest temperature ever on the Antarctica continent: -136°F. Also the University of Wisconsin, Madison reported that the South Pole Station saw a new record low temperature of -73.8°C (-100.8°F) on June 11, 2012, breaking the previous minimum temperature record of -73.3°C (-99.9°F) set in 1966.
Just weeks ago CFACT reported that the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) saw a record cold of -55.4°C.
In 2010 the Neumayer III station, operated by Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute, recorded the lowest temperature at their Antarctic location in their 29 years of operation. The mercury dropped to -50.2°C.
Antarctic freeze-up still being denied
Some global-warming-hypothesizing scientists are finding it difficult to cope with the reality of growing sea ice at the South Pole, some even insisting that it is shrinking, or that the expansion is a sign of warming and that the trend will reverse later in the future. But other experts (skeptics) think these scientists are being naive to think that a trace gas could control the entire global climate system. The climate system, they say, is far too complex and many other more potent factors are really at play. And so these experts aren’t at all surprised by what is going on.
Willie Soon, Professor of astrophysics and geosciences at the Solar and Stellar Physics (SSP) Division of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, says, “The South Pole is in sharp contradiction against the CO2 global warming scenarios which were supposed to melt most of the ice masses of the world.” So much so, Soon says, that “it is still being denied by some professional scientists“. Soon says that the freezing of the South Pole is “one fact that shows how much more we need to understand about how the Earth climate system can vary naturally and how different regions are inter-related to each other rather than insisting that all changes and variations must be caused by rising atmospheric CO2 alone.”
Antarctic sea ice should retreat when PDO and AMO cool
Veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi, who specializes in providing commercial clients with short-term and seasonal forecasts, also thinks other major global factors are at play – for one: ocean surface temperature oscillations in the Pacific and Atlantic, i.e. the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Decadal Oscillation (AMO): “The southern oceans around Antarctic are cool in a warm PDO, but warm in a cool PDO.”
Bastardi believes that once the PDO is well into the cool phase, the Antarctic sea ice will retreat. “If the southern ice cap does not shrink, then that will be a problem, but I have confidence it will.”
But Arctic will recover
Conversely Bastardi thinks that as the AMO enters its cool phase, in about 5 -10 years, the Arctic will be well on its way to recovery. Already we see signs of that starting today. Joe has written an entire essay on this, and it will be posted tomorrow.
In summary: While scientists who have invested careers in tying climate change to CO2 are scrambling to explain the lack of cooperation by the sea ice at the South Pole, other experts think the anomaly is all part of longer term natural cycles which man is powerless to stop.

"We find ourselves in an era of what we might call creative self-destruction. We’re destroying ourselves – it’s as simple as that.  Economic growth and exploiting nature’s resources have long gone hand-in-hand, but as repeated warnings from scientists and reports such as the latest from the IPCC tell us, they now constitute the most ill-fated of bedfellows. Climate change, the greatest threat of our time, is perhaps the definitive manifestation of the well-worn links between economic progress and devastation. How can we allow this to happen? The sheer scale of the problem undoubtedly makes genuinely united efforts difficult, but there must be other fundamental reasons for the alarmingly limited reaction to the spectre of all-out ecological disaster. The corporate world’s responses to climate change have a significant influence. Many might be more accurately described as narratives, or even myths. Like Plato’s original Noble Lie (that served to ensure only those “most suited” to governing were able to), they advance an agenda and maintain the status quo. They thrive on the age-old dichotomy of “us” and “them”, and while we may be acutely aware of imminent catastrophe, somehow we’ve become convinced that someone else will save us. It’s easy enough to condemn these myths. It’s easy to become angry about them and to rail against the self-serving short-termism at their root. But until we appreciate quite how brilliantly they satisfy their purpose to protect the interests of some at the expense of the rest, any meaningful alternatives will remain elusive. Our recent study of corporate responses to climate change sets out not to disprove these myths but to understand how they work and what they achieve. We looked at how 25 major corporations in the resources, energy, manufacturing, transport, finance and retail sectors responded to climate change between 2010-12. The analysis involved interviews with senior and operational managers and an in-depth investigation of sustainability assessments, annual reports, submissions to governments, shareholder briefings, climate-change presentations and policy documents. Three key myths emerged, each helping to obscure the link between the accumulation of capital and the erosion of natural resources. Each has shown itself to be dangerously seductive. The first, the myth of corporate environmentalism, portrays corporations as the saviours of the environment. It stresses firms’ willingness – even determination – to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, produce “green” products and services, and to act on environmental criticism of their products, services or policies. Revelling in the ideals of transparency and accountability, it conveys the message that corporations are best placed to respond to climate change and that alternatives – inevitably including government regulation – will inevitably be less effective. In other words, it’s business as usual. Don’t query the underlying economic system, simply refine our own habits, for which corporations will continue to be the “value-neutral” providers. The suggestion is that the answer to over-consumption is more, but better, consumption. By the grace of their hand, corporations have equipped us with the tools to save ourselves: now it falls to us as individuals to use them wisely. The second myth, corporate citizenship, strengthens corporations’ moral role in leading us to supposed salvation. It depicts corporations as legitimate entities in public debate and paints them as representatives of “the people”. This is how corporations give us a voice. In effect however, the only way this voice is heard is through consumption. The result is that citizenship itself becomes a surrogate for corporate interests of profit and shareholder value. This isn’t democracy: it’s the cementing of the narcissistic conceit that says what’s good for corporations is good for all citizens. That corporate citizenship has long since become a dead metaphor highlights the astonishing strength of this myth. Perhaps even more powerful, though, is the myth of corporate omnipotence, the idea that companies, thanks to their rationality and efficiency, are capable of taming nature itself. And so the most improbable promises and claims go unquestioned. The state isn’t sidestepped, but should be no more than a co-creator or supporter of schemes that put profitability above all else. Even where climate change is concerned, the bottom line still rules. We’ve heard similar boasts before, of course. The global financial system was supposed to be rational and efficient as well – how quickly we forget. But this is what passes for normality. Somehow we now find ourselves content to bear idle witness to the ever more innovative destruction of our world in the pursuit of gain. As one senior manager interviewed during the course of the research remarked: “It’s all about recognising that this change is happening and taking a leadership position to be able to leverage the opportunities that come out of it.” While stunningly blunt, this pales next to the brutally forthright admission of one CEO: “I’m going to be real frank here. We’re not doing this to save the planet – that’s not the driver. We’re industrialists.” The principal consequence of this unshakably capitalist mindset is the same inevitable end first identified by Marx more than 150 years ago in The Communist Manifesto and Das Kapital, but on a magnitude far greater than can be imagined. The inescapable fact of the matter is that while you can fool some people all of the time, or all people some of the time, the environment cannot be deceived. This was put well by maverick physicist Richard Feynman, who was outraged, when the technical failure that destroyed the Challenger space shuttle before a live TV audience of millions was traced back to NASA’s insistence that the launch go ahead in unusually cold conditions, that NASA – another organisation keen to bask in claims of rationality and efficiency – could be so stupid and arrogant. “Reality must take precedence over public relations,” he wrote, “because nature cannot be fooled.” Unless we reject some prevailing myths and replace them with responses that are firmly and sincerely rooted in proper governance, human organisation and authentic engagement, we won’t have to wait long until we’re reminded of this truth.

It is always tricky to traverse the minefield of Middle East politics, and Mitt Romney appears to have stirred up more than a little controversy with his recent remarks about Israeli and Palestinian economies.



Romney pointed out that GDP per capita in Israel is $21,000, compared with $10,000 in the Palestinian Authority, and suggested that a difference in “culture” between the two countries might be partially responsible for the disparity. The Palestinians were predictably upset, and much of the media said Romney had committed a damaging gaffe. Yet, considered apart from concerns over offending Middle Eastern sensibilities, Romney’s remarks are not only accurate, they reflect a much larger truth that matters not just in the Middle East but in this upcoming election.



First, it should be noted that Romney actually got the numbers wrong: Israel’s per capita GDP is much higher, $31,282, and the Palestinian Authority’s much lower, just $1,600. No doubt the Palestinian economy has suffered as a result of Israeli security policies. Limitations on Palestinian property rights, continued Israeli control over land and water, and restrictions on both imports and exports have harmed Palestinian economic development. By some estimates, as much as 60 percent of Palestinian territory is off limits to economic development. Romney should have taken this into account.





Romney’s ‘gaffe’ revealed an important truth.



Yet, how then to account for Jordan, where GDP per capita is just $5,900, or Egypt, where it is only $6,500? Israel can hardly be blamed for a lack of economic growth in those countries. In fact, no Arab nation without substantial oil wealth has a GDP per capita greater than half that of Israel.



Perhaps Romney could have used a better term than “culture” to describe the combination of attitudes toward markets, the role of government, the welfare state, inequality, and institutions that underpin a nation’s economy, but nit‐​picking about terminology shouldn’t eclipse the larger truth: If a nation hopes to prosper, it must foster a culture conducive to prosperity.



In fact, Israel itself had to change in order to spur economic growth, abandoning the old socialist solidarity of the kibbutz for a political culture that encourages entrepreneurship, investment, and risk‐​taking. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cut taxes, reduced government spending, reformed pensions, and begun privatizing state‐​owned companies, including El Al (Israel’s national airline) parts of its electric company, and its major banks. The “new Israel,” Netanyahu has said, is based on “free enterprise, privatization, open capital markets, an end to cartels, lower taxes, [and] deregulation.”



The result has been the transformation of Israel into a hub for technological entrepreneurship. From 1993 to today, real GDP has increased fourfold, and real GDP per capita has risen 250 percent.



The Palestinian Authority has not undertaken similar reforms. Government spending continues to consume an inordinate amount of GDP. Taxes, while widely evaded, are high. Both foreign investment and domestic business remain subject to a byzantine and often corrupt regulatory regime. The Authority’s old‐​fashioned pay‐​as‐​you‐​go public pension program is accumulating enormous future liabilities. Crony capitalism is the norm rather than the exception. As a result, the Palestinian Authority’s economic growth has been nearly nonexistent.



If the Palestinians want to follow the Israeli model for economic growth, then they too will have to reduce taxes, regulations, and the burden of government. They will have to foster a culture of entrepreneurship and success. They will have to realize that the politics and policies of resentment and envy do not create a single job, start a single business, or add a single dinar of wealth.



This is true outside of the Middle East, as well. Is there any doubt that Europe’s welfare‐​state culture and the entitlement attitude that drive the high taxes and bloated governments of countries such as Greece and Spain are at least partially responsible for their problems?



Governor Romney hardly needed to go halfway around the world to demonstrate this. He could just have looked at two neighboring U.S. states, Virginia and Maryland, to see a similar dynamic. Maryland has one of the most aggressively tax‐​and‐​spend legislatures in the country. The state ranks 42nd out of 50 in terms of business environment. Its tax burden is the nation’s twelfth‐​highest. Virginia, ranked 26th for business climate, is far from the most pro‐​business state, but it is much better than Maryland. Thirty‐​three states have higher taxes than Virginia does.



As a result, Virginia’s unemployment rate is just 5.7 percent, while Maryland’s is 6.9 percent. Virginia just announced a state‐​budget surplus. Maryland continues to wrestle with a massive budget deficit. And, after Maryland passed a new “millionaires’ tax,” 31,000 residents moved out of the state, many of them to Virginia. One might consider Virginia to be Israel and Maryland to be Palestine (without the border checkpoints). That is why President Obama’s view of America’s culture, at least when it comes to economics, is so troubling. His recent remarks concerning whether business owners built their businesses on their own, even when taken in context, reflect a belief that individual initiative, intelligence, and hard work have far less to do with success than good luck. The successful are simply winners of “life’s lottery.” It is, therefore, government’s job to rectify the inequity of capricious fortune by redistributing the wealth.



President Obama would make our culture more like the cultures of Europe. If that were to happen, we wouldn’t just be a “fundamentally transformed” nation, we would be a far less prosperous one.



Don’t call it a gaffe. Governor Romney was right. Political and economic culture really does matter.

From the University of Waterloo, an extraordinary claim. While plausible, due to the fact that CFC’s have very high GWP numbers, their atmospheric concentrations compared to CO2 are quite low, and the radiative forcings they add are small by comparison to CO2. This may be nothing more than coincidental correlation. But, I have to admit, the graph is visually compelling. But to determine if his proposed cosmic-ray-driven electron-reaction mechanism is valid, I’d say it is a case of “further study is needed”, and worth funding. – Anthony

WATERLOO, Ont. (Thursday, May 30, 2013) – Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are to blame for global warming since the 1970s and not carbon dioxide, according to new research from the University of Waterloo published in the International Journal of Modern Physics B this week.
CFCs are already known to deplete ozone, but in-depth statistical analysis now shows that CFCs are also the key driver in global climate change, rather than carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
“Conventional thinking says that the emission of human-made non-CFC gases such as carbon dioxide has mainly contributed to global warming. But we have observed data going back to the Industrial Revolution that convincingly shows that conventional understanding is wrong,” said Qing-Bin Lu, a professor of physics and astronomy, biology and chemistry in Waterloo’s Faculty of Science. “In fact, the data shows that CFCs conspiring with cosmic rays caused both the polar ozone hole and global warming.”

“Most conventional theories expect that global temperatures will continue to increase as CO2 levels continue to rise, as they have done since 1850. What’s striking is that since 2002, global temperatures have actually declined – matching a decline in CFCs in the atmosphere,” Professor Lu said. “My calculations of CFC greenhouse effect show that there was global warming by about 0.6 °C from 1950 to 2002, but the earth has actually cooled  since 2002. The cooling trend is set to continue for the next 50-70 years as the amount of CFCs in the atmosphere continues to decline.”
The findings are based on in-depth statistical analyses of observed data from 1850 up to the present time, Professor Lu’s cosmic-ray-driven electron-reaction (CRE) theory of ozone depletion and his previous research into Antarctic ozone depletion and global surface temperatures.
“It was generally accepted for more than two decades that the Earth’s ozone layer was depleted by the sun’s ultraviolet light-induced destruction of CFCs in the atmosphere,” he said. “But in contrast, CRE theory says cosmic rays – energy particles originating in space – play the dominant role in breaking down ozone-depleting molecules and then ozone.”
Lu’s theory has been confirmed by ongoing observations of cosmic ray, CFC, ozone and stratospheric temperature data over several 11-year solar cycles. “CRE is the only theory that provides us with an excellent reproduction of 11-year cyclic variations of both polar ozone loss and stratospheric cooling,” said Professor Lu. “After removing the natural cosmic-ray effect, my new paper shows a pronounced recovery by ~20% of the Antarctic ozone hole, consistent with the decline of CFCs in the polar stratosphere.”
By proving the link between CFCs, ozone depletion and temperature changes in the Antarctic, Professor Lu was able to draw almost perfect correlation between rising global surface temperatures and CFCs in the atmosphere.
“The climate in the Antarctic stratosphere has been completely controlled by CFCs and cosmic rays, with no CO2 impact. The change in global surface temperature after the removal of the solar effect has shown zero correlation with CO2 but a nearly perfect linear correlation with CFCs – a correlation coefficient as high as 0.97.”

Data recorded from 1850 to 1970, before any significant CFC emissions, show that CO2 levels increased significantly as a result of the Industrial Revolution, but the global temperature, excluding the solar effect, kept nearly constant. The conventional warming model of CO2, suggests the temperatures should have risen by 0.6°C over the same period, similar to the period of 1970-2002.
The analyses indicate the dominance of Lu’s CRE theory and the success of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
“We’ve known for some time that CFCs have a really damaging effect on our atmosphere and we’ve taken measures to reduce their emissions,” Professor Lu said. “We now know that international efforts such as the Montreal Protocol have also had a profound effect on global warming but they must be placed on firmer scientific ground.”
“This study underlines the importance of understanding the basic science underlying ozone depletion and global climate change,” said Terry McMahon, dean of the faculty of science. “This research is of particular importance not only to the research community, but to policy makers and the public alike as we look to the future of our climate.”
Professor Lu’s paper, Cosmic-Ray-Driven Reaction and Greenhouse Effect of Halogenated Molecules: Culprits for Atmospheric Ozone Depletion and Global Climate Change, also predicts that the global sea level will continue to rise for some years as the hole in the ozone recovers increasing ice melting in the polar regions.
“Only when the effect of the global temperature recovery dominates over that of the polar ozone hole recovery, will both temperature and polar ice melting drop concurrently,” says Lu.
The peer-reviewed paper published this week not only provides new fundamental understanding of the ozone hole and global climate change but has superior predictive capabilities, compared with the conventional sunlight-driven ozone-depleting and CO2-warming models.

 **Presented in association with[The Unshackled](https://www.theunshackled.net). Trans-Tasman Talk (TTT) is hosted by Tim Wilms from Melbourne and Dieuwe de Boer from Auckland. The show debuts every Tuesday at 9pm New Zealand time (and 7pm Melbourne time). Episodes are broadcast live on the [Right Minds Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFcFU3Qv9lKc9rHEIqWd6Dw) and also on [The Unshackled](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHfXKg-zg-VrSVIu6AK5R0Q).**



In the third episode of Trans-Tasman Talk, Tim and Dieuwe look at how our respective Prime Ministers were received by Donald Trump. They discuss local developments in New Zealand, such as the Auckland Mayoral race and another NZ Labour sex scandal. Plus, Dieuwe explains Maori ethno-nationalism and how an Auckland mayoral candidate’s “seig heil” outburst had nothing to do with fascism, but rather the adoption of Nazi symbolism by local Maori gangs.



Both Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern were on the Atlantic Coast in the United States this week. ScoMo for an official state dinner with Donald Trump at the White House, and Jacinda to attend the UN Climate Change Summit in New York with keynote speaker Greta Thunberg.



Jacinda scored a pull-aside with President Trump, the lowest level of diplomatic meeting possible, while the rest of his schedule was full of bilateral meetings with other nations. Morrison had a full State Dinner with the Trump Administration while securing steel tariff concessions and a trade deal. Ardern walked away with nothing.



There was a breaking news bulletin about Brexit during the show and a brief discussion of the possibility of new trade deals with the Mother Country, a CANZUK free movement agreement, and the deportation procedures for foreign-born criminals.



Climate change has been a hot topic recently, and the Australian climate protests and New Zealand’s Zero Carbon Bill both featured on the show.



 _Due to daylight savings kicking in a week early in New Zealand, next week’s show will premiere at 9:30pm. We sync back up with Australia the week after and TTT will return to its regular slot._

"**Random border checks will be imposed to stop French holidaymakers going to ski in neighbouring Switzerland, Prime Minister Jean Castex has said.**
France, in common with Germany and Italy, is shutting its ski lifts over Christmas to stop the spread of Covid-19, but Swiss slopes are already open.
The ski season at Christmas and the New Year is a vital part of the economy for many European countries
Mr Castex said it was his duty to protect fellow citizens.
""The conclusion you need to make is that 'I'm not going to Switzerland',"" he told BFMTV on Wednesday, adding that anyone who did go would face quarantine on their return.
Several EU leaders have tried to co-ordinate plans ahead of Christmas.
However, Switzerland is not part of the European Union, and Austria and Spain are keen not to shut their slopes entirely.
That has left one French town hall on the Swiss border draping Swiss flags from its windows in protest at the French decision not to allow the ski lifts to run. ChÃ¢tel is among a number of resorts on both sides of the border that make up the Portes du Soleil ski area.
Mayor Nicolas Rubin accused French leaders of failing to listen and consult. ""We've got a problem with the French government which shuts the slopes a month before Christmas while our Swiss neighbours keep theirs open,"" he told French radio.
In Switzerland itself the situation is still unfolding. Alpine resorts want to minimise restrictions but the government will decide on Friday whether to impose a limit on visitors.
Austria on Wednesday announced that skiing would be allowed from 24 December.
However, Austrian hotels will stay closed until 7 January and quarantine requirements for people from countries with more than 100 cases per 100,000 - which include Germany and Italy - are likely to severely restrict visits from abroad.
Other EU countries are expected to set out their Covid plans for the coming weeks:
Germany seeks EU deal to close ski resorts
How Europeans are preparing to celebrate Christmas
Live updates: 'No corners cut in vaccine approval'
""I'm doing my utmost to appeal to every colleague,"" Jean Castex said. ""The Italian prime minister, the German chancellor and France are working together. The Spaniards and Swiss aren't going along with us, but diplomatic action is under way.""
He said his intention was to protect French resorts as well as French citizens from coronavirus, so not only would checks be put in place on the border, but prefects in areas along the border could impose seven-day isolation while Covid testing took place.
France is hoping to reopen its ski slopes from 20 January but the prime minister says the aim for the next few weeks is to prevent an influx of visitors over the festive season.
Among the most notorious outbreaks during the last ski season was at the Austrian resort of Ischgl, where visitors from as many as 45 countries said they caught coronavirus. Authorities are facing possible compensation claims from thousands of people for failing to act fast enough.
The World Health Organization says the problem lies not so much in the nature of skiing but in travelling to the ski slopes and in mixing with other skiers afterwards."
"The two joint leaders of the Green party, Siân Berry and Jonathan Bartley, are to stand for their job-shared role again, declaring the time is right to seize the moment and become a mass-membership movement. Berry and Bartley have held the leadership since 2018, but the party holds a contest every two years to allow others to challenge for the top job.  Bartley previously held the role jointly with the party’s only MP, Caroline Lucas, who stepped aside in 2018 saying it was time for the party to widen the pool of its prominent figures. The party will accept nominations until the end of June and then online voting will take place between 3 August and 31 August. In a joint statement announcing their intention to stand again, Berry and Bartley said it was a pivotal moment for their party. They said: “The country is in crisis and at a crossroads, and the decisions being taken now will determine what our world looks like for decades to come. We face the fundamental question of whether we will address the climate and ecological emergency, and whether we will deal with the rampant inequality, racism and poverty that scars the lives of millions – or return to business as usual. “The Green party must seize this moment. We need to be bigger and better and become a mass-membership movement that demonstrates the new kind of leadership this country so desperately needs.” The party failed to add any seats at the 2019 election, winning just 2.7% of the vote, but Lucas increased her majority in Brighton Pavilion. The overall vote share was down on its 2015 performance of 3.6%, but up on the 2017 result of 1.6%, when the party was squeezed by the surge in support for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour. Berry and Bartley said: “When we were elected, we did so on a platform of working with the wider party leadership team to take the Greens to the next level. Over this time the party has grown its membership by over 50%. “Together we have more than doubled our number of councillors, and gone from being the official opposition on five councils to playing a part in running 18 councils. And the clarity and passion of our policies and values meant we had our most successful European elections ever, electing seven MEPs last year.” They said they would continue to put a green new deal policy and the climate emergency at the heart of the party’s agenda."

Whitney reminds her listeners that since Al Gore’s “propaganda film” An Inconvenient Truth, things have not turned out as he predicted. She states that “quite inconveniently for Al Gore and the rest of the politicians who to advance this delusion”… “The earth has done nothing but get colder each year since the film’s release.” … “President Obama knows it’s getting colder. He was foolish enough to blame our recent, pathetic economic growth on record freezing weather.”
She then correctly points out that Arctic sea ice has been on the rebound and that Antarctica is as cold as ever. Also Whitney says, “Experts agree that storms have decreased.”
Citing the leaked Climategate e-mails, she accuses scientists of having “falsified data”. She correctly credits oil and free markets for leading to today’s unprecedented prosperity. Wow, I’m in love with her already!

"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

New paper finds that aging weather stations record much higher daytime temperatures, 1.63°C higher than new stations
While we are all watching the heat wave developing in the US southwest, here is something to consider. Albedo on the surfaces of weather station shelters changes with time, something I and the volunteers have documented with the Surface Stations project. For example, here’s a aged weather station where the whitewash coating is coming off and the bare wood is becoming exposed:
Back in 2007, Pat Michaels wrote in an American Spectator column “Not so Hot“:
“Weather equipment is very high-maintenance. The standard temperature shelter is painted white. If the paint wears or discolors, the shelter absorbs more of the sun’s heat and the thermometer inside will read artificially high. But keeping temperature stations well painted probably isn’t the highest priority in a poor country.”
Now there is proof that changes in station shield surfaces affect temperature
A paper published  in the International Journal of Climatology finds that aging of the solar radiation screens on weather stations is causing a large positive bias in measured temperatures of 1.63°C, which by way of comparison is more than twice the global warming of 0.7°C recorded since the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850.

According to the authors, “During the comparison [of the new vs. 5 year old] and 1 to 3-year-old screens, significant temperature differences were recorded at different times of the day. The differences, wider than the uncertainty amplitude, demonstrate a systematic effect. The temperature measured with the older screen is larger, and the maximum instantaneous difference was 1.63 °C (for 0–5 years comparison) in daytime hours.
During night-time the two AWS’s measure the same temperature (within the uncertainty amplitude). This behaviour, increasing with increasing solar radiation intensity and decreasing with increasing wind speed, is attributed to a radiative heating effect. The screen ageing has compromised the shield effectiveness introducing a significant change in the temperature evaluation.” The paper is yet another blow to the unreliable, biased, and highly upward-adjusted temperature record.
The paper: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.3765/abstract
Comparative analysis of the influence of solar radiation screen aging on temperature measurements by means of weather stations DOI: 10.1002/joc.3765
G. Lopardo et al
Abstract:
Solar radiation screens play a key role in automatic weather stations (AWS) performances. In this work, screen ageing effects on temperature measurements are examined. Paired temperature observations, traceable to national standards and with a well-defined uncertainty budget, were performed employing two naturally ventilated weather stations equipped with identical sensors and different only for their working time. Three different tests were carried out employing different aged AWSs: a 5-year-old AWS (AWS5) was compared with a new device (AWS0), a 1 year old (AWS1) was compared with both a 3 years old (AWS3) and a new one devices (AWS00). Due to solar and weather conditions exposure a degradation of the screen reflective coating is evident for the older AWSs (5 and 3 years old) and so a qualitative estimation of how different conditions of ageing affect the temperature drift was done.
During the comparison 0 to 5 and 1 to 3-year-old screens, significant temperature differences were recorded at different times of the day. The differences, wider than the uncertainty amplitude, demonstrate a systematic effect. The temperature measured with the older screen is larger, and the maximum instantaneous difference was 1.63 °C (for 0–5 years comparison) in daytime hours. During night-time the two AWS’s measure the same temperature (within the uncertainty amplitude). This behaviour, increasing with increasing solar radiation intensity and decreasing with increasing wind speed, is attributed to a radiative heating effect. The screen ageing has compromised the shield effectiveness introducing a significant change in the temperature evaluation. 
The experimental results of a further comparison, between 0- and 1-year-old screens, confirm the same conclusion showing a negligible ageing effect, within the uncertainty amplitude.

"**UK regulators have approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use.**
But while many people want an injection as soon as possible, others are worried about putting something unknown into their bodies.
This is the first and most important question scientists ask when they start designing and testing a new vaccine or treatment.
Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies.
The principle is to start small and only ever move on to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns.
As long as the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check that the vaccine or treatment is effective too.
That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - around 40,0000 individuals in the case of Pfizer/BioNTech.
In trials, half of the people are given the vaccine and the other half a dummy or placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results have been analysed, to avoid bias.
All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently.
The Covid vaccine trials have happened at breakneck speed, but they haven't skipped any of these steps.
The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine trial was voluntarily put on hold at one stage to investigate why one participant - out of many thousands - had died. It restarted once it was clear it was not related to the vaccine.
Approval will only be given for a vaccine if the government regulator, the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), is happy that it's both safe and effective.
The MHRA is part of the Department of Health, and employs more than 1,200 people. Its head is Dr June Raine, who has spent her career working in medicine regulation.
In becoming the first agency in the world to approve a coronavirus vaccine, Dr Raine said: ""The public can be absolutely confident that the standards we have worked to are equivalent to those around the world"".
Checks on the vaccine will continue to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks.
If anyone suspects they are suffering a side effect from a vaccination, they can report it to the MHRA.
Independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it first
It has drawn up interim advice on priority groups for the Covid vaccine and how many doses to use.
The JCVI, which has about 20 members who are experts on vaccines, is led by Prof Andrew Pollard, who works at the University of Oxford.
There are lots of different Covid vaccines in development.
Some contain the pandemic virus itself in a weakened form.
The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like Sars-CoV-2 - the virus that causes Covid-19.
Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines use bits of genetic code to cause an immune response, and are called mRNA vaccines.
These do not alter human cells. They only present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid.
Some Covid jabs contain proteins from coronavirus.
Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective.
There is no evidence that any of these ingredients cause harm when used in such small amounts.
Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against.
Some people do suffer mild symptoms, such as muscle aches or a bit of a temperature, after being vaccinated.
This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine.
Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients will be listed.
Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, who advises the MHRA, said it hadn't identified any ""serious adverse reactions"" during the trial of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
He said: ""Most of the adverse effects were mild and short-lasting, usually lasting for a day or two, similar to the kind of effects you get after any other vaccine"".
He added that the MHRA had a ""vigilant"" strategy to carry on monitoring the safety of the vaccine.
Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation).
Once a coronavirus vaccine is approved, it is likely that people will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid-19 in the past.
That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection.
Guidance from Public Health England says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with long Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered.
Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine.
And some vaccines are grown on hen's eggs, or cells from chick embryos.
There are hundreds of Covid vaccines in development. We don't have details on every ingredient yet, but many of the Covid vaccines are expected to be vegetarian or vegan friendly.
There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections.
Covid vaccines appear to stop people getting very sick and could save lives.
The first doses that become available will probably be offered to people with the highest need - such as the elderly - who could become severely ill.
It is not yet clear how much protection vaccines might give in terms of stopping people from spreading Covid.
If they can do this well, vaccinating enough people would stamp out the disease."

Share this...FacebookTwitterBerlin-based leftist daily TAZ here reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel isn’t going to bother attending the Ban Ki-Moon initiated climate conference in New York this coming September. The TAZ adds this has been “confirmed by a government spokesman“.
Moon personally invited all world leaders, asking them to attend with “ambition and responsibility” in order to lay the groundwork for the Paris 2015 climate conference where world leaders are to sign onto a binding agreement requiring industrialized countries to drastically cut back CO2 emissions by 2050, and thus serving as the successor agreement to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
The TAZ writes that even Presidents Barack Obama and Francois Hollande will be attending.
Merkel’s decision to snub the event is likely another sign that efforts to forge a climate agreement are already dead in water. The TAZ writes:
Ultimately only Europe and very few other countries remain on board. Canada for example has opted out. Japan and Russia are also no longer taking part.”

Merkel “burying global climate agreement”
According to the TAZ, Merkel will not be attending because of “scheduling reasons“, but added that Germany will be represented by “high-ranking” officials.
Activists groups are howling in response to Merkel’s snub. Germany’s leading global warming hysterical blog klimaretter here accuses Merkel of “burying the global climate agreement”.
Klimaretter adds that Brazil is expected to play a key role in facilitating an agreement but that the prospects of making progress look dim since negotiations suffered a huge setback in March:
The representatives of 28 EU countries postponed to October the decision on their mutual climate targets for 2030. That means: The EU will decide their new climate targets first after the Ban-Ki-Moon conference [New York]. This is a hefty setback for climate diplomacy: Of course the Brazilians aren’t going to be putting any suitable climate targets on the table when they do not even know what the Europeans have in their pockets.”

Gotta love this, with all the hullabaloo over a possible new world temperature record in Death Valley, a logging town in Washington has pre-empted them.
Hilariously, the reading of 139 degrees F is listed as “suspect” as it should be, but at 133 degrees F in the next reading (just under the Death Valley all time record of 134F) it is listed as “OK”.

Obviously it is an equipment malfunction. I wonder how many other weather stations will go on the fritz in our upcoming heat wave.

"Picking the pain reliever that’s best for you can be a confusing task. Pharmacy and supermarket shelves are lined with a dizzying array of boxes, names and labels describing the symptoms the medications are intended to address. While they all share the same goal, making you feel better, their active ingredients vary, and all have potential drawbacks. Dr. Robert A. Duarte, director of the Pain Center at Northwell Health in Great Neck, N. Y. cautioned that consumers should not be lulled into thinking that    pain relievers are free from potential harm just because they are available on store shelves. Sales of    medications exceeded $30 billion in 2015, with pain relievers ranking near the top, according to industry statistics. Consumers need to be informed about what they are taking, and in what doses. A survey conducted in 2001 for the National Council on Patient Information and Education found that only   of those polled could identify the active ingredient in their pain reliever. A similar fraction of consumers said they had taken more than the recommended dose of nonprescription medication because they believed it would increase its effectiveness. Dr. Sadiah Siddiqui, an anesthesiologist specializing in interventional pain medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine in Manhattan, said consumers need to read the labels of the medications for their active ingredients. Those who take any kind of    pain reliever around the clock for a week or more should see a specialist or their doctor, she added. Here are the major categories of nonprescription pain relievers and some of what you should know about them: Common brand name: Tylenol Recommended to treat: Headaches, pain and fever Potential side effects:The Food and Drug Administration recommends a maximum of 4, 000 milligrams per day. Exceeding that level can mean the liver has to work harder. Clinicians recommend a daily maximum dose of 3, 000 if it is taken for an extended period. What else you should know: Concerns about potential liver damage from taking acetaminophen have been clouded over time, Dr. Duarte said. The warnings surfaced because patients were taking Tylenol with other    medications or prescriptions that also contained acetaminophen. For instance, the prescription painkiller Percocet and    cold and flu remedies have Tylenol in them. When patients take those drugs as well as Tylenol, they can unwittingly get higher doses of acetaminophen than they should, he said. “You may not think you are taking that much Tylenol, but yes you are,” he said. Common brand names: Advil, Motrin Recommended to treat: Arthritic, joint and dental pain and headaches Potential side effects: Stomach bleeding and kidney problems are risks, particularly for patients who are 60 or older, Dr. Duarte said. What else you should know: Ibuprofen is an   that combats prostaglandins, the chemicals associated with pain such as menstrual cramps, joint pain and headaches that are released in the body. Common brand names: Bayer and St. Joseph. It is also found in Excedrin. Recommended to treat: Headaches and pain from inflammation. It is also used to prevent strokes and promote heart health. Potential side effects: Gastric bleeding and kidney dysfunction children up to their   years should not take aspirin because it is linked to Reye syndrome, which causes brain and liver damage. What else you should know: When it comes to Excedrin and Excedrin for migraines, opt for the less expensive basic product because they both have the same active ingredients, Dr. Duarte said, adding, “Don’t be fooled by packaging. ” In general, he said, regardless of what product you take, don’t think that if some is good, more is better. If you have an underlying history of headaches and you are regularly taking    pain relievers, you can be at risk of a “rebound headache” caused by the drugs wearing off and the onset of another headache. Some natural products, such as magnesium (400 to 600 milligrams a day) or riboflavin (400 milligrams a day) or using aromatherapy with peppermint oil can help with migraines and muscle pain, he said. Patients should discuss all the medications they take with their doctor. “A simple    in fact, has risks just the way a prescription does,” Dr. Duarte said. “A lot of the patients don’t take these medications seriously. ”"

From the Oh noes, we’re almost doomed department:
For the first time in roughly 5 million years, the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere could top 400 parts per million in the Northern Hemisphere next month.
Full story at USA Today. 
What Doyle Rice is writing about is this Tweet from Scripps:



399.72 parts per million CO2 in air
April 25, 2013
http://t.co/5Q2FLbb4ix
— Keeling_Curve (@Keeling_curve) April 26, 2013

Interesting how a single Tweet can become an entire news story, especially since Mauna Loa data still has a ways to go. It’s almost as if Doyle can’t wait for this to happen.
Expect a plethora of gloom and doom stories next month or maybe the month after when MLO hits 400.
 
Note that the seasonally corrected trend number has a ways to go and Doyle in his article cites the unofficial number, not yet released, and often corrected later:
As of Tuesday, the reading was 398.44 ppm as measured at Mauna Loa.
At Scripps, they are already gearing up for the announcement, trying to visualize what 400 PPM looks like. Apparently, it looks like a fossil skull (see their story below). For the average person, they won’t notice anything, pre 400 CO2 will look exactly to them like post 400 CO2, and just like the Y2K bug, it is nothing more than a number, and nothing will happen when that threshold is crossed. Though, if there is any severe weather anywhere in the world within that month, you can bet some fool (like Joe Romm) will try to link the two events.
From Scripps:




What Does 400 ppm Look Like?


April 25, 2013 



As atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise, scientists look back four million years for answers on what to expect from climate
The Pliocene is the geologic era between five million and three million years ago. Scientists have come to regard it as the most recent period in history when the atmosphere’s heat-trapping ability was as it is now and thus as our guide for things to come.
Recent estimates suggest CO2 levels reached as much as 415 parts per million (ppm) during the Pliocene. With that came global average temperatures that eventually reached 3 or 4 degrees C (5.4-7.2 degrees F) higher than today’s and as much as 10 degrees C (18 degrees F) warmer at the poles. Sea level ranged between five and 40 meters (16 to 131 feet) higher than today.
As for what life was like then, scientists rely on fossil records to recreate where plants and animals lived and in what quantity. Pliocene fossil records show that the climate was generally warmer and wetter than today.  Maps of Pliocene vegetation record forests growing on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic, and savannas and woodlands spreading over what is now North African desert. Both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets were smaller than today during the warmest parts of the Pliocene. 

In the oceans, fossils mark the spread of tropical and subtropical marine life northward along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard.  Both observations and models of the Pliocene Pacific Ocean show the existence of frequent, intense El Niño cycles—a climatic oscillation that today delivers heavy rainfall to the western U.S. causing both intense flooding but also increasing the river flows needed to sustain salmon runs. The absence of significant ocean upwelling in the warmest part of the Pliocene would have suppressed fisheries along the west coasts of the Americas, and deprived seabirds and marine mammals of food supplies.  Reef corals suffered a major extinction during the peak of Pliocene warmth but reefs themselves did not disappear.
Richard Norris, a geologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego, said the concentration of CO2 is one means of comparison, but what is not comparable, and more significant, is the speed at which 400 ppm is being surpassed today.
“I think it is likely that all these ecosystem changes could recur, even though the time scales for the Pliocene warmth are different than the present,” Norris said.  “The main lagging indicator is likely to be sea level just because it takes a long time to heat the ocean and a long time to melt ice. But our dumping of heat and CO2 into the ocean is like making investments in a pollution ‘bank,’ since we can put heat and CO2 in the ocean, but we will only extract the results (more sea-level rise from thermal expansion and more acidification) over the next several thousand years.  And we cannot easily withdraw either the heat or the CO2 from the ocean if we actually get our act together and try to limit our industrial pollution–the ocean keeps what we put in it.”
Scientists can analyze the gases trapped in ice to reconstruct with high accuracy what climate was like in prehistory, but that record only goes back 800,000 years. It is trickier to estimate carbon dioxide levels before then, but in 2009, one research team reported finding evidence of carbon dioxide levels ranging between 365 and 415 ppm roughly 4.5 million years ago. They based their finding on the analysis of carbon isotopes present in compounds made by tiny marine phytoplankton preserved in ancient ocean sediments.
That estimate made Earth’s last experience of 400 ppm a much more recent event than scientists have commonly thought. There has been broader consensus that carbon dioxide concentrations have been much higher than today’s but not for tens of millions of years. The assertion that Earth passed the 400 ppm mark a mere 4.5 million years ago has been supported by other analyses, many of which also concluded that the temperatures at that time were higher than previously estimated.  These studies suggest that the traditional way scientists currently rate Earth’s long-term sensitivity to extra doses of CO2 might not sufficiently take into account the slower effects of climate change on the sunlight-absorbing properties of the planet, such as ice sheet melt and changes in plant cover on land.
What that means is that Earth might react even more strongly to the increases in CO2 measured by the Keeling Curve. Several prominent questions remain to be answered, though, before accurate scenarios can be created. The extreme speed at which carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing is unprecedented. An increase of 10 parts per million might have needed 1,000 years or more to come to pass during ancient climate change events. Now the planet is poised to reach the 1,000 ppm level in only 100 years if emissions trajectories remain at their present level.
“Our grandchildren will inhabit a radically altered planet, as the ocean gradually warms up in response to the buildup of heat-trapping gases,” said Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego geoscientist Jeff Severinghaus.

"Scientists at the University of East Anglia have discovered new man-made gases that are contributing to the depletion of the Earth’s ozone layer. Three new Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which act to destroy ozone, have been identified. This may be bad news for ozone, and potentially also for environmental legislation. Ozone in the earth’s atmosphere plays many critical roles. At ground level, it is an air pollutant, harmful to human and environmental health, and reducing crop yields. But in the upper atmosphere, at altitudes of between 20 and 50km above the earth, the stratospheric ozone layer blocks out harmful solar UV radiation, preventing damage to the earth’s ecosystems and providing protection against skin cancer. CFCs are man-made gases that were first developed in the 1930s for use in refrigeration systems. Subsequently they were employed in a wide range of industrial processes and consumer products (notably, as propellants in aerosol spray cans). The very properties that made CFCs so useful industrially – their high chemical stability – also contributed to their impact on the atmosphere.  When the hole in the stratospheric ozone layer over Antarctica was discovered in 1985, the evidence quickly identified CFC gases as the culprit. Unreactive in the lower atmosphere and with lifetimes of 50 to 100 years, they have plenty of time to travel from the earth’s surface into the stratosphere. At precisely the altitude where stratospheric ozone is found, they are broken down by high-energy UV radiation. A cycle of chemical reactions then follows, which eventually destroys ozone, creating holes over the earth’s polar regions. The discovery of the Antarctic hole led to the Montreal Protocol and subsequent treaties to restrict CFC manufacture and use. If compliance with the protocol is complete, we might expect to look back and see growth in atmospheric CFC levels through the 20th century, peaking shortly after 1989 when the Montreal Protocol came into force, and falling slowly thereafter. This new study, published in Nature Geoscience, undertook painstaking long-term measurements of CFC and HCFC levels. Air samples were collected in the unpolluted environment of Tasmania, dating back to 1978, and in air extracted from firn (compressed snow) cores from Greenland. Firn air effectively traps air bubbles for decades, allowing modern analysis methods to “look back in time” to sample compounds which were previously not measurable and so reconstruct historical atmospheric composition. The UEA team report measurements of three new CFCs – that is, man-made gases previously unidentified in the atmosphere. For two of these, CFC-112 and CFC112a, the trends observed broadly reflect those anticipated: there is no detectable level present in air before the 1960s, followed by growing abundance until the mid-1990s. This is not undue cause for alarm, as their levels then declined as we might expect from the Montreal Protocol restrictions. However, the other chlorofluorocarbon, CFC-113a, is still accumulating, with atmospheric levels increasing steadily right up to the most recent measurements in 2012. This implies that it is currently being produced through some kind of industrial activity, unimpeded by the protocol restrictions. At first sight, the existence of these gases suggests a failure to comply with the Montreal Protocol. One plausible explanation is that the measurements reflect a number of loopholes within the protocol. For example, some manufacture of CFCs is allowed for use as intermediates in the production of other chemicals. The information disclosed to the public on this is however limited. Alternatively, production may be occurring in the (minority of) nations who are not signatories to the protocol. The levels of the new gases identified are small compared with the better known CFCs responsible for the bulk of ozone depletion over the past 50 years, so their direct impact is relatively modest. Perhaps more significant is the implication of these observations for environmental legislation – are we witnessing evidence for non-compliance with the spirit, if not the letter, of the Montreal Protocol?  The Montreal Protocol is the most successful example of global environmental pollution legislation we have. Indeed, it is often held up as the poster child for the rather more vexing negotiations over international greenhouse gas emission limits. The study’s authors are correctly cautious in identifying their observations as evidence for illegal CFC production. There are several explanations for their data, which are consistent with the technical restrictions of the Montreal Protocol. But these results at the least suggest that further monitoring be performed and also that the restrictions on the protocol’s public reporting might be amended to help clarify the matter.   Whichever explanation is found to prevail, the work is an example of the reality of the science – in this case measured atmospheric composition – pointing to problems with either the treaty reporting regime or lack of compliance with the treaty overall. These are two inconvenient truths which should be addressed. Future atmospheric measurements should identify the source of the new CFC emissions, providing more definitive insight into the matter."
"**There have been more than 1.6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and about 60,000 people have died, government figures show.**
However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher.
**Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:**
If you can't see the look-up click here.
After the first peak in April, cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October, before falling again in the past two weeks.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 16,170 confirmed cases.
It is thought the infection rate was much higher during the first peak in spring, but testing capacity at the time was too limited to detect the true number of daily cases.
The data for cases can also be broken down by region and comparing the change in those figures by week gives a sense of where there has been a recent increase in newly-reported infections.
Coronavirus infections in England have fallen by about a third during lockdown, according to a major study carried out by Imperial College London.
While some of the worst-hit areas saw the biggest improvements, cases have remained relatively high across England, according to the React-1 study, which is based on tests of more than 100,000 people between 13-24 November.
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggest about one in 185 (16,400 people) in Wales had the virus in the week ending 21 November.
In Northern Ireland rates are thought to be decreasing at around one in 145 people (about 12,700 people), while in Scotland, the figure was one in 115 (about 45,700 people).
The average number of daily deaths began to rise again in September, following the first peak in April.
On Wednesday, the government announced a further 648 deaths.
Of these, 555 deaths were in England, 51 in Wales, 38 in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland.
Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included.
England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 52,000.
Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.
The North West, North East and Yorkshire, and Midlands have seen the highest number of admissions but the situation in all three now appears to be improving.
Cases have risen across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The red areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people.
Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in an effort to tackle the number of rising cases.
In England, each local authority has been placed in one of the new three tiers following the end of the recent national lockdown.
Wales has announced a range of further measures, including a ban on pubs, restaurants and cafes serving alcohol, from Friday 4 December.
In Northern Ireland, a further two-week ""circuit-break"" lockdown began on 27 November.
Scotland has a five-tier system of alert levels with different measures in place in different parts of the country.
UK leaders have agreed to allow up to three households to meet indoors during a five-day Christmas period of 23-27 December.
When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways.
Government figures count people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.
But there are two other measures.
The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 70,000 deaths by 20 November.
The second measure counts all deaths over and above the usual number at the time of year - that figure was more than 75,000 by 20 November.
The most recent figures available from the ONS are for the third week of November, which show there were 14,276 deaths registered in the UK.
Some 3,038 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - 199 more than the week before.
Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the data from the ONS and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years by about 21%.
Overall, the figures are still well below the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.
The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.
If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.
The government's current estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK is 0.9 to 1.
The estimate for England is 0.9 to 1, while for Scotland it is 0.8 to 1. The estimate for Wales is 0.8 to 1 and in Northern Ireland it is 0.9 to 1.1.
The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions."

_Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
__—__   
  
Just five weeks after _Science_ magazine prominently featured a paper proclaiming that the multidecadal slowdown in the rate of the earth’s average temperature rise—aka, the “pause” or “hiatus”—was but a figment of bad data, comes a new paper in _Science_ magazine explaining the physical mechanisms that have led to the slowdown.   
  
Wait, what?   
  
You read it right. What _Science_ laid to rest but a month ago, _Science_ has now resurrected. Science (with a capital “S”), and those dedicated to it, should not be amused.   
  
But such is the nature of the game. _Science_ the magazine is more interested in generating publicity for itself than in best serving Science the field—a point being increasingly raised by prominent scientific figures.   
  
The new paper, whose title even contains the dreaded H-word (“Recent hiatus caused by decadal shift in Indo-Pacific heating”), is authored by Veronica Nieves and colleagues from the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). The paper itself is rather technical look at how the hiatus has manifested itself in various compilations of measurements (and models) of the ocean’s temperatures at depth.   




Never once do the authors act as if the hiatus didn’t exist, but rather present data showing how the pause in the rise of the oceans near-surface temperatures came to be. Basically, they identify a broad and shallow patch of the Pacific Ocean as being primarily responsible for slowing the rise in global near-surface temperature, but find that the cooling of that patch during the past decade has been offset by a warming in an adjacent and deeper patch of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. They write:   




[T]he decade long hiatus that began in 2003 is the result of a redistribution of heat within the ocean, rather than a change in the net warming rate.”



The authors do not describe how this behavior, either spatially, temporally, or in magnitude, compares with climate model expectations of the behavior, although they do reject a recent prominent finding that claimed there was not a “systematic overestimation of the temperature response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the [climate model] ensemble” after correcting for the recent downturn in solar activity coupled with uptick in low-scale volcanic activity (Huber and Knutti, 2014).   
  
But, the main story here is not the new findings (which will require further analysis to unpack their significance), but that _Science_ magazine is publishing a paper describing physical mechanisms behind the hiatus that was accepted in its final form on June 24th, three weeks after _Science_ ’s paper announcing the hiatus to be a non-event.   
  
The new paper contains a lot of science while the earlier paper rehashed some old findings (published elsewhere) and then spun them to make it seem as if the hiatus didn’t exist.   
  
Which one do you think was published to grab headlines and generate attention?   
  
But, really, what should you expect from a journal whose editor-in-chief, Marcia McNutt, last week wrote in an editorial about climate change titled “The two-degree inferno,” things like “time for debate has ended,” that “action is urgently needed” and this gem directly aimed at those who stand in the way (like trying to publish research findings to the contrary?):   




In Dante's Inferno, he describes the nine circles of Hell, each dedicated to different sorts of sinners, with the outermost being occupied by those who didn't know any better, and the innermost reserved for the most treacherous offenders. I wonder where in the nine circles Dante would place all of us who are borrowing against this Earth in the name of economic growth, accumulating an environmental debt by burning fossil fuels, the consequences of which will be left for our children and grandchildren to bear? Let's act now, to save the next generations from the consequences of the beyond-two-degree inferno.



It is high time for everyone to realize that _Science_ magazine can no longer be considered a science journal, but instead has joined the ranks of advocacy publications, for better or for worse.

Quote of the Week: The first principle is that you must not fool yourself–and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that. Richard Feynman, Cargo Cult Science, 1974 [H/t Donna Laframboise]

THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Greenhouse Re-Visited: Vincent Gray, a five time expert reviewer of the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), has reassessed his earlier review of the origins “greenhouse effect.” Also, he addresses many errors that arise in the models. They are too highly simplified versions of the climate system and fail to incorporate important components of the earth’s heat transfer system.
The paper (22 pages including references) may become controversial, as it should be. If Gray is correct, then the entire IPCC program, and the ones that parrot it, such as the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the EPA’s endangerment finding, are built on false assumptions that must be revised.
According to reports from the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service, from 1993 to 2012 the US Government has spent about $140 to 150 Billion on global warming / climate change – creating the Climate Establishment. Based on continuing resolutions, current spending is about $20 Billion per year. This figure does not include subsidies for unreliable wind and solar, or Biofuels.
No doubt, the Climate Establishment will bitterly contest any major revision of their ideas and models, in which they have expressed great, if scientifically unfounded, certainty. The following is not intended to be a summary of Gray’s assessment, but just a brief list of some of the highlights.
· In postulating that carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas, Svante August Arrhenius used the wrong measurements – ones of water vapor, not carbon dioxide. He did not make the measurements, but used those by Langley.
· Arrhenius greatly over estimated the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere as compared with water vapor, by an average of 50 to 1.
· Guy Callendar, who continued the emphasis on carbon dioxide, ignored water vapor and believed that radiation was the only form of energy transfer in the climate system. He ignored the existence of conduction, convection, evaporation, and condensation as mechanisms of heat transfer.
· The IPCC has continued to emphasize radiation, ignoring the other mechanisms of heat transfer.
· The simplified model of the IPCC by Kiehl and Trenberth ignores the fact that the sun does not shine on the same place 24 hours a day. Measures of the average radiation from the earth are not suitable and measurements should include the difference between day and night.
· There are no estimates of the accuracy of the values of solar heating over oceans and land.
· The range in estimated values solar heating effects of oceans and land is significantly greater than the calculated values of warming effects from increasing carbon dioxide.
· Thus, the value of warming effects from increasing carbon dioxide cannot be calculated with scientific precision.
Gray differentiates between an actual greenhouse and the earth’s climate. For the earth, both ocean and atmospheric circulation are critical. The movements of fluids are chaotic, and have not been satisfactorily described by mathematics. He states that the IPCC falsely claims that the chaotic behavior is managed; pointing out that, based on their calculations, the energy subject to chaotic behavior is about 60 times greater than the estimate of the warming effect of increased carbon dioxide (97 v. 1.6 W/m squared).
Please see link under Challenging the Orthodoxy.
******************
Cold Kills: After five cold winters in a row, northern European newspapers are carrying articles that express anger at politicians who have instituted policies “to fight global warming,” which are increasing energy prices to consumers. Granted, the cold winters are weather events, but so were warm spells previously claimed to prove global warming caused by CO2. For example, in Britain the 2003 heat wave was blamed for 2,000 deaths. The current cold spell is being blamed for upwards to 30,000 deaths. These are real deaths, with certificates, cause, and name; not imaginary deaths from questionable computer models, such as those used by the EPA. Green politicians and bureaucrats have lost touch with the public. Subsidies to consumers are not the same as affordable energy. Even the once-alarmist Economist is beginning the grasp the scope of the man-made problem. Please see links under Questioning the Orthodoxy, Questioning European Green, Changing Weather, and Health, Energy, and Climate
******************
Spend More, Save More: As with the US, the British government has adapted the marketing concept that the more you spend, the more you save. The bureaucrats admit that their policies are increasing energy costs, particularly electricity, but claim if consumers buy more energy efficient appliances that have been mandate, the consumers will save in energy costs. What the bureaucrats do not consider is labor costs. For example under the standard cycle, some modern dishwashers in the US take about two to three times as long as older ones, for a slight savings in electricity. The consumer may consider the time lost is far more than the savings mandated by the bureaucrats.
******************
Labeling: Proper labeling is important in marketing (propaganda). Many skeptics have studied the history of climate change and concluded that it is real, ongoing, significant, and natural; but, the human influence is minor. Many climate alarmists label these skeptics as climate change deniers, or science deniers. Similarly, it has become fashionable for some in the Climate Establishment to label the current era (say the past 250 years) as the Anthropocene, a geological epoch dominated by human activity.
With a touch of humor in a comment on Britain’s Climate Change Commission posted on Bishop Hill, James Evans suggests a label for latest period, (say last 50 years) – The Hubrisocene – an epoch dominated by ego that humans can control climate. Please see link under Challenging the Orthodoxy.
******************
Character: Senator Inhofe stated he was proud to be one of those singled out in the film “Dirty Lying Bastards.” This attitude is contrasted by that of “I am a victim” Michael Mann, who claims that he was made a public figure by “science deniers” who severely criticized him. It is Mr. Mann’s hockey-stick that is the subject of intense criticism, because Mr. Mann’s study ignores significant prior studies with large amount of data that contradict the hockey-stick. Please see links under Communicating Better to the Public – Make things up and Oh’ Mann.
******************
Renewable Mandates: In the US, the battle over renewable energy mandates is moving to the several states (Renewable Energy Standards or Portofolio). Some politicians are becoming aware that many citizens do not wish to pay for unreliable, expensive wind power. One hot-bed is the state legislature of North Carolina, which is taking up the issue this week. Please see link under Subsidies and Mandates Forever.
******************
Save Energy, Move South? A new study estimates that the total energy use for indoor climate control is about 3.5 times more in the cold climate of Minneapolis, Minnesota, than in the warm climate of Miami, Florida. The study is quite interesting, but not exactly a fair comparison. Minneapolis is far inland and subject to intense heat and cold. Miami is on the east coast, and extremes in temperature are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean. A more valid study would compare cities distant from oceans, with approximately the same humidity, Minneapolis and Memphis, Tennessee may be appropriate. Please see link under Energy Issues – US.
******************
Keystone XL: The fate of Keystone XL pipeline remains in the hands of the Administration in Washington. Obviously, Canadians with an interest in oil sands are disturbed by the delay. These interests include the government of Alberta, which will receive increased royalties with increased development. Pipelines are the safest way to move oil and gas. Without the pipeline, the oil is moving by rail, and one accident occurred this week.
An interesting proposal is to convert one of the pipelines in Canada’s Mainline from natural gas to oil. The Mainline carries natural gas east from Alberta, over the Canadian Shield, to the eastern cities of Canada. The Canadian Shield is a formidable barrier with extensive exposed bedrock, some of the oldest in the world. As discussed by Robert Bradley, in From Edison to Enron, building the Mainline east was expensive, both financially and politically, rather than building it south into the US around the Great Lakes then back north again,. If the gas pipeline can be physically converted, or if an oil pipeline can be built adjacent to it, then that may be a more practical venture than dealing with Washington. Please see Article # 2 and links under Energy Issues – Non-US.
*****************
Number of the Week: 1200 million metric tonnes! (1323 million short tons) Petroleum engineer, and world class track cyclist and coach, Norm Kalmanovitch calculates humans exhale approximately 1200 million metric tonnes of CO2 every year. “I based the number on an average calorie intake of 1200 calories which gives about 180 kg/person of CO2 per year. Seven billion people times 180 kg/person comes to 1260 million tonnes which I rounded off to 1200 million metric tonnes!” Of course this is approximate, but it gives some sense of proportion compared to claimed CO2 savings by certain policy measures.
For example, according to an article by John Dawson, the carbon tax scheme of Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard boasts that by 2020 it would cut CO2 emissions by 160 million tonnes – about thirteen percent (13%) of human emissions from breathing. Perhaps Australians should ask Ms. Gillard: Is breathing polluting?

UPDATE: I have a “before” picture of the vehicle now, posted below.
UPDATE2: Perhaps storm chasing has reached a tipping point.
Respected Tornado Reseacher And Storm Chaser Among Dead In Oklahoma | FOX17online.com
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. — Family members and members of the storm chasing community are confirming that well-respected tornado researcher and storm chaser Tim Samaras is among the eleven confirmed victims of Friday’s tornado that ripped through El Reno, Oklahoma. Samaras was one of the most well-known and respected tornado researchers in the world and had made many appearances on television shows like the Discovery Channel series Storm Chasers and was a regular contributor to shows on National Geographic.
The day that should change tornado actions and storm chasing forever
Update 9:30 a.m., June 2: We now hear that “veteran storm chaser Tim Samaras; his son, Paul Samaras; and chase partner Carl Young, are among those killed by Friday’s EF-3 tornado in El Reno, OK.”
===============================================================
In the midst of all the tragedy unfolding in Oklahoma, media and storm chasers have been swarming all over the tornado outbreak. I’ve seen this many times in my years in television news: when you are tasked with going live, sometimes common sense gets literally thrown to the wind.
The photo shows the SUV Mike Bettes and a few of his crew member were travelling in when it was thrown by the tornado. Photo by SeanSchoferTVN/Twitter
The Weather Channel lost sight of reality today, trying to get close to get the best footage for live coverage, and paid the price. Fortunately, they weren’t killed.  Just last year, the TWC ran this segment by TWC meteorologist Mike Bettes, where he asked:

Mike Bettes’s Open Mike Discussion “Storm Chasers, Have They Gone Too Far?”

And it seems, Mike Bettes doesn’t listen to his own advice. Watch:


From TWC’s report on the incident:
Meteorologist Mike Bettes was chasing the monster rain-wrapped tornado near El Reno, Okla. when he says the storm picked up the heavy chase SUV and threw it an estimated 200 yards.
“We were ahead of the storm. We stopped to broadcast and I saw a large violent wedge tornado,” Bettes said in a live phone interview after he established phone connection after the incident.
“What we were trying to do was just get away from it and get to the south side of it,” Bettes said. “But what ended up happening was all three of our vehicles that we chase with were all hit by it.”
Basically, he put his team so close, he couldn’t get away from it.
And, he should know better. From the videos I’ve seen, this appeared to be a multiple vortice tornado, with a central core surrounded by other vortices (typically 3 or 4). Sometimes these outer vortices are intermittent and invisible.

Trying to dodge multiple vortices in the middle of live TV is of course a recipe for disaster.
h/t to Firsthand Weather
UPDATE: Before the tornado caught it, all blinged out:

At the launch of of the research vessel ~~Boaty McBoatface~~ _Sir David Attenborough_ , the man himself said:



We are only going to deal with it [climate change] if we know what the facts are.



The oracle himself, Sir David, says we don’t yet know the facts. Is it not a little strange that they are spending all that money on a research vessel to find out what the facts are when we all know that the ‘science is settled’?



One million steel parts. How were the steel parts made? Equal parts fairy dust, unicorn urine and dodo feathers? Probably not. Lots of heat from ‘fossil’ fuels and good quality coal. 



Naturally, the 60,000 litres of paint would all be organic, waterbased and eco-friendly. The pigments would have been hand-ground by the native women of Myanzibar from the bark of the eco-sourced sustainably grown muszbat tree. Or did they simply use the nice convenient petroleum based paints from the local marine supplier? 



Clearly they could not allow the wiring to short out so each of the 450,000 m were shielded in hand spun and manually woven fabric sheathing, an ancient traditional method used by the herdsmen of the Botsgrandy Plains. Or maybe they found that using cables with petroleum-based plastic insulation was just a tad more convenient?



Go and do Arctic and Antarctic research by all means – you may learn the truth that the world is not melting. But don’t use all the advantages of our modern, advanced, petroleum-based lifestyle whilst railing against it. Hypocrites.

So the spoiled brat is scolding us again. 



Greta Thunberg [joined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQLzaHr_LkM) a large crowd of young people skipping school in Iowa City, Iowa for a climate change protest on Friday, where she declared the recent United Nation’s action summit on climate change a flop.



The summit, which ran in conjunction with the U.N.’s annual General Assembly meeting, featured Thunberg and other youth speakers.



“We told world leaders to act on the science,” Thunberg, 16, said at the protest inspired by the Fridays for Future school walkout she started a little over a year ago in her homeland Sweden. “And we demanded a safe future for us and for everyone.”



brat, Greta Thunberg, who just two weeks ago was being lauded literally as the new messiah has now declared that the summit where she was beatified was a ‘failure’.



“But they didn’t listen,” Thunberg said. “As we all know, **the U.N. climate action summit was a failure.”**



 **“That was, unfortunately, what we had expected,”** Thunberg said.



Thunberg said world leaders are “uncomfortable” standing behind the “science.”



  
A failure, huh? A failure moreover that she “expected”. If she expected to fail then why bother? If her childhood hopes and dreams are going to remain stolen then “brat” Greta shouldn’t have been in New York scolding us in the first place. If it was a failure as “expected” then why is she still out of school continuing to scold us all? What is the point? It is about time that she realised that the real culprits in the high crime of stealing her dreams and childhood are her paymasters, like George Soros and her parents, who painted for her a doomsday picture of the future and who have heartlessly used her to further their political agenda.



If I were a rude person I would riff off of [last night’s Jeremy Clarkson video,](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/clarkson-explains-why-cycling-is-actually-bad-for-the-environment/) and say that Greta Thunberg should just eff off. I am not that rude, however, so I will simply predict her gradual decline into obscurity.



She will now be ignored because the very summit that was used to beatify her has now been declared a failure; **ergo she is a failure.** She isn’t so saintly anymore and the silence from the media about her latest huffy outburst is telling.



I think I can safely predict that, like the so-called Occupy movement, these climate whingers will be ignored, then forgotten. Does anyone remember the rowdies occupying everywhere saying that they would stay until they got what they wanted? Well, where are they now? That’s right, nowhere. We all got bored with their scolding and rubbish, their unkempt appearance and their violence and simply ignored them. Then winter came and went and took the losers with them.



Governments will fail to declare climate emergencies, and they won’t make such declarations, because to do so will open them right up to lawsuits over the tide coming in and a few extra puddles forming after a thunderstorm. Then people will start to realise that there actually isn’t an emergency and the world isn’t ending and we will just carry on.



Bloviating politicians like Jacinda Ardern will cuddle their tarnished Nobel Peace Prize and mutter to themselves that no one listened, as they continue to enjoy their winter holidays beside the beach in some tropical paradise that is still there and hasn’t been washed away. Not for them to spend time in a barren winter wasteland when there are warmer climes to enjoy.



Have you ever wondered why these climate conferences always seem to occur in high summer? Never do they have one in the depths of winter in Siberia or Alaska where their rhetoric would be swallowed up and muffled by mountains of inconvenient snow.



As Clarkson said, they, Greta, Jacinda, all of them “can just eff off.”

"The National Trust is urging people not to take a barbecue or light a campfire when they visit the coast and countryside following a spate of wildfires that have damaged flora and fauna. Despite recent rainfall, a record-breaking spring of sunshine has left many landscapes dry and created the perfect conditions for fires to ignite and quickly spread.  Since the start of April, several large blazes have broken out on the trust’s land, including one at Froward Point on the Devon coast that was started by a barbecue and required six fire engines and a police helicopter to extinguish. Woodland and heathland were damaged. Around 2 sq km of land was damaged at Marsden Moor in West Yorkshire, an important site for ground-nesting birds such as the curlew, short-eared owl and merlin. In May, a heathland fire damaged Thurstaston Common on the Wirral peninsula, in north-west England, which is home to lizards, tiger beetles and migrant birds. Prime heathland habitat was lost. Station Manager Lauren Woodward gives a tour of the devastation at Thurstaston Common where she is Incident Commander today. Please listen to the messages from firefighters at the scene or we will have no beauty spots left to visit. @WirralCouncil @NaturalEngland pic.twitter.com/l3ssIdp30g At Studland Beach in Dorset, fire crews extinguished 30 unattended barbecues in a single night. There has also been an increase in litter at many sites, which the trust says not only blights the landscape but poses a threat to wildlife and can fuel wildfires. At Dovedale, in the Peak District, volunteers filled 100 bin bags in one weekend. Ben McCarthy, the head of nature conservation at the National Trust, said: “We know that people have missed the outdoors and open spaces these past few months – and we’re really pleased to be welcoming them back. “But we’re urging people not to bring barbecues to the countryside or the coast. They can lead to real problems, particularly after such little rain in April and May. “Many areas of land are still very dry and all it takes is a single spark from a barbecue or a dropped cigarette to cause a serious fire. “Fires like these undermine our work to care for nature and respond to the climate emergency, which are priorities for the National Trust.” Incidences of UK wildfires are increasing in number and severity, in part due to changing weather patterns. Last year was particularly worrying for fire services and conservation charities with the unseasonably warm February and Easter contributing to blazes across the country. Among these was a devastating fire on Marsden Moor in April 2019 that destroyed 700 hectares (1,730 acres) of wildlife habitat, including that of the mountain hare, and burned for four days."

South Korean President Park Geun‐​hye delayed her trip to the U.S. because of a public health emergency at home. That led to much chatter over whether the postponement was necessary and would harm the bilateral relationship.



Woo Jung‐​Yeop of the Asan Institute argued that “the focus of Park’s U.S. visit should be on what to discuss, not on when to reschedule.” After all, there was no obvious purpose in the trip: North Korea is a chronic problem but hasn’t done anything particularly provocative recently. The low‐​key summit plans, coming so soon after the high‐​profile visit by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, left many South Koreans suffering from an inferiority complex.



However, the delay won’t make a future Park trip any more useful. There is much on which the two nations should cooperate, since the Republic of Korea has graduated from Third to First World status and sports one of the world’s largest and most advanced economies. But the military alliance is outdated. Despite having surged past the North, enjoying a 40‐​to‐​1 economic advantage and 2‐​to‐​1 population edge, Seoul continues to play the helpless dependent, unable even to command its own forces in a war.



The military relationship was forged in a different time. The U.S. and Soviet Union divided the Korean Peninsula after Japan’s surrender in 1945. There weren’t many alternatives. Continued Japanese rule would have enraged all Koreans and united Soviet rule would have enslaved all Koreans.



But the division resulted in two hostile Korean states. A three‐​year quasi‐​civil war erupted 65 years ago, in which the U.S. and West fought against China and the Soviet Union through their respective Koreas. After mass destruction, highlighted by millions of casualties and refugees, the conflict ended roughly where it started. With the ROK a wreck and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea backed by neighboring China and Soviet Union, only Washington’s security guarantee kept the South independent, if not exactly free.





What other nation with serious international ambitions subcontracts not only its defense, but control of its own forces, to another government?



That eventually changed. In the 1960s President Park Chung‐​hee, the present president’s father, suppressed all political opposition but reformed the economy, leading to the ROK’s dramatic growth. Democracy waited another quarter century, until the growing middle class tired of military rule.



Yet through it all South Korea’s defense dependency on America persisted. Seoul surpassed the DPRK in economic strength and achieved political stability. The Soviet Union disappeared and China joined the international community, with both Beijing and Moscow recognizing the South. South Korean businesses spanned the globe and Seoul began having military ambitions beyond the peninsula. No matter. The ROK insisted that abundant American forces must remain, backed by additional units aground in Okinawa and afloat and aflight in the Pacific.



The South Korean government hasn’t even been willing to take over operational control, or OPCON, of its own forces in wartime. It isn’t ready, it insists. Why not, one wonders? _North Korea_ commands its forces. One can’t imagine Kim Il‐​sung leaving the keys to his tanks with Joseph Stalin or Mao Zedong after the Korean War concluded. What other nation with serious international ambitions subcontracts not only its defense, but control of its own forces, to another government? _For decades_.



Of course, some South Koreans admit that they most fear shifting command would encourage Washington to withdraw its troops. Thus, their objective is to appear as helpless as possible as long as possible to retain the U.S. troop tripwire. “Please, we just can’t do it without you,” Seoul tells Washington. It’s an embarrassing ploy by a country whose people want to be taken seriously abroad.



The present arrangement obviously is bad for America, other than for U.S. officials who enjoy running the world, or at least who think that they run it. The “mutual defense treaty” requires Americans to defend the ROK. In return, the South agrees to be defended. That’s the way it always has been, and nothing much has changed recently despite all of the talk of refashioning the alliance.



Protecting South Korea isn’t cheap. Promising to go to war means America might have to go to war. That’s a risk which should not be taken lightly. Being ready to go to war requires force structure. The more potential wars, the bigger the military needed. That the ROK helps pay for occupation costs ignores the more basic expense, the cost of raising, equipping, and maintaining the units themselves.



Nevertheless, Washington considered the ROK’s survival as compensation enough, at least in the early years, when the U.S. was prepared to defend South Korea as part of the larger Cold War struggle. But today the peninsula is militarily inconsequential. A North Korean victory would be just that, a North Korean victory, not the first leg of an exorable march toward global Communist domination. There would be no threat to America.



No question, of course, it would be an awful outcome. But that doesn’t mean it warrants a permanent “alliance” entangling the U.S. in one of the most heavily militarized and unstable regions on earth. Anyway, the North would win a conventional contest only if Seoul allowed the former to do so, by failing to build the defense which it is well‐​capable of deploying. The South is only _acting_ helpless.



Leon Whyte of the _Fletcher Security Review_ calls for expanding the alliance “beyond old parameters,” but there are no alternative purposes for the military alliance (in contrast to reasons for friends to cooperate). Some American policymakers imagine the ROK as part of an iron ring containing the People’s Republic of China, but few South Koreans want to make a permanent enemy of their big neighbor with a very long memory. It’s one thing to be defended by America in the extremely unlikely event that the PRC attacked the South. But to join the U.S. in a war against China over, say, Taiwan’s quest for independence or Tokyo’s control of the Senkaku Islands? Washington can dream on. The South Koreans ain’t that crazy!



The Pentagon imagines other military scenarios in East Asia—say a squabble in Southeast Asia—but they almost certainly wouldn’t justify American intervention. And even if they did, Seoul wouldn’t likely join in unless it was in the ROK’s interest to do so, in which case a formal treaty would be unnecessary. (The first President Park sent soldiers to Vietnam in order to convince Washington to keep U.S. personnel in the South.) A temporary coalition of the willing makes more sense than permanently defending another country in the hope that it might help out somewhere sometime. Seoul did kick in some support for America’s misadventures in Afghanistan and Iraq, but again, if the price was a permanent garrison on the peninsula, the cost was far too high.



Nor does Washington get much else out of the relationship. South Koreans have never purchased U.S. products as a reward for America’s defense guarantee. Nor has the Blue House ever pliantly taken orders from Washington. Seoul rolls out the red carpet when an American president visits, but acts in its own interest nonetheless. Army Lt. Col. James Minnich proposed that a “comprehensive, strategic alliance” cover climate change, human trafficking, and peacekeeping, but none of these have anything to do with a bilateral military pact.



Doug Bandow‐​John Bolton debate on Fox



The most important downside for the U.S. today is that defending the South puts America in the middle of a contest between North and South Koreas, Japan, China, and Russia. All have more at stake than the U.S. Washington is constantly badgering the PRC to do America’s bidding against Pyongyang. And North Korea is constantly threatening the U.S. only because the latter’s forces “are there,” in the South, threatening the DPRK. Pyongyang might not like Washington, but it wouldn’t care about America if U.S. troops weren’t on its border. The North likely would spend its time issuing threats against its neighbors instead. As it is, the Korean peninsula is one of the most important flashpoints which could drag America into a real war with potentially horrific casualties, even if the outcome was certain “victory.”



While it might have been inevitable that North Korea would have sought nuclear weapons, America’s involvement likely made it inevitable. As Henry Kissinger once said, even paranoids have enemies, and only nukes offer a certain deterrent to the North, which today would fight alone against the U.S. in a region filled with U.S. allies. Worse, Washington has proved its willingness to dismember (Serbia), undermine (Syria), and impose regime change (Afghanistan, Grenada, Haiti, Iraq, Panama), even after making a deal with a government (Libya). The fact that the Kim dynasty is evil does not mean that it has no legitimate security fears which might be assuaged by possession of a nuclear arsenal. Only by markedly reducing the threat perceived by the DPRK is Washington likely to have meaningful negotiations over nuclear weapons, like those going on with Iran, once viewed as a fellow pariah state.



Although the benefits of being defended are obvious, the ROK loses in several ways. The first is diminished self‐​respect. Real countries should defend themselves, not be dependent on other states. Persistent squabbles over the status of forces agreement highlight the tension of being a sovereign state and hosting foreign troops. South Koreans rankle over showing American personnel special consideration, but the U.S. can’t station forces in another nation without ensuring minimal legal protections.



Second, the South’s defense is in part out of its own hands. After the sinking of the Cheonan and shelling of Yeonpyeong Island, the U.S. urged restraint at almost any price. As Washington had the right to do, since it could be drawn into a war if Seoul retaliated and conflict erupted. Contracting out one’s defense to others necessarily yields control over major defense decisions.



Third, the ROK’s diplomatic strategy toward the North suffers. If Washington chooses the opposite approach, the result will be conflict and confusion. Moreover, the U.S. can use its dominant position to pressure South Korea to adopt America’s stance. Differences between George W. Bush and Kim Dae‐​jung were sharp, for instance. To the extent that Pyongyang views the South as merely a puppet regime the former will pay more attention to America’s tactics.



Fourth, secure in the U.S. defense guarantee Seoul has felt little pressure to seek a modus vivendi with Japan. The two prosperous democratic states should cooperate in defending themselves and promoting regional security, but have refused to leave history behind them. Both nations’ leaders made conciliatory remarks last Monday on the 50th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations, but nothing substantive has changed. Both share the blame but face the same perverse incentives.



Fifth, relying on the U.S. encourages South Korea to accept permanent dependency. No special geographical feature of the peninsula keeps the country to the south militarily inferior. But Seoul has less incentive to invest in the military. If the South won’t defend against the North, which really does pose a threat, Washington can’t seriously expect the ROK to join America in containing China.



Doug Bandow‐​Michael Malice Forum



Finally, Seoul cannot consider building a countervailing nuclear weapon if necessary. Nonproliferation in Northeast Asia is a bit like gun control: only the potentially hostile powers, in this case China, North Korea, and Russia, have nukes. There’s no good reason for the U.S. to risk its security by putting the American homeland at potential risk to guarantee South Korea’s security against a nuclear‐​armed North. Perhaps the ROK should do the job itself. Especially since a realistic Seoul recognizes that the U.S. might not follow through on its promises if the North is able to retaliate against America.



Moreover, the mere possibility of the South going nuclear, likely followed by Japan, would encourage Beijing to redouble its efforts to achieve a nuclear free peninsula. This threat likely would be far more effective than the allies’ oft‐​repeated determination to apply more pressure on Pyongyang to return to the Six Party Talks, which the North abandoned more than six years ago.



South Koreans pay a high price for the convenience of an American security guarantee. While they have achieved much, they are stuck on the U.S. defense dole, as dependent as any domestic welfare recipient. When the two presidents next meet, they should discuss how to transform the U.S.-South Korea relationship into one of equals, in which the ROK gives as much as it gets.



With Seoul locked into its role as military dependent, America should stop playing the indulgent parent and push the adult child out into the real world. Better, Seoul should take the initiative and end its unnatural reliance on the U.S. Nearly seventy years of defense welfare is enough. It’s time for the ROK to grow up and take its place on the world stage.

Cato's Annual Monetary Conference last November hosted a ""shadow review"" of the Federal Reserve's own self-review, dedicated to examining ""whether the U.S. monetary policy framework can be improved to meet future challenges."" The articles in the spring/summer 2020 issue of the _Cato Journal_ , drawn from that conference, are now available online.



With inflation then consistent with the Fed's 2 percent target and unemployment at remarkable lows, the Fed likely didn't expect that the ""future challenges"" it planned to address would come so soon, or be so extreme. Today, thanks to the federal response to the Covid-19 pandemic shuttering businesses across the country, the Fed has once again reduced its policy rate almost to zero, while renewing its large-scale asset purchases and undertaking an unprecedented program of emergency lending that has all but erased the conventional boundary line separating monetary from fiscal policy. These developments make a reexamination of the Fed's policy framework seem even more important than they were last fall.



In his Editor's Note, Cato Vice President for Monetary Studies James A. Dorn writes that today, ""central banks have… greater discretion and lending authority than ever before. Monetary policy has morphed into fiscal policy. The Fed is in uncharted waters and a review of policies aimed at the 2008 financial crisis is inadequate. A major assessment of central banking and alternative money regimes is overdue."" Several participants in last fall's event have updated their articles to reflect these developments.



In the spirit of fostering dialogue and debate about what we can learn from past policy errors and how to apply those lessons going forward, the _Cato Journal_ is proud to present the articles summarized below. (To access the full text of an article, click on its title.)



 **""The Federal Reserve's Review of Its Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices,"" **Richard H. Clarida, Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System



Since the 2008 crisis, the global economy has changed in two critical ways, Clarida says. First, the natural rate of interest has fallen, and remained, well below its precrisis baseline. That makes it harder for central bankers to conduct effective countercyclical policy (which often means lowering their policy interest rate) during economic recessions. With the Fed's primary policy strategy increasingly in doubt, the Board of Governors is considering new tools it can use at the zero lower bound.



Second, the short-run Phillips curve, measuring the relationship between inflation and unemployment, is flattening. In and of itself, that's not necessarily a bad thing—but it does mean that Fed policymakers should take exceptional care to keep inflation at their self-assigned, 2 percent target, which they work to maintain together with maximum employment.



Given these changes, Clarida outlines three questions that the Fed needs to address in its review. First, given its mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment, should the Fed reconsider its current practice of ""forgiving"" past inflation shortfalls or surpluses, without attempting to compensate for them? While it's possible for the Fed to adopt ""makeup"" strategies to correct for inflation inconsistencies, this can work only if the public trusts central bankers to stick to them, which may be asking a lot. Second, does the Fed need different tools to reliably fulfill its dual mandate? While Clarida does not say whether the Fed might retire any of its existing policy tools, he does say that Fed leaders are thinking about adding new ones. Finally, how can the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) improve the way it communicates with the public? While it does so more often, and in more ways, than it once did, Clarida suggests that there is still room for improvement.



 **""Independence and Accountability via Inflation Targeting,"" **Peter N. Ireland, Murray and Monti Professor of Economics at Boston College and Member of the Shadow Open Market Committee



Holding central bankers accountable for their decisions is vital to insulating them from partisan pressures. Yet, according to Ireland, accountability has proven difficult to achieve in practice. He illustrates this using examples from the Fed's own history: in the 1970s, ""despite the occasional appearance of a statistical Phillips curve relationship between inflation and unemployment… [political efforts] to exploit that Phillips curve led… not to lower unemployment at the cost of higher inflation but instead to the worst of both worlds."" Only ""by focusing first on keeping inflation low,"" and not on propping up employment numbers, did future Fed chairs restore the American economy and its labor force. ""Unemployment fluctuates no matter what,"" Ireland explains, ""but keeping inflation low and stable can promote the Fed's full employment objective.""



Ireland recommends that the Federal Reserve replace its current mandate with ""a new, streamlined mandate… to focus on stabilizing inflation around its own self-declared 2 percent target."" A numeric inflation target remains a key ""institutional safeguard"" for keeping Fed policymakers accountable to the public—while insulating them from political pressures.



 **""A Look Back at the Consensus Statement,""** Jeffrey M. Lacker, former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and Distinguished Professor of Economics at Virginia Commonwealth University



The Federal Reserve only formalized the terms of its dual mandate in 2012, with the release of its ""Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy"" (often abbreviated as its ""consensus statement""). Lacker discusses two factors that may have limited the statement's efficacy. First, the FOMC advertised the consensus statement as a mere formalization of existing policy, meaning it produced only a minimal change in the public's inflation expectations. Second, it neglects to specify a numeric employment target—or even a concrete metric for its goal of ""maximum employment.""



Drawing from these lessons, Lacker makes recommendations for the Fed's current policy review. He commends the statement for beginning to rectify some of the more ""problematic"" elements of the Fed's dual mandate—namely, that ""it injects distributional politics directly into monetary policy"" by specifying a numeric inflation target. Yet the Fed must now decide whether, or how, to compensate when it misses that target. It must also resolve ongoing questions surrounding its employment mandate.



 **""NGDP Targeting and the Public,"" **Carola Binder, Assistant Professor of Economics at Haverford College



When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) first considered replacing its existing inflation-targeting regime with nominal gross domestic product (NGDP) targeting, the idea didn't get much of a hearing. Several years removed from that initial discussion, Binder gives NGDP level targeting a second look, arguing it compares favorably to inflation targeting when it comes to weathering new threats to central bank credibility and independence. The global trend toward populism does not bode well for central banks, which, being ""unpopular by design,"" are frequently the lightning rods of populist discourse: Binder's data show that regimes classified as ""populist"" or ""nationalist"" put greater political pressure on central banks—and higher pressure is also correlated with higher rates of inflation.



The Fed's ""twin deficits"" of credibility and trust make it all the more vulnerable to political interference. Partly to blame is that the FOMC conducts monetary policy via inflation targeting, which it has a harder time explaining to the public. Switching to NGDP level targeting, Binder says, would make the Fed's actions ""easier to communicate, more popular, and less prone to political interference than a flexible inflation target or dual mandate."" It would also ""allow the Fed to frame its policy decisions in terms of income rather than inflation""—something that households and politicians can see and feel directly, which makes it easier to grasp. Nor would the switch cause any major policy disruption: in fact, had the Fed switched to NGDP level targeting in 2012, it would seem all the more successful today, given the steady growth rate NGDP has maintained since the last recession. What's more, the low inflation and unemployment rates that we had seen from 2017 until quite recently would look like a policy victory, rather than an anomaly ""casting existential doubt on the Fed's model of the economy"" (which assumes that inflation and unemployment are inversely correlated).



The Fed can protect its independence and enhance its credibility by replacing its dual mandate with a ""single, explicit, numerical"" NGDP level target, Binder says. This will make it easier for the public to gauge the Federal Reserve's credibility, easier for Fed officials to explain their decisions, and harder for politicians to subject the Federal Reserve to partisan interference.



 **""Federal Reserve Policy in a World of Low Interest Rates,"" **Eric R. Sims, Professor of Economics, University of Notre Dame and NBER Research Associate, and Jing Cynthia Wu, Associate Professor of Economics, University of Notre Dame and NBER Faculty Research Fellow



Since the last crisis, interest rates around the world have found a new normal: nearly zero percent. That's typical even for flourishing economies—and that might signal trouble for central bankers whose main monetary policy strategy is interest rate targeting. Because that strategy generally means keeping the central bank's policy interest rate in line with the natural market rate of interest, a natural rate of zero jeopardizes the central bank's ability to conduct accommodative monetary policy—which often means lowering their policy rate—in the event of a recession. Sims and Wu ask whether this new reality of near-zero interest rates requires a new policy framework to match—one that can better address the increased risk of natural rates hitting the zero lower bound.



While some suggest that the next recession might warrant sub-zero interest rates, Sims and Wu show that cutting rates below zero is not effective at stimulating recessed economies. Yet the converse strategy—gradually transitioning to a higher policy rate regime before the next recession hits—is equally fraught, and unlikely to do much good. Instead of shifting policy rates, they suggest that the Fed continue using two of its most powerful postcrisis tools, quantitative easing and forward guidance, to combat economic stagnation when natural interest rates broach their zero lower bound.



 **""Operating Regimes and Fed Independence,"" **Charles I. Plosser, former President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia



The Fed's postcrisis operating regime makes it more vulnerable to partisan pressures, Plosser writes, by allowing the size of the Fed's balance sheet, and therefore the overall volume of reserves, to have little—if any—bearing on its monetary policy decisions. As long as large excess reserves remain a standing feature of the Fed's operating regime, there is no limit to how large its balance sheet can become. This makes Fed policy a prime target for congressional meddling, with elected lawmakers coveting the central bank's abundant reserves for their own purposes. Indeed, lawmakers have already succeeded in funneling Fed money toward their pet projects: the crisis era bailouts, FAST act, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were all funded by Congress exploiting the Fed's ""power"" to detach its balance sheet from the stance of monetary policy. Plosser writes that it is imperative that the Fed revise its current operating regime in order to protect its independence from congressional whims.



 **""How QE Changed the Shape of the U.S. Yield Curve,"" **Manmohan Singh, Senior Financial Economist, International Monetary Fund, and Rohit Goel, Financial Sector Expert, International Monetary Fund



Lending firms often re-use long-term securities as collateral for short-term loans, which they use to purchase additional long-term, interest-earning assets. Borrowing firms get that collateral back immediately upon repaying those loans—meaning that the same long-term securities can get ""recycled"" through short-term lending markets again and again. Re-using high-quality bonds as short-term collateral is a process ""akin to the money creation that takes place when banks take deposits and make loans,"" Singh and Goel write; and it ""change[s] the effective supply and demand dynamics at the long-end [of the yield curve], which then feeds back into short-term rates."" Their article is the first to analyze how that relationship has changed since the 2008 crisis. Before 2008, short-term policy rates ""drove"" interest rate behavior at the right end of the yield curve, so that ""market expectations about the future path of the overnight federal funds rate were reflected in 10-year yields and beyond."" Postcrisis, however, transactions using long-term securities as short-term collateral are fewer, and the influence these transactions have on short-term market rates are weaker.



Quantitative easing (QE) may play a role in that. An abundance of high-quality collateral ""lubricates"" the money markets. When, during a round of QE, a central bank buys up this long-term collateral and transforms it into so many permanent, static holdings on its balance sheet, its market availability declines, money markets dry out, and short-term interest rates rise. New regulations compound these effects, especially leverage ratios limiting how much collateral banks can hold, relative to reserves, at any given time.



Post-pandemic, Singh and Goel write, central banks should reduce the size of their balance sheets, and by extension, their role in lending markets. Unwinding central bank balance sheets, while freeing up more space for the assets commercial banks can hold on theirs, ""is likely to improve transmission to the short-end money market rates."" Regulatory changes should also keep ""central bank reserves and U.S. Treasuries… as equal as possible,"" granting dealer banks more freedom to exchange some of their leverage (in the form of reserves) for collateral (in the form of U.S. Treasuries). That, in turn, will bolster the velocity and money-creating power of that collateral. This is especially important now, since ""Covid-19 related bailouts will keep central banks' footprint even larger for even longer, unless regulations are softened to allow dealer banks more balance sheet capacity.""



 **""Monetary Policy Operating Frameworks: Are Reforms Heading in the Right Direction?"" **Andrew Filardo, Head of Monetary Policy, Bank for International Settlements and Visiting Fellow, Hoover Institution



Filardo examines the repeated, and unexpected, interest rate spikes that rattled financial markets during the final months of 2018 and September 2019. Many blamed these episodes on the Fed's gradual balance sheet unwind, which added risk to the market and subtracted reserves. Yet Filardo counters that these spikes were instead ""symptoms of deeper pathologies."" In particular, he attributes them to flaws in how ""monetary policy operations have been adapted to the new financial regulatory environment.""



Contrary to claims that the Fed's postcrisis, ""floor-based"" operating system offers the best chance of stabilizing the money markets, Filardo argues it actually _weakens_ incentives for financial institutions to lend to, and monitor, one another. With the Fed pumping large quantities of reserves into the market whenever money becomes scarce, private institutions rely on one another less for overnight lending. That makes them less likely to monitor one another's risk-taking behavior. If the Fed increases its lending activities, it could further erode market trust and stability. Filardo recommends two reforms for returning responsibility to the hands of private financial institutions. First, the Fed should abandon its current floor system and return to its precrisis corridor system. Second, it should adopt Filardo's own ""sequestered reserve rule,"" requiring financial institutions and regulators to negotiate an ""appropriate preannounced level of reserves necessary to satisfy liquidity regulations."" That ratio would curb institutions from hoarding excess reserves and encourage them to use reserves, alongside other high-quality liquid assets, in their day-to-day operations.



 **""Upgrading the Fed's Operating Framework,"" **David Beckworth, Director of the Monetary Policy Program at the George Mason University Mercatus Center



Beckworth reviews some of the major macroeconomic lessons of the last decade, examining monetary policy strategy experiments from around the globe—ranging from interest rate policy adjustments, to quantitative easing cycles, to policies aimed at expanding the monetary base. Ultimately, his survey leads him to suggest three measures for making the Fed more resilient to future crises. Along with adapting its operating framework for both positive and negative interest rate scenarios, switching from interest rate targeting to NGDP level targeting will help the Fed ""provide meaningful forward guidance."" To enhance the credibility of the Fed's operating framework, Beckworth also recommends that the Fed set up a standing fiscal facility for making ""helicopter money"" drops—with the stipulation that this facility be used only when the natural rate of interest breaches the zero lower bound. While he concedes that such a facility would allow monetary policymakers to engage in fiscal policy operations, he adds that its terms should be clearly outlined to keep the Fed's ability to marry fiscal and monetary policy constrained, rules-based, and limited in both duration and scope.



 **""Central Banking and the Rule of Law,"" **Paul Tucker, former Deputy Governor, Bank of England



How can central banks can restore their legitimacy and integrity when their incentives to compromise both are so high? Tucker approaches this question from the standpoint of political and constitutional theory, rather than economics, which lends a unique perspective to his analysis. ""[M]ost discussions, and especially justifications, of central bank independence are expressed entirely in the language of economics,"" he says; and economics, ""positing a benign sovereign, sets out to achieve a flourishing society in which well-being is maximized."" Political theory, on the other hand, ""alert to the possibility of a malign sovereign, aims to avoid tyranny.""



In constitutional democracies, Tucker says, central banks should not be exempt from ""the values of democracy, constitutionalism… and of the rule of law."" To that end, central bankers should design a transparent, rules-based, ""money-credit constitution"" for measuring their compliance with policy mandates. They should also be required to explain publicly any departures that constitution's terms. Central bankers should also keep their balance sheets ""as simple and small as possible""; avoid making drastic discretionary policy changes; resist lending to insolvent firms; and develop transparent contingency plans for would-be extraordinary circumstances that may require them to temporarily increase their financial-market footprints.



 **""How Natural Language Processing Will Improve Central Bank Accountability and Policy,"" **Charles W. Calomiris, Henry Kaufman Professor of Financial Institutions, Columbia Business School, and Harry Mamaysky, Director of the Program for Financial Studies, Columbia Business School



However else central banking may change, central bank transparency is likely to improve, rather than worsen, in the near future. That's thanks to innovations in natural language processing (NLP) software, which can detect speech and language patterns associated with obfuscation or manipulation. While Fed bankers have a tendency to withhold the truth from the public, it's rarely out of malice. Instead, by making central bankers shoulder so many responsibilities—and therefore expose themselves to more blame—during economic difficulties, discretionary and unsystematic policy frameworks encourages them to dissemble. What's more, the lack of a definitive set of goals and metrics by which the public can hold them to account makes it easier for central bankers to dodge questions or provide meaningless answers about their policy decisions.



NLP can begin to address these challenges—with techniques that highlight evasive, long-winded explanations, or technology that reveals vague, meaningless, or redundant language in Fed policy statements. Calomiris and Mamaysky identify three ways that they foresee NLP improving central bank communications. First, NLP can help measure ""how nonsystematic and nontransparent policy is"" or reveal when central bankers ""are failing to disclose their true beliefs about a policy."" Second, NLP acts as a ""mind reader,"" clarifying ""which economic phenomena central bank policies are actually responding to."" It also works as an ""information leveler,"" reducing ""the information asymmetry between central bankers and the public about the state of the economy."" The authors predict that as NLP technology becomes more advanced, Fed policy will become more transparent (and systematic) in turn, with central bankers facing new incentives ""to recognize and address observable shortcomings.""



 **""How Politics Shapes Federal Reserve Communications,"" **Sarah Binder, Professor of Political Science, GWU and Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution, and Mark Spindel, Founder and Chief Investment Officer, Potomac River Capital, LLC



Binder and Spindel reflect on the political origins—and consequences—of the double bind the Fed faces in its communication strategy. While transparency is vital for stabilizing market expectations and keeping central bankers accountable, it also makes it easier for politicians to blame the Fed when the economy sours. Now, conflicting and often impossible demands from Congress and the President make it nearly impossible for Fed officials to communicate openly. The authors discuss how our increasingly polarized political climate harms Fed transparency and independence, especially when it comes to inflation targeting and balance sheet operations.



One of the most politically troubling economic trends facing the Fed is the weakening relationship between inflation and unemployment. The idea that inflation and unemployment are inversely correlated has been a bedrock of Fed policy for decades, and is even the basis of the Fed's dual mandate. Now, however, ""setting market expectations of future policy"" through forward guidance ""is near impossible in light of the Fed's uncertainties."" At the same time, the Fed faces aggressive political jawboning from President Trump. Between the President's ""procyclical pressure for more dovish policy… compounded by already low rates and an enfeebled Phillips curve,"" the Fed has dispensed with most of its communications strategies and ""limited itself to meeting-by-meeting policy choices.""



Nor are these choices themselves free from political pressure. When it comes to managing inflation expectations, former Federal Reserve officials have refused to consider higher inflation targets, not for economic reasons as much as out of fear that Congress might object. Similarly, the Fed's balance sheet policies are at once a topic of congressional criticism and exploitation: though Republican and Democrat lawmakers have each questioned the Fed's paying interest on excess reserves, they have also both ""tapped Federal Reserve profits (a partial by-product of large balance sheet policies) to help fund political priorities.""



 **""Pitfalls of Makeup Strategies for Mitigating the Effective Lower Bound,"" **Andrew T. Levin, Professor of Economics, Dartmouth College, and Arunima Sinha, Assistant Professor of Economics, Fordham University



Levin and Sihna discuss three factors that make ""makeup strategies"" prone to failure. First is the challenge of ""expectations formation"": the public may not trust the Fed to carry through on a given makeup strategy; and unless people expect the Fed to change its own policy, they are unlikely to change their own patterns of spending and saving. Second is ""imperfect credibility"": the less credible a central bank is, the less capable it will be of influencing market behavior. Even a well-functioning and trustworthy central bank is not entirely credible—throwing the outcome of even the soundest make-up strategy in doubt. Third is ""model uncertainty"": all economic policies rely, to some degree, on economic modeling; and make-up strategies are no exception. Yet models are not markets, and cannot mirror reality perfectly. At best, models can merely help policymakers form educated guesses about how their strategies will pan out.



 **""Envisioning Monetary Freedom,"" **George Selgin, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives



Selgin's contribution addresses the question: what might a free market monetary system of the not-too-distant future be like? He begins by noting that, ""if monetary freedom means anything, it means that people are free to choose what sort of money they will keep on hand, or accept from others, in exchange for their labor, goods, or services. And enjoying such freedom… means that government regulations neither compel people to use any particular sort of currency nor prevent entrepreneurs making alternatives to the dollar."" What sort of monetary arrangements would these conditions give rise to? Among the changes Selgin contemplates are the fate of the U.S. dollar, new incentives for borrowers and lenders, and currency competition and valuation. The dollar will likely prevail in the short-term, he writes, with either a ""convertibility rule"" or a ""quantity rule"" regulating the total amount in circulation.



As for regulatory incentives, Selgin imagines a world where ""both explicit and implicit deposit insurance,"" are done away with, followed by ""all bank regulations [aside from those that] enforce voluntary contracts"" between borrowers and lenders. (That includes all government bailout guarantees.) Future financial transactions will be mostly digital and ""made using convertible [cash] substitutes, supplied by banks or other companies,"" tracked and executed by ""an intricate clearing and settlement system,"" he says. He also discusses ""converting today's Federal Reserve banks into so many private clearing houses,"" and allowing commercial banks the option to transact with them or a variety of competing clearing house systems.



Just how dramatic the changes will be between today's monetary system and that of a future, freer society, Selgin says, will depend not only on _what_ changes are made—but _how_ we make them.



 **""The Fed's Precrisis Monetary Framework is Well-Suited for a Free Society,"" **Bill Nelson, Executive Vice President and Chief Economist, Bank Policy Institute



Before the 2007–09 financial crisis, the Fed's primary means of regulating the money supply were purchasing U.S. Treasuries and conducting short-term sales of government securities. These limited functions meant it seldom intervened in day-to-day market transactions. Banks borrowed and lent among one another, and the Fed served only as their lender of last resort. Postcrisis, the Fed has augmented its earlier operating framework dramatically. Nelson discusses the consequences of these changes and makes recommendations for reform. He addresses the Fed's decision to house unlimited Treasury deposits at Federal Reserve banks as well as the Fed's QE3 (or ""QE Infinity"" program), which continued well past its promised conclusion date. Extending QE postponed, and then altered, the Fed's earlier plans to renormalize its balance sheet. Rather than sell back the assets it had purchased from market dealers, as it first intended, the Fed opted instead to allow those assets to roll off as they mature.



Nelson argues that returning to the Fed's pre-2008 operating framework will help the economy run far more smoothly going forward. He outlines the steps the Fed should take to shrink its balance sheet and reinstate its ""scarce reserves"" regime. First, it should tame fluctuations in its own reserve balance (which shifts wildly owing to ups and downs in the Treasury General Account, or TGA) by relying on frequent repo operations in the short run, and by shifting more of the TGA's reserves to the private sector in the long run. Second, it should dispel the popular misconception that TGA deposits are counted among the Fed's own assets. It should also enact policies that encourage banks to rely on collateralized daylight overdrafts and use the Fed's discount window judiciously—not as a first recourse for borrowing. It should also unwind its own asset portfolio as soon as possible.



 **""Four Principles for a Base Money Regime,"" **William J. Luther, Assistant Professor of Economics, Florida Atlantic University and Director, AIER Sound Money Project



Four properties define the optimal base money regime, writes Luther. The first is a stable inflation rate. While economists continue to debate whether the optimal inflation rate is slightly negative or slightly positive, it is certainly close to zero, Luther says—likely somewhere ""between –4 percent and 4 percent."" The second is demand-elasticity: changes in the total quantity of base money should depend, not on central bankers' discretion, but rather market demand. Luther adds the caveat that a ""demand-elastic"" regime does not mean adjusting the base money supply upon every shock in the real supply, ""since real shocks tend to be concentrated on a particular subset of markets."" The third is a uniform global currency. Not only does a uniform currency facilitate exchange in myriad direct and indirect ways; it also increases the benefits of exchange. ""A common currency area prevents a regionally specific money-supply mechanism,"" Luther writes. ""However, the financial system routes funds to those demanding them and remaining differences in regional price levels are relative-price differences. Taken together, this implies that the optimal currency area is the maximum currency area""—which is to say, global. The fourth is incentive-compatibility: those charged with creating and maintaining the monetary regime must not only be legally required, but incentive-bound, to uphold the rules by which it operates. While Luther notes that no monetary regime anywhere in the world possesses all four of these attributes, he says that taken together, they can serve as a guidepost for comparing, and improving upon, the ones in existence today.



 **""Money, Stability, and Free Societies,"" **Steve H. Hanke, Professor of Applied Economics, Johns Hopkins University



The greatest threat that financial crises pose to free societies, Hanke writes, is not the supply shock that comes with it, but the civil liberty constraints that come after it. He outlines three strategies for improving global monetary stability overall, and in turn reducing the immediate and long-term threats financial crises pose to our prosperity. The first is to formalize a loose, yet official, exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Hanke recommends that this rate be somewhere between $1.20 and $1.40 per euro. The second is to replace at least 100 central banks around the world with currency boards, which Hanke considers more stable, since unlike a central bank, a currency board is entirely non-discretionary and ""cannot engage in the fiduciary issue of money."" Its sole function is rather ""to exchange the domestic currency it issues for an anchor currency at a fixed rate,"" meaning that ""the quantity of domestic currency in circulation is determined by market forces."" Because currency boards have ""a [fixed] exchange rate policy… but no monetary policy,"" their economies consistently perform better than central banks' in areas like financial stability, lower inflation, debt reduction, and market productivity. Hanke's third recommendation is that governments greenlight private currency board systems, including digital currency boards like Libra. Like most businesses, central banks tend to regard these competitors as threats to their own market primacy. Unlike most businesses, however, central banks can effectively bar their competitors from entry via institutional strictures. Hanke argues against this: ""The competitive forces that will be unleashed by the private alternatives would be a great stabilizer and enhance economic freedom and free societies.""

"An international survey of people’s news habits around the world reveals that Australians’ opinions on climate change are determined mostly by age and news source but that, overall, we are more likely to deny climate change than most other nations. And it is clear from the results of the 2020 Digital Media Report that a major reason for this denial is the influence of News Corp. This year’s Digital News Report in Australia, which is produced by the News and Media Research Centre at the University of Canberra (disclosure, I am also employed by the university and wrote a commentary for this year’s report), covers a wide range of topics that investigate how people access news and what interests them. The report has some pretty eye-opening results on the topic of climate change, which confirm longheld beliefs about the impact of the News Corp coverage of the issue. Of the 40 countries that take part in the survey, which is coordinated by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford, only the US, Sweden and Norway have a higher percentage of news consumers who believe that climate change is either not serious at all or they don’t know if it is serious (which effectively means they do not think it is serious): Just over one in five news consumers in Australia regard climate change as either not very serious, not serious at all or “don’t know”. Given that the report was conducted during the recent horrific bushfire season, that result is rather stunning and depressing. The problem is that, given you are reading this, you are not one of those people. Of all online news outlets, Guardian Australia readers are second only to those who read Junkee in being extremely concerned about climate change, and third behind readers of the Conversation and Vice News, of those who are more than “somewhat concerned”. And while we can give ourselves a pat on the back, a look down the bottom of the charts shows where the problem lies. Nearly 30% of skynews.com.au readers don’t believe climate change is a serious issue (compared to 35% of those who watch Sky News TV), and we see News Corp websites dominate the news sites whose readers most deny climate change. Mostly the views of the online readers aligns with that of the offline readers by brand, although those who consume ABC online are generally more likely to deny climate change than those who consume ABC TV and radio. The survey of 2,131 news consumers found that age is also a major factor behind people’s views of climate change. Generally, the younger you are the more concerned you will be: As a card-carrying member of Gen X, it is rather shaming to find that barely half of us think climate change is either very or extremely serious, given unlike our baby boomer parents our formative years saw increasing temperatures: But it is not just age – political orientation is also a determinant. Those who call themselves rightwing are much more likely to deny climate change: But while this may not be surprising, given their news sources and the statements by rightwing politicians, what is more worrying is that just as many of those who class themselves as “centre” view climate change as merely “somewhat serious”, as do rightwingers. This suggests a large gulf in the ability of the media to convey the issue’s importance to those with little political affiliation. When it comes to climate change, believing it is only “somewhat serious” essentially means you have not understood the problem. And it is clear that the media is not getting the message through. Only 38% of those with a “centre” political orientation believe the media provides “accurate information” on climate change: We need to be a bit careful with these findings because while rightwingers are more likely to deny climate change, they are also more likely to believe the media is not telling the truth. So it is unclear whether those in the centre believe the media is exaggerating or underplaying the issue. But while it is easy to lay all the blame at the feet of News Corp and those media organisations and journalists who choose to treat climate change as a debatable concept (or possibly a less than serious one) the report also points to the challenge for those of us in the media who agree with the science. Over a quarter of those who only regard the issue as “somewhat serious” are disinterested in reading about climate change: This is the challenge for organisations such as Guardian Australia, the ABC, and the Nine/Fairfax papers who do report on the issue with the seriousness it deserves. It is not enough to preach to the converted. We need to reach those vaguely aware of the issue but not really informed well enough to understand its seriousness. Failure to do so will cede the issue to the climate-change denying media outlets, and will continue to have Australia with one of the highest numbers of deniers in the world. • Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia"
"MONROVIA, Liberia  —   Emmanuel Dongo, who spends his days begging on Monrovia’s streets, plunged with his crutches onto the concrete stage and into the glare of neon. He thrust his muscular shoulders forward, limp legs hanging behind him, and transformed himself into Lyrical D, rising rap artist. “Handicap man trying to survive, then you sitting there just to criticize, when that you, what thing you will really do?” he asked, snapping out the lyrics to a rapt crowd at Code 146, where Liberia’s aspiring rap stars come to make their names. “Will you close your mouth and turn your back on you? I feel too bad when I sitting in this wheelchair, just want to be walking like you, man. See me passing and you mocking at me telling me I not even look like human being. ” Putting down his crutches, Mr. Dongo leaned back into his wheelchair and propelled himself across the stage, dancing frenetically and spitting out angry rhymes about his experiences of discrimination in a society that largely views disability through the lens of superstition. Even though disabled victims of war are a common sight on Liberia’s city streets, handicapped people are often seen as cursed, their amputations or paralyzed limbs viewed as the result of witchcraft by the cruel and envious, or else as punishment for some wrongdoing. Music seems an unlikely career choice for a Liberian with Mr. Dongo’s many difficulties. But the proliferation of makeshift studios,   engineers and a distinct Liberian sound has given rise to a thriving music scene here, opening up space for emerging artists like Mr. Dongo. Aspiring artists can record songs for as little as $20 if the engineer likes them, or even free if they are a big enough name. That night at Code 146, the D. J. played the beat to Lyrical D’s latest club track. Onstage, Mr. Dongo swung back into his wheelchair and began to twist, turn and thump the chair’s front tire up and down. “Make some noise, party people, make some noise!” he shouted. The listeners in the audience responded, shaking their bodies and raising their arms in the air. Code 146 is owned and run by Jonathan Koffa, Monrovia’s most famous rapper. Known as  Takun J, Mr. Koffa is widely considered a pioneer of HipCo, Liberia’s articulation of rap that uses the nation’s unique patois as its base. His downtown club is hidden at the end of a dark alley. Its walls are lime green and covered with paintings of the city’s musical icons. Performances rarely start before 11 p. m. with music pumping through crackling speakers till the early hours. On the evening Mr. Dongo performed, his producer, Alhaji Yaits, 22, who goes by the name Young Master, sat nodding to the beat he had helped produce a week earlier. Mr. Yaits discovered Mr. Dongo, 27, on the streets of Monrovia three years ago and, in between other paying projects, has been helping him produce an album free of charge. Mr. Dongo’s wheelchair is regularly parked at the bottom of the steps leading to Mr. Yaits’s studio. Inside, the walls are decorated in   colors with the names of artists Mr. Yaits has worked with and a large picture of him presiding over a mixing board. Mr. Yaits, like Mr. Dongo, was inspired by Takun J and HipCo music, a sound born in Monrovia in the aftermath of Liberia’s civil war, which ended in 2003. HipCo is raw, gritty and deeply   in spirit. It throws punches at politicians and the Liberian elite, whom HipCo rappers accuse of plundering the country’s wealth and ignoring the poor. Dozens of artists like Mr. Dongo jockey for a chance to perform at Code 146’s weekly   sessions. In the early days of his career, Mr. Dongo was ridiculed when he performed at the street jams that regularly spring up across the city, but at Code 146 he was welcomed with open arms. Born in a rural area outside the capital, Mr. Dongo came into the world on the eve of a conflict that killed more than 250, 000 and displaced millions. His mother was never able to reach a clinic to have him vaccinated for polio, leaving Mr. Dongo with two withered legs. His uncle, a health worker, eventually brought Mr. Dongo to Monrovia but lost his job and was not able to support him. Instead, he sent Mr. Dongo to a grim   home for disabled people. Mr. Dongo lived there for over a decade before moving out on his own to pursue his dream of becoming a rap star. By day, Mr. Dongo sits on busy traffic islands and begs outside the shiny supermarkets that serve Liberia’s expatriates and elite, who drive around in ample S. U. V.s and live in plush   compounds protected by barbed wire. He uses most of the money to support his    son, who lives with Mr. Dongo’s mother. The rest of the money goes toward the fledgling music career he hopes will lift him out of poverty in a nation where opportunities for handicapped people simply do not exist. Just getting around Monrovia is tough for the disabled. Footpaths are rare, and when they exist, they are often a series of disjointed concrete panels that jut out like jagged teeth. Metal manholes are often stolen for scrap metal, leaving open holes in the middle of roads. Many of Monrovia’s main thoroughfares have been paved in recent years, though, and Mr. Dongo and other disabled people can often be seen gliding in their wheelchairs through city traffic, dodging cars in a country where road rules are rarely respected. Like many Monrovians, Mr. Dongo lives in a slum, called Clara Town, where he has to muscle his way through the narrow dusty pathways that run between the community’s zinc shacks. While largely independent, he often pays neighbors to fetch him water from the pump to bathe, to   his clothes and sometimes to cook. Mr. Dongo fantasizes about a future in which he no longer begs in order to survive or navigates potholed roads and back streets instead, he’s ferried around in a black S. U. V. accompanied by a bodyguard who pushes him past screaming fans to the stage. On the streets he feels embarrassed when those who know him as an artist see him begging. “I know that sitting on the street begging I belittle myself,” Mr. Dongo said. “But when I perform onstage, I feel good because I know that my dream is working and people go wild for me. ” As Lyrical D finished his short set at Code 146, Mr. Koffa stood behind the bar, a quietly commanding presence. His bare, muscular arms were tattooed with maps of Liberia and tributes to HipCo. At the end of the performance, Mr. Koffa told Lyrical D that he liked his new track and shook his hand. Several days later, Mr. Dongo was out on the street filming a video for his song “Show Love. ” A director told Mr. Dongo where to position himself as workers shooed people away from the shot. A friend played the song through a mobile phone plugged into a boom box, and Mr. Dongo began to sing. He was accompanied by two friends dressed in matching    striped   and jeans: his backup dancers, twirling in wheelchairs. Mr. Dongo furrowed his brow and performed small stunts with his chair. “I can remember when I used to go on show, people used to laugh,” he sang. “But I keep pushing, no fun, keep pushing, no fun, keep pushing, I not give up. ”"
"Biofuels have come under scrutiny in the latest IPCC report, which outlines some of the emergent risks associated with their production. In principle, biofuels seem to be an ideal solution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions and the risks of climate change. Most of the carbon released when the fuel is burned is absorbed by plants as they re-grow. If all went according to plan, the carbon cycle would be “closed” and there would be no (or very little) net release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from biofuels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest report still finds potential for biofuels to provide a low(ish) carbon solution to energy needs and, as a result, be part of the arsenal of strategies to reduce the risks of climate change. But the authors also draw on the past decade of research that shows the challenges ahead if biofuels are to meet this promise without worsening other global problems. But it has been clear from the earliest IPCC reports that biofuels were never going to be a game changer. At best they were going to provide 10% of the world’s energy needs – in part because it would be impossible to produce sufficient crops for biofuel, given the need to use land for other purposes. As is common in policy debates, a solution is put forward to solve one particular problem (climate change) and over time people with interests in solving other problems (food or water security) begin to notice potential downsides for the focus of their concerns.  Biofuels have followed this traditional path and, since the last Assessment Report, it has been recognised that they cannot be understood as a solution outside of a more complex energy-food-water-climate nexus. They are interlinked in a way that land devoted to growing crops for biofuels might compete with food production, lead to deforestation and also compete for increasingly limited water supplies. A significant hitch in the biofuel strategy was identified in what has become known as the Searchinger Report. This focused on the potential adverse effects of biofuels on climate change if a rush to growing them caused farmers to convert forests and grasslands to crops for fuel. Depending on the farming method used, biofuels could be responsible for significant land use problems, such as releasing other greenhouse gases like nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere.  Critiques followed, pointing out that crops might require significant amounts of water for irrigation in areas of the world already struggling with water scarcity. The assault on bioenergy continued with the food vs fuel debate, in which it was claimed that wholesale movement towards biofuel production could nudge aside food production, driving up food costs and worsening food shortages in the poorest nations. The latest IPCC report has taken these concerns on board and issued a cautionary note. The message is not that biofuels should be abandoned. There is still scope for them to contribute to a global low carbon energy policy, but if done poorly, biofuels could worsen both food and water problems, while simultaneously making climate change worse.  Whether a risk emerges depends critically on what is assumed about how land would be used if crops for energy were not planted. These counterfactuals are where most of the disagreements lie regarding the net effect of biofuels. Each of the concerns surrounding biofuel production has a solution to ensure that the risks identified don’t appear in practice. As the authors recognise, however, putting these solutions in place makes biofuels a more complicated mitigation strategy than was thought in the last assessment report. Advanced biofuel production is being developed to solve many of the existing problems with them. Solutions include moving away from a reliance on food crops, sustainable forestry practises where the total amount of carbon stored in plants remains constant even as biomass is harvested and the development of drought-resistant feedstock, perhaps through bioengineering. The lesson? It was a mistake to ever view biofuels outside the energy-food-water-climate nexus. Human aims always collide and so a balance must be found and policies harmonised so each of the aims is represented in how land is used. And watch this space, because the UK’s Supergen Bioenergy Hub at the University of Manchester, is addressing these issues and helping the world move toward solutions that will allow biofuels to play at least their limited role in solving the energy and climate change problems of tomorrow without worsening other pressing problems of food and water."
"There were so many instant internet spoofs making fun of Kellyanne Conway’s   “Bowling Green Massacre” that it’s hard to pick a favorite. Gun to my head, I’d say mine was the Twitter meme that showed a brass plaque dedicated to the names of the poor souls left for dead on Bowling Green’s grassy killing field. It was blank. That’s because there was no massacre there. No one died. No one even stubbed a toe. But there’s a good chance you know that by now: that the supposed terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Ky. that Ms. Conway, a top presidential adviser, invoked on MSNBC last week to justify President Trump’s contentious travel ban never happened. (And, no, the reason you had never heard of it was not because the Dishonest Media ignored the alleged carnage at the time of its   as Ms. Conway alleged.) The very fact that you probably know all this means that the “Bowling Green Massacre” may go down in the record of the Trump presidency as the first break in the “fake news” clouds that have cast such gloom over our fair and once (relatively) true republic. The same internet that enabled false stories to run unchecked through news feeds during the election year dispatched new white blood cells that attacked Ms. Conway’s “alternate facts” with “true facts” (a redundant term that I guess we’re stuck with for now). Their most effective attack was traditional reporting, in many cases from news organizations that have doubled down on   joined by newfangled memes that accentuate the truth. The Massacre That Wasn’t showed that while Facebook, Google and Twitter take steps to combat nefarious hoaxes, they are already playing host to an organic correction movement led by ordinary users who are crowdsourcing reality. It’s early. Vigilance, and continuing improvements throughout the news business, remain necessary. But the tale of the “massacre” could be the start of something new. Ms. Conway’s mention of the supposed attack  —   she was trying to justify Mr. Trump’s order that closed the border to citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries  —   slipped past the MSNBC host interviewing her, Chris Matthews. The corrective story broke the way stories have broken since God invented newspapers: A guy walked into a bar. In this case, the guy was Joe Sonka, a staff writer for the Insider Louisville website. He was having a beer at a bar called the Backdoor when “someone texted me that Conway said something insane,” Mr. Sonka told me. As a reporter  —   and onetime liberal blogger  —   in Kentucky for several years, Mr. Sonka knew what Ms. Conway seemed to be referring to when he went home to check it out. In 2011, the federal authorities arrested two Iraqi refugees who were later given prison sentences  —   one for life and one for 40 years  —   for plotting to send money and weapons to Al Qaeda in Iraq from their new homes in Bowling Green. The episode led to a slowdown in Iraqi immigration as the Obama administration reworked vetting procedures. The authorities never charged the men  —   one of whose fingerprints turned up on a roadside bomb in Iraq  —   with planning an attack on American soil. So at 9:34 p. m. on Thursday, Mr. Sonka wrote on Twitter: “@KellyannePolls says that 2 Iraqi refugees ‘were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre.’ (There was no such massacre. )” It made like a Trump tweet and roared through the broader news media sphere. “That tweet got 2. 4 million impressions,” Mr. Sonka said. “Pretty crazy. ” There was fast   by Vox, The Washington Post, CNN and Fox News (among many others) on conservative websites including Newsmax and Breitbart and, finally, in multiple references on “Saturday Night Live”  —   the ultimate sign that something has truly broken through. In the end, social media and journalistic scrutiny aligned with comedy to right a wrong pretty definitively. That it happened so organically showed that false “facts” might not always be the stubborn things so many people fear they are becoming. To understand how deep those fears go, just look at how “1984,” by George Orwell, has climbed up the   lists nearly 70 years after its debut. A “1984” stage adaptation is even heading to Broadway. (How about a Hamiltonesque musical: “2 and 2 make 5? Don’t give me that jive! ”) As the New York Times book critic Michiko Kakutani put it recently, Orwell’s classic seems “all too familiar,” capturing “a world in which the government insists that reality is not ‘something objective, external, existing in its own right. ’” Mr. Trump renews those fears every time he taps out social media messages like one he posted on Facebook on Thursday complimenting an article about a “ ” travel ban Kuwait was imposing on five nearby countries. As it happens, this was untrue, as even Sputnik International, the Russian   news service that  helped promote the story, acknowledged. Then there are the regular Trump Tweets calling CNN or The Times “fake news. ” The Bowling Green episode made such a splash because it played directly into concerns that the Trump administration would use untrue assertions to rally support for its agenda while denigrating as “dishonest” all the valid reporting pointing out the falsehoods. But even before the Bowling Green story fell apart so spectacularly, there were signs that what had worked well during the presidential campaign last year might not succeed when it comes to the   work of government. All the accusations of “fake news” and “dishonest media” couldn’t erase images of crying relatives stranded at airports  —   or the reporting on the legal questions surrounding Mr. Trump’s immigration order that led a judge to temporarily suspend it. No one in the administration could disappear the readouts from the president’s tense call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia leaked to The Washington Post. Nor could they reverse the effects of the reporting, some of it in The Times, about the potential business conflicts of his Army secretary nominee, Vincent Viola, who withdrew his name Friday night because of them. Ditto for the blowback over the whole Bowling Green yarn. Ms. Conway went on to admit her error, first on Twitter (where else?) and later in an interview with Howard Kurtz of Fox News, saying it was overblown because “I misspoke one word. ” (By that, she meant, apparently, that she should have said “Bowling Green terrorists” rather than “Bowling Green massacre. ”) And Ms. Conway was right when she wrote that “honest mistakes abound. ” After all, The Washington Post admitted over the weekend that several details in a column about internal White House strife over the president’s executive order on immigration were in dispute. A few days before that,   of Detroit walked back a report about a woman who died in Iraq supposedly after Mr. Trump’s new policy blocked her entry to the United States. Yet by the end of the weekend, it was Ms. Conway’s credibility that was receiving the most scrutiny (which she described as unfair and coming from “a lot of the haters” in her interview with Mr. Kurtz). Some, like the New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen, were calling upon the television networks to stop booking her. And CNN declined to have her as a guest on Sunday  —   in part because the Trump administration offered her in lieu of Vice President Mike Pence, but also because of what the network told me were “serious questions about her credibility. ” It would be a positive development if Ms. Conway embraced the idea that the term “honest mistakes” can apply to reporters, too, as it would be if everybody  —   including journalists  —   doubly committed to getting the facts right, without hysteria or misfires. Too optimistic? Well, if you had asked me a few days ago what I was planning to write about, I wouldn’t have said it would involve praising Twitter for keeping the national debate    —   and fun. Eventually, the Bowling Green memes led to mock street memorials with signs like “Never Remember. ” They had made it IRL, or “In Real Life,” which, the new administration is learning, has a way of sneaking up on you."
"In November 2014 Sir John Houghton gave the annual Edmund Halley lecture at St Margaret’s church, Lee, south-east London, where I was rector, on the theme of climate change. The audience, including secondary school students, was packed. He was gracious, obviously knowledgable and clear-sighted about the dangers awaiting us. He was also sure, as a religious believer, that the universe did not contain its own final explanation."
"This story is co-published with Columbia Journalism Investigations, the Center for Public Integrity and Covering Climate Now. Read the full investigation here. Charlie Rhodes lived alone on a tree-sparse street with sunburned lawns just outside Phoenix, Arizona. At 61, the army veteran’s main connection to the world was Facebook; often, he posted several times a day. But as a heatwave blanketed the region in June 2016 – leading to temperatures among the highest ever recorded – his posts stopped. Three weeks later, a pile of unopened mail outside his door prompted a call to police. When officers arrived, they were overcome by the odor of rotting garbage, worsened by the still-searing heat. Inside the home, they found the air conditioner broken and its thermometer reading 99F. Rhodes lay dead in the bedroom, his body decomposing. The cause, his autopsy shows: “Complications of environmental heat exposure.” Yearly heat-related deaths have more than doubled in Arizona in the last decade to 283. Across the country, heat caused at least 10,000 deaths between 1999 and 2016 – more than hurricanes, tornadoes or floods in most years. Scientists link the warming planet to a rise in dangerous heat in the US, as well as the spread of infectious diseases and other health conditions. Federal research predicts heatstroke and similar illnesses will claim tens of thousands of American lives each year by the end of the century. Already, higher temperatures pose lethal risks: the five warmest years nationwide have all occurred since 2006. In the last six decades, the number of annual heatwaves in 50 US cities has, on average, tripled. In contrast to a viral pandemic, this is a quiet, insidious threat with no end point. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is charged with helping cities and states adapt to threats like extreme heat. Its climate program, created more than 10 years ago, is the federal government’s only sustained effort to bolster state and local health departments’ fight against global warming. But the program has been hampered by a decade of underfunding, limited expertise and political resistance, Columbia Journalism Investigations and the Center for Public Integrity found. Interviews with more than 100 people and a review of hundreds of pages of government records show the Obama administration, while pushing measures to combat climate change, missed opportunities to expand the program. Under Donald Trump, officials have tried to eliminate it. The tepid federal response has left state and local health workers ill-equipped to act, exposing communities to underappreciated threats that will only get worse.  Arizona’s health department receives around $200,000 a year to fund its climate team. But for a state with 7 million people – including a growing number of isolated, older residents like Rhodes – experts say it’s not enough to pay for research and, most importantly, action. Rhodes, a once gregarious jokester who cut himself off from family and friends after the loss of his job and father, had devised a method to handle the heat: he covered his windows with aluminum foil and ran the air conditioner in his bedroom. But as the temperature hit 120F near his home, no one checked on him. Asked what the program has done to prevent people like Rhodes from dying of heat, the Arizona health department spokesperson Holly Poynter said its advisories on the hottest days include a sentence encouraging people to check on at-risk friends, family and neighbors twice a day. “Heat-related deaths are preventable,” she said, “and continued work is needed due to increasing vulnerable populations within the state.” The CDC defended its efforts on climate change, saying its program has assisted health departments successfully for years. “We’re proud of the work that our program is doing,” said Patrick Breysse, who heads the agency’s environmental health center and oversees its climate activities. “We’re excited about the leadership role we play.” Some CDC-aided health departments lead the nation in heat illness prevention. San Francisco’s climate program helped devise heat emergency response plans and mapped vulnerable city neighborhoods. Now, officials use these maps to encourage neighbors to check on each other. Climate programs elsewhere helped change the threshold for heat advisories from 100F to 95F after finding residents get sick at lower temperatures. Yet many departments funded by the CDC are struggling to fulfill the program’s mission, according to government and academic reports and interviews with state and local health workers. In North Carolina, program employees asked their CDC counterparts for guidance and expertise to identify the state’s climate health threats. Records show the agency failed to provide the assistance it promised early on. After nearly a decade of research, health workers only recently began reaching out to the most vulnerable residents. In Florida, heat-related hospitalizations are on the rise. But health officials there barred the state climate team from publicly acknowledging global warming’s link to heat. Then, with the CDC’s imprimatur, they evicted the program from the health department. Most of the country’s 3,000 state and local health departments, meanwhile, get no such funding. They’re on their own to figure out what to do and how to pay for it. Federal officials have known for decades that climate change poses a public health crisis. In 1989, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued a 100-page report on how global warming could affect human health. It urged public health agencies to fund research on extreme heat and provide health departments with “trained professionals”. By 2000, the US released its first recurring assessment of the changing climate’s impacts. Again, it called for “investments in advancing the public health infrastructure”. Five years later, Dr Howard Frumkin, a veteran epidemiologist hired to run CDC’s environmental health center, brought the nation’s leading public health agency into the battle against climate change. “We knew that the climate was warming,” said Frumkin, who viewed the CDC as “past the point where we needed to be stepping up”. In 2009 – then the second-hottest year on record – Frumkin seized an opportunity to expand the CDC’s climate efforts. That February, he testified before a congressional committee about challenges brought by global warming. Health departments, he said, require climate and health training and data to plan for impacts. “CDC has in place many of the building blocks,” he told the committee, but it needed to assemble them into a serious effort. A month later, a Democratic-led Congress gave the CDC $7.5m for its climate program, to be renewed yearly with congressional approval. The new initiative seeded climate and health activities in 10 health departments. Frumkin hoped it would eventually expand to all 50 states. Shortly after Congress funded the program, Dr Thomas Frieden, then the newlyappointed CDC director, introduced his “winnable battles” – seven health initiatives that his agency prioritized. Climate was not among them. Most of those programs – nutrition, food safety – received an annual $50m to $700m by the end of his eight-year tenure. The climate program, by contrast, never exceeded $10m. In 2013, the CDC recommended reducing that budget. As the CDC’s director, Frieden rarely used his bully pulpit to address threats posed by the warming planet. During a 20-minute keynote speech at a national environmental health conference, he discussed the topic for 13 seconds. A 2015 report by the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, criticized the CDC for failing to provide leadership on the issue. Frieden, for his part, disputes claims that he did not prioritize climate change and insists he cares about the issue, pointing to the CDC’s work combating dangerous particulate matter produced by cars and coal plants. “It will have major public health consequences,” he said of climate change. “But there’s only a certain amount that public health programs can do.” The CDC’s lackluster response contrasted with President Barack Obama’s public overtures and policy initiatives on climate. Former senior White House officials – including those who helped implement climate policies – admit the administration didn’t apply enough pressure on the CDC to act. In December 2015, Republicans in Congress rejected a proposal to boost spending on the CDC program to $18m. The increase would have more than doubled its size. The summer of 2016 – when Charlie Rhodes died – showed there was no time to lose in the push to understand and stem heat death. The previous eight years, the number of heat-related fatalities in Arizona had averaged 145. That jumped to 219 in 2016, and 264 the year after. A report produced by Maricopa county – where the largest number of the state’s heat deaths have occurred – found that men, Native Americans and people 75 and older were most at risk. Gene Moore, 82, fit all three categories. A Quechan tribe member, he spent much of his life on its reservation, near Yuma, Arizona, before moving near Phoenix in 2010 to live with his son. Over the years, Moore’s health declined, but he remained mobile and enjoyed talking on the phone with friends, according to his son, Ivan. In June 2017 – several weeks after Ivan had his home air conditioner repaired – he took his family camping in the mountains. Gene stayed behind. The day Ivan left, the temperature hit 118F. Phoenix went 11 days at or above 110F, one of only five such stretches on record. Four happened in the last three decades. A week later, Ivan’s brother called to say Moore had stopped answering his phone. Ivan dialed the police. They found Moore dead on his bedroom floor, his window open. The air conditioner had broken again, and the temperature inside topped 105F. Moore’s autopsy shows cardiovascular disease caused his death, while heat played a significant contributing factor. Arizona health officials still don’t know why more residents like Moore are dying or how best to protect them. Temperatures are rising in the state, but the hottest summers don’t always match the highest death tolls. The Arizona State University researcher David Hondula, who works with the state’s climate team, contributed to a study ruling out temperature as the only reason. Other factors such as homelessness and substance abuse may play a role, he said, but the climate program doesn’t have money to keep studying the problem. “If additional funding existed, we could really dive in to answer this question,” Hondula said. Instead, the limited CDC money – budgeted before the spike in deaths – supports awareness campaigns in poorer areas such as Yuma county. Many Arizona cities offer cooling centers – air-conditioned libraries, churches and other shelters – for residents to escape the heat. Moore and Rhodes both had access to a vehicle. Cooling centers were nearby. Health workers are now surveying residents who visit cooling centers, but they say it takes money to determine why so many others don’t. Ivan Moore, who grew up hearing about heat death victims on the radio, blames himself for what happened to his father. “I should have had someone check on him sooner,” Ivan said, even though less than 36 hours had passed between Gene’s last email to his family and when police found him. “He had quite a few years left on him.” In North Carolina, the CDC-funded program has helped enable what health department spokesperson Kelly Haight Connor described in an email as “the substantial growth in climate and health adaptation”. Even so, documents show the climate team ran into roadblocks almost as soon as it tried to evaluate the state’s preparedness for climate change. It was still seeking the agency’s assistance when, in 2015, it completed an analysis showing heat-related mortality would increase over the coming decade. On 22 June that year, Sherion Winfrey, 63, had just returned to work after vacation and had nine days before she was due to retire. For nearly 40 years, she worked at the same oil- and air-filter factory in Fayetteville, North Carolina, a city in the Sandhills. She’d learned to pack frozen water bottles in a cooler to keep herself refreshed on the hot assembly line. But that day, as the temperature outside hit 96F, she collapsed during her shift. Rushed to a hospital, she died early that afternoon. A state inspection of the factory the next day found that heat from industrial ovens and the metal walls and roof of the un-air-conditioned production line raised the indoor heat index – a combined measure of temperature and humidity – to over 106F and into the Occupational Safety and Health department’s “danger” heat classification. The inspector recommended the factory allow employees time to acclimate to the heat after an absence. But the investigation into Winfrey’s death ended after a medical examiner found that Winfrey suffered “a fatal pulmonary embolism and did not die from exposure to extreme temperatures”. Recent research suggests this type of blood clotting may be brought on by daily temperature swings. Danny Muhammad, Winfrey’s son, has no doubt heat contributed to her death. Winfrey complained to family about the factory’s stifling environment. “The heat index was out of this world that day,” Muhammad said. It was the ninth consecutive day that temperatures had reached at least 94F – seven degrees hotter than the June average. Winfrey’s family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in 2017 against the factory, citing extreme indoor temperatures as the cause of her death, but the case was later dismissed. A spokesperson for the factory declined to comment. It took another three years after Winfrey’s death for the North Carolina program’s heat education efforts to begin in four Sandhills counties – and not where she had lived. In the years since the Trump administration took over, the political pressure hampering some of the CDC climate program’s grantees has also been applied to the program itself. Former and current staff said senior agency officials, aware of Trump’s denials of climate science, have tried to keep the program operating under the radar. Self-censorship surfaced quickly after the 2016 election, even before Trump assumed office. In December of that year, the CDC environmental health director, Patrick Breysse, indefinitely postponed a first-ever climate symposium that was scheduled for after the inauguration. George Luber, then the CDC’s climate chief, remembers his superiors warning the event would be poorly timed; Breysse said the postponement was for budgetary reasons. The environmental health chief acknowledges that his staff debated whether to use the term “climate change”. He later combined the climate and asthma programs and, internal documents suggest, omitted the word “climate” from the new branch’s title. Breysse insists the White House never directed his actions. But they served as the basis for a whistleblower complaint filed by Luber, who was removed from his CDC post in 2018. The complaint alleged that Luber was ousted because of his outspokenness on global warming. It stirred a hornet’s nest of public attention, but some program insiders allege his removal had more to do with his mismanagement and mistreatment of employees than his advocacy. The CDC, which refused to comment on “personnel matters”, said its climate program was running better than ever. The agency pointed to the “mini grants” it has doled out through partner organizations to help another 10 health departments, one-time funding of $5,000 to $50,000. Meanwhile, every one of Trump’s budget proposals has tried to eliminate the program. The inaction in Washington contrasts with some local efforts to save lives endangered by the climate crisis. In Phoenix, spurred on by the sustained surge in heat deaths, some groups hand out 250,000 bottles of water annually to the homeless. Others distribute heat awareness magnets and brochures to the elderly. Still others are developing home sensors that will notify friends and family when indoor temperatures climb. Many vulnerable residents fall through the cracks. Arizona medical examiner records of heat deaths are filled with accounts of ageing and isolated people who hadn’t been heard from for days before a wellness check was requested. Among them were Larry and Kathleen Purchase, 69 and 68 respectively, who died from environmental heat exposure in their Phoenix home during an unusual string of triple-digit days in September 2018. Married for almost 50 years, the two were active in their community and ran a small computer repair service, said Larry’s brother, Terry. When their 1970s rooftop air conditioner broke, they didn’t have the several hundred dollars to fix it. Terry remembers them as “good stewards of the environment”, a tenet of their Christian faith. They didn’t believe in human-caused climate change, he said. The day they were found, the temperature in their home hovered around 100F.

It’s been said, in relation to President Trump, that sometimes you need a bully on your side against an even bigger bully. The same can be said for assholes. Mark Steyn once said, “You can’t out-asshole Donald Trump”, but Jeremy Clarkson would give him a run for his money. And that’s why we love him.



In a world of PC capons, Clarkson is exactly the kind of blunt-spoken asshole we need in the fight against the self-righteous assholes of the left.



Former “Top Gear” host Jeremy Clarkson in a Friday column called teen climate activist Greta Thunberg a “spoilt brat” and blamed her supporters and parents for encouraging her behavior. 



Thunberg is one of the most privileged humans to ever walk the earth. Like most of her generation, she lives in the sort of coddled luxury that would make the Sun King gasp with envy – and all she can do is scowl and screech at my generation and the generation before – which would be the generation who saved the world from Nazism. **How dare she?**



Clarkson suggested Thunberg remember that she owes a debt to adults, starting with those who sponsored her much-hyped trans-Atlantic voyage last month.



“How dare we? No,” he said. “How dare you sail to America on a carbon fibre yacht that you didn’t build which cost £15million, that you didn’t earn, and which has a back-up diesel engine that you didn’t mention.”



Clarkson went on to point out that adults also gave Thunberg and her generation countless scientific and cultural innovations, from headache medicine to movies to fighter jets to iPhones.



“Pause for a moment to consider how soundly you sleep at night, knowing that adults are building and servicing and flying Sweden’s fighter planes. To keep you safe,” he said. “We gave you mobile phones and laptops and the internet. We created the social media you use every day and we run the banks that pay for it all.”



Clarkson added: “So how dare you stand there and lecture us, you spoilt brat.”



Clarkson also rightly pointed out that the fault lies with the parents and unscrupulous activists who have enabled this brat’s ignorant temper-tantrums.



Clarkson agreed with Thunberg that “the world is heating up” and something should be done to prevent climate change from fueling an “unimaginable refugee crisis.”



However, he said that “science is what will solve the problem eventually. Not scowling and having screaming ab-dabs every five minutes.”



“So be a good girl, shut up and let them get on with it,” he concluded. “And no. You cannot stay out past ten. And you cannot go out in a skirt that short.”



Naturally, the unprincipled left are hypocritically cowering behind their infant human shield.



The column by Clarkson, who has long courted controversy, provoked indignation by Thunberg’s many supporters.



However…in an essay published Saturday, National Review editor Rich Lowry argued that Thunberg is a “pawn being used by adults for their own interests.”



“Kids are powerful pawns,” he said. “The catchphrase ‘for the children’ has a seductive political appeal, while kids offer their adult supporters a handy two-step. The same people who say, ‘The world must heed this 16-year-old girl’ will turn around and say to anyone who pushes back, ‘How dare you criticize a 16-year-old girl?’”

"If you come across a young cuckoo this summer, you’ll be witness to one of the most bizarre sights in nature. Cuckoo chicks are interlopers in the nests of other species, and can be seen being frantically fed by their unwitting foster parent, despite often being clearly many times larger than their hosts. It makes you wonder: why on earth does this bird expend so much energy raising such clearly unrelated offspring? The clue comes from thinking about this puzzle in terms of costs and benefits. Raising a cuckoo chick often occurs at the expense of host chicks. Common cuckoo chicks, for example, famously remove any host eggs or young from the nest within days of hatching. Chicks of a few other cuckoo species however will grow up alongside their host’s own offspring. Yet they still remove competition – magpie host chicks often die of starvation because, for example, great spotted cuckoo chicks beg to be fed more intensely.  But parasitism may not always be costly. Great spotted cuckoos are also parasitical on carrion crows, but as crow chicks are much larger than cuckoos they are never out-competed and crow parents always manage to raise a few young of their own. For magpies, parasitism by cuckoos is costly, for crows it is less so. So while magpies drive cuckoos away from their nest, or recognise foreign eggs and remove them, crows do not. But surely, even when costs are low, there is an evolutionary advantage to avoiding raising someone else’s chick. In the late 18th century the German ornithologist Johann Bechstein presented a different idea. Instead of hosts being taken advantage of, he proposed that they were “beside themselves for joy” at the opportunity to raise a cuckoo chick. It was “an honour” to care for it. Modern biologists pooh-pooh this notion, because self-interest, not generosity, is the currency of evolution by natural selection.  However, the results of a 16-year study published in the journal Science suggests he might have been on to something. By looking at the relationship between these species differently, the study, led by Daniela Canestrari, reveals that crows do not defend themselves because they actually benefit from having a cuckoo in the nest. Combining data collected over 16 years with careful field experiments, the study shows that nests containing cuckoos produce more crow chicks than those without. Better yet, the authors show how this entirely counter-intuitive conclusion is reached. When disturbed, great spotted cuckoo chicks emit copious amounts of a sticky, smelly substance. The authors tested the novel hypothesis that this stinky substance deters predators from the nest. If cats and hawks were given tasty pieces of chicken meat, but smeared with the cuckoo’s excretion, these typical nest predators were repelled. This indicates that the cuckoo’s excretion is a very powerful defence mechanism, likely to save both cuckoo and crow chicks alike if a predator comes calling. So although crows appear to be behaving generously towards cuckoos, they are in fact still selfish – they tolerate cuckoos because of the benefit they provide their own young. But do crows “welcome” cuckoos, as Bechstein suggested?  It’s probably a little more complicated than this. Crows nest communally – their bushy nests often visible by the score in the bare branches of trees – and a previous study at this same field site showed that larger groups of crows’ nests are less likely to be parasitised by cuckoos. If raising a cuckoo is so beneficial to the survival of crow chicks, we’d expect the opposite. Perhaps having other crows to help raise chicks also helps to deter predators – the benefit of the cuckoo excretions no longer outweighs their cost. Of those cuckoo species that do not evict their nest-mates, many also emit similar smelly fluids. So this study shows that it might be time to revisit our conclusions as to why their hosts have not evolved defences also. In areas where there are many predators, even the smallest advantage conferred by a cuckoo chick may be sufficient to obstruct the natural evolution of defences in the host species. In the past when we have discovered brood parasite hosts with no apparent defences towards parasitism, we have come to a different conclusion.  Perhaps these hosts will evolve defences, but there has not yet been sufficient evolutionary time to do so – the hosts are lagging behind. While plausible, such explanations are rarely satisfying as they are almost impossible to test or falsify. Daniela Canestrari and her colleagues however, have now done just this. Although smelly, theirs is a much more satisfying explanation."

Eli Rabett in his lair, er, lab
People send me stuff.
Here at WUWT, we all tend to laugh at Dr. Joshua Halpern who fancies himself as a rabbit and writes in tongues third person as ‘Eli Rabett‘ about the evils of global warming to show everyone how smart he is, while twitching his nose at everyone else. He’s one of the more colorful characters of the warmist side of the debate who pretty much personifies that clique, though has strong competition from SUNY’s Scott “super” Mandia when it comes to being the most ridiculous of college scientists. Seeing how these folks tend to self-parody, I see that as license to poke a little fun at them. After all, he endorses this as a valid tactic with the “Eli Rabett approach on climate communication with deniers,”.
This episode of government stupidity about needing a rabbit license for a magic show, followed by a “disaster plan” for severe weather that may harm the rabbit, made me think of him, because what else could pop into your mind when you think of such things? Now with extreme weather aka #poisonedweather™ making bigger weather disasters every minute, we all need a disaster plan for props pets. Right?
I’m going to get right to work on one for the most prestigious member of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
I get word that David Burge (Iowahawk) writes on Facebook about a magician that is required to have a “disaster plan” for his rabbit, no this isn’t a joke.
I swear I am not making this up. In the annals of government stupidity, this story may very well be the Mount Everest. Bob McCarty Writes:

My USDA rabbit license requirement has taken another ridiculous twist. I just received an 8 page letter from the USDA, telling me that by July 29 I need to have in place a written disaster plan, detailing all the steps I would take to help get my rabbit through a disaster, such as a tornado, fire, flood, etc. They not only want to know how I will protect my rabbit during a disaster, but also what I will do after the disaster, to make sure my rabbit gets cared for properly.  I am not kidding–before the end of July I need to have this written rabbit disaster plan in place, or I am breaking the law.
Source: http://bobmccarty.com/2013/06/28/usda-tells-magician-to-write-disaster-plan-for-his-rabbit/
It gets even weirder, from the start of the episode with the USDA:
Finally, it was time for the  inspection at the Hahne’s home. Marty decided to ask some questions.
“My friend has a snake,” he said. The inspector quickly told him they don’t regulate snakes.
“No,” Marty said, “I mean he feeds his snake rabbits. He breaks their necks and drops them in the cage for the snake’s food. Does he have to have a permit for that?” Again, she told him there’s no regulation for that.
“So I could break my rabbit’s neck and feed him to my friend’s snake and I wouldn’t need a license?” Marty asked.
“Correct,” she said, “But you need a license to use him in your magic show.”
The obvious question (besides the snake food licensing one) is: does Howard University need a license to keep ‘Eli Rabett’ around for entertainment purposes and does Howard University have a disaster plan to keep Eli Rabett safe in case the university is flooded by accelerating sea level rise or flattened by an errant derecho? Inquiring minds want to know.

 **Devonport-Takapuna Local Board**  




 **RATINGS GUIDE:**



 **$** to **$$$$$** with **$** being a leftist trougher and **$$$$$** being small government dynamo



For some, however, a clown is more appropriate. More than one may be awarded.



It’s quite incredible to watch the percentage of votes being returned compared to previous elections. This article will be published a couple of days after writing but 2019 is currently 40% lower than the record low turnout of 2016. 



I lived in this local board area for about 5 years up until the end of last year. While I have now returned to the Orakei ward, I still work on the Shore in Hauraki and breathe a sigh of relief that my journey stops at the entrance to the much maligned Lake Rd.



There are 18 candidates contesting 6 positions. You may cast up to 6 votes in this FPP contest.  




[ **Aidan Bennett**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=5f0630e5-5274-4716-a0e5-e88c2e27f0c7&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– A Fresh Approach **$$$$$**



A Fresh Approach is a new ticket running three candidates who didn’t contest 2016. If any new candidate knows the issues in this local board area, I’d bet money Aidan does. His printing company Benefitz employs 80 people and he also publishes Channel Magazine – a monthly local. If you’re getting into politics, what better tool than your own magazine?



Bennett says he is standing because he believes the performance of the local board is declining and there are incumbents who have been there far too long. Bennett is very future focused in terms of embracing and preparing for further intensification, driving electric cars, bikes and scooters. Instead of fighting change, he wants to adapt accordingly.



Bennett has invested in the area, not just as a business owner but also in the community, receiving a QSM in 2018. He has held various roles in the North Harbour Club Charitable Trust over a 14 year period and also as a trustee of Takapuna Beach Playground Charitable Trust getting – you guessed it – the playground on that beach constructed.



He hasn’t mentioned the controversial carpark issue but he mentions creating a vibrant town centre so you can probably join the dots for his position on that.



[ **Mary-Anne Benson-Cooper**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=ed389e5e-258a-45ef-bedf-6030ba4b68c6&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board) – Independent ****



I first encountered Mary-Anne while rating the Upper Harbour contest. She is standing for three different local boards and if she is elected to more than one, Devonport-Takapuna isn’t her first priority. Considering she finished in 14th place for this local board in 2016, she clearly isn’t your top priority either.



She says if she is elected, she would find solutions for Lake Rd. I guess she doesn’t have any yet. She also says she will keep rates low which reinforces my suspicion she really has no idea what she’s talking about.



[ **Kevin Brett**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=20c18cc5-8a08-4ed3-9e2a-5c7eb1ac88c1&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– The Trump New Zealand Party



When I stumbled across the Trump NZ Party several weeks ago I was immediately intrigued and had a look at their website[ trump.org.nz](http://www.trump.org.nz/) It is a hideous site/sight to behold. Messy, cheap, overflowing with capital letters and exclamation marks. I emailed them to find out more and found out nothing as there was no response.



You don’t really need me to tell you how silly this group is. Brett’s poorly written candidate profile is all the red flags you need:



 _Workers including professionals from all over the CPTPP Nations are going to pour into NZ to take your Jobs they will work for less than you._



This is just nonsense. Your job is the one you currently have, not fantasy positions you might like to do one day. What a knob.



[ **Gavin Busch**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=bd308169-24cf-46c3-9b83-55c1bee44be5&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Team George Wood **$$$$**



Team George Wood was formed in the 2016 elections and it is the first example of a personally named local board ticket I’ve ever seen. They took 3 of the 6 seats. Busch stood last time but wasn’t successful.



Busch lives and works in the area and has degrees in Finance and Economics. Those certainly wouldn’t go to waste if he represents you on the local board. 



Gavin doesn’t consider himself a natural politician (another plus) but is standing because he blames the lack of support from Council on having a board which has been dysfunctional compared to others which do enjoy Council support. While he claims that has improved with the election of three Team George Wood candidates in 2016, things could still be better.



I personally can see the benefit in electing a board ticket that holds a majority. It’s reasonable to expect you’d see a more efficient board that makes faster progress. Rodney and Manurewa are good examples of this.



Busch has identified groups and facilities that are focused on water sports and safety as a priority for local board funding which is sensible considering much of the area is coastal. He also wants to deliver on the Local Centre plans for Devonport, Takapuna and Milford. He has also been involved with the development of the Narrow Neck Pump Park and is keen to get it started sooner.



[ **Paul Cornish**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=6b2d9ec4-bcc3-4d92-b385-66ba064f4abe&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Keep Our Open Spaces **$$$**



Paul is the sole candidate running on the ‘Keep Our Open Spaces’ ticket, which he describes as a byline, reinforcing my suspicion about the general validity of local body affiliation practices.



Obviously Cornish is focused firstly on preserving open spaces and acting as a watchdog to protect jeopardised public space. At least he accepts the need to move on from the battle over the Takapuna car park and instigate a new town square.



He has led a campaign to “erode the dominance of the sole Lake Rd petrol outlet” and support the establishment of a rival outlet. I had never heard of this campaign but upon taking a closer look it would appear Devonport has been serviced by a solitary BP at the top of Lake Rd since 2010. Gull actually commenced plans for an unmanned petrol station on Vauxhall Road min 2018 but that is being objected to by bloody heritage NIMBYs from [Devonport Heritage Inc](http://www.devonportheritage.net/aboutus). I recall the group was bankrupted in 2016 after losing an Environment Court battle to interfere in the business of the owners of the Masonic Hotel. Unfortunately a new group was formed within a year. Cornish wants to conserve heritage buildings so I’m unsure how serious he is about his petrol campaign.



Paul has put a lot of energy into reviving two squash clubs and the Victoria Theatre in Devonport. I immediately started searching his profile for hints of a desire to pump your money into the theatre, of which I found none.



[ **Trish Deans**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=5a6174a2-4a9a-49ab-9cc9-0b9c6f82bdb6&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Heart of the Shore **$**



Trish is the Chair of Devonport Heritage formed in 2017 and was chair of the original Devonport Heritage which went into liquidation following an unsuccessful attempt to interfere in other people’s business; opposing Redback Develop’s plans to demolish the Masonic Tavern and build apartments.



Auckland Council and North Shore City spent $322,838 defending the resource consent. In 2011, Auckland Council voted to withdraw a claim for $106,500 costs against the trust and other groups also involved. Devonport Heritage was unable to pay a $27,000 bill for court costs resulting from the battle.



Evidently Deans is quite comfortable with sticking her beak where it doesn’t belong, running up six-figure bills in the process, walking away without paying the bill then building a clone organisation to do the same to others.

Donald thinks the board needs to get real input from the entire community to ensure it is trying to achieve what the community wants. He would establish more reference groups similar to the last Greater Takapuna Reference Group in Sunnynook, Devonport and Milford.



From what I’ve gathered researching the North Shore race, the slow progress being made by Council is not due to a lack of consultation but rather too much. Council funding for irrigation and lighting work at the Allen Hill Reserve, the Lake Pupuke walkways and the cycleway and walkway at Plymouth Reserve had been allocated. Some members of the board who aren’t standing for re-election insisted upon resource consents being opened up to full public notification. This adds 12 months to the process and Council won’t hold those funds if there is not an expectation of them being used within the year.

Heart of the Shore, in my estimation, is the far-left ticket for DT Local Board. Jackson has been fighting the closure of the Anzac Street car park in Takapuna. In March 2018 Auckland Council voted to sell the land and develop a new Town Square and park, plus apartments and retail with new parking very nearby. Unfortunately, on June 22, the genuinely insane [Miriam Clements ](https://www.facebook.com/www.logic.org.nz/videos/vb.187401794783973/2179873922283699/?type=2&theater)successfully convinced the High Court to put a temporary block on the sale pending a judicial review in August 13.



It’s a long, messy, confusing tale to follow but it appears the project was back on track following the judicial review. Move forward another 12 months and it appears that Takapuna Residents Association has just lodged an appeal with the High Court asking for a review of “serious flaws” during the Auckland Council’s approval for the regeneration of the Anzac Street car park. Iain Rea is the spokesman for the group and also a Heart of the Shore candidate for Local Board, so I’ll continue this under his candidate rating…



Ruth Jackson says in her candidate profile (with my comments in brackets) that she is committed to:



Then continues with the standard mentions of clean waterways, beaches etc. She will be obstructive, irritating and cost Takapuna millions of dollars in Auckland Council investment while she attempts to hamstrung any progress on the local board.

McKenzie was elected to local board in 2016 and at 31 years old, brings a younger perspective. That’s borderline ‘youth voice identity politics’ nonsense which most candidates under 30 sink their campaigns by using. Borderline.



Living and working in the area, she also works as a Brand Manager which is a bit vague and previously has been President of Takapuna Rotary and a Girl Guide leader in Hauraki.



There’s no beating around the bush in communicating her priorities for her second term; environmental issues including water quality on beaches at the Wairau Estuary, improving play spaces and improving accessibility to facilities, especially those who are not able-bodied.



Glad to see she has also highlighted the importance of doing this in a fiscally prudent manner.

Writing a voting guide can be awkward at times as I know several of the candidates personally. It’s always been a pleasure talking politics with Jan. I had also worked with her late husband Mike on various political projects many years ago.



Alas, Jan’s viewpoints couldn’t be any more different from mine and we are diametrically opposed on the big Anzac Street car park stoush, but I wish her well for the campaign. 



[**Iain Rea**](https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/elections/information-for-voters/Pages/candidate-details.aspx?candidateId=e6f8bf89-9716-41d9-b425-9350f778205d&srchtype=Board&areavalue=Devonport-Takapuna%20Local%20Board)– Heart of the Shore **$**



Iain Rea is the latest person to throw yet another spanner in the works of the decade long battle over Anzac Street car park. He gives his reason for appealing to the High Court to determine whether two competing proposals for a town square accurately presented to councillors and was the public consultation, cited to support those proposals, proper and fair.



Rea says “Council should work better!” If he genuinely believed that, he wouldn’t be seeking your vote.



Rea is also chair of Devonport Peninsula Precincts Society who appealed to the Environment Court in February 2017 to object to the design of a proposed Ryman Healthcare 600 bed, six storey retirement complex in Devonport. Rea was also assisted by nosey-parker neighbour group Urban Auckland and the NZ Institute of Architects in the ensuing mediation process. The 5 week mediation process cost DPPS $50,000 but I’m unable to determine the cost to Ryman Healthcare from the delay. It resulted in Ryman changing its plans to four and five storey blocks and reduced unit numbers.



Notorious obstructive NIMBY Tricia Deans, Heart of the Shore candidate also ensured her unwelcome opinions were heard. Nothing was mentioned about the hundreds of thousands of dollars her activities had cost ratepayers in earlier NIMBY battles.

I thought I recognised the name. Revell is a previous National MP. He is very enthusiastic about achieving the goals Team George Wood has set for the next three years, such as the overdue improvements to Lake Rd, finally getting the Takapuna town square upgrades underway, the Milford Takapuna walkway, Wairau Estuary boardwalk and dealing with the water quality issues at Castor Bay, Milford and Takapuna beaches.



Revell is especially keen to get the Castor Bay public facilities completed as well as urgent geotech stability work on the Castor Bay Cliff. I don’t share his enthusiasm for undergrounding “ugly power poles” because there are far better ways to spend ratepayer money.



The 2019 elections need to return a board with a majority grouping that shares the same aspirations for the area, avoiding the delays, obfuscations and deadlock that has characterised the previous three years.

Scanlan is opposed to the CPTPP Labour signed following the US withdrawal from the TPPA. It’s completely irrelevant to a local board contest. In her experience “bullying, racial discrimination, emotional blackmail, public humiliation are all used in the corporate sector against women.”



The Trump New Zealand Party Policies are designed to preserve the existing culture and heritage. She also wonders why we don’t talk much about the ongoing issues in the Amazon Basin which she believes plays a critical role in stabilising the global climate. She is a vegan who enjoys going to plant based cafes with others from her gym after yoga.

Michael has been on the local board for George Team Wood and also served on Takapuna Community Board pre-super city.



His focus for the next term is to fix Lake Road, ferry terminal for Bayswater, improve water quality from the Wairau creek and our beaches. Support the Wairau Creek boardwalk, local business, and local clubs. A floodlit basketball court for Sunnynook, and improvements to Allen Hill Stadium.



He believes the Shore is getting short-changed by Auckland Council and will pressure them to forward the outcomes of the Sunnynook and Belmont plans.

Toni currently works as the Devonport Business Improvement District Manager and has been involved in leading roles on the Devonport Arts Festival Trust. She is also a founding member of the Devonport Zero Waste Committee and very enthusiastic about improving the local environment through sustainable practices.



Her employed and voluntary activities mean she should be well aware of how local boards and the Council works so she is a step ahead of most first-time candidates.



Her professional role means meeting with numerous community groups and volunteers who happily dedicate their free time to activities that improve the neighbourhood, such as weeding reserves, cleaning beaches and organising parades. She can see the importance in engaging with and mobilising that energy from a seat on the local board.



Like other A Fresh Approach candidates, she wants to prepare for a new town centre and the challenges that will come with the inevitable intensification of the area.

Watson will be well known to many as a former talkback host on Newstalk ZB and I’m just old enough to vaguely remember him on What Now! He lives in Bayswater running a karate and arts school with his wife.



He’s interested in big plans to deal with transport problems and says we need to be bold and start digging the tunnel from Epsom to Albany and Waterview to the Shore. That certainly is bold.

George Wood is a very familiar face, having been Mayor of North Shore City for nine years, North Shore Councillor for six and the Chair of Devonport-Takapuna for the last three. He’s experienced, knowledgeable and driven to complete the major projects coming up in the region.



In 2015, Devonport-Takapuna lost the $54 million budget for Lake Rd, but three years later, George and his team got $47 million replaced in the budget for the urgent upgrades needed to fix the daily traffic snarls. Also to come are improvements on Esmonde Rd and finishing the cycleway linkage between Francis Street and Esmonde Rd.



Milford Mariners are currently spending $1.1 million without Council assistance dealing with the pollution issues caused by sediment flowing down the Wairau Creek into Milford Estuary from Thomas Park. The current leaseholders, Takapuna Golf Club, have 6 years to run on their current agreement.



George’s experience at all levels of local body make him well qualified to embark on essential improvements to storm water systems and with a new targeted rate in place, he will be lobbying strongly for improvements to the water coming down Milford Estuary onto Milford and Castor Bay beaches.



The other big project on the cards is Unlock Takapuna which will include the replacement of Anzac Street car park with a new town centre, and increased car parks nearby plus the upgrade of Hurstmere Road.



In my view, to continue the momentum on these plans, it is essential that George and the other Team George Wood candidates are elected.

I thought Wood’s background as an employer and employment mediator would be welcome on the Local Board. However, he thinks Auckland Council needs to reduce carbon emissions by 50% over the next decade. He is prepared to have the challenging conversations needed to bring about change.



Talking to yourself is only insane if you get a reply.

"SUNDARBANS NATIONAL PARK, Bangladesh Two hundred years ago, the first cholera pandemic emerged from these   mangrove swamps. It began in 1817, after the British East India Company sent thousands of workers deep into the remote Sundarbans, part of the Ganges River Delta, to log the jungles and plant rice. These brackish waters are the cradle of Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that clings to human intestines and emits a toxin so virulent that the body will pour all of its fluids into the gut to flush it out. Water loss turns victims ashen their eyes sink into their sockets, and their blood turns black and congeals in their capillaries. Robbed of electrolytes, their hearts lose their beat. Victims die of shock and organ failure, sometimes in as little as six hours after the first abdominal rumblings. Cholera probably had festered here for eons. Since that first escape, it has circled the world in seven pandemic cycles that have killed tens of millions. Artists of the 19th century often depicted it as a skeleton with a scythe and victims heaped at its feet. It stalked revelers at a masked ball in Heinrich Heine’s “Cholera in Paris” and kills the protagonist in Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice. ” Outbreaks forced London, New York and other cities to create vast public water systems, transforming civic life. Today cholera garners panicky headlines when it strikes unexpectedly in places like Ethiopia or Haiti. But it is a continuing threat in nearly 70 countries, where more than one billion people are at risk. Now, thanks largely to efforts that began in cholera’s birthplace, a way to finally conquer the   plague is in sight. A treatment protocol so effective that it saves 99. 9 percent of all victims was pioneered here. The World Health Organization estimates that it has saved about 50 million lives in the past four decades. Just as important, after 35 years of work, researchers in Bangladesh and elsewhere have developed an effective cholera vaccine. It has been accepted by the W. H. O. and stockpiled for epidemics like the one that struck Haiti in 2010. Soon, there may be enough to begin routine vaccination in countries where the disease has a permanent foothold. Merely creating that stockpile  —   even of a few million doses  —   profoundly improved the way the world fought cholera, Dr. Margaret Chan, secretary general of the W. H. O. said last year. Ready access to the vaccine has made countries less tempted to cover up outbreaks to protect tourism, she said. That has sped up emergency responses and attracted more vaccine makers, lowering costs. “More cholera vaccines have been deployed over the last two years than in the previous 15 years combined,” Dr. Chan said. The treatment advances relied heavily on research and testing done at the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, known as the ICDDR, B, in Dhaka. Although Dhaka may not be the first place one might look to find a public health revolution, the center is famous among experts in gut diseases. While its upper levels are quiet and scholarly, the center’s ground floor is the world’s largest diarrhea hospital. Its vast wards treat 220, 000 patients a year, almost all of whom recover within 36 hours. Doctors there save hundreds of lives a day. The ICDDR, B was originally the Cholera Research Laboratory, founded in 1960 by the United States as part of that era’s “soft diplomacy. ” Research hospitals were built in friendly countries both to save lives locally and to act as sentinels for diseases that might threaten America. The wards, which in the rainy season extend into   tents in the parking lot, contain long rows of “cholera cots. ” On each iron or wood frame is a plastic sheet with a hole in the middle. A bucket beneath the hole catches diarrhea, while another beside the cot fills with vomit. An IV pole completes the setup. Defying expectations, the ward smells only of the antiseptic that the floors are constantly mopped with. Patients with severe watery diarrhea arrive around the clock, many of them carried in  —   limp, dehydrated and barely conscious  —   by friends or family. A nurse sees each one immediately, and those close to death get an IV line inserted within 30 seconds. It contains a blend of glucose, electrolytes and water. Cholera spurs the intestines to violently flush themselves, but it does not actually damage the gut cells. If the fluid is replaced and the bacteria flushed out or killed by antibiotics, the patient is usually fine. Within hours, patients start to revive. As soon as they can swallow, they get an antibiotic and start drinking a rehydration solution. Most walk out within a day. The techniques perfected here are so effective that the ICDDR, B has sent training teams to 17 cholera outbreaks in the past decade. Usually, the only patients who stay long in the hospital are infants so malnourished that another bout of diarrhea would kill them. They live for up to a month in a separate ward with their mothers, who are taught how to cook nutritious porridges from the cheapest lentils, squash, onions, greens and oil. Only about 20 percent of the patients at the center have cholera. The rest usually have rotavirus, salmonella or E. coli. The same therapy saves them all, but the cholera cases are more urgent because these patients plummet so precipitously toward death. “I thought I was dying,” Mohammed Mubarak, a gaunt    printing press worker, said one afternoon from his cot. His roommates had carried him in at 7 that morning, unconscious and with no detectable pulse. Now, after six liters of intravenous solution, he was still weak but able to sit up and drink the rehydration solution and eat bits of bread and banana. “His stool is changing from   to green, so he is recovering,” said Momtaz Begum, the ward nurse who monitors the buckets and makes sure patients take in as much liquid as they lose. Mr. Mubarak had first fallen ill at about 2 a. m. a few hours after he drank tap water with his dinner. “Usually I drink safe water, filtered water,” he explained. “But I drank the city water last night. I think that is what did this. ” Cholera, born in the swamps, arrived long ago in Dhaka. The city is home to more that 15 million, and a third of the population lives in slums. In some places, water pipes made of rubbery plastic are pierced by illegal connections that suck in sewage from the gutters they traverse and carry pathogens down the line to new victims, like Mr. Mubarak. Vibrio cholerae travels from person to person via fecal matter. In 1854, the epidemiologist John Snow famously traced cases to a single well dug near a cesspit in which a mother had washed the diaper of a baby who died of cholera and nd convinced officials to remove the well’s pump handle. Because cholera is a constant threat to hundreds of millions of people lacking safe drinking water in China, India, Nigeria and many other countries, scientists have long sought a more powerful weapon: a cheap, effective vaccine. Now they have one. Injected cholera vaccines were first invented in the 1800s and were long required for entry into some countries. But many scientists suspected they did not work, and in the 1970s studies overseen by the ICDDR, B confirmed that. In the 1980s, a Swedish scientist, Dr. Jan Holmgren, invented an oral vaccine that worked an impressive 85 percent of the time. But it was expensive to make and had to be drunk with a large glass of buffer solution to protect it from stomach acid. Transporting tanks of buffer was impractical. Making matters worse, it was fizzy, and poor Bangladeshi children who had never tasted soft drinks would spit it out as soon as it tickled their noses. In 1986, a Vietnamese scientist, Dr. Dang Duc Trach, asked for the formula, believing he could make a bufferless version. Dr. Holmgren and Dr. John D. Clemens, an American vaccine expert who at the time was a research scientist for the ICDDR, B, obliged. “This isn’t an elegant vaccine  —   it’s just a bunch of killed cells, technology that’s been around since Louis Pasteur,” said Dr. Clemens, who is now the ICDDR, B’s executive director. He and Dr. Holmgren lost touch with Dr. Dang, largely because of Vietnam’s isolation in those days. But seven years later, Dr. Dang notified them that he had made a new version of the vaccine. He had tested it on 70, 000 residents of Hue, in central Vietnam, and had found it to be 60 percent effective. Although his was not as effective as Dr. Holmgren’s, it cost only 25 cents a dose. If enough people in an area can be made immune through vaccination, outbreaks often stop spontaneously. In 1997, Vietnam became the first  —   and thus far, only  —   country to provide cholera vaccine to its citizens routinely, not just in emergencies. Cases dropped sharply, according to a 2014 study, and in 2003 cholera vanished from Hue, where the campaign focused most heavily. But Dr. Dang had not conducted a classic clinical trial, and Vietnam’s vaccine factory did not meet W. H. O. standards, so no United Nations agency was allowed to buy his vaccine. Because no pharmaceutical company had an incentive to pay for trials or factories, his invention languished in “the valley of death”  —   the expensive gap between a product that works in a lab and a   version safe for millions. In 1999, Dr. Clemens approached what is now the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, which was just getting organized. “They were literally operating out of a basement then,” he said. “I got a letter from Bill Gates Sr. It was very relaxed, sort of, ‘Here’s $40 million. Would you mind sending me a report once in a while?’ “But without that,” Dr. Clemens continued, “this wouldn’t have seen the light of day. ” With that money, Dr. Clemens reformulated Dr. Dang’s vaccine, conducted a successful clinical trial in Calcutta and found an Indian company, Shantha Biotechnics, that could make it to W. H. O. standards. Rolled out in 2009 under the name Shanchol, it came in a vial about the size of a chess rook, needed no buffer and cost less than $2 a dose. Even so, there was little interest, even from the W. H. O. The vaccine lacked the publicity campaign that pharmaceutical companies throw behind commercial products, and “cholera ward care” was saving many lives  —   when it could be organized. The new vaccine was not used in a cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe in 2009, or initially in Haiti’s explosive outbreak in 2010. The “valley of death” lengthened: Without customers, Shantha could not afford to build a bigger factory. The impasse was broken only when Dr. Paul Farmer, a founder of Partners in Health, which has worked in central Haiti since 1987, began publicly berating the W. H. O. for not moving faster. The agency approved Shanchol in 2011, and since then, the vaccine has slowly gained acceptance. In 2013, an emergency stockpile was started, and the GAVI Alliance committed $115 million to raise it to six million doses. The vaccine is now used in Haiti, and has been deployed in outbreaks in Iraq, South Sudan and elsewhere. A second version, Euvichol, from South Korea, was approved in 2015. And later this year, Bangladesh  —   where it all began  —   hopes to begin wiping out its persistent cholera. A local company has begun making a domestic version of the vaccine, called Vaxchol. Dr. Firdausi Qadri, a leading ICDDR, B researcher, estimated last year that success there would require almost 200 million doses. The world finally has a vaccine that, with routine administration, could end one of history’s great scourges. But what will happen is still hazy. With 1. 4 billion people at risk, the potential cost of vaccination in   countries is enormous. And the disease tends to move, surging and vanishing among the many causes of diarrhea. Even Bill Gates, who paid for much of the research, has asked: “We actually have a cholera vaccine, but where should it be used?” Looking back on his long struggle to prove the vaccine’s value, and then to win acceptance, Dr. Clemens offered an explanation that blended wistfulness and cynicism. “We’re probably not bad scientists,” he said, “but we were lousy advocates. “If this disease had been in American kids, there would have been trials as fast as the Salk polio vaccine. ”"
"Rewilding is considered one of the crazier ideas in contemporary conservation. The idea of resurrecting woolly mammoths and setting them loose in Siberia and the American Great Plains or lions roaming through central Europe is pretty mad. Mostly though, rewilding is much less barmy to the point of being conventional.  Rewilding projects tend to have some features in common that distinguish them from your typical conservation programme. These include, reintroducing a species (such as elephants) or introducing a proxy species (such as elephants in the place of extinct woolly mammoths). They also often seek to restore the ecology of the location (such as by creating a new habitat type or by improving the existing one) and tend to have a significant social impact as a result of the species reintroduction and habitat restoration. To a large degree, we already know how to do habitat restoration and species reintroductions. The interesting challenge and innovative potential of rewilding comes from combining these three elements of restoring and reintroducing a species, and closely interacting with society in the process. There are many approaches to rewilding, each drawing on the regional problems and conservation specialities of different places. In Europe, megaherbivores such as deer, horses and bison have commonly been used to create and maintain certain habitats in abandoned or reclaimed land. In the US, rewilding has focused on reintroducing threatened and iconic species such as wolves. Rewilding commonly uses species that play into cultural legacies and landscapes of the region. Interestingly, there has been almost no discussion to date of what rewilding would look like in the global South. We tend to think that the South still has plenty of primary forest and pristine wilderness, constituting conservation priorities: why “re-” wild when it is already “genuinely” wild? In many cases, of course, these “pristine” habitats formed relatively recently after human activity or natural disasters.  It is also not the case that all conservation priority areas in developing countries are being well conserved under current approaches. Places that are not scenic or that host human activity are less likely to be designated as parks and reserves. For example the semi-arid caatinga forest in northern Brazil is highly threatened, but little effort is made to protect it.  This is also the case with the espinal savanna in central Chile. The three-pronged approach of rewilding can provide an innovative method of conservation in some of these overlooked habitats of the Southern Hemisphere.  In collaboration with researchers at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and the Universidad de Chile, I am working on one of the first rewilding projects in South America. We started with the question of how to better manage and adequately conserve the espinal, a common savanna of central Chile.   The Chilean Espinal is dominated by a South American acacia called “espino” (“thorn tree”) and is traditionally used to pasture sheep, goats and cattle. Chileans think of the espinal as lacking wildlife and other natural values, often describing it as “empty.” However, from a biological point of view, central Chile is a hotspot of unique native species, and the only mediterranean-type habitat in South America. If well-managed, espinals can have abundant biodiversity of flowers, birds, small mammals and other species. Being semi-arid, it is important that shade from trees is maximised to improve productivity. We know that the espino is stimulated to grow more when it is pruned, which creates more shade.  This trait, called compensatory growth, is likely to be an adaptation to it having been pruned (eaten) by a megaherbivore in the past – one that is no longer present in espinal. We think that this missing species is the guanaco. Guanacos are a relative of llamas and were hunted out of central Chile 500 years ago. Our project will return them from Southern Chile to espinal to study their foraging on the trees, how the trees grow in response and how the ecosystem responds.  Restoring espinals will have wider effects on the area too. They should increase the productivity of sheep, goat and cattle ranching. Guanaco wool is also a valuable comodity and can be traded internationally under the CITES convention. Plus, our research so far shows that guanacos are well-liked and their presence in espinal landscapes would increase the Chilean public’s appreciation of and interest in visiting espinals to see endemic wildlife. The goal of guanaco rewilding in the espinal is to establish a new conservation strategy in central Chile – where wild animals and sustainable, high-quality agriculture can coexist. We aim to provoke a re-evaluation of the area, by working within local values and preferences. We hope that the guanaco will become the flagship for conservation action in central Chile. And perhaps also the flagship for new visions of rewilding around the world."
"**NHS staff at a Welsh health board faced 61 incidents of violence and aggression in a month, the health board has said.**
Hywel Dda University Health Board, which covers large parts of west Wales, said staff had been abused on hospital wards and in the community.
Community health practitioners were ""confronted, challenged and abused"" for wearing PPE, it added.
Director of nursing Mandy Rayani said staff were feeling ""increasingly upset"" as a result of the abuse.
Staff at Hywel Dda experienced 61 incidents of violence and aggression in September, an average of just over two every day.
The health board provides services to about 384,000 people in Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire, which includes some of the most rural areas of Wales.
It has the lowest number of coronavirus deaths out of any Welsh health board area which contains a general hospital, with 116 since the start of the pandemic, according to Public Health Wales figures.
Powys has a lower figure, but does not count deaths of residents in hospitals outside of the county.
Ms Rayani said: ""Staff who are working very hard to deliver care and treatment are feeling increasingly upset due to verbal abuse, and sometimes threatening and intimidating behaviour by patients and relatives, particularly when being asked to leave a department whilst their relative is being assessed.
""While the majority of the public treat NHS staff with respect, and appreciate the very difficult work they are doing in challenging circumstances, there are sadly a number of people who behave in a way which causes staff to feel at risk.""
She added healthcare workers wearing PPE was now standard practice and did not necessarily mean workers were treating Covid-19 cases."

Antarctic Melt Alarm by the AWI …at -93°C!
By EIKE meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls

On August 10, 2010, a new record cold was measured in Antarctica [1]: -93.2°C. Thus the previous record of -89.2°C set at the Vostok Research Station on 21 July 1983 was smashed by 4°C. The annual mean temperature in Antarctica at ice sheet at elevations of 2000 to over 4000 metres range from -30 to -50°C, and the trend is downward [2]. Now the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) has announced in a press release [3]: “A record retreat in the ice sheets“. Can ice sheets melt at such record low temperatures? Has the AWI discovered some new physical law?
In the AWI release the following amazing thing can be read:

Researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, have for the first time extensively mapped Greenland’s and Antarctica’s ice sheets with the help of the ESA satellite CryoSat-2 and have thus been able to prove that the ice sheets of both regions are momentarily declining at an unprecedented rate.”

These ice sheets mainly located in Greenland and Antarctica and are mostly around 3000 meters thick. On the Greenland ice sheet the annual mean temperatures are about -20°C, and -40°C in Antarctica. Antarctica is a huge polar continent, and Greenland is an island (peninsula) with a latitude range of 10°- 30° from the Pole and borders on the Arctic ocean. This is one explanation for the considerable temperature and climate differences. While Greenland has marginally lost ice during the summer over the last 20 years, the change in ice volume in Antarctica is very much in dispute [4] and hardly measureable with the needed accuracy (Fig. 1).

Figure 1  Trends in ice ice mass [5].
Only a small part of Antarctica has lost mass
Contrary to the claims made by the AWI, there are also satellite evaluations concluding that there has been a positive ice mass gain in Antarctica (Fig. 2):

Figure 2  Antarctic ice growth. [6]
Interesting in the release are the AWI claims about the “somewhat hidden” limitations for Antarctica:

The rate of loss for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has tripled for the same time period“

and

The scientists observed the most rapid elevation changes…at the Pine-Island-Glacier in Western Antarctica.” 

and

But: while the glaciers in Western Antarctica and on the Antarctic peninsula are shrinking, the ice sheet of Eastern Antarctica grew– however at such a minimal amount that the growth was unable to compensate for the loss on the other side of the continent.”

Firstly, here once again the Antarctic Peninsula and Western Antarctica – where the Pine Island Glacier is located – are being used as the poster child for the dramatic ice loss and for climate change. Unfortunately it has long been known that the ice calving and the melting there are related meteorological reasons: cyclic changes in the West-Wind-Drift (storms) and with associated sea currents [7]. The result: Almost the entire Antarctic continent has gotten colder over the past 30 years. The only exception is the Antarctic Peninsula.
West Antarctica and Antarctic Peninsula melt due to cycles
This is because the Antarctic Peninsula in located in the west wind zone of the southern hemisphere. This southern hemisphere wind belt is subject to stochastic cyclic atmospheric pressure variations, as is the case with all other global wind systems. This is analogous to the northern hemispheric North Atlantic Oscillation NAO). In the southern hemisphere it is known as the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO).
At the site “Wetter-Lexikon” (Weather Dictionary) [8] it is defined as:

The Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) is the fluctuation of the atmospheric pressure between the 40° south and 65° south latitudes. That means that this oscillation is defined by atmospheric pressure difference over the South Pole and the South Tropical regions. The strength of the AAO has an impact on the wind regime at the middle and upper latitudes of the southern hemisphere. The AAO influences the climate over a large part of the southern hemisphere, for example Antarctica, Australia, and the southern parts of South America.
The AAO index is computed from the atmospheric pressure differences. When the AAO is negative, then the cold high predominates over Antarctica. The polar east winds blow strongly around the South Pole. …. In the positive phase the west current shifts southwards so that more rain than normal falls in the southern part of South America and in Australia. Moreover mild air can reach down to the Antarctic coast.”

This means the Antarctic Peninsula can be affected!
This peninsula, including the South Shetland Island, is located in the west between 60°-75°S, and thus in the much feared cyclone zone of the Roaring Forties and Shrieking Sixties.

Figure 3: Antarctic Oscillation (AAO). [10]
Before about 1980 there was a dominance of meridional weather patterns, a time when zonal weather patterns predominated. That meant a strengthening of the westwind circulation and thus storm activity. At the same time milder air from the Pacific was led to the Antarctic Peninsula. Thus storms with mild air were led from the Pacific and resulted in ice meting processes. Moreover, higher waves mechanically broke up the ice. Here in recent times was the ice break at the Wilkins Ice Shelf at the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula [9]. The causes are meteorological and have nothing to do with a “climate catastrophe”.
When it comes to climate, the Antarctic Peninsula is only 1% of the Antarctic area.
So where is the accelerated sea level rise?
Despite all the uncertainties mentioned above, the AWI still comes to the following result:

When one calculates both together, the volume of both ice sheets is shrinking by 500 cubic kilometers per year.”

This of course would have to lead to an acceleration in sea level rise which one could observe. However, there has been no detected sea level rise acceleration! A very thorough overview of the latest peer-review publications [11] in fact reaches the opposite result:

Numerous evaluations of coastal tide gauges over 200 years as well as the gravity measurements of the GRACE satellite deliver again and again a sea level rise of about 1.6 mm/yr. … Here…the trends are in agreement: The sea level rise has been linear for at least the last 100 years; there is no acceleration in sea level rise. A signal indicating man-made CO2 (AGW) is nowhere to be seen. This stands in stark contradiction to the claims and especially the alarmist prognoses of the IPCC and some climate institutes.”

Two other facts on ice that were glossed over (avoided?) in the AWI press release:
1. In Antarctica there is a “100-year record” maximum sea ice extent [12]:

The sea ice around Antarctica has steadily increased since satellite measurements began in 1979 and in June, 2014, (peak of the Antarctic winter) reached a new record with respect to total area.”

2. At its current condition, the Arctic sea ice will reach its low late-summer peak in September, and will be well above the minima of the last years:

AWI’s own Antarctic station has measured a cooling trend
Finally, in a release [14], the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) also itself announced a 30-year cooling trend at its Neumayer-Station (70°S). According to the definition of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), this is a climate trend. The AWI wrote:

The meteorological observatory at the Neumayer-Station III is an official climate observation station of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research…has been measuring daily the air temperature in Antarctica for 30 years.”

The AWI published the result in a chart with a linear regression trend (Fig. 5):
        
Figure 5: Temperature cooling trend at the NEUMAYER Station [14].
However the formulation used by the AWI to describe that cooling trend is quite peculiar (deceptive?):

A result of the long-term research: At the Neumayer-Station it has not gotten warmer over the last three decades.”

Indeed not! It has in fact gotten colder there. Why did they use the blurred formulation “not warmer” when the scientific finding on this AWI dataset is clear? Also at the Neumayer-Station there is an Antarctic climate trend showing cooling.
Most of Antarctica is cooling – not warming as the AWI implies
There are even more peculiar AWI formulations:

This development however is a regional change and the measurements from the Neumayer-Station III do not in any way represent the global climate changes.”

Here the question that comes to mind is: What is that supposed to be about?
Who could ever get the idea that a regional or a local temperature trend would allow conclusions to be drawn for global trends? Or should nobody get the idea that global warming” is not even global?
There are also other peculiarities in the AWI release:

Only at the center of Antarctica has it not gotten warmer.”

The Neumayer-Station (with its cooling trend) is located at 70°S, i.e. far away from the “center” of Antarctica. There it has gotten colder. Moreover the measurements and facts presented here and provided in the footnotes below contradict what the AWI is claiming: “Only in the center of Antarctica has it not gotten warmer“.
With the excption of the Antarctic Peninsula (<1% of the Antarctic area) there is a cooling trend in Antarctica and it also includes the surrounding sea ice [15]:

Both the UAH and the RSS datasets [16] show that the temperature surrounding Antarctica has slipped a few tenths of a degree Celsius 0.1°C from 1979 to today. The temperature anomaly in both datasets has dropped below zero, i.e. below the long-term reference mean value.” 

Summary: 
Measurements in Antarctica show a secular cooling trend. The exception is the Antarctic Peninsula and a part of West Antarctica (approx. 1% of the Antarctic area). In 2010 a new all-time record cold was measured: -93.2°C. The sea ice floating around Antarctica reached “100-year record” daily highs in 2014. With these observations, how anyone could conclude there has been a “record ice sheet retreat” [3]  remains a secret of the AWI.

"After unifying the Mongols, Genghis Khan led his army from Northern Mongolia in 1211 to the Caspian Sea in 1224, forging the largest contiguous land empire in history. For centuries, common wisdom held that the Mongols were driven to conquest because of harsh conditions – namely, drought. Our new record, dating back to 900AD with confidence, indicates the opposite.  Published in PNAS, our new tree-ring data suggests that it was consistently wet from 1211 to 1225CE, a period we are calling the Mongol Pluvial. No years during this period were below the long-term average, which is the only run of moisture conditions in our 1,100-year-long record. Independent tree-ring records of the same area also indicate that this period was warm. On the cool semi-arid steppe of Central Asia, water is life and, in those days, water was energy. The Mongol diet is heavily based on the meat of grazing animals. Their mode of transportation was the short, but Pheidippidic, horse. So, for food and for travel, grass was life. Grass was energy.  An abundance of moisture would seem to provide the horsepower for the rapidly growing Mongol Empire. The Mongol soldier typically had five steeds at their disposal. With a large army, that quickly translates into huge herds and a huge need for grass. The tree-ring records we collected suggest that the grasslands of central Mongolia were probably productive during this period of unprecedented moisture and mild temperatures. The tree-ring data strongly agrees with satellite estimates of grassland productivity during the modern period. Going back in time, then, the trees would suggest that during its rapid expansionm the Mongol Empire  was sitting in a sea of grass – a sea of energy – a potential abundance of life. As with many scientific discoveries, our initial finding that Siberian pine trees from the Khorgo lava field in Central Mongolia yielded data that matched the year that Genghis Khan was born, was initially an accidental one. We had collected samples as an aside to another project we were doing (Fire, Climate, and Forest History in Mongolia). When they were finally analysed, it was with great surprise that we learnt of the correlation they showed with Genghis Khan’s empire-building. We had to go back for more samples. Using tree rings from these, we reconstructed a 1,112-year water-balance record. Trees are sedentary creatures, sitting in one spot for centuries unable to move from fire, drought or other ravages of time. Thus, they have to sit there and take what is thrown at them.  For tree-ring scientists like ourselves, changes in the environment are recorded in the structure of the trees – clues about their age – and in the rings of their branches. We seek out the oldest looking trees on the landscape and take small samples, like a biopsy, that are the diameter of a chopstick. And, on dry sites like the Khorgo lava field, we took samples from dead trees to extend the living tree record further back in time by matching the unique patterns of large and small rings. The rings in one sense can be considered a bar code of information. The information we glean from the bar code made of wood indicates the growth of these trees are severely limited by moisture. We test this hypothesis statistically by comparing ring width measurements and human measures of moisture availability. So, when we see 15 years of above average ring widths in the early 1200s, this indicates wet conditions. That is our hypothesis, at least, and something we will test in the coming years with historical documents, environmental records from lake sediments, more tree rings, and ecological modelling experiments. While this record speaks to a rapid transformation of Eurasian culture during the 13th century, it also speaks about an abrupt transformation in Mongol culture today. Towards the end of our tree-ring record we see a prolonged drought from the end of the 20th century into the beginning of the 21st century. This drought followed the wettest century of the last 11 and occurred during the warmest period of the last 1,100 years in Asia.  The abrupt transition in environmental conditions – one that’s seen hundreds of lakes and wetlands disappear from the region’s landscape – occurred during the move from a more agriculturally based economy to a more urban one. These severe conditions, in combination with some harsh winters, killed millions of livestock and are thought to be one trigger of a mass migration of Mongols from the countryside into the capital of Ulaanbaatar. Though we don’t have the data to connect this heat drought to climate change, warming temperatures have stacked the deck towards causing higher amounts of evaporation, so even if the amount of precipitation remains the same, high temperatures will generate a more intense drought. That’s what we observed in the early 21st century and based on past moisture variation in Mongolia and future predictions of warming, we would expect to see similar events in the future."

Guest post by WUWT moderator Andi Cockroft
I wrote the other week of an Evening With His Lordship – aka Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley – in which I outlined his presentation made here in New Zealand.
Many commenters seemed to take issue with my spelling of “sceptic” – which of course is correct for an Anglo Saxon such as I, or some berated my referral to Christopher as “His Lordship” – which of course is equally correct for an Anglo Saxon – it is simply courtesy after all.
I do point out that most of my adult life has been spent developing computer “programs”, which read and write to “disk” (although I do sometimes rebel and use a disc) – and when the painful necessity arises, I can even spell “initialize” – so I am quite adaptable to US English when needed.
Hopefully here though, attending a presentation by Catherine Leining, one of New Zealand’s only two disciples of Al Gore, should prove less contentious – with I suspect very few real sceptics in the auditorium.
I had hoped to report quite dispassionately and simply compare the arguments put forward by Christopher and those by Catherine – but regrettably that is just not possible.

The two presentations could have not be further apart in technique had they tried.
Whilst Christopher mixed wit, scientific argument and many citations, the pitch by Catherine was primarily emotive.
Introduced by Wellington’s Green Mayor, Celia Wade-Brown, the first 25 minutes were spent on who Catherine was. The presentation proper started just before 6pm.
But none of the scientific papers, charts, graphs, comparisons etc of Monckton – no – here was weather in all its forms: floods, droughts, winds, snow – you name it – suddenly it is “weather is climate”.
Plenty of quotes – Hansen, Trenberth et al but surprisingly no mention of Mann ! None of which said anything other than “it’s worse than we thought”
Prof James Renwick was there to lend support, a leading light at NIWA in earlier times, now an associate Professor at Wellington’s Victoria University

From left to right: Mayor Celia Wade-Brown, Catherine Leining and James Renwick
But I digress. There was a slide with a couple of graphs on there, and I can report that not only is the hockey stick alive and well, it has a twin!!!
I wasn’t quick enough on the camera to capture the image, but the ever-so-typical Mannian flat-line with the uptick to infinity was shown above an almost identical graph showing CO2 concentrations in ppm – also heading skyward to infinity.

Of course this was followed almost immediately by the graphs comparing historic 10 (or was it 20) millennia temperature versus CO2 concentrations. The granularity of which was totally incapable of allowing any interpretation of what preceded what.
More CAGW threats followed, with the typical underwater Maldives stunt, and dire warnings of “likely” temperatures around the globe if we fail to act.
At no time was there any attempt to discuss or explain Climate Sensitivity, Albedo (other than briefly during Q&A), ENSO, Ocean Heat, Aerosols, Proxies, Solar Maxima… the list of missing discussions is almost endless
Towards the end, I was quite surprised that there were no “tipping points” – but in quick successions these were three – but so monumental were they that I forget what they were – something about public opinion I think.
A long presentation on what must be done (but not why it should be done), with windmills, solar, battery cars for all, self-sufficiency for Africa, Carbon Trading, bio-fuels, no more coal, no more bad oil – although apparently “Z” (a brand-name for Shell Petroleum over here) are the good guys and Exxon the bad guys
Towards the end, a series of “red herrings” – it’s the Sun (apparently not), warming has stopped (apparently not), there is no consensus (oh yes there is – 98% climate scientists agree), it’s all based on models (no it’s not), CO2 is a beneficial gas (no it’s not it’s harmful) and a few others.
In all, a very different style of presentation from His Lordship’s more scientific fact-based presentation, this one based primarily on assumptions that the CO2 theory is already fact and that we must act – but no justification of the underlying science to prove the affirmations.
Q&A was interesting – I asked why NIWA (responsible for the Climate record in NZ) was reporting temperature increases twice the global average – according to James Renwick no it’s not – it’s only about 10% above average – I’ll check that one.
Interesting discussion around polar temperatures (and this is where albedo was touched on), and apparently Antarctica is thawing just as much as the Arctic – it just has more ice so will take longer.
Finally, I knew it had to happen. NZ emits about 47% of its GHG’s from agriculture. A fervent Vega sitting in the gallery insists that if we all took Vitamin B12 supplements, we could all relinquish our addiction to beef and save all that flatulence.
On that note, I left. But since I had missed my evening meal to attend this presentation, I stopped off for a curry on the way home – if that doesn’t add methane to the atmosphere I don’t know what will.
