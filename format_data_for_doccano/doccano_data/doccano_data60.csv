"Worldwide CO2 emissions from commercial flights are rising up to 70% faster than predicted by the UN, according to an analysis. Carbon dioxide emitted by airlines increased by 32% from 2013 to 2018, according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation.  The US-based ICCT, which exposed the Volkswagen dieselgate scandal, estimated global air travel for passengers and freight emitted 918m tonnes of CO2 last year. Researchers said the rate of growth far exceeded that used to develop projections for CO2 emissions by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization. The ICCT report says: “The implied annual compound growth rate of emissions, 5.7%, is 70% higher than those used to develop ICAO’s projections that CO2 emissions from international aviation will triple under business as usual by 2050.” The total increase over the past five years was equivalent to building about 50 coal-fired power plants, the ICCT calculated. The study shows the UK is responsible for 4% of global aviation CO2 emissions, behind only the US (24%) and China (13%). Domestic flights in the US and China account for a quarter of all aviation emissions. The US, China and EU account for 55% of all emissions. Airlines in the 36-member countries of the ICAO have signed up to a carbon reduction scheme known as Corsia and will start recording their emissions this year. The scheme is framed to allow aviation to continue to grow but reduce its net footprint by purchasing carbon emission offsets – or funding a carbon dioxide saving elsewhere. Although aviation accounts for just over 2% of all global emissions, that proportion is expected to expand significantly as other sectors such as energy make more rapid progress to decarbonise. A forecast released by Airbus on Wednesday said the number of commercial aircraft in operation would double to 48,000 planes worldwide by 2038. It predicted urbanisation and an emerging middle class would fuel rapid growth, particularly in the Asia-Pacific. The growth in total emissions comes in spite of more fuel-efficient planes, as passenger numbers have grown. Emissions per passenger kilometre have been reduced by more than 50% since 1990. According to the airline trade body Iata, carriers have improved fuel efficiency by more than 2% per year over the past decade. An Iata spokesman said: “It is true that because of demand from people in developing economies to enjoy the same benefits of flying as those in rich countries, aviation emissions growth is currently faster than our efficiency gains. “That is why from 2020 all growth in international aviation CO2 will be offset, reducing carbon by millions of tonnes a year. And by 2050 we aim to cut total emissions to half the 2005 level, using a combination of sustainable fuels and radical new technologies.” The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, called on the UK aviation industry to take the lead in introducing electric flight. In a speech at Cranfield University in Bedford on Thursday, he said: “We need to get to grips with commercial aviation greenhouse gas emissions for the sake of our children and our fragile environment.” He said aviation “supercharges our economy, drives prosperity, jobs and tourism and helps promote Britain’s interests globally … But with aviation set to grow significantly over the next three decades, largely driven by rising demand from emerging markets, particularly Asia, the Middle East and India, I want to pave the way for the transition towards commercial use of cleaner electric planes.”"
"A majority of the public recognise the climate crisis as an “emergency” and say politicians are failing to tackle the problem, backing the interests of big oil over the wellbeing of ordinary people, according to an eight-country poll. The survey, which comes before what is expected to be the world’s biggest climate demonstrations on Friday, found that climate breakdown is viewed as the most important issue facing the world, ahead of migration, terrorism and the global economy, in seven out of the eight countries surveyed. In the US it comes third behind terrorism and affordable healthcare. Nick Lowles, from UK-based anti-racism group Hope not Hate, which commissioned the survey, said the findings showed that the public were “way ahead” of politicians in recognising the scale of the climate crisis. “They understand the scale of the problem and want governments to take the strong and decisive action that this emergency requires.” Hundreds of newsrooms around the world are banding together this week to commit their pages and air time to what may be the most consequential story of our time. As world leaders descend on New York for the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September  – and millions of activists prepare for a global climate strike on 20 September – the media partnership Covering Climate Now is launching its first large-scale collaboration to increase climate coverage in the global media and focus public attention on this emergency. The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, which was founded earlier this year by the Columbia Journalism Review  and the Nation. The partnership currently includes 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people. The network represents every corner of the media including TV networks (CBS News, Al Jazeera), newspapers (El País, the Toronto Star), digital players (BuzzFeed, HuffPost, Vox), wire services (Getty Images, Bloomberg), magazines (Nature, Science), and dozens of podcasts, local publishers, radio and TV stations. You can learn more about the initiative here. He said the crisis would have a huge impact on racism, division and conflict in future years unless it was tackled now. “As an organisation dedicated to bringing communities together and challenging the politics of division, we believe that our leaders must take swift action on climate change so that environmental pressures do not become a source of hostility, anger and competition in our societies.” The poll surveyed more than 1,000 people in the UK, Canada, Germany, Italy, Brazil, France, Poland and the US. It found that at least three-quarters of the public think the world is facing a “climate emergency”, with climate breakdown at risk of becoming “extremely dangerous”. The overwhelming majority in each country – 74% in Britain – said they were already seeing the influence of the climate crisis in extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, and around two-thirds describe it as a direct threat to ordinary people in their country. The poll reveals widespread alarm that the crisis is on the brink of spinning out of control, with 64% in the UK agreeing with the statement “time is running out to save the planet” – the figure was 70% in Germany, 74% in Brazil and 57% in the US. It also found that few people believe their governments are doing enough – only 23% in the UK, 20% in Germany, 23% in Brazil and 26% in the US agree that ministers are taking sufficient action. The results will put pressure on world leaders gathering for the climate action summit in New York next week. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for heads of government to bring plans – not words – to address the climate emergency ahead of a 2020 deadline for countries to raise their national targets under the Paris agreement. The treaty signed in 2015 obliged governments to keep temperatures well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C The poll found that most people called for radical measures to cut emissions – including building more wind turbines and solar panels, providing more charging points for electric cars, and investing to create jobs in clean industries. They also wanted governments to be tougher on big polluters and to force them to pay for the damage they caused, although the public are sceptical this would happen, with at least two-thirds suggesting politicians put the interests of big oil and gas corporations before those of local communities. The poll also found support for tougher measures to cut emissions, including a halt to coal mining and an end to oil and gas drilling, as well as increased taxes on frequent fliers. The findings come just a day before millions of people are expected to take to the streets for the global climate strike. Walkouts and demonstrations are expected in cities on every continent except Antarctica and adults, businesses and trade unions have been urged to join. Laurence Tubiana, the CEO of the European Climate Foundation, said the findings in the poll underlined the growing support for immediate radical action. “This poll reconfirms what the growing numbers of people striking for climate action are saying: We’re worried, we know we can do more, leaders, we need you to step up and unite behind the science.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week, I think it was, I remember reading something about Al Gore’s The Climate Project having slumped to an all-time low with the number of Climate Crisis presentations delivered.
The French sceptic climate website Changement Climatique has compiled a graphic showing the number of presentations given each month. I’ve posted it below.
Using complex Mannian statistical techniques, I’ve fitted a curve (red line) to the chart (sorry, code is not available). Conclusion: Al Gore’s TCP is headed for a crisis. He really needs to dramatically cut back his hot air emissions.

Probably the only 2 things performing worse are the all-but-defunct Chicago Climate Exchange and Obama’s Economy.
Changement Climatique describes Gore’s project situation as follows:
 The number of presentations reached a peak of 193 in October 2009, just before Copenhagen, but then went on an “unprecedented” and “irreversible” decline to a total collapse in the last few months.  At the moment, not a single presentation is scheduled for 2011, which bodes ill for future of the project. It’s a sure sign that “climatic fatigue” has struck the warmist movement.
Quelle misere.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen the temperature sinks far below normal and people freeze to death, you hardly hear a peep from the media anymore.But as soon as the temperature rises a few degrees over normal for a day or more, the media explodes with headlines of “HEAT WAVE!” and “SCORCHING HEAT!”.
Thanks to the internet and a few media outlets, few and far in between, the inconvenient news of a devastating, protracted cold snap gripping much of south America is coming out. Read news24.com/World/News.
Here are some grisly statistics:
1. 175 dead in 6 countries
2. 112 people had died of hypothermia and flu in Peru.
3. 16 people froze to death and 11 died of carbon monoxide poisoning due to faulty heaters.
4. Thousands of cattle also froze to death on their pastures in Paraguay and Brazil.
5. In Bolivia, 18 people died, in Paraguay five and two each in Chile and Uruguay. Nine people died of the cold in southern Brazil.
How cold is it? Take a look at this post I put up three days ago. return-to-1970s-cold/, showing the 7 day outlook.
You’d think when they’re not too busy covering Zsa Zsa Gabor, the media would cover this.
In Germany, it seems the major news magazines are finding space and time to report the cold – along with the reports of the warm weather we’re having here, which will end in about 36 hours.
But Germany’s ARD Teklevsion has NOTHING. Same goes for ZDF television. Hmmm.
I couldn’t find much at the major US news services either. CBS – nothing. At CNN there’s a report that’s a day old with 17 deaths. Nothing at the right wing Fox either. Maybe others are better at finding big news.

"In the past three weeks, we took the pulse of citizens in eight countries in the Americas and western Europe whose governments will prove critically important to global efforts to tackle the climate emergency. Our findings were unambiguous – tackling climate breakdown was deemed the most important priority for government, ahead of terrorism, the economy and migration. In all the countries except the US, the majority of those surveyed said that the climate emergency was the number one issue, and that governments had to do more.  Ahead of the global day of strikes tomorrow and the UN climate summit on Monday, Hope Not Hate is calling on governments worldwide to take urgent action on the climate emergency – otherwise we risk not just extreme weather but extreme politics. Although we think about climate breakdown as an environmental issue, for many people around the world its consequences will be felt as primarily social and political. If governments don’t take urgent action to tackle the climate emergency, rising sea levels, desertification and increasingly frequent extreme weather events will have potentially devastating effects on both the world’s poorest people and its wealthy nations. Globally, millions of people face a bleak future: being displaced from their homes and losing their livelihoods. It’s unimaginable that in such circumstances, resourceful, determined and sometimes desperate people won’t try to find better, safer places to work and raise their families. Climate breakdown will create volatile social situations. Large numbers of people could be forced to move within their countries and across borders – both near and far. Extreme environmental events and rapid change could also destabilise economies, leading to unemployment, pressure on resources, spiralling living costs and political and social unrest. Hope not Hate’s work in communities across the country over 15 years has taught us that this type of scenario threatens peaceful coexistence, and opens the door to those who seek to capitalise on the politics of hate. Societies faced with economic insecurity, real or perceived competition for resources, pressured public services and rapid social and cultural change can quickly grow disaffected if faced with unresponsive politicians and no hope of change. In these situations, diversity can become division, a situation that provides fertile ground for those who wish to break apart shared identities and common cause, and create a “them and us” mentality. Our investigations have found that these groups are already exploiting the issue – with climate denial and climate conspiracies finding a welcome home in the ideology of both the populist right and the far right. It’s paradoxical that the very people who would seek to capitalise on the social dislocation caused by the climate crisis are one of the biggest groups driving climate scepticism in Europe. It’s for this reason that we believe citizens and governments should be taking radical action against the climate emergency. The war-driven migrant crisis in 2015 showed how quickly and powerfully anti-immigrant feeling can distort and destabilise politics as we know it, surging far beyond any initial racial, religious and cultural friction. Keeping our societies united and tolerant in the face of the pressures created by the climate crisis is an integral part of the global fight for climate justice, but governments, policymakers and NGOs are not yet ready for this challenge. We must plan ahead so we can resist and repel any backlash to people fleeing the consequences of the climate crisis, and build coalitions between the environmental and social justice movements. Unless we take action now on climate breakdown, and begin preparing for its political consequences, I fear we could be heading for serious trouble. • Nick Lowles is chief executive of Hope Not Hate, the UK’s largest anti-racism and anti-extremism movement"

Share this...FacebookTwitterEIKE has a piece today called Super Expensive Energy. It perhaps could serve as a reminder for President Obama, who thinks passing cap & trade and stopping reliance on fossil fuels will somehow plug the hole. My feeling is that Obama is using the oil disaster as a political instrument to drive through a dangerous cap & trade law.
Cap & trade means subsidising industries. Governments can do this as long as they can afford it. But that’s rarely the case. Most often they cannot. Europe is a prime example for Obama to look at.
Take a look at socialist Spain, for example. Driven by a green ideology, and all the promises it brings, Spain went ahead and subsidised wind and solar energy with unbridled abandon, thinking it could create thousands of new green jobs and usher in the next economic wonder.
Well, it has. But not the kind of wonder a sane person welcomes. Today Spain is bankrupt and unemployment is at (twenty) 20%. Spain has since been forced to drastically cut its subsidies, and the solar bubble has popped. Spain is now begging other countries for a bailout.
Even in a country that has abundant sunshine, like Spain, solar energy still cannot compete on the free market without generous subsidies. Consumers prefer reliable and inexpensive energy.
You’d think that with solar energy being completely uncompetitive in a country where sunshine is plentiful, leaders in other countries with gray, rainy climates would avoid such a source of energy. Not Germany. Even with its gray dismal climate, leaders went full throttle ahead in subsidising solar panels and energy. They simply forced the power companies to buy up green power from people who have solar panels on their roofs at exorbitant prices.

The power companies of course simply pass the higher costs on to the consumers. Industry is among the consumers of power. Companies that have energy-intensive processes are moving operations, and the jobs that go with them, out to countries that have much lower pollution standards.
Cooking your own goose
State-guaranteed price for solar power in Germany is far above the actual sales price to the market. Such a method was used in former communist East Germany (the country that built a wall to keep its people from running away). For example, a person there could sell a goose they had raised in his backyard to the local markets at the state-guaranteed price of 30 East German Marks. A few hours later the same seller could go back to the market and buy the same goose for only 15 Marks, slaughtered and ready to cook. Today it’s the same with green power producers. They sell their power for 43 cents/kwh, and then buy it back for 22 cents. Does that make sense?
Only if you want to send the economy to hell in a handbasket, and quickly.
In Germany green laws have been passed that will cost hundreds of billions of euros over the next 15 years, all based on the bogus claim they protect the climate. According to EIKE:
These billions burden the economy in 2 ways: 1) They lead to higher electricity rates for producers, meaning their products become more expensive, and 2) lead higher energy bills for consumers, and thus less buying power. Eventually this will choke the German economy and its growth, which eventually will hit already strapped governments fiscally. Absolute foolery.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI know the other uptown climate sceptic blogs don’t want to get anywhere near this red-hot potato of a topic, as the details are explosive, too sketchy and the sources are to some extent dubious. Caution has to be exercised  in drawing conclusions. It’s far too early for that.
But where there’s smoke, there’s fire.  I committed myself to keep people posted on the story. I’m not just going to sit here and “suck it up”. My hunch tells me it’s going to boil over. I may be wrong, but two more big puffs of smoke have just billowed up.
The National Enquirer, yes, a yellow journal, has reported that two more lady masseurs have come forward, claiming Al Gore behaved very inappropriately, read NY Post report.
In the first case that came to light late June, masseur Molly Hagerty said in a 2009 police report that she felt Gore had done this many times before, meaning other women had probably endured the same. If Hagerty was just a fraud, then no other women would come forward.
Now 2 more women are reported coming forward and claiming abuse by Gore.
One incident took place at a Beverly Hills luxury hotel when Gore attended the Oscars in 2007. The second allegedly occurred a year later at a Tokyo hotel. This would confirm Hagerty’s suspicions.
I read the entire police report made by Hagerty, and it seemed to me implausible that someone would make up such an elaborate story.

And although tabloids like the National Enquirer are known for untrustworthy stories, would they go after someone like Gore without having real substance? You can screw up a story on a Hollywood diva, but wouldn’t you make damn sure you have your facts straight if you go after the former VP of the United States, Nobel Peace Prize,  Oscar winner, a figure with that kind of influential muscle?
The New York Post writes:
The probe threatens to engulf Gore deeper into a sex scandal once thought unthinkable for the Nobel prize winner who built up an image as a doting husband and family man who fell in love with his wife at the high school prom and lived happily ever after.
Another reason I think the story has substance is because of what Gore has said and done in the past. AIT was carefully crafted to deceive, and so it says a lot. His words say a lot. This is not a man playing with a full deck, in my view.
Who really betrayed the country?
Eventually these things have a way of getting out of control. Global warming is already having enough trouble surviving Climate-gate. This Gore story could put the whole damn thing away for good.
Will more women step forward?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe array of strategies the green-outside, red-brown-inside activists keep plotting never ceases to amaze me.
The latest comments come from Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer in an interview with George Stephanopoulus, and provide a window to another page of the enviro-Mein-Kampf playbook.
In the interview, Stephanopoulos asks Breyer, on burning the Koran, if the First Amendment ought to be rethought: Breyer replies:
Holmes said it doesn’t mean you can shout ‘fire’ in a crowded theater. Well, what is it?  Why?  Because people will be trampled to death.  And what is the crowded theater today?  What is the being trampled to death? It will be answered over time in a series of cases which force people to think carefully.  That’s the virtue of cases.
So if Breyer had his way, the government would decide what a crowded theater is, and what gets trampled. Folks that would be a dangerous threat to free speech.

Keep in mind that the Supreme Court has already declared CO2 a pollutant that needs to be regulated. And now at least one Justice wants to declare certain types of speech as “pollutants”, and subject them  to regulation.
So what’s the next step? Skeptics is a crowded theater?
Next they’ll be calling the planet a “crowded theater”and its inhabitants “the trampled”, and that certain kinds of speech lead to trampling in the crowded theater, earth.  For example,  those of us who express skepticism, or produce inappropriate science, could be deemed making speech that leads to death in the crowded theater earth.
Without our speech, the planet could be saved, after all.
Sound crazy?
Well, we’ve already been called “deniers”, the scourge of the planet, even bastards that ought to face Nuremberg-type trials for climate crimes. Be warned.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve been following Joe’s forecasts here in Europe for about 2 years. At first I thought he was just another weatherman and didn’t put too much stock in what he said. Then I noticed his 3 to 6-month general forecasts were pretty darn accurate.
Back in 2008 he predicted a cold winter for Europe – and it panned out. Last fall 2009 he predicted a harsh winter for central Europe, and Germany got its worst winter in 46 years. Late last winter he predicted a hot summer – and bam! Hello hot summer.
Meanwhile, the Met Office, equipped with its monster-size, mega-million dollar super-computers, was not even able to do better than flipping a penny.
They’ve since given up issuing seasonal forecasts, yet still insist their 50 and 100-year forecasts will be correct because of the dubious “undisputed CO2-temperature correlation”. (If that’s so, why waste your money on a super-computer?)

"Behind the remote research huts of Sermilik ice station, a vast sheet of ice stretches north for 1,480 miles, spanning an area three times the size of France. It is holding 10% of the world’s freshwater, water that has been frozen solid for millions of years. It’s glacier calving season in the south-eastern reaches of Greenland, and the adjacent channel is full of the thunderous roars and cracks of a flotilla of icebergs breaking apart. Across a narrow granite ravine separating the visitors’ hut from the main living quarters of the 40-year-old international scientists’ base, lab machines click and whirr through the night. The day’s samples – water, air, carbon, algae – spin frantically around curious-looking aluminium discs. Melting ice drips slowly into assorted beakers. Struggling to adjust to the midnight sun, a team of international research scientists from Aarhus University and Germany’s national research centre for solid earth sciences peer into microscopes at clues to the planet’s future. These are samples of glacial past and present, retrieved from the belly of the Mittivakkat glacier, which is in mortal retreat on the plateau above. To understand our origins, scientists look to the stars. To understand our eventual demise, the glacier is ground zero. Far from being barren places, glaciers represent more than 10% of our landmass and are teeming with biodiversity. They are spawning and breeding places not just for the familiar species like whales, arctic hares and foxes, polar bears, seals and muskoxen but also for bacteria, fungi and algae that have a vital role in the planet’s biodiversity. This team of microbiologists is attempting to decode the lives of these hidden creatures and their links to the ice melts across the polar caps. Algae blooms, these scientists say, are turning sun-reflecting glaciers into sun-absorbing hotspots. Long hours are spent on the glacier and even more in the makeshift labs set up in a decrepit series of huts built in the late 1960s on the edge of this lonely archipelago some 40 miles away from the nearest settlement. Archive photographs in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, show that the Mittivakkat glacier’s vast icy mouth opened out to the Arctic Ocean as recently as the 1950s. But to reach its heart in 2019 is a hike many miles inland, crossing rocky terrain in entirely unexpected 23-degree heat. Lichen and unseasonal arctic flowers line the route, as do thirsty mosquitoes, who feast on the moisture of human eyeballs, relenting only at the ice line. Flying over a glacier by helicopter it’s easy to dismiss the landscape as devoid of life, but for the seven scientists at Sermilik hiking over the ice, it is a source of constant fascination for animal and plant life. Alexandre Anesio is a professor in Arctic biogeochemistry from Aarhus University. A charismatic Brazilian, he has a rifle slung over his shoulders – one of four armed researchers, all on constant vigil for the polar bears who stalk the coastline here. He is also probably the worst shot. His young doctoral students, Eva Doting and Laura Halbach, look more keen-eyed, having spent the last month preparing by shooting polar bear targets at a rifle range in Copenhagen. On the Guardian’s first evening, over supper, Anesio explains with earnest patience that snow isn’t universally white. Some of the last snow to lie on the surface of the earth, long after the human race is gone, might even be red. Not blood-red – more a watermelon hue. He also talks about how, in the end, the fate of our glaciers, sea-level rises and biodiversity loss, will not only come down to the excesses of the industrial age and our unbridled consumer life, but also to the influence of algae. The sticky green residue familiar from childhood tadpole ponds, as it turns out, could be a microscopic bellwether for this age of extinction. Each year, high on Greenland’s glaciers, algae perform a remarkable migration. After spending winter deep in the snowpack as dormant cysts, they awake in spring and swim through snowmelt, dividing and photosynthesising along the route. When they reach the surface, the algae turn black, dark green and crimson – colours that come from astaxanthin, a molecular cousin of the chemical that makes sweet potato orange. The algae produce it as a sunscreen, as it absorbs UV light. As a consequence the humble algae dramatically reduce the amount of sunlight reflected by Greenland’s glaciers and increase the sunlight they absorb, darkening the snow and ice. Most concerning for the researchers out on the glacier is the fact the algae that live on the ice surface in summer are increasingly dark brown, leading them to absorb more sunlight and exacerbate melting. Along with his colleague Professor Liane Benning, Anesio leads a team responsible for this breakthrough discovery. The team is now aiming to understand the mechanisms behind the algal growth, and how the organisms have adapted to live on the ice. The key question is whether the algae will grow and darken other areas of the ice sheet as the climate gets warmer. If this happens, which is what the team here in Sermilik suspect, it will mean up to 30% faster melting of the ice sheet than existing models are predicting. “In 2019 our glaciers and ice sheets [are] already being darkened by dust, soot, and ash from our industrial world, which provides the perfect home for algae to flourish,” Anesio says. “As the organisms reproduce, they melt even more snow, which in turn allows them to proliferate again. So it’s like a cycle. A very bad one.” As algae spread, the effect will be compounded, leading to even more melting.  Benning, of the German Research Centre for Geosciences or GFZ in Potsdam, was previously part of the Black and Bloom project to understand how and why the Greenland ice sheet is melting. She says algae-discoloured snow isn’t just an Arctic phenomenon. “It’s a global occurrence,” she says. “This is increasingly a problem in the Arctic, Alpine and Himalayan glaciers. Blooms of red snow and brown ice are turning up in Antarctica also. What we hope to do is spread our research out further because we believe this is a significant factor in ice melt. This is why we are back here in Greenland but we believe the work also needs to be done elsewhere.” The sound of a city block-sized portion of ice as it separates from Greenland’s ice shelf is unique. A violent sonic boom is followed by an echoing machine-gun style “ak-ak-ak-ak” as the iceberg turns on its axis, before surrendering to the ocean with an eerie silence. There is a sadness to it.  On one single day last month, Nasa’s Oceans Melting Greenland project announced that Greenland’s ice sheet had suffered its most substantial single-day volume loss on record, sending an estimated 12.5bn tonnes of ice pouring into the Arctic Ocean – a body of water that could cover the whole of England in five inches of water. If the Greenland ice sheet disappeared tomorrow, sea levels around the world would rise by seven metres and life, as we know it, would come to an end. Glaciers matter. And they are in universal retreat. By 2100 Alpine summits may have lost around nine-tenths of the ice that covered them in 2003. In western Canada, somewhere between 60% and 80% of the ice measured in 2005 will have disappeared and flowed into the sea. In South America, the glaciers of Bolivia have lost almost half their mass in the last 50 years. Sermilik’s scientists argue for serious thinking and funding to understand glacier loss. For Anesio, who left his job at Bristol University, transferring to Denmark because of the potential impact of Brexit on his research, science has to be “something collaborative”. “There is no question that the data we are seeing is concerning,” he says. “One of the latest predictions is that there is a 10% chance for sea levels to rise by two metres in 2100. So maybe some people think 10% is not a great chance – but I don’t think I would cross the street if I had a 10% chance [of being] hit by a truck. “Our job as scientists is to create more accurate models and add to our global understanding of the climate crisis so that it can be used for politicians to take action – we hope, a little bit faster than is happening now.” As glaciers retreat from India to Greenland, biodiversity is being lost. According to the UN one million species face extinction due to human influence. Such a collapse in biodiversity would wreak havoc on the interconnected ecosystems of the planet, putting humans at risk by compromising food sources, fouling clean water and air, and eroding defences against extreme weather such as hurricanes and floods. As Greenland’s ice melt has been adopted by the world as a global bellwether for climate crisis, less focus is being placed on the impact on biodiversity. This ice sheet is not just being melted by algae bloom and from above by warmer air temperatures. Arctic waters are reaching record high temperatures and warmer water is lapping against these great glaciers. For Greenland, one of the least densely populated countries in the world, the impact will be felt on land by the nation’s flowers, plants, bushes and heather, its polar bears, caribous, arctic hares, foxes and wolves and at sea by narwhals, seals, bowhead whales and the large variety of unique sea birds. This is biodiversity that actually faces few direct pressures from human activities – the major threat is glacial melt and climate crisis. The shrinking of the sea ice area is already having a significant impact on marine ecosystems. It’s an essential habitat and breeding ground for many species, ranging from micro-algae to marine mammals. This is now a hungry time for polar bears struggling to access the sea ice to hunt for seals. An estimated 3,500 of the bears stalk the coastline of Greenland and at Sermilik, stories are swapped of close encounters with the animals. Scientific labours in the chill winds and high seas of the Arctic summer seem wrapped in an unusual sense of urgency this year. The scientists working in Greenland are keen to communicate their new, emerging understanding of the dynamics of the declining ice sheet to the broader world. According to Christopher Trivedi, a US member of the scientific team, communicating the work of the many scientists active across Greenland to local people is a vital and often overlooked part of the job. “I think science communication matters. We need to include the local community here with the work we are doing, and we also have a responsibility to explain the work we are doing here. What we are finding impacts the immediate environment more than anywhere else.” For the younger members of the Sermilik team, the bleakest conversation held at the ice station is around the plastic being discovered. “We are finding plastics in the atmosphere at the centre of Greenland’s ice sheet,” says Dr James Bradley, assistant professor at the Queen Mary University of London. “Millions of tonnes of plastic are discarded into the environment every year and are broken down into small particles and fibres that do not biodegrade. These particles, known as microplastics, have now been found everywhere from high mountains to deep oceans and can carry toxic chemicals and harmful microbes. Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic waste. Their presence in oceans and waterways has received a great deal of scientific and media attention in recent years, but our growing concern is their presence in the atmosphere.” It is evident that all the scientists feel a growing responsibility on their shoulders to answer questions that have been ignored for too long. This summer, in the face of record ice melt, there is a deeper purpose and an urgency to their work. They want more resources and new technologies to map the details of ice loss with greater precision. They want better global monitoring of nutrients and contaminants that are now trickling at ever higher rates from glaciers into downstream waterways. They want to expand their work to Antarctica and other parts of the glacial world. “To be honest, I’m massively worried,” says Anesio. “I just hope that we are not crossing that tipping point because I don’t think humans can adapt to the rates of changing climates at the moment.” He says that he also has hope, “because I can see a new movement in the young generation that cares. I think that everyone individually can contribute, by pressing politicians, but also by making their contribution in terms of the reduction of CO2.” Leaving the ice station by boat, negotiating the same narrow channel of icebergs that brought us here, we pass over the shattered remnants of a glacier and stop to scoop a 1,000-year-old chunk of ice from the water. These lumps of ice can only meet one path, drifting out into the Arctic sea at the mercy of winds and warm currents until they break apart into the ocean. Days later, further north of the island, a local ship’s captain summed things up with his Greenlandic dark humour. “That noise you hear out there. The fizzing and cracking,” he tells me, cupping his ear to the wind for dramatic effect as his old wooden ship passes through a fjord filled with decaying mountains of ice. “That noise is the end of the world.”"

"The police are planning to impose restrictions on the global climate strike in London on Friday, warning that anyone who does not comply risks arrest. The event in London is part of what is expected to be the biggest mobilisation around the climate crisis the world has seen, with millions taking to the streets in demonstrations and strikes in cities on every continent.  The conditions outlined under a so-called section 14 restrict the demonstration in London to an area around Westminster and Millbank and say the action must finish by 3.30pm. A succession of youth climate strikes on Fridays this year has drawn hundreds of thousands of young people to the streets to demand action over the unfolding ecological crisis. But the Met claimed the “cumulative impact of these protests had been very significant” adding it had evidence that this Friday’s protest “may result in serious disruption to communities in London”. Met commander Dave Musker said: “We respect the right to protest. However, what we will not tolerate are protesters committing criminal offences and disproportionately stopping people going about their lawful business in London.” He added: “Anyone who knowingly fails to comply with these conditions or incites others to fail to comply will be committing an offence and will be liable to arrest. I will not allow the actions of a few to seriously hinder the day-to-day activities of the vast majority of Londoners, or visitors.” Amnesty International UK called the police restrictions “heavy-handed”. “People have the right to protest in sight and sound of their target audience, and we would hope the police bear that in mind when dealing with assemblies in other parts of London such as in the vicinity of town halls,” said Tim Gee, campaign manager. “Tomorrow is expected to be the largest ever day of action on climate change, as young people and adults take to the streets together to demand action on tackling the climate crisis and the human rights violations caused by it. It is vital that their voices are heard and not silenced.”"

"There is a debate in Florida whether it is any longer sensible for banks to offer 30-year mortgages, because by 2050 sea level rise will have overwhelmed many properties. So far, despite the scientific evidence to the contrary, everyone’s nerve is holding; property prices are not affected and mortgages are still being granted. This is a region where a single hurricane-induced storm surge could flatten billions of dollars’ worth of properties.  It is not surprising then that in England, despite the fact that 520,000 properties (including 370,000 homes) are in areas with a 0.5% or greater annual risk from coastal flooding, that the 30-year mortgage debate has not started. After all, Florida is statistically 10 times more likely to get a devastating flood than parts of Norfolk, Cornwall or Hull. Looking at the standard searches that solicitors undertake for buyers it is clear that environmental matters such as drains and contaminated land are carefully examined, along with the dangers of local flooding from overflowing rivers or flash flooding from rainfall. Wider searches to see whether many square miles at or below sea level might be in danger from being overwhelmed by a storm surge are not considered. With sea levels rising each year much faster than previously estimated this might soon be a costly oversight. "
"Thousands of Australian school students are again preparing to walk out of classrooms across the country to demand action on the climate crisis. The global mass day of action will take place on Friday 20 September, three days before the United Nations climate summit in New York. It follows strikes in March this year in which 150,000 people marched in Australia and 1.5 million took part worldwide. Organisers expect next week’s global strikes will be bigger and, this time there will be a much stronger presence from unions, workers and companies that have signed up to strike in solidarity with the young activists. Here’s a guide to what’s happening. Strikes are planned in 120 countries across the world including almost 100 locations across Australia, from the major centres of Sydney and Melbourne to the small rural town of Wollar in New South Wales. There will be strikes in all capital cities and in regional centres such as Albury, Orange and Bendigo. Organisers are anticipating the largest crowds this time will be in Melbourne, where the strikes coincide with the last day of the Victorian public school term. “This massive day of action is going to be fundamental towards advocating for more efficient action on climate change,” Evan Meneses, a 17-year-old organiser for the Adelaide strike, said. He said this was especially the case for Australia “given there is very little concrete evidence to suggest we’re achieving what was laid out in the Paris agreement”. “There’s something that really connects with people when people as young as eight or 13 are advocating for action on the climate crisis because people that young are not the ones who should be having to [do so].” The details for capital cities are as follows (all times are local). • Sydney 12 noon – The Domain • Melbourne 2pm – Treasury Gardens • Brisbane 1pm – Queens Gardens • Canberra 12 noon –Glebe Park • Adelaide 12 noon – Victoria Square • Darwin 1pm – Parliament • Perth 11am – Forrest Place • Hobart 12 pm – Parliament The full list of strike locations is here. Organisers expect hundreds of thousands of people, including students and their parents, to take part. The strikes will also have a strong presence from workers and unions. So far, 30 unions have signed up including the Australian Education Union, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation and the CPSU. Faith groups, including the Anglican and Uniting churches, have pledged their support for students. And hundreds of companies are giving staff time off to strike or finding other ways to express solidarity. Last week companies including Atlassian, Future Super and KeepCup formed an alliance called Not Business as Usual that is urging businesses to support employees who want to strike. What began as an alliance of about 20 businesses has grown to almost 1,000 as of Friday afternoon. Intrepid Travel is one of the companies giving employees a chance to participate in the strike. Its chief executive, James Thornton, said: “We stand in solidarity to support the next generation as they demand climate action. It is real, it is happening and it’s time for global business leaders to do their part.” The students have been inspired by the Swedish school student Greta Thunberg, whose strikes outside the Swedish parliament sparked a global movement. In November 2018, thousands of Australian school students went on strike and that was followed by the mass global day of action in March. Thunberg is in New York for the UN climate summit after making a transatlantic trip on a zero emissions sailboat. A youth summit, featuring some of the school strikers, including young Australian organisers, will take place in the lead-up to the UN conference. The Australia students have three demands for governments. 1. No new coal, oil and gas projects, including the Adani mine. 2. 100% renewable energy generation and exports by 2030. 3. Fund a just transition and job creation for all fossil-fuel workers and communities. The third point is a new feature for the Australian movement and particularly important for these strikes. The strong presence of workers at these strikes is about trying to end the pitting of climate action and the needs of the economy against each other. Instead, the young activists want constructive action to support workers in carbon-intensive industries as economies transition to net zero emissions. Alexa Stuart, a 15-year-old organiser of the Newcastle strike, said: “While it’s really important that we recognise that students are feeling scared about the impact of the climate crisis on our future, it’s also very important to recognise that, in Newcastle especially, there are a lot of jobs in the coalmining industry. “Those jobs are the livelihoods of many people. “It’s why it’s especially important that we’re starting to have conversations in the Hunter region about a just transition so no one is left behind and we can still have a positive impact on climate change.” Varsha Yajman, 17, is a student at Gosford high school and an organiser of the Sydney strike. She said the federal election, at which the Coalition government was returned despite its lack of effective climate policy, had made the movement realise “we had to reach out to people beyond the student community”. “With the election result, it became quite evident that a lot of people think our movement has just created instability for workers in the coal industry,” she said. “A just transition for all workers is really, really important to us. “We think a lot of teenagers are already aware of the impact of the climate crisis. We realised we need to reach out to adults and workers and demand their attention.” Young people are anxious about what their future looks like in a world that is failing to stall the climate crisis. In the last week alone in Australia, bushfires have torn through Queensland and New South Wales in the first week of spring. They have been described as unprecedented. The link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and increased bushfire risk is complex but, according to major science agencies, clear. Climate change does not create bushfires, but it can and does make them worse. A number of factors contribute to bushfire risk, including temperature, fuel load, dryness, wind speed and humidity.  The Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO say Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910 and temperatures will increase in the future. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is extremely likely increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases since the mid-20th century is the main reason it is getting hotter. The Bushfire and Natural Hazards research centre says the variability of normal events sits on top of that. Warmer weather increases the number of days each year on which there is high or extreme bushfire risk. Dry fuel load - the amount of forest and scrub available to burn - has been linked to rising emissions. Under the right conditions, carbon dioxide acts as a kind of fertiliser that increases plant growth.  Dryness is more complicated. Complex computer models have not found a consistent climate change signal linked to rising CO2 in the decline in rain that has produced the current eastern Australian drought. But higher temperatures accelerate evaporation. They also extend the growing season for vegetation in many regions, leading to greater transpiration (the process by which water is drawn from the soil and evaporated from plant leaves and flowers). The result is that soils, vegetation and the air may be drier than they would have been with the same amount of rainfall in the past. The year coming into the 2019-20 summer has been unusually warm and dry for large parts of Australia. Above average temperatures now occur most years and 2019 has been the fifth driest start to the year on record, and the driest since 1970. Not a significant one. Two pieces of disinformation, that an “arson emergency”, rather than climate change, is behind the bushfires, and that “greenies” are preventing firefighters from reducing fuel loads in the Australian bush have spread across social media. They have found their way into major news outlets, the mouths of government MPs, and across the globe to Donald Trump Jr and prominent right-wing conspiracy theorists. NSW’s Rural Fire Service has said the major cause of ignition during the crisis has been dry lightning. Victoria police say they do not believe arson had a role in any of the destructive fires this summer. The RFS has also contradicted claims that environmentalists have been holding up hazard reduction work. Last summer brought a wave of natural disasters and record-breaking heat. For the first eight months of the year, the country’s mean temperature was the second warmest on record. Mean maximums were the warmest on record over the same period and mean minimums the equal-sixth warmest. Authorities are warning of a grim outlook into the coming summer if current dry conditions and above average temperatures persist across much of the country. Aoibhinn Crimmins, a 17-year-old student at Dickson College and an organiser of the Canberra strike, said the March strikes were designed as a “wake-up call” on climate ahead of the federal election. “This strike is going to be much more about standing up in the face of adversity because the election result was not what we were expecting,” she said. “We are going to the streets again showing we are not going to back down and we are going to keep fighting for climate justice.”"
"Torres Strait islanders “embarrassed” by Scott Morrison’s appearance at last month’s Pacific Islands Forum will request he visit their region to view the impacts of climate change. Warraber man Kabay Tamu, representing a group of islanders who have complained to the United Nations about climate-based human rights breaches, will deliver the invitation to Australia’s delegation at the UN climate summit in New York next week.  “We’re urging the prime minister to visit our islands, meet our communities and see the climate crisis for himself,” Tamu said. Tamu told the Guardian in May: “We’re currently seeing the effects of climate change on our islands daily, with rising seas, tidal surges, coastal erosion and inundation of our communities.” “When erosion happens, and the lands get taken away by the seas, it’s like a piece of us that gets taken with it – a piece of our heart, a piece of our body. That’s why it has an effect on us. Not only the islands but us, as people. “We have a sacred site here, which we are connected to spiritually. And disconnecting people from the land, and from the spirits of the land, is devastating. “It’s devastating to even imagine that my grandchildren or my great-grandchildren being forced to leave because of the effects that are out of our hands.” In May the group, drawn from four islands, went to the UN Human Rights Committee in Switzerland to accuse the Morrison government of breaching their human rights because of inaction on climate change. Tamu took issue with the Australian position at the recent Pacific Islands Forum, when Morrison rejected smaller nations’ calls for an immediate global ban on new coal-fired power plants and coal mines. “As fellow islanders, we were embarrassed by Australia’s showing,” Tamu said. Tamu also criticised the prime minister’s decision not to attend the UN summit despite being in the US to meet Donald Trump, sending Australia’s foreign minister instead. Sea levels around the world are expected to rise between 75cm and 1.5m by the end of the century, depending on greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Australian Department of Environment and Energy, a rise of just 50cm would increase the risk of flooding around Australia by 300 times – making a once a century flood likely to occur several times a year. In some areas of Australia, flooding risk would rise much more – up to 10,000 times. The precise sea level rise around the Torres Strait, and the projected inundation, has not been calculated but low-lying islands are expected to experience a much greater flooding risk than mainland Australia. The department identifies the remote islands of the Torres Strait as some of the most vulnerable, as does the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), which warns communities they may be forced to relocate.

"The number of commercial aircraft in operation will more than double in the next 20 years to 48,000 planes worldwide, Airbus has forecast. The European aerospace company said that despite mounting concerns about the effects of aviation and the climate crisis, it believes air travel will continue to grow rapidly.  Urbanisation and development will mean the emerging global middle class of air passengers could rise 50% by 2038 to almost 6 billion people. Most of the expected 4.3% annual growth in air traffic will occur in the Asia-Pacific region, where demand for new planes is set to surpass that of Europe and North America combined. Airbus executives said aviation growth had proved resilient in the face of economic and geopolitical shocks, such as war and oil price rises, and they expected it to continue. Last year, the growth in flying exceeded predictions, with the number of flights per year up by 280m. Christian Scherer, the chief commercial officer of Airbus, said: “It is as if every single inhabitant of the US took another trip.” The manufacturer expects about 60% of the global fleet of 22,680 passenger jets and freight aircraft to be replaced with new planes in the next two decades, which it said would “contribute to progressive decarbonisation of the air transport industry”. Asked if “flight-shaming” could affect Airbus’s forecasts, Scherer said: “It’s not a concern. We’d rather see it fundamentally as an opportunity. Airbus sees itself as a champion of bringing global emissions down and lowering fuel burn.” While newer models of plane are far lighter and consume much less fuel, aviation’s overall carbon emissions have grown due to the huge rise in passenger numbers. Airbus said that on average, fuel consumption by distance per passenger is 47% of what it was in 1990. However, the number of annual passenger flights worldwide has quadrupled to 4 billion during that period. The average aircraft has more seats and spends 2.3 more hours per day flying than 20 years ago - a trend that suggests even more air journeys could come from the 39,000 planes Airbus forecasts to be delivered by 2038. Bob Lange, the senior vice-president for business analysis at Airbus, said its forecast had not been tempered for potential flying restrictions, whether through government action or public pressure. He said: “Greta Thunberg says, listen to the scientists and be equitable. The growth we see is from routes that are developing.” Chinese domestic flights are due to triple and overtake US domestic flights as the biggest source of air traffic within the next two decades, according to the Airbus forecast. Indian people are expected to take five times as many flights as they do now by 2038. Lange said: “As we become more globalised there are more reasons to travel. The growth is largely coming from people who haven’t accessed air travel in the past. If the US decide to halve their travel, it’s not going to make a dent in people travelling for the first time. “In the notion of what we’re going to do to protect our planet there has to be a notion of equity.” He argued that it would be wrong to say other people shouldn’t aspire to travel as we do today. Scherer said the goal of halving aviation’s emissions by 2050 was “not talk”, but targets Airbus uses as anchors. As yet, no technology appears to exist that is compatible with continued growth in flying.  Airbus is exploring sustainable fuels and alternative propulsion. It hopes to fly a test plane, the E-Fan X, in 2021, which could mean short-range hybrid-electric flights are feasible by the mid-2030s, Lange said. “We need to do more, it’s not enough but we can’t do it purely on our own.”"

Last Friday the German edition RIA NOVOSTI Russian news agency reported that there were five clusters of sunspots on the sun, leading some scientists to believe that the sun’s unusual lull may be over for good.
Scientists have been observing sunspots for hundreds of years. Many believe solar activity has a major impact on the earth’s climate on a decadal scale.
As a rule, the number of sunspots is considered to be the main criteria for solar activity: the higher the number of sunspots, the higher the activity.
But Sergei Bogatchov of the Lebedev Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences says that this correlation is not exact. Over the last 10 years, the highest number of sunspots occurred on January 24, 2002 – 19 clusters of spots were registered. Yet these sunspots led to only three weak solar eruptions. The most powerful solar eruption in recent history occurred on November 4, 2003 when only 4 clusters were present on the sun, reports Ria Novosti.
Last February there were 22 eruptions – 4 were powerful. Since then the sun has been in a stupor. According to Bogatchov the current sunspots show very little energy.  Today’s sun image, see above, is again relatively inactive.
When will this solar cycle reach it’s maximum?

Ria Novosti writes that according to Bogatchov, this cycle’s maximum was already pushed back to mid 2013 earlier this year, meaning the cycle is extended from 11 to 12 years. Bogatchov says:
If nothing happens in the next months ahead, then the expected maximum will have to be pushed back once again.
Source: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SolarCycle/
Source: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SolarCycle/
Judging NOAA’s latest sunspot tracking chart above, pushing back the date of the expected peak will likely happen sooner than later, and the length of the current cycle will be thus extended well beyond 12 years. Compare it to their original prediction back in 2007:

Now that’s quite a difference. We were projected to be at about 100 by now. But we’re only at about 20, well below their low projection! Scientists and policymakers really ought to start taking notice, as the chances that they are planning for the completely wrong scenario are becoming inescapable.
Recent studies have shown that Europe’s winters are especially harsh when solar activity is low. If that holds, get ready for some tough winters ahead. Last winter may have been just a preview of what’s coming. Stay tuned for more details on this elsewhere!

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn yesterday’s post I wrote about Deutsche Welle’s  letter to European Institute for Climate Energy (EIKE). where it denies being one-sided in holding an alarmist conference for journalists called: The Heat Is On – Climate Change and the Media, which has workshops like: How to professionally deal with climate scepticism. The conference’s own stated objective:
This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures. 
And the panelists at the conference warn: 
Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics at the expense of the basis of life. 
Despite the obvious one-sidedness of the conference, Deutsche Welle’s Intendant Erik Bettermann sent a letter to EIKE denying it completely. Remember that Deutsche Welle is a publicly funded broadcaster that is required by law to remain fair and balanced.
Now here’s a translation of EIKE’s response to Deutsche Welle’s denial:
Dear Herr Bettermann
Thank you for your reply dated 9 June 2010. You state at the start of your letter concerning the conference that: 
“…Deutsche Welle neither influences the global discussion on climate development in a one-sided manner, nor does it intend to, through its reporting or through the international convention: Global Media Forum..”

However your website announcement itself states: 
“Global warming presents grave problems for the world. Climate change not only has impacts on geo-political peace, regional conflicts, social well-being and human rights, it also impacts our very existence – whether or not the planet will be a hospitable place. Starvation, mass movement of refugees, flooding, lost harvests, extreme storms, droughts and pandemics weaken the foundation of our collective home. The Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum 2010 will put the main topics concerning climate change at the centre of focus and search for a practical way out of the current situation, whereby the role of the media at the international, national and local levels are considered. To prevent the catastrophe, drastic instruments and measures are required.”
This is indeed state doctrine that DW is describing. But it is factually false and moreover it involves the massive, forbidden influence of public opinion. Furthermore, you deny influencing of participants with seminar speakers. But the web announcement itself states, for example: “For journalists it is almost impossible to check over each and every statement for factual accuracy…,“ and: “Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics…This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.“ And further: “That’s why it simply cannot be said that Deutsche Welle is promoting in any way, within the framework of the Global Media Forum,  a one-sided view on the problem of climate development.”
That the single pages of the seminar cannot be called up does not change in any way the publicly made Deutsche Welle objective of influencing public opinion.
In addition you write:  “…through presentations, discussions and debates, the Global Media Forum is a conference for journalists, politicians, scientists and many others in dealing with the question of what role the media have in sharpening people’s awareness regarding the complex topic of climate change.” 
Yet, to the contrary, the stated objective of the conference is to sharpen the fear of climate catastrophe. That’s a big difference. 
You further confirm your denial of public fact, and contradict your own website announcement: 
“Deutsche Welle offers a forum for these discussions , and as a publicly funded broadcaster, does not represent a pre-decided opinion in one direction or another…”
For any normal German reader, it is obvious that the statements made in your letter are in direct contradiction to the publicly stated objective of the forum.  The forum Deutsche Welle is conducting does not in any way comply to the requirements for publicly funded media outlet, paid by the German taxpayer.
Thus we request once again that you cancel this one-sided, catastrophe-promoting conference. The public will be kept informed by us in the appropriate ways.
Yours sincerely,
Dr. H. Thuss,         Dipl. Ing M. Limburg, 
Präsident               EIKE Vizepäsident
Of course the conference began yesterday, and ends tomorrow. No word if some of the conference’s content has been removed in order to comply with the law. Don’t hold your breath. One can now safely say that one publicly funded media arm in Germany has officially gone from journalism to state-sponsored propoganda.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThanks to Tom Nelson for posting this. Thomas L. Friedman has earned a spot in my category: Lifestyles of the Rich and Alarmists. Normally I avoid riding on the coattails of other blogs,  but this time I’ll make an exception.If  Thomas Friedman walked around barefoot preaching his gospel like Kung Fu did, then I’d have a lot more respect for the guy. Now I have zero respect.  Like most environmental hypocrites, it’s: “do as I say, and not as I do”. But hey, they’re entitled to live like kings for all the important work they do in rescuing man and the planet.
The rest of us? Well we don’t really do anything important. All we do is impact the environment, and thus we ought to be relegated back to the mud and rice fields.
It never fails. Take almost any Hollywood star or elite left-winger, and you’ll see their environmental activism is invariably proportional to their wealth, A = kW. The same equation applies for their hypocrisy: H=kW, where k > 10.
Let’s take a look at some of the eco-features of his spread.
1. The pool looks to be about 30′ x 70′, no solar heating for it.
2. The asphalt 2-lane driveway is large and wide enough for a stretch limo to easily curve around.
3. No solar panels on the roof. The place is a virtual heat sink.
4. Judging from the angle of the sun and season, the house faces southwest, yet does nothing to take advantage of that. The south-facing windows are even modest in size.
5. Lots of carbon-storing trees were cleared away.
6. I count 3 chimneys – lots of heating.
7. There’s got to be at least 8 bathrooms in the place, who knows how many heated jacuzzis.
8. Even the white car parked outside doesn’t look like a hybrid.
It certainly tops Al Gore’s mansion (the one in Tennessee). But who knows, maybe he takes the hybrid once a week.

Share this...FacebookTwitter77 German scientists have signed an open letter to Chancellor Angela Merkel casting their doubt on the hypothesis of manmade CO2 emissions causing considerable global warming. The letter, drafted in 2009 by EIKE, continues today to gather signatures from scientists in Germany. Here is the German Letter with signatures, and here’s the English translation.
The open letter states:
…humans have had no measurable effect on global warming through CO2 emissions
and
More importantly, there’s a growing body of evidence showing anthropogenic CO2 plays little measurable role. Indeed CO2’s capability to absorb radiation is almost exhausted at today’s atmospheric concentrations. If CO2 did in fact have an effect and all fossil fuels were burned, then additional warming over the long-term would remain limited to only a few tenths of a degree.
The letter is also signed by more than 300 concerned citizens, many with doctorate, engineering and other professional titles.
Recently the online Franfurter Rundschau published some comments made by German über-alarmist Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and an advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel, implying that sceptics were hiding in anonymity and that scepticism was anti-scientific, saying:
Most of them [sceptics] operate from the safety of anonymity in the internet. They don’t try at all to do it successfully through a factual debate; rather they attempt to sow scepticism on science being an instrument to explain reality.
Perhaps the open letter will convince Herr Prof Dr Schellnhuber that the sceptics are not as anonymous as he would like to believe. Furthermore when it comes to debate, Schellnhuber employs the same tactic as Al Gore – running and hiding. Still, he is surely welcome to debate the issue at the  ICCC now taking place in Chicago. But don’t expect him to show up. He’s too busy scrambling to keep his science alive in Germany.

"It is not quite true that behind every great fortune lies a great crime. Musicians and novelists, for example, can become extremely rich by giving other people pleasure. But it does appear to be universally true that in front of every great fortune lies a great crime. Immense wealth translates automatically into immense environmental impacts, regardless of the intentions of those who possess it. The very wealthy, almost as a matter of definition, are committing ecocide.  A few weeks ago, I received a letter from a worker at a British private airport. “I see things that really shouldn’t be happening in 2019,” he wrote. Every day he sees Global 7000 jets, Gulfstream G650s and even Boeing 737s take off from the airport carrying a single passenger, mostly flying to Russia and the US. The private Boeing 737s, built to take 174 passengers, are filled at the airport with around 25,000 litres of fuel. That’s as much fossil energy as a small African town might use in a year. Where are these single passengers going? Perhaps to visit one of their superhomes, constructed and run at vast environmental cost, or to take a trip on their superyacht, which might burn 500 litres of diesel an hour just ticking over, and which is built and furnished with rare materials extracted at the expense of beautiful places. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised to learn that when Google convened a meeting of the rich and famous at the Verdura resort in Sicily in July to discuss climate breakdown, its delegates arrived in 114 private jets and a fleet of megayachts, and drove around the island in supercars. Even when they mean well, the ultrarich cannot help trashing the living world. A series of research papers shows that income is by far the most important determinant of environmental impact. It doesn’t matter how green you think you are; if you have surplus money, you spend it. The only form of consumption that’s clearly and positively correlated with good environmental intentions is diet: people who see themselves as green tend to eat less meat and more organic vegetables. But attitudes have little bearing on the amount of transport fuel, home energy and other materials you consume. Money conquers all. The disastrous effects of spending power are compounded by the psychological impacts of being wealthy. Plenty of studies show that the richer you are, the less you are able to connect with other people. Wealth suppresses empathy. One paper reveals that drivers in expensive cars are less likely to stop for people using pedestrian crossings than drivers in cheap cars. Another revealed that rich people were less able than poorer people to feel compassion towards children with cancer. Though they are disproportionately responsible for our environmental crises, the rich will be hurt least and last by planetary disaster, while the poor are hurt first and worst. The richer people are, the research suggests, the less such knowledge is likely to trouble them. Another issue is that wealth limits the perspectives of even the best-intentioned people. This week, Bill Gates argued in an interview with the Financial Times that divesting (ditching stocks) from fossil fuels is a waste of time. It would be better, he claimed, to pour money into disruptive new technologies with lower emissions. Of course we need new technologies. But he has missed the crucial point: in seeking to prevent climate breakdown, what counts is not what you do but what you stop doing. It doesn’t matter how many solar panels you install if you don’t simultaneously shut down coal and gas burners. Unless existing fossil fuel plants are retired before the end of their lives, and all exploration and development of new fossil fuel reserves is cancelled, there is little chance of preventing more than 1.5C of global heating. But this requires structural change, which involves political intervention as well as technological innovation: anathema to Silicon Valley billionaires. It demands an acknowledgement that money is not a magic wand that makes all the bad stuff go away. Tomorrow, I’ll be joining the global climate strike, in which adults will stand with the young people whose call to action has resonated around the world. As a freelancer, I’ve been wondering who I’m striking against. Myself? Yes: one aspect of myself, at least. Perhaps the most radical thing we can now do is to limit our material aspirations. The assumption on which governments and economists operate is that everyone strives to maximise their wealth. If we succeed in this task, we inevitably demolish our life support systems. Were the poor to live like the rich, and the rich to live like the oligarchs, we would destroy everything. The continued pursuit of wealth in a world that has enough already (albeit very poorly distributed) is a formula for mass destitution. A meaningful strike in defence of the living world is, in part, a strike against the desire to raise our incomes and accumulate wealth: a desire shaped, more than we are probably aware, by dominant social and economic narratives. I see myself as striking in support of a radical and disturbing concept: enough. Individually and collectively, it is time to decide what “enough” looks like, and how to know when we’ve achieved it. There’s a name for this approach, coined by the Belgian philosopher Ingrid Robeyns: limitarianism. Robeyns argues that there should be an upper limit to the amount of income and wealth a person can amass. Just as we recognise a poverty line, below which no one should fall, we should recognise a riches line, above which no one should rise. This call for a levelling down is perhaps the most blasphemous idea in contemporary discourse. But her arguments are sound. Surplus money allows some people to exercise inordinate power over others: in the workplace; in politics; and above all in the capture, use and destruction of the planet’s natural wealth. If everyone is to flourish, we cannot afford the rich. Nor can we afford our own aspirations, which the culture of wealth maximisation encourages. The grim truth is that the rich are able to live as they do only because others are poor: there is neither the physical nor ecological space for everyone to pursue private luxury. Instead we should strive for private sufficiency, public luxury. Life on Earth depends on moderation. • This article was amended on September 19 to remove an inaccurate reference to the world’s most expensive superyacht. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his latest video , Joe Bastardi gives his latest hurricane forecast.
Joe compares 2010 with 1950, a year the hurricane season started off late, but then did so with a vengeance. It produced 8 major hurricanes in 6 weeks. He sees 2010 having very similar conditions, and so he predicts the same pattern as 1950.
Joe also explains his theory that with global warming, the tendency will be less tropical storm activity because there will be less of a need to redistribute heat and pressure to the higher latitudes. That’s what hurricanes do.
So far for this year, Joe says:
Yet, we’ve had globally the weakest start to a hurricane season, Pacific basin and Atlantic basin, through the month of August so far. It’s just astounding how quiet it’s been – so far.
Joe doesn’t expect it to stay quiet. He’s telling you to fasten your seatbelt, because we are very likely in for some rough riding.

The press frets: Where are the hurricanes?

Meanwhile the generally sceptic Austrian online Die Presse has a story called Weather: Were Are The Hurricanes?  (Notice how when the hurricanes don’t show up, it’s called “weather”. Die Presse quotes the NOAA:
There are no tropical cyclones at this time.
What can the alarmist media do without the promised hurricanes and the calamity they deliver? Die Presse writes:
They should have arrived a long time ago. The hurricane season goes from June 1 until November 30, and the fanfare from the US press was shriller than usual back in May: It’s the five-year anniversary of Katrina, the storm that devastated New Orleans. ‘The 2010 hurricane season could be a monster, warned Time on May 26.
Die Presse explains that weak hurricane activity last year was due to the El Nino blocking effect. But this year La Nina is developing, and so the coast is clear for the hurricane parade. But the media so far has fretted:
Now El Niño is out of the way, La Niña rules and clears the path for hurricanes. First came one, Alex, in June, followed by Bonnie in July, which did not even reach hurricane status, and Colin in early August, which also amounted to nothing.
But the media ought not fret too much. If Joe is right, the chasers of destruction in the media will get plenty to hyperventilate about soon enough. Then they’ll be categorising hurricanes under “climate”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYou’ll recall that WUWT reported here  a couple days ago on NASA’s warnings of “huge space storms” causing devastation in 2013 or so.  Well, one leading Russian scientist has something to say about it.The German edition of the online Russian RIA Novosti has a report today called: World Catastrophe in 2013? Russian Solar Scientist Is Sceptical. Astrophysicist Sergei Bogatchov told RIA Novosti yesterday:
Today there exists no scientific basis that allows the condition of the earth and the sun to be predicted over such a time period.
Mr. Bogatchov researches at the Laboratory for Solar X-Ray Astronomy at the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Scientists indeed expect a peak in solar activity in 2013, but nobody can say how strong it’s going to be.
Moreover RIA Novosti reports,
The current solar slumber extending to 2013 also cannot be excluded.
And adds background info for its readers:
In the past weeks the media quoted the Head of NASA’s Heliophysics Division, Richard Fisher, that unprecedented solar eruptions are to be expected. That could mean disruptions in satellites, shutdowns in navigation systems and power grids.
So there you have it. A leading Russian scientist is scratching his head wondering how NASA scientists could possibly come up with such a prognosis.
My guess is probably the same way they make their climate projections: Conjure up a catastrophe scenario, insist it withstands rigorous review, get the media and idiot politicians to believe it, and then get more funding!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Klimazwiebel blog run by Prof. Hans von Storch brings our attention to a newly released Dutch report on the IPCC. The report is published by the Rathenau Institute and is titled:
Room for Climate Debate:
Perspectives on the interaction between climate politics, science and
the media,
It is written by Jeroen van der Sluijs, Rinie van Est and Monique Riphagen. It’s lengthy, but the abstract sums it up. You can read the abstract in full at von Storch’s site.

The Rathenau report looks at the interaction of science and politics. It concludes that politics has come to rely on science to tell it what to do. More science means more knowledge, and thus less uncertainty. The problem, however, is that this approach leaves little space for debate. As a result, the political debate moves to science, which in turn leads to politicised science.
The authors recommend more dissent be allowed in the process, which will certainly not be welcome by those who have hijacked the scientific process for the purpose of achieving political aims.
In the abstract the authors write:
To depoliticise science and offer more room for the political debate, more space should be given to dissent opinions, sceptic as well as alarmistic. More openness about uncertainties in scientific knowledge and more room for these dissent scientific views in the IPCC reports would restore the political debate and enhance societies’ capacity to deal with this uncertainty.
Keep in mind that the InterAcademy Council will publish its evaluation of the IPCC this month.  Climate science has come under heavy fire since Climategate and the discovery of mistakes, gaffes and alarmist exaggerations in the last IPCC report.
The IPCC process is broken, and needs to be overhauled. Will the InterAcademy Counciltake the Rathenau Institute’s advice and allow dissent, or will it be just another corrupt whitewash?
Both, politics and science can work only if they are open to dissenting view and opinions. Anything else is authoritarian.

"This Friday’s school strike, which adults around the world have been asked to join, is the largest mobilisation yet attempted by the youth climate movement launched last year by the Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. As such, it is an event of international significance. History shows not only that social change is possible, even when the interests ranged against it are formidable, but that peaceful protest is among the most effective ways to bring it about. The campaigns against slavery, for female suffrage and for workers’ and civil rights, as well as the independence movements of former colonies including India, all harnessed new forms of civic participation and activism to the cause of progress. Movements on behalf of people who lack voting rights, of course, have little choice but to try to exercise influence outside the ballot box. As adults in democracies, we have become used to making our political choices in elections, with only a small minority in most countries actively involved in parties or campaigning. That does not mean political action should end there. And except for 16- and 17-year-olds in a handful of countries, children cannot vote. If they want their voices to be heard they must seek other means – such as a school strike. Some of the young people demonstrating on Friday will have been influenced by adults. But teenagers, who are typically rebellious and open to new ideas, have been important in social movements before. No one should be surprised if young people are more alarmed than their grandparents about effects that are predicted to become more severe in 20 or 30 years’ time. Hundreds of newsrooms around the world are banding together this week to commit their pages and air time to what may be the most consequential story of our time. As world leaders descend on New York for the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September  – and millions of activists prepare for a global climate strike on 20 September – the media partnership Covering Climate Now is launching its first large-scale collaboration to increase climate coverage in the global media and focus public attention on this emergency. The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, which was founded earlier this year by the Columbia Journalism Review  and the Nation. The partnership currently includes 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people. The network represents every corner of the media including TV networks (CBS News, Al Jazeera), newspapers (El País, the Toronto Star), digital players (BuzzFeed, HuffPost, Vox), wire services (Getty Images, Bloomberg), magazines (Nature, Science), and dozens of podcasts, local publishers, radio and TV stations. You can learn more about the initiative here. It is the simplicity of the movement’s message, as well as the youth and determination of the protesters, that has made them unignorable. Less than a year ago, the world’s leading climate scientists issued a warning that we are running out of time to avert the worst effects of global heating, at a meeting at which some scientists were reported to be in tears. Temperatures are continuing to rise and the effects are already punishing, particularly in poorer parts of the world. But increases of more than 1.5 degrees celsius would lead, scientists warn, to food scarcity and water stress for hundreds of millions more people. Heat-related deaths, forest fires and mass displacements by flooding become far more likely in this scenario, while for species including coral the consequence would be extinction. Yet despite these dire warnings and the attempts at decarbonisation overseen since 1988 by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world is failing. Carbon emissions in 2018 reached a record high of 37.1bn tonnes. There has been some progress, measurable in pledges by governments and notably a decade of emissions cuts in the EU. The profile of green issues is higher, the cost of renewables is falling fast and public opinion in many countries is shifting. But our path is taking us towards a painful and dangerous future. The climate strikers demand that the world faces these facts. Their aim is to force us to confront a problem that, for far too long, we have found it convenient to ignore. When Greta Thunberg and other young campaigners met US legislators this week, it was to assert their right to a livable future. In a short film with George Monbiot, also this week, she was more specific, advocating the protection and restoration of ecosystems as a natural climate solution. A reckoning is overdue with those who, seeking to avoid the transition to clean energy, misled the public. Without the lost decades of inaction and denial, global heating need never have become the emergency it now is. Many politicians as well as fossil fuel industry executives and lobbyists are deeply culpable. But Friday is an opportunity to take action – as the Guardian is doing by declaring a climate emergency.  Environmental campaigners, scientists and others deserve praise for their climate work over many decades. That we are nowhere near where we should be, in spite of their efforts and knowledge, is a cause for anger. The freshness and seriousness of the school strike movement is a reason to hope."
"With just under 7,000 GP surgeries in England seeing millions of patients each week, family doctors can also have a dramatic impact on reducing emissions in the NHS. According to the NHS Sustainable Development Unit, pharmaceuticals are the biggest cause of emissions in primary care and make up 18% of the NHS’s total emissions. Reducing unnecessary prescriptions and single-use plastic blister packs for small medicines will make a big difference, as well as cutting costs, says Karen Creffield, practice manager at Frome medical practice, in Somerset, which is trying to cut its carbon footprint.  The practice has identified a number of areas where it hopes to “de-prescribe”: opioid reduction, hypnotics and antidepressants and reviewing patients taking seven or more medications. It is also promoting inhaler recycling and switching to more sustainable inhalers. Most asthma sufferers use metered dose inhalers, which use hydrofluorocarbons to propel the medicine into the airways. But these gases are much more potent than CO2. They make up 70% of inhalers prescribed by the NHS, but only 10% in Sweden. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence wants doctors to follow the Swedes’ example and consider prescribing dry-powder inhalers that provide the same medicines without the greenhouse gas emissions instead. Simply switching to lower carbon inhalers would reduce total emissions by 4%, according to the NHS long-term plan. The Royal College of GPs funds a green impact for health toolkit to help practices reduce their environmental footprint. “We want to promote actions in our practices for ourselves and our patients that are good for youthem and good for the planet,” says Terry Kemple, the former RCGP president and sustainability lead. In Frome all the practice staff are asked about their contribution towards sustainability in their appraisals, while a green impact policy emphasises the importance of turning off lights and electrical equipment. Its procurement policy prioritises working with suppliers who are committed to reducing their emissions. “All our tea and coffee is fair trade, we only use local companies for catering who are committed to locally sourced, fair trade and organic produce (where possible), says Creffield. “This includes healthy snacks at meetings (avoiding palm oil for example).” By sending more text messages to patients instead of letters, it has cut paper use significantly. Staff are encouraged to walk or cycle to work and the practice has two electric vehicle charging points."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Die Zeit reports here that a Canadian court has ruled in favour of the Inuit Indians, forbidding a planned Arctic expedition by Germany’s alarmist Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in the Lancaster Sound. Reports show that the German expedition may have included Arctic oil and gas exploration.
The AWI’s Polarstern research vessel was ordered to pack up and leave. Now it’s off the coast of Greenland.
Die Zeit writes:
A historic victory will be celebrated in Nunavut. This is the first time a Canadian court recognises the cultural and territorial rights of the Inuits, says a pleased Okalik Eegeesiak, President of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association in Canada.
What makes the story interesting is that the German scientists were not only getting ready to conduct sea ice and water studies, but appear to have been commissioned to conduct oil and gas exploration.

Works were planned to study the rotation of Greenland plates in the Paleocene and Eocene, 40 to 60 million years ago, says Die Zeit.
Die Zeit writes that the fine print in the project description submitted to Canadian authorities in Ottawa for approval (which was granted) included investigating the potential for single sediment basins for the formation of hydrocarbons. 
Hydrocarbons?

Oops! Was the Alfred Wegener Institute getting ready to conduct oil and gas exploration work on behalf of Canada and Germany under the guise of Arctic research? They all deny it.
The Polarstern planned to use air gun blasts for taking seismic readings of the seabed. The Inuit saw this opening, and exploited it, claiming that blasts would drive the seals and Arctic wildlife away. They took it  to court, and won.
Die Zeit also writes that this one particular expedition was not overseen by the Alfred Wegener Institute, as is usually the case, but by the German Ministry for Geosciences and Natural Resources. This ministry is a subordinate of the Ministry of Economics and is responsible for securing the supply of natural resources to Germany.
Hmmm. And all this time I thought these scientists were out there measuring the ice. C’mon, just put 2 and 2 together.
For the German research team, which was in the Baffin Bay getting ready to start its studies when the ruling was made, it’s the first time in 28 years that it has been forbidden to conduct research there. Last year the Inuits had protested a Polarstern expedition, but were unsuccessful.
Sure the ruling is a blow for Arctic oil exploration, but it’s not like we were ever going to get it anyway. The Arctic ice is coming back.
At least now we’re pretty sure what it’s really all about for the goody-too-green Germans and Canadians – oil!

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis is global warming, says the NOAA
Remember all those reports about how snow in the wintertime would be so seldom that it would be exciting, permafrost would melt, and palm trees possibly spreading to northern Europe? This all due to AGW. Well, according to the prominent online Sueddeutsche Zeitung (South German News), there’s been some, errr, adjustments to climate models, or something. Forget all them warming scenarios. The Suddeutsche Zeitung reports today the following:
Climate change could lead to especially cold winters to precisely large industrial nations in Europe, North America and Asia. The cause of all this is the irreversible disappearance of Arctic ice, says James Overland of the American weather adminstration NOAA.
and Overland is quoted as saying:
Cold and snowy winters will become more the rule than the exception.
Overland made these comments last Friday at a conference at the end of the International Polar Year in Oslo. Last winter was just a taste of what could possibly happen in Europe and in the USA.
Overland says that a warmer Arctic polar region leads to the development of stable cold highs in the north, which in turn pump cold Arctic air down to the middle latitudes, which include Germany, Great Britain and France.
Normally European countries are supplied with warmer, more moist Atlantic air that keeps winters on the mild side. But in the future, cold will predominate.
So take note all you tree-hugging Europeans: global warming means cold harsh winters. Don’t forget we told you so! It all fits with catastrophic AGW. Yes, it sounds crazy, but that’s what it is. So If some wacked out denialist brings up cold winters as an argument to refute AGW, then just tell them that to the contrary, it just proves AGW!
Update:
One Süddeutsche Zeitung reader Reinhard Boesch reacts, like many others, as follows:
I’ve been reading for 20 years now in the science section of your paper about the climate catastrophe, the greatest catastrophe in human history. This was fully supported by Graßl, Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf, with your editors prophesising red-hot summers, rainy winters and the end of skiing below elevations of 1500m. The fundamental science underpinning these claims was beyond doubt (settled) and anyone who dared to challenge the science was first labelled as a climate sceptic, then as a denier, and finally marginalised as a flatearther. But now it’s going to get colder because it’s getting warmer. Perhaps we should handle science reports like stock reports – ignore them and just take them as they come.

"Moderate congressional Democrats worried about the infeasibility of passing the kind of sweeping climate legislation their progressive counterparts are proposing, such as the Green New Deal, are laying out their own policies. The New Democrat Coalition released an 11-page outline of principles on Wednesday, along with a list of bills to back them up, advocating for incremental and “pro-market” steps to cut pollution. Their pitch comes as the Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg visits Capitol Hill to tell US lawmakers they just aren’t trying hard enough, and young people inspire global climate strikes this Friday ahead of the UN climate change summit next week. “Congress has been working for years on powerful, proven policy solutions,” they say. “Our challenge is to build on those efforts and push past entrenched partisan fights to secure durable climate legislation that ensures we lead the global transition in combatting climate change.” The New Democrats want to set a clean energy standard, encourage nuclear power and clean up methane leaks from oil and gas companies. They say they want to get carbon pollution to net-zero by 2050, calling the climate problem “unquestionably urgent”. Progressives, by comparison, have penned the Green New Deal, a blueprint for rapidly cutting heat-trapping pollution while fighting societal inequity. But the document, sponsored by the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is not legislation and does not spell out specific policy changes. The difference in the proposals highlights a rift between Democrats that is also on display with the 2020 presidential candidates. More centrist politicians worry about playing into Republican messaging that climate-focused Democrats want to ban cheeseburgers and end air travel. And they say lawmakers should focus on what is politically achievable. Progressives say the climate crisis requires radical change. Where Sanders has called for spending $16.3tn on climate goals and for going to war with fossil fuel companies, former vice-president Joe Biden would commit $1.7tn and has struggled to commit to phasing out the US natural gas that is contributing to heating the planet. Congressman Scott Peters, vice-chair of the New Democrats, maintained that his group’s proposals aren’t inconsistent with a Green New Deal and said some might be able to gain necessary support from conservatives. Peters said “rather than arguing about a political tool like the Green New Deal”, Democrats should be making plans. Peters acknowledged his group has more to do, noting that their package of legislation doesn’t include a plan to tax carbon pollution. But he said “this is what you need to do to start a path to net-zero by mid-century”. That’s the goal the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has laid out for keeping temperatures from rising unacceptably higher. “We really don’t have time to waste,” he said."
"The climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has bluntly told members of Congress to heed scientists’ warnings over global heating on a day when the existential anguish of young activists was given a voice at the heart of Washington DC power. Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who has ignited a global youth climate movement, said at a congressional hearing that she had no prepared remarks other than to submit the landmark IPCC report, published last year, that warned of the rapidly approaching catastrophe of global heating. “I don’t want you to listen to me, I want you to listen to the scientists,” Thunberg told the US lawmakers. “I want you to unite behind the science and I want you to take real action.” Thunberg told the joint House of Representatives committee that she was “furious” when she first learned of the climate crisis, adding that “it should be taken for granted” that climate science was accepted and acted upon. The 16-year-old was given a largely respectful reception by US politicians who remain deeply split over the urgency, and even the veracity, of the climate crisis. The hearing came on a day when Donald Trump’s administration, which has reversed the major climate policies put in place by Barack Obama, sought to hobble California’s ability to enact stricter emissions standards for cars and trucks. The Republican members of the committee, however, praised the efforts of Thunberg and acknowledged the reality of climate change. “I agree we need to take aggressive action,” said Garret Graves, a Louisiana Republican known for a firmer embrace of climate science than many others in his party. Graves did gently spar with Thunberg over his repeated assertion that China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, should be the main target of activist ire. Thunberg, who arrived in the US in August on a solar-powered yacht, was asked by Graves what she would do if she saw another boat throw rubbish into the sea. “I would tell [the] other boat to stop dumping trash in the ocean,” she said. She then told Graves: “I am from Sweden, a small country, and it’s the same argument: ‘Why should we do something? Look at the US.’ It’s being used against you as well.” Members of Congress heard from other young climate activists who explained the trauma of growing up in a world primed for greater floods, storms, heatwaves and unrest because of rising global temperatures. “This should fill you with shame. Youth climate activism should not exist,” said Jamie Margolin, a 17-year-old who told of choking wildfire smoke in recent summers in her native Washington state. Margolin said her fellow students suffer anxiety and a “weird form of nihilism” where they wonder if it’s worthwhile making future plans. “There’s depression and fear,” she said. “It’s devastating and scary and also feels like we’ve been betrayed. It is shameful and cowardly to not take action. How can we call ourselves an example for the world if we are going to be cowards and not do anything?” Bill Keating, a Massachusetts Democrat who chaired the hearing, said he was sorry that young people had to come to Washington DC to plead for greater action. “Our generation has failed to adequately address our climate crisis,” he said. “This failure isn’t fatal, yet our failure to change will be. We wouldn’t be in this situation right now – our witnesses would be safely and happily in school pursuing their dreams and not protesting and pushing their governments to act – if everyone was already doing their part.” At a news conference following the hearing, plaintiffs in a lawsuit that alleges the US government violated young people’s rights by abetting activities that have contributed to global warming, called for legal action to force greater movement on climate change from the US. “We are very fortunate in this country that we have three branches of government so that when there are branches of government that are actively harming our children, and have done so knowingly over the last 50 years by creating an energy system based on fossil fuels, the courts can step in to protect the rights of our children,” said Andrea Rodgers, a staff attorney at Our Children’s Trust, which is representing the young people in the case. The committee was the latest stop in a long series of events for Thunberg, who last year started to skip school every Friday in order to protest against inaction over the climate crisis. Her stance spawned a global strike movement that will escalate on Friday when adults, as well as students, will walk out of their workplaces over the emergency. The protests come ahead of a UN climate summit in New York next week where governments will be urged to strengthen their efforts to cut emissions. The world is currently on track to surpass a warming limit of 2C agreed to in the Paris climate agreement, with major emitters such as the US and Brazil now headed by leaders who have questioned climate science and enthusiastically back mining and logging that causes the release of planet-warming gases. Greta Thunberg rounded off her two-day tour of Capitol Hill with a 15-minute address to around 150 people. The teenage activist looked a little nervous at first as she took the lectern under a giant chandelier in a grand committee room, but then smiled as she resumed her call to arms against the climate crisis.“The USA is the biggest carbon polluter in history,” she told the audience. “It is also the world’s number one producer of oil. It is also the only nation to signal its intention to leave the Paris climate agreement because it was ‘a bad deal’.”Speaking softly, she modulated her voice slightly to make clear she was quoting, disapprovingly, Trump with the words “a bad deal”.Thunberg invoked Martin Luther King’s struggle for civil rights and John F Kennedy’s goals that included landing a man on the moon – “not because they are easy, but because they are hard”, – to plead with Washington to lead in the fight, even if it seems impossible. “Giving up can never be an option,” she said. The speech was greeted with a standing ovation and followed by a panel discussion. Thunberg, due to take a train to New York on Wednesday night, was asked about her observations of the way Washington works. She replied: “It’s definitely more calm than I thought. Everything is just happening so slow and people are just repeating the same things over and over again. “I have heard so many politicians here say the same things over and over again. If it continues like that, we’re not going to get anywhere.” She also had a message for those who feel depressed or paralysed by the scale of the crisis. “I started to do something, take action, try to make a difference instead of sitting in despair. That changed my life. It gives your life meaning … To know you can have impact, it makes you feel a lot better.”"

Calamitologist at work.
Last week I asked readers to submit their own essays: Wanted! Readers As Guest Writers. Well, I’m happy to present the first one! Ed Caryl observes that skeptics tend to have more training and real life experience in the art of forecasting than warmists do. So who should we believe? Yeah, it’s a tough question. 
   
Chicken Little Was A Calamitologist 
By Ed Caryl 
Many writers have been unsatisfied with the terms used to classify the two sides of the climate debate. Warmist and skeptic seem unsatisfying for the first, and demeaning for the second. The warmist label is also a bit narrow, in that those on that side also preach ocean rise and acidification, severe storms, floods and droughts (on alternate days), and other disasters. Many of these predictions take on a “the sky is falling” tone. The warmists call themselves climatologists, but that term is a job description, not a degree. A better description would be calamitologist – one who envisions climate calamities. Let’s look at a few resumes of some famous calamitologists. 
Dr. Michael Mann: received his Doctorate from Yale, the Department of Geology and Geophysics in 1998. His undergraduate degrees are in Physics and Math.
Dr. Phil Jones: holds a BA degree in Environmental Sciences from the University of Lancaster, and a Masters and PhD from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
Dr. James Hansen: holds a BA degree in Physics and Mathematics, an MS in Astronomy, and a PhD in Physics, all from the University of Iowa. Early in his career he spent almost 20 years studying Venus. His calamitologist creds are based on that work.
Dr. R. K. Pachauri: studied at North Carolina State University, where he obtained an MS in Industrial Engineering in 1972, a PhD in Industrial Engineering and a PhD in Economics, a native of India.
Dr. Gavin Schmidt: BA (Hons) in Mathematics at Jesus College, Oxford University, PhD in Applied Mathematics at University College London.

The calamitologists, we notice, tend not to be trained and experienced in the actual science of forecasting. Just the seasonal forecast track record of the Met Office says it all. 
What about the other side, the skeptics?
Many among the “skeptics” are meteorologists who, unlike most calamitologists, are formally trained in forecasting and have gathered years of experience doing so. Some examples: 
Dr. Roy Spencer: B.S. in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Michigan; M.S. and Ph.D. in Meteorology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.
Joe Bastardi: BS in Meteorology from Penn State University, a practicing meteorologist with AccuWeather.
Anthony Watts: practicing meteorologist, AMS Seal holder.
Joe D’Aleo: Weather Channel founder, practicing meteorologist.
Dr. Richard S. Lindzen: Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A.B in Physics, S.M. in Applied Mathematics, Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Harvard 
These are just a few of the names known in this controversy, but can you see the trend? Although the calamitologists have advanced degrees, usually in natural sciences, they lack training and experience in forecasting. That’s probably the reason why they often forecast long-shot calamity scenarios. 
On the other hand, the meteorologists are real forecasters, and their success depends on the accuracy of their forecasts. Every time they make a forecast, they put their reputations on the line. Sure, some will argue, weather forecasting is not the same. But if you can’t forecast a week or two ahead, can you reliably forecast 50 or 100 years ahead? Be honest. 
Indeed the more a person is trained in the science of forecasting, the more skeptical they appear to become of the AGW hypothesis and the ability for models to predict longterm climate. Real forecasters seriously doubt CAGW. 
Perhaps in the future we ought to refer to the two sides as calamitologists and real forecasters.

"In the New South Wales town of Wollar you can’t hear children laughing in the school playground any more. Coal has silenced the schoolyard, coated the remaining houses in a layer of dust and cut off the future of our community, just as it is doing to our children’s future on a global scale. When the world takes part in the climate strike on Friday, those with a remaining connection to Wollar will strike too, at the empty local school.  Our school is empty because the state and federal governments put coal above the needs of our children, allowing Peabody’s coalmine expansions to swallow up this town. 350 people once lived in Wollar, before Peabody’s Wilpinjong coalmine was allowed to destroy the countryside and our town. The primary school and the shop were once the hub and lifeline for this community. Folks from all walks of life worked and played together here. It was an ideal place for children to grow up. As the Wilpinjong coalmine expanded, families moved out of Wollar. The mining company bought the shop and bought out locals. This process of negotiation was very stressful. People were asked to sign confidentiality agreements, pitching the community against each other. During this process people became ill, divorced and displaced. To locals it seemed as though the company never encouraged mining families to move to the village and send their children to the Wollar school. Remaining families complained of rent increases in Peabody-owned companies and soon left Wollar. As student numbers dwindled, Wollar school was put into recess. Recess should be when children go into the playground. It should be a time when kids can play and learn life skills. It should not mean the end of a child’s community. Since last December, there’s been no more laughter, songs, balls over the fence or indeed any life at all at Wollar school. When it went into recess, Kay Bushnell, the school’s principal, observed that “the last vestige of identity has gone”. To say coal is stealing our children’s future is not dramatic. We have known since the 1970s that coal is driving climate change, fiercer bushfires, droughts, heatwaves and storms. What coal has done to Wollar is being played out around the world in every community devastated by a record-breaking weather event, with residents left to pick up the pieces while the coal companies continue to profit. Our town is now a ghost town, with a dirty coalmine charging closer as you read. Who would want to send their children to a school with coal dust in the drinking water, the roar of a mine in the background, and trucks careering by the school gate? The permanent closure of our school is imminent but some still call this progress. I call it an emergency for human life and a lesson. We need to learn from the story of Wollar. The students that have started the climate strike movement in Australia are now asking us adults to listen and to act. We can’t afford to leave it any longer. We can’t afford to wait until coal swallows up the future of all of Australia’s children. We must get active now. • Alison Smiles-Schmidt used to work at Wollar school. She is the manager of a nursery in Mudgee"
"The Queensland government sought the input of the mining lobby on new laws, introduced into state parliament, designed to stop acts of civil disobedience by protesters using “dangerous attachment devices”. The controversial legislation introduced on Thursday proposes new penalties for activists who block transport infrastructure or business access and use locking devices to prevent their removal. Police will be given new powers to search people and vehicles suspected of carrying such devices.  In recent months, climate change activists have ramped up efforts to disrupt the coalmining sector, including by blocking machinery and freight routes. There is a dedicated campaign to disrupt the activities of businesses bidding for contracts with the Adani Carmichael project. In explanatory notes to the new laws, the government says the peak mining lobby group, the Queensland Resources Council, was consulted on the legislation, alongside civil liberties groups and others. The Queensland Greens MP Michael Berkman said he was “barely surprised” the government sought the mining sector’s input. “It just makes it crystal clear that this legislation is really about protecting Labor’s fossil fuel donors and obscuring their climate hypocrisy,” he said. The laws were announced last month largely in response to climate protests that had blocked commuter roads in Brisbane. The government has now softened much of its language initially used to justify the laws, including branding activists as “extremists” and making unsubstantiated claims about their intentions. The state premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said last month that climate activists were using “sinister tactics” and devices laced with booby traps that were “designed to harm”. Police have never made any such accusation against a protester, and the government has not supplied evidence to support such claims. In tabling the draft legislation on Thursday, the police minister, Mark Ryan, acknowledged the intent of such “locking” devices was to prevent or delay the removal of protesters. “Some people have also made use of bespoke items that have been constructed or designed to defeat attempts to remove them,” Ryan said. He told parliament that “it has been reported some people have claimed” to have placed glass or aerosol canisters inside devices. The only reports of such claims were based on the premier’s initial speech to parliament in August. “These types of [dangerous attachment devices] represent a real risk of injury or death to a person, emergency service workers and the public as the incorrect disassembly or removal of these devices may lead to serious injuries, not only for the person attached to the device but anyone in the vicinity,” Ryan told parliament. The laws outline new fines and potential jail terms for people who use locking devices during protests – up to $6,500 or two years in prison for people who block transport infrastructure, and $2,600 and one year in prison for those who block business access. Berkman said the laws were unfounded, unnecessary and dangerously anti-democratic. “Minister Ryan was clearly feeding us lies recently when he said that protesters were ‘booby-trapping’ devices. “The actions supposedly targeted by this bill are already illegal, this is obviously just about politics and vilifying peaceful protesters.” In explanatory notes, tabled alongside the new bill, the government outlined that it believed public order and safety outweighed the right to peaceful assembly. “The introduction of new offences ... to prohibit the use of a dangerous attachment device may impact on those persons who wish to use these devices when exercising their right to peacefully assemble. “However, this right has to be balanced against considerations about public order and safety and the rights and freedoms of others affected by the assembly. These dangerous attachment devices may cause a real risk of injury or death to a person or persons using the device, emergency service workers and the public when attempts are made to disassemble these devices.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA heat wave in Russia, a flood in Pakistan and a calving glacier in Greenland were enough to trigger mass hysteria in Germany. The warmists pulled out their hair, socialites fainted, re-insurers went bezerk and the German media screamed bloody climate murder. Really.
Meanwhile the rest of Germany relaxed on their long holidays and yawned. So it’s only fitting that somebody step up and offer a message of calm to the bedwetters.
German online Die Welt has a piece by Ulli Kulke titled Enough with the Panic Slogans of Climate Chaos. It’s an attempt to deliver a message of calm and reason, one that is sorely needed by Germany’s irrational media.
First he explains that this year was a warm one, but so was 12 years ago – 1998, due to a strong El Nino effect. And he points out that the blazing heat in the northern hemispehere strangely could not stop Arctic sea ice from increasing in size compared to the years before. The Antarctic sea ice is growing too.

But, writes Kulke, has a lot to do with other factors other than temperature, namely precipitation and wind conditions, Kulke writes:
The Arctic ice is not a suitable instrument as a thermometer for measuring global climate, for warming or cooling.
Also Kulke points out that the media already proclaiming the year to be the hottest on record, long before it’s finished, has become an annual media event in Germany. Kulke writes:

When you look back at the archives, you’ll find that a lot of years were declared the all-time warmest already when just one or two especially warm months were measured. At the end of the year, of course, they turned out not to be the hottest. That has occurred year after year since 1998, which, according to measurements, was the hottest in over 100 years. This has contributed to warming inflation in the minds of the people.

And what about all the natural catastrophes occurring this summer? Is there a connection with climate change? Kulke rightfully points out that there’s no statistical evidence of this when one looks back at decades of records. It was not long ago, 2005, when many claimed hurricanes like Katrina were proof of global warming. Since then hurricanes have been almost off the radar.
Concerning the Russian fires, Kulke writes:

Also the fires in Russia were not examples. Their extent this year was not more than in previous years. To the contrary, the only (deadly) difference: this year the fires occurred near metropolis Moscow and thus got more interest from the international media.

Even in famous magazine New Scientist climate scientists have shown that solar activity was responsible for the blocking weather patterns that led to the extremes in Russia and Pakistan. Kulke writes:

In fact, the situation in Pakistan actually contradicts the popular version of climate scientists. They’ve always claimed that monsoons were especially weak in South Asia during El-Nino years, with droughts even occurring. This year that’s not the case, as is clear looking at the awful images shown on TV every evening. No drought there this El Nino year.

Finally Kulke advises those looking for weather records to go to Ham Weather, where you’ll find that weather records, hot and cold, occur every day, every week, every year…after year, after year, after year. That’s nature.
But don’t expect a change from the German media. Words of reason probably will not cure their incontinence.

"In a cold, dingy room at the back of a Loughborough pub, maths student Steff Farley would meet with friends to discuss an issue they felt no one was talking about on campus. These conversations over a few pints were the start of a campaign that would eventually push the university to divest from fossil fuels. The students ran peaceful, relatively small demonstrations; they’d hand out leaflets about Loughborough’s fossil fuel investments during open days, or write fossil-free slogans in chalk on the campus grounds. “We started off small,” Farley says. “We decided that students should be able to demand from our university what we deserve.” Although university campuses have historically been spaces for activism, Farley felt Loughborough was fairly apolitical. “There were a couple of general leftwing groups but they both fizzled out.” But things are beginning to change: “This environmental campaign is sticking around.”  Farley, who is a member of People & Planet, a UK-wide student network that pushes for environmental justice, has seen support grow as groups like Extinction Rebellion and the school strikers made headlines. “You need other students to believe in what you’re doing,” she says. “A lot of people feel powerless. But when you join an activist group, it’s healing to finally be doing something. A lot of hope comes from it.” The past year has seen millions of students skip school or college to strike over government inaction on the climate emergency, and they’re set to return to the streets on 20 September. Organisers say that university students have been prominently involved too. The National Union of Students (NUS), which has been monitoring attitudes towards the environment since 2014, says 91% of students are “fairly or very concerned” about climate breakdown; 80% want their institution to be doing more on sustainable development, while 60% want to learn more about sustainability. Paris Palmano, a student activist at the University of Sussex, set up the Climate Action Movement with two friends in 2017, a university society aimed at improving education on climate crisis. At meetings students discuss climate issues, policy, science and possible solutions. “It’s a space for young people to discuss and gain a perspective on this stuff. It’s not offered by any societies; I imagine if you’re on the right master’s course you do learn this stuff, but it’s not accessible,” he says.  Members have gone on to become key organisers of the local youth strikes and Extinction Rebellion’s youth group. Palmano and another student at Sussex were even claimants on a major climate change lawsuit against the UK government. The lawsuit said the government’s 2050 carbon target didn’t meet the science or its legal obligations to the Paris agreement. They lost the case, but the impact has been far-reaching: the government’s climate change committee issued a review of the 2050 carbon target. “We’re not going to solve climate change in a courtroom. It’s going to be this much wider societal process of changing the opinions and culture until the politics doesn’t fit the culture any more, and then the politics will change,” he says. Campus can be a platform for changing culture. “It’s the perfect space to disrupt and partake in these kinds of things,” says Mary-Jane Farrell, a student at Sussex who organises the youth strikes in Brighton. “The grounds can allow you to be radical.” Palmaro adds: “The main reason I’ve been able to do this so consistently and so relentlessly is because I’m a student. The academia I’m involved with is enough to make me angry, and the spare time I have is enough to make me active.” But students are operating in a difficult environment. Although many universities across the country are leading in climate science and research, institutions themselves are lagging behind when it comes to confronting the climate emergency. According to the University green rankings by People and Planet, two-thirds of UK universities are likely to fail their 2020 targets for reducing carbon emissions. It doesn’t mean the climate movement isn’t visible on campus – the University of Manchester, for example, hasn’t divested from fossil fuels despite a persistent campaign from students at Fossil Free. This has given rise to splinter activist groups: an Extinction Rebellion youth group has launched at Manchester students’ union. In December, sabbatical officer Lizzy Haughten set up a zero-waste shop on campus, selling sustainable products made by students, such as bath soaps and beeswax wrap. It has been so popular that the shop has opened in a new location at a university building in the city. “While setting up a zero-waste shop is not going to save the world, it’s things like this that need to be in place when the government realises we need to change,” Haughten says. “Things like Extinction Rebellion and zero waste can work together – Extinction Rebellion demands government to make the changes, then there are already things in place that show these changes work.” Harriet Thew, a postgraduate researcher on youth participation in global climate governance at the University of Leeds, says the movement’s reach has gone beyond the student body – in February more than 200 academics voiced their support for the youth strikes. Meanwhile, the lecturers’ trade union is calling on members to walk out in support of young people in the school strikes on 20 September. “It’s challenging that relationship we have with the younger generation – it’s not about hoping they’ll do things in the future. Staff are now facing questions of intergenerational justice head on,” says Thew. In Brighton, Farrell is preparing for the next global youth strikes, predicted to be the biggest yet. “What’s so refreshing about having uni students come along with secondary school, primary school [pupils], is that the youth generation is united,” she says. “It really breaks down the barrier between academia and primary level education, which directly challenges the educational system we are demanding to be reformed.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve gotten into a bit of a squabble at Georg Hoffmann’s blog concerning Henrik Svensmark’s cosmic ray cloud-seeding hypothesis.
Hoffmann cites two recent papers that investigate Forbush decreases and their impacts on clouds, and thus climate. The two papers reach different conclusions.
The first paper is by Calogovic et al. (Jürg Beers Gruppe) in GRL, which analyses the 26 strongest Forbush events beginning in 1989 and compares them to ISCCP cloud data. This Calogovic paper finds nothing. No systematic changes in low cloud cover were associated with Forbush events.

The second paper by a German team, Rohs et al, appeared in the Journal of Geophysical Research and found a faint but detectable correlation that seems to contradict Svensmark’s hypothesis that low, earth-cooling clouds would be produced. Rather, Rohs et al finds that high, earth-warming type cirrus clouds are produced instead.
That would be astonishing because it would mean that periods of low solar activity would cause warm periods, and not cold ones, thus completely flying in the face of the Maunder and Dalton minimums.
The Rohs team used Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) data, which uses so-called limb-viewing of the atmosphere. Six Forbush events over 1.5 years were analysed.

//-->




Although Hoffmann admits that 6 Forbush events in 1.5 years is a scant amount of data, he can hardly contain his glee with Rohs’s findings and deems them sufficient enough to openly taunt proponents of Svenmark’s hypothesis. He even singles out the “usual suspects”:  THE HOCKEY SCHTICK and GREENIE WATCH, here and here respectively, for claiming Rohs’s paper supported Svensmark. THE HOCKEY SCHTICK and GREENIE WATCH did not mention that the clouds formed in the Rohs paper were of the high, warming kind.
Of course, in a reader comment, I asked why the long periods of long protracted solar inactivity during the Manunder Minimum and Dalton Minimum did not lead to warming. Why was it cold instead? Hoffmann replies with interesting speculation:
Concerning the Maunder Minimum. So IF the Rohs relationship turns out to be robust, it is in fact the wrong sign fo the suggested sun/climate relation. Then you have a couple of other possibilities: 1) Direct forcing (TSI) is sufficient to compensate the Cirrus effect. That means a comparably high climate sensitivity. 2) Volcanoes were mainly responsible for the Maunder Minimum and compensated the Cirrus effect 3) The target is not clear meaning there is no clear relationship between the sun and climate.
For the moment I tkink one has to wait for more MIPAS data. Svensmark idea is by any means not even close to something verfied.
I wonder if he realises what he is saying. If Rohs turned out to be robust ( I doubt it will), then it would turn climate science on its head. Now that would be most interesting.
Note: Georg Hoffmann is a researcher at the LSCE (Laboratory of Sciences of Climate and Environment) in Paris and focuses on various aspects of paleo-climatology. His area of specialty includes climate reconstruction of the last 1000 years and the coupling of carbon cycles to climate development on paleo-timescales.
——————————————————————————————————————————-
UPDATE: HOCKEY SCHTICK REPLIES:
1. The abstract says they only looked at mid and high altitude clouds, so nothing can be concluded from this study about low altitude clouds &amp; GCRs
2. The abstract says “a 15% increase in CNM would result in … an increase in cloud opacity,” so unless the abstract is worded incorrectly, there is no problem with the sign of the correlation. This would also be consistent with earlier statement of a “positive cloud-CNM correlation.”
3. The claim that high altitude clouds warm the planet because they “absorb more IR and reflect less sunlight” seems tenuous at best. Incoming solar energy is 45% IR, so these clouds absorb significant amounts of solar energy BEFORE it reaches the earth, thus acting as a sunshade. Furthermore, high altitude clouds at -18C or less are not capable of heating the earth at 15C because “a cold body cannot heat a warm body” from the 2nd law of thermodynamics.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAgain the excellent Readers Edition here has an excellent piece on Pachauri, which I’ve written here in English. Pachauri became Chairman of the IPCC in 2002.The following is his little-publicised partial resume of some of the posts he’s held. Now if you look closely and squint your eyeballs really hard, you might see a conflict of interest here and there.

1981 director Tata Energy Research Institute in New Delhi
2001 general director of  The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI)
2005 founder of GloriOil, which developed TERI technology for exploiting remaining oil reserves of abandoned oil sources
2007 on the advisory committee of Siderian Venture Capital in San Francisco
2008 consultant to Credit Suisse on renewable and sustainable energy
2008 on the advisory committee of the Rockefeller Foundation
2008 on the supervisory board of Nordic Glitnir Bank which launched the Sustainable Future Fund
2008 Chairman of Indochina Sustainable Infrastructure Fund
2008 Director of the International Risk Governance Council in Geneva, which was founded by French power company EDF and German power company E.On
2009 strategy advisor for the New York based Pegasus Investment Fund
2009 Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Asian Development Bank
Head of the Climate and Energy Institute of Yale University, which is funded by millions of dollars from USA and private companies
Member of the Climate Change Board of Deutsche Bank
Director of the Japanese Institute for Global Environmental Strategies
Advisor to Toyota Motors
Advisor to the French state-owned SNCF rail
President of the Industrial Lobby TERI-NA which is funded by 130 government and corporate sponsors, which include the Rockefeller Foundation, Monsanto and the World Bank

Today, billions are being made trading paper called CO2 certificates. For example, Indian Tata moved its steel production of 3 million tonnes annually from England to India, and thus earned almost 2 billion euros in CO2 credits. Not only that, almost 2000 honest workers lost their jobs². India alone has 1455 emissions trading projects up and running with an estimated value of US$33 billion. Many are run by Tata.
Pachauri is also on the Advisory Committee of the Chicago Climate Exchange, the largest and most lucrative CO2-exchange in the world, which was supported by TERI. One director is Maurice Strong, former General Secretary of the UNCED, and head of Petro-Canada, and head of Ontario Hydro. In 2005 he had to step down because of his involvement in the UN Oil For Food scandal. Since then he’s been living in Peking, where he directs his oil business and advises the Chinese government on how to get rich with CO2 certificates – just like India is doing. (But don’t blame India and China – they are only accepting great offers. Who wouldn’t!).
Now one begins to see just how corrupt the UN climate policy is. People near its core are getting seriously rich. Now you know why Al Gore will say and do anything to keep the scam going. 
Pachauri also asked the EPA to limit CO2 emissions without waiting for Congress to act. The EPA took his advice and declared CO2 “dangerous to human health”. The EPA based all this on the bogus IPCC 2007 4AR. This alone  is going to cost industrial countries another estimated $45 billion.

Share this...FacebookTwitter{Note 15 August 2010: Joe has replaced his Penn State post with a new post, and so you can no longer read it.]Anyone who reads this blog knows that meteorologist Joe Bastardi is one of my favorites. Yesterday he wrote a scathing piece at his European blog about his alma mater Penn State for the way it whitewashed the Michael Mann affair, and other things.
Joe Bastardi is a graduate of Penn State, receiving a degree in Meteorology and is a leading Accuweather meteorologist. His seasonal forecasts almost always far outperform those of “climate scientists”. It’s because Joe knows what he’s talking about, the “climate scientists” don’t. A Penn State investigation of Michael Mann, author of the infamous hockey stick graph, led to his exoneration, much to the protest of the scientific community. Many called the investigation a whitewash. Bastardi agrees. At his blog he writes:
Though I have a degree from the once proud and great meteorology department, it was EARNED during its glory day, when we graduated 2/3rds of the worlds meteorologists, and were the envy of other schools. That was yesterday, and yesterdays gone.
and says:
Penn State has lost its way.
I will no longer refer to myself as a Penn State grad, nor promote the university in my appearances.
That’s pretty heavy. And if you still don’t think Joe is ashamed of Penn State, read on:

One cannot imagine the betrayal I feel at the hands of this university. AND THAT SAYS IT ALL.
The fact is the university I busted my tail for, and defended all these years, is complicit in not only advancing an agenda driven matter in the name of “science” but also trying to suppress freedom of independent, rational thinking. Its that simple.
Joe is not alone. Many share his opinion. He writes:
And believe me, there are many.. legion, that graduated PSU through the 90s that feel the same way I do.
Joe will no longer remaim silent, and that’s good. We need more figures like Joe to speak out and express a dissent that is more necessary now than ever.
I also feel a little bit that way about my own alma mater, the University of Arizona, where one of Mann’s colleagues is a professor – but thankfully not at the College of Engineering and Mines, where I studied and got my Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering. I can imagine that this has got to be really tough for Joe to do.
Write to Joe to express your support: bastardi@accuweather.com. I think he’ll appreciate it.

"Every spring, 4.4 billion bogong moths migrate up to 1,000km to the alpine regions of Victoria and New South Wales ahead of the summer heat. But for the past two years, the number of moths that have made the journey to those areas from breeding grounds in Queensland, NSW and western Victoria has crashed to almost undetectable levels and scientists are turning to the community for help. A new website, led by Zoos Victoria, is asking Australians to take a photo if they think they see a bogong moth, and to record when and where they saw it. Called Moth Tracker, the website has been set up to try gather information on the migration routes of the bogong moth and what the coming summer will bring for the species and animals that rely on them. That includes the mountain pygmy possum, a critically endangered marsupial that hibernates for five to seven months of the year. Just 2,000 of them remain in the wild. When the possum emerges from under the snow, the bogong moth is its main food source. Last year, scientists monitoring the mountain pygmy possum late in the breeding season in Victoria found that between 50% and 95% of the animals had lost their full litters of young. Analysis found the animals had starved to death without their main food source. “The migration of bogong moths has occurred for over 7,000 years and their arrival in the alpine zone is the second biggest arrival of nutrients in the area after the sun,” Marissa Parrott, a reproductive biologist at Zoos Victoria, said. “They’re an important species in their own right and they’re crucially important for mountain species like the pygmy possum as well as birds, frogs and plants.” Parrott said researchers had developed the Moth Tracker website because not enough was known about why the moths were not making it to their summer destination. The collapse in numbers is unprecedented and there are three likely causes scientists are exploring. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning They are the ongoing drought in south-eastern Australia, changes in agricultural practices such as spraying of crops or flooding of areas for cotton and rice production, and light pollution in urban areas that diverts the moths away from their migration path. In addition to asking Australians to log sightings of moths – and how many – on the website, the researchers are also asking for assistance in the south-east of the country to reduce light pollution. Some of the greatest beacons are sporting fields and Canberra’s Parliament House and its surrounds. Until the end of October, the scientists are asking people to turn off unnecessary outdoor lighting. To use the Moth Tracker website, participants just need to take a photo, upload it the website, along with the time of the sighting, location and how many moths. An expert will then examine the photo and if it is identified as a bogong moth it will be logged on a map. Parrott said it was hoped the data would help researchers to create short- and long-term strategies to aid in the recovery of the moths and the possums. “We’ve never seen this loss of moths happening before,” she said. “We’re gathering all the data we can … so that we can have both short-term and long-term strategies to protect these species and learn more about what is an unprecedented event.”"

"On Friday, thousands of adults across the world will take part in the global climate strike to show solidarity with Greta Thunberg and the young students who have been walking out of school for months to raise awareness of the climate emergency. Among them will be many public sector workers, including some NHS staff.  With the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report last year warning that the human race has just 12 years to limit the most devastating impacts of global heating, stark images of the toxic effect of plastic on marine life in David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II and the devastating fires in the Amazon rainforest, the scale of the crisis is all too clear. New research published last week by the Health Care Without Harm (HCWH) campaign (an NGO that works to reduce the environmental footprint of health worldwide) and consultancy firm Arup, calculates that globally, healthcare’s climate footprint accounts for an astonishing 4.4% of the world’s net C02 emissions. If healthcare were a country it would be the fifth largest emitter on the planet. The report also finds that the NHS produces higher emissions than the global average for healthcare and is responsible for 5.4% of the UK’s total carbon emissions, equivalent to the greenhouse gas emissions of 11 coal-fired power stations. Its emissions are not much lower than those for both aviation, and agriculture, forestry and land use in the UK (each 6.5% according to Committee on Climate Change figures). The NHS was one of the first national health systems to produce a carbon reduction strategy 10 years ago and started measuring emissions in 2007. Since then the health and social care sector has cut emissions by 18.5%, according to the NHS Sustainable Development Unit, despite a 27% increase in clinical activity over the same period. But Kristian Steele, an associate at Arup and one of the HCWH report’s authors, says the findings show that the NHS needs to up its game. “As we continue to work to deliver high standards of quality healthcare, we must also address the environmental burden associated with this. The sector must strive to do no harm by working to cut its carbon emissions.” This summer, more than 1,000 doctors signed an open letter calling for widespread nonviolent civil disobedience in the face of the environmental crisis and the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change, which represents all major health bodies and 650,000 healthcare professionals in the UK, has recognised the climate crisis. “While the UK Health Alliance is not calling for health professionals to join strikes during scheduled working hours, we share the fervour of strikers for urgent action to mitigate against the damaging effects of climate change through changes to our behaviours as individuals, members of institutions such as the NHS, and as a country,” says Nicky Philpott, director of the alliance. “Failure to act quickly will heighten existing national health challenges, place undue financial strain on the NHS, and worsen health inequalities both within the UK and internationally.” Yet, so far, only two NHS bodies have declared a climate emergency: Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust and the Greater Manchester health and social care partnership. In contrast, more than 100 local authorities have declared a climate emergency, and the government has committed the UK to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. “In a sector that has health promotion and healing in its mission, it’s a no-brainer for it to want to protect health by cutting its own carbon footprint,” says Josh Karliner, HCWH international director. “Health systems need to weigh in for clean, renewable energy to protect the health of their patients. Decarbonising will reduce morbidity and mortality caused by the combustion of fossil fuels.” Coming from a partnership that represents all health and social care bodies in the region and around 100,000 workers, Greater Manchester’s climate emergency declaration last month is potentially a game-changer. Some £6bn a year is spent on health and social care in the city region. Getting all 13 trusts, 10 clinical commissioning groups and the 10 councils responsible for social care to become carbon neutral by 2050 will be no mean feat. Anthony Hassall, joint chair of the partnership’s sustainable development leadership group, says: “Our actions must cover everything from the types of drugs and treatments we purchase, the energy used in our buildings, the waste we generate in clinical procedures to the transport our staff and patients use.” A detailed plan is due to be published by the end of the year. As air pollution causes 1,200 deaths a year in the region, one of the priorities will be to improve public transport to and between NHS sites and reduce emissions from delivery vehicles, as well as installing electric vehicle charging points. It also aims to improve energy efficiency of NHS buildings, reducing single-use plastics, and planting trees. Newcastle upon Tyne’s declaration – which came in June, before Greater Manchester’s – made it the first healthcare organisation in the world to declare a climate emergency and pledge to become carbon neutral by 2040. Newcastle has been in the vanguard of sustainability for decades. The trust installed combined heat and power plants in its hospitals in the late 1990s and all electricity bought comes from 100% renewable sources. It has sent zero waste to landfill since 2011 and recycles more than 40% of non-clinical waste (the average in the NHS is 23%). All procurement contracts include sustainability criteria, while hospital cafes and restaurants provide compostable cutlery and plates. The trust has commissioned new staff, patient and visitor electric bus services for 2020 and already has electric catering and estates vehicles. But it is in the clinical areas – dialysis for kidney patients and anaesthetics in its operating theatres – that Newcastle really stands out. Its “renal green group” has been working to reduce the environmental impact of dialysis since 2010. It recycles packaging and used dialysis fluid canisters, while energy-saving measures include the retrofitting of heat recovery technology within dialysis machines. The trust has also pioneered ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions from anaesthetics, which make up 5% of acute hospitals’ total emissions and 1.7% of CO2 for the UK’s health and social care sector. Much of this is about the choice of anaesthetic: some gases are more polluting than others. The two most common anaesthetic gases are Sevoflurane and Desflurane, which largely do the same job. But Desflurane has a global warming potential 20 times greater than that of Sevoflurane. Dr Cathy Lawson, a fellow in environmentally sustainable anaesthesia for the Association of Anaesthetists and the Centre for Sustainable Healthcare, based at Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals, saysreducing the use of Desflurane can make a real difference. “Since 2016, we have cut emissions from anaesthetic gases by 45%, through education about the environmental impact that our different gases have, supporting our colleagues to make informed choices about their clinical practice and using behavioural nudges to reduce unintentional use of our more harmful agents.” From November she hopes to start introducing technology to capture these gases, and support staff in using alternative techniques with less emissions. She is also working with colleagues to improve the sustainability of operating theatres by cutting energy use and waste, reducing single-use plastics through recycling, and procuring more sustainable and reusable clinical items. Jonny Groome, co-founder of the Greener Anaesthesia and Sustainability Project and anaesthetic registrar at Barts Health NHS trust, points out that 40% of waste in operating theatres is a high-quality product that could be recycled. Unfortunately, most waste ends up being labelled as “infectious clinical waste”, he says, and gets incinerated at a high financial and environmental cost.  Transport is a big contributor to NHS emissions. The NHS accounts for almost 10bn road journeys each year – around 3.5% of all road travel. The long-term plan has committed to cutting mileage and air pollution from ambulances, patient transport and staff journeys by a fifth by 2024 – and ensuring that nine out of 10 vehicles are low emission within a decade. In February, NHS chief executive, Simon Stevens, called on vehicle manufacturers to develop greener ambulances. Some trusts are introducing energy-saving measures to reduce car journeys such as lift-share schemes for staff, free shuttle buses between sites, and cycle-to-work schemes, as well as building staff accommodation within walking distance of work. Sussex Community NHS foundation trust has introduced a “care without carbon” mantra throughout the organisation. It developed an internal network to encourage departments to re-use furniture and unwanted office products, opened a travel bureau in 2013 to encourage public transport and cycling and has introduced a car lease scheme for staff with a cap on car emissions. As a result, emissions are down by 37%, says Susie Vernon, associate director of sustainability at Sussex Community NHS foundation trust. Oxford University hospitals NHS foundation trust provides a cycle-to-work scheme, as well as a free staff shuttle bus between the trust’s four sites in Oxford. It offers a lift-share scheme, as well as discounted bus and rail passes. The trust is also building two nearby staff accommodation developments. University hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS trust projects carbon savings of 2,000 tonnes over 20 years due to reusable sharps containers. But with two hospitals still using coal boilers and some oil-fired, getting to net zero emissions is a huge challenge for the NHS. Stephen Powis, medical director for NHS England, says: “As part of our long-term plan, the NHS is doing its bit to protect our environment with practical measures like reducing the need for road traffic for appointments, phasing out coal in our buildings, supporting staff to use bike and car hire schemes and making use of safe, greener treatments including low-emission inhalers where it’s appropriate and good for patients.” “For more than 70 years the health service in England has protected our country’s health with world-leading treatments, research and staff, but we also are doing more to protect our patients’ environment and help prevent ill health, which will not only safeguard the NHS and public health for future years, but save taxpayers money into the bargain.” In the end, though, the best way to cut emissions is to keep patients healthier. “Nothing could be less environmentally sustainable than delivering interventions that do not work,” says Chris Naylor at The King’s Fund. “Arguably the best way to cut emissions would be to change the way we do healthcare, to prevent illness in the first place.”"

The German European Institute For Climate and Environment (EIKE) brings our attention to a report by the publicly funded NDR German television news show Panorama concerning the state of climate science and politics today in Germany. If you’re a climate activist, things just couldn’t be worse.

NDR Panorama report on Germany”s mood with regards to climate change (in German).
In summary the topic of climate change in Germany has gone far beyond its shelf-life. It is used up and no longer draws a bit of interest from the public. As the clip shows, the German public has grown tired of the constant barrage of climate alarmism, and is now über-bored by it. Editors have since taken climate news off the front pages. The public doesn’t want to hear it anymore, editors fret.
At 0:36 of the clip, normal citizens are asked about climate change. The reaction:  they couldn’t care less about it. Indeed some even say warmer is better. Climate change? No worries at all!

The depth of public apathy has left climate activists and experts like Professor doom & gloom Hans Joachim Schellnhuber frustrated, depressed and resigned. Schellnhuber at the 1:39 mark:
Just a few years ago it was so that when a meteorological extreme occurred, the phones would be ringing off the hook. Today hardly anyone calls; climate change has quasi become taboo.

Nobody wants to talk about it. And after the disaster that was Copenhagen, neither do the political leaders. In Schellnhuber’s view, the optimism in achieving a climate treaty is gone. That was clearly visible at the recent UN Climate Conference in Bonn. Says Karsten Sach, leader of the German negotiating delegation:
Everyone knows we’ve reached a dead-end.
The media has lost interest in reporting on the constant failure by policymakers. At the 3.56 mark, accompanied by gloomy music, a chart shows how the number of reports on climate change appearing in three major centre-left newspapers has dwindled. The hype is over. The public is fatigued, fed up, and disinterested.
Editor Dagmar Dehmer of Berlin’s Der Tagesspiegel says somberly:
Editors know the topic is important, but it’s not topic no. 1 at the moment. Climate is no longer on the front pages, and is not viewed as an earth-moving topic.
The video clip then moves to a car-tuning meet, where one auto-tuning enthusiast says:
Nobody cares about it.
And what about Chancellor Angela Merkel? Climate change has become a thorn in her side. She associates the issue with failure and hopelessness. Says Tagesspiegel editor Dagmar Dehmer at the 5:38 mark:
Climate change has become a loser topic. And Angela Merkel wants nothing to do with it.
Yet, Merkel’s minister of environment insists that climate change is an important topic for the future.
For the future, yes.  But not for today. The report ends with relaxed vacationers chuckling when asked by the journalists about the threats of climate change.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe dreamers of global warming calamity always have to find imaginative explanations for inconvenient truths and paradoxes. Today’s German papers are reporting on the recent study by Judith Curry and Jiping Liu, researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology. The paper is an attempt to provide an explanation for the paradox of increasing Antarctic sea ice in a warming climate.You see, there’s a simple explanation for everything.
The latest explanation is a brainstormed hypothesis at most, and nothing more. Hypotheses are important in science of course, but they are only its very raw trial material. They are not fact.
Yet today, in climate science, we are expected to accept half knowledge and computer-generated scenarios as “finished” science. Folks, it’s a farce.

So just what is the Liu/Curry explanation? The German Sueddeutsche Zeitung here presents it as follows:
The ice in the south polar sea is still growing there because climate change means more precipitation, most of it as snow. This snow reflects part of the radiative warming back out into the atmosphere and thus prevents the ice from melting.
But if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase over the next decades as expected, then sea ice will eventually melt from underneath. In addition, precipitation will fall increasingly as rain, and not as snow. This means the radiative reflection will diminish and thus lead to acclerated ice melt at the surface from above.

Depending on the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the decades ahead, the researchers calculate a shrinkage in Antarctic sea ice of 40,000 to 300,000 sq. km. per decade . The ice is expected to melt especially rapidly starting at the end of the 2060s.
40,000 to 300,000 sq km/decade? At the end of the 2060s? Really?
Recall this is all based on still really crappy climate models. It’s crystal ball science by fortune tellers. Don’t get me wrong. Science starts with wild hypotheses. But only in climate science do they seem to end there. Curry and Liu, your work is far from finished. You are a long way from being able to make such predictions with even minimal certainty. You get paid for that?
This is not the first time an attempt has been made to hastily explain, using dubious methods, why the Antarctic is not cooperating. Steig et al used dubious statistical acrobatics to produce a warming Antarctic graphic, i.e. it is cooperating! Read here.
The following NASA chart made before all this Orwellian history rewriting shows some parts of Antarctica indeed have warmed over the last decades, but most of the continent has cooled.
he Antarctic continet has cooled, not warmed.
Source: http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=6502
And as long as it cools, the ice will expand, reflect more radiation out into space and…well, I’ll let the readers apply their own Curry-like hypotheses from there.

In yet another “we’re all threatened by climate change” piece, the German online FOCUS magazine presents here a piece on the desertification of the earth, of course all worsened by climate change. FOCUS quotes a source:
Almost 33.3% of the earth’s surface is threatened by so-called desertification.
Right off the bat I have trouble with that statement because we know that only 29% of the earth is land. Does that mean 4% of the Earth’s water surface is about to dry up?
FOCUS reports that poor nations of Africa are the most threatened by the spread of desertification. But looking at the Sahara, there’s scientific literature that shows the opposite is happening. For example a 2009 National Geographic report relies on scientific literature and says:
Emerging evidence is painting a very different scenario, one in which rising temperatures could benefit millions of Africans in the driest parts of the continent.
Scientists are now seeing signals that the Sahara desert and surrounding regions are greening due to increasing rainfall.

and
Images taken between 1982 and 2002 revealed extensive regreening throughout the Sahel, according to a new study in the journal Biogeosciences.
Sounds like good news to me. So why does FOCUS peddle something that’s so misleading? Well, just take a look at its source of information: Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit, in English: German Society For Technical Cooperation. It’s a private company owned by the German government, that promotes sustainanble development and…well, you get the picture.  Perhaps FOCUS should rely more on scientific literature in the future.
Finally, and interestingly, National Geographic also attempts to project future trends for the Sahara, but finds it’s a very difficult and complicated task.  It quotes Martin Claussen of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, who says:
Half the models follow a wetter trend, and half a drier trend.
And so much for the climate models!

Share this...FacebookTwitterI) WHO ARE THE SCEPTICS IN GERMANY?
The real “troublemakers” in Germany are:
1. Professor Hans von Storch of the GKSS (warmist, but scientific and welcomes debate).
2. Prof. Josef H. Reichholf of the Technical Univ. of Munich.
3. Hans H.J. Labohm (Dutch), journalist.
4. Prof. Augusto Mangini, U. of Heidelberg (maybe not a sceptic, but critical of AGW science).
5. Dirk Maxeiner, journalist German blog.
6. Matthias Storx, journalist.
7. European Institute for Climate and Energy EIKE blog.
8. Readers Edition blog.
9. Klimanews blog.
9. Die Welt newspaper, which sometimes publishes sceptical pieces.
10. Der Spiegel magazine, which sometimes publishes sceptical pieces.
11. Petition of 77 sceptical German scientists.
(And maybe some day this here blog may make it to the top 100!)II) WHO ARE THE ALARMISTS?
1. Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research PIK. Government funded.
2. PIK Director Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber – visionary of the Great Transformation (a dangerous social engineering experiment). He’s the no. 1 climate advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel (yikes!). Has tried to shut down debate read here.
3. Prof. Stefan Rahmstorf, gatekeeper, attack-dog. Notorious for efforts to stifle dissent and to marginalize sceptics. Calls sceptical media reports irresponsible and disinformation.
Famous for publishing alarmist scenarios just before climate conferences.
4. German media, almost unanimously. Perfect example here and here.
5. Munich Re Reinsurer, purveyor of catastrophic scenarios.
6. The German school system, which repeatedly shows AIT to children uncritically.
7. A host of well-funded environmentalist groups like BUND, NABU, WWF, Greenpeace, Germanwatch, etc.
8. An array of companies set to make tons of money in trading CO2 certificates.
9. A vast majority of politicians, conservatives and environmentalists alike.
III) HOW IS AGW VIEWED HERE?
Germany is a country that has a powerful green movement. Environmentalism has become a religion for many. Probably has something to do with atonement for past sins. Environmentalism is pounded daily into the German psyche by the public-funded media, the state school system and other institutions. What you as a person does to “protect the climate” is a measure of how good you are. It’s like Karma. (So, I’m quite the naughty boy here).
IV) ARE ATTITUDES CHANGING HERE?
Yes!  Thanks to the little but vital  information the media allowed to drip out about Climategate, the recent bitter winter and a small group of concerned but very active citizens, there’s been much success in educating the public. Recent polls have alarmed the massive Green Establishment. They’re in panic. The sceptics have the momentum. Indeed the dreaded “tipping point” may have been reached. Just a couple of years ago, the media promoted the notion of universal consensus, and Mann’s depiction of the last 1000 years as fact. Today they can no longer maintain that.
V) GERMANY’S POLITCAL PARTIES – HOW GREEN?
There are five significant parties in Germany.
1. CDU/CSU – center right. Equivalent to the US RINOS. Led by a centrist Angela Merkel. They like cap & trade and believe in AGW. Favour use of nuclear energy.
2. SPD – socialists. Equivalent to the US Democrats.
They love cap & trade, regulation and are in love with Barack Obama and the US Democrats. Against nuclear power. Led by Sigmar Gabriel – Fan No. 1 of Al Gore. He distributed 6000 copies of AIT to advanced secondary schools for indoctrinating university-bound children.
3. The Greens. Made up of enviro-zealots, treehuggers and elitists. Vehemently against nuclear power.
4. FDP – Free Democrats – libertarian. Supporters of free markets, nuclear energy. But pay much lip service to green alternative energy, but not real big supporters.
5. Die Linke – The communists.
They like anything that gives the state absolute power. Ought to be viewed as a threat to democracy.
Currently a coalition of the CDU/CSU and FDP are in power. But they are weakening. Elections may have to be called.
VI) WHAT IF ELECTIONS WERE HELD TODAY (June 20, 2010)?
– CDU conservatives- 33%
– SPD socialists – 32%
– Green treehuggers – 15%
– Die Linke communists – 11%
– FDP libertarians – 6%
That means there’d possibly be a Socialist/Green/Communist government, and thus a huge push by Germany for a global climate treaty. So, although there’s been much progress, there’s still much to do in Germany when it comes to educating the public.
Note: I’m sure I’ve forgotten some names and other information. Your tips would be welcome.

Calamitologist Stefan Rahmstorf once defended his alarmist sea level rise scenarios by saying:
I can’t help it. It’s simply the laws of physics.
The question is: Whose physics?
No science has rewritten the laws of physics like climate science. In climate science, it works like this:
1. Develop a model that shows heating in the future.
2. Then compare the model projections with reality. If there’s a discrepancy:
3. Don’t change the models, instead go and change the measured data so that they agree with the models.
One way to do this is to go back and adjust the historical data, like GISS has done – GISS REWRITES HISTORY!
Another way is to modify your measurement methods and systems so that they put out only data that agree with the models. This involves closing down certain weather stations and then using data from urban-heat-island stations for filling in. GISS has done that too.
You may be able to fool the public this way, but you can’t fool the ice.
Joe Bastardi reports in his latest clip Ice Ice Baby how the Arctic ice simply refuses to melt, although we are told it’s getting warmer and warmer and warmer. Indeed look at total sea ice, north and south pole, here.
There we see a sea ice anomaly of ZERO! Global sea ice is right at normal.
Indeed the ice has been recovering over the last three years – even though we are told that it is getting hotter. This can mean only one thing. When it gets warmer, you get more ice.
We can’t help it, it’s simply the laws of climate physics.

But no, he”s a West Virginian Democrat running for the Senate and now he’s acting like he means business. Of course it’s understandable that a Democrat from West Virginia would want to protect the economic interests of his own state, especially before an election.

The above clip is pretty emphatic – best anti-Cap & Tax clip I’ve seen in a long time. I admit I even felt myself bonding with Joe’s message. Susanne Goldenberg of the Guardian, however, is a little less enthusiastic about the ad, and writes:
A number of Democrats trying to hang on to their careers in these congressional elections are distancing themselves from Barack Obama, but only one, so far, is suggesting he would take a gun to the president’s energy policies.
Oooh, I do like that suggestion.
But I wonder if Manchin is just shootin blanks. And if not, can he shoot straight? Notice how the ad doesn’t show him hitting anything. That hole in the paper was probably put there by Sarah Palin, who I think can shoot a hell of a lot straighter than Manchin.
Many Democrats have a habit of talkin real tough when the GOP has the momentum, but then turn mushy later on (after the election). Right now Manchin is saying:
I sued the EPA and I’ll take dead aim at the cap and trade.
Well Joe, you got my vote – if you keep that promise. In Indiana Congressman Joe Donnelly is also in a tough race, and he’s running TV ads calling climate change legislation “Nancy Pelosi’s energy tax”. Howabout just taking dead aim at the Cap&Trade bill too, Mr Donnelly? And don’t forget to pull the trigger.
The question is: Can we rely on these possible phonies to follow through on their promises? Talk is cheap and thousands of jobs are on the line. Check their records to be sure how they really vote.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOn the surface, looking at warmist blogs and sites can be quite entertaining at times. But reading more closely between the lines, the entertainment always seems to turn into a surreal horror story.For the most rabid among the environmentalists, who strangely never seem to run out of funding, saving the planet means having to deny others life.
I happened to go to Al Gore’s site where he linked to a piece in Seed Magazine called Eating Away. It takes a look at growing human population, the agriculture needed to feed it, its consumption and impact on the planet.
Seed Magazine admits that the population growth rate peaked in the 1980s and that the world has gone from Baby Boom to Baby Bust, much of this trend owing to the education and empowerment of women, especially in developed countries.
But having population growth under control here and there is not enough. Poor countries still have exploding populations. Environmentalists worry about the extent the planet could sustain a population of 9 billion, projected to be reached by 2050.

Apocalyptic scientists fear that the CO2 emission resulting from a growing population will lead to a climate catastrophe. According to biologist E.O. Wilson of Harvard University:
A population growth to 9 billion people alone will add as much as 2 billion metric tons more of carbon dioxide to the greenhouse gas blanket smothering Earth.
In their view, the planet has become too small. So who should be the first to leave?
Target: USA’s 10,000-tonne children
Some already have a clear target in the crosshairs, for example reproductive biologist Roger Short of the University of Melbourne. Seed Magazine writes:

Short goes so far as to call for a halt to future population growth. After all, the most profound way a U.S. citizen can impact climate change is to have fewer children, since every American child born today will add almost 10,000 metric tons of CO2 to the atmosphere under current conditions—five times more than a Chinese child and 160 times more than a baby from Bangladesh.
Having one fewer child would reduce a family’s greenhouse gas impact 20 times more than driving a Toyota Prius, using Energy Star appliances and other environmentally friendly lifestyle choices combined, according to researchers at Oregon State University.
So it’s not really about the number of people on the planet, rather it’s more about who. Future American children have been degraded and reduced by the Greenshirts to grotesque 10,000-tonne planet-threatening monsters.
Andrew Bolt’s recent commentary looks at the psychopathology behind the radical green movement, read Totalitarian Itch.
Seed Magazine writes:
The world’s richest 500 million people produce half of global carbon dioxide emissions, while the poorest 3 billion emit just 7 percent.
Ultimately, the problem isn’t the number of people. It’s what those people do. The average American (just one of 309 million) uses up some 194 pounds of stuff—food, water, plastics, metals and other things—per day, day in and day out.
The poor 3 billion are not the problem. American parents and kids, they’re coming after you. The blood hounds have picked up your scent. You can hear them barking in a not so far away distance.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe blogosphere has started to buzz about alleged proposals in the European Parliament in Europe to criminalize climate science scepticism. Science progresses through scepticism and rigorous testing of hypotheses. Criminalising scepticism would be the same as criminalising science. It would be a going back to the Dark Ages.
Lubos Motl wrote a piece at his blog on these proposals and so I listened to the audio he has available. In the audio a name of an International Academy of Environmental Science http://www.iaes.info/ came up, and whose president is a Professor Abrami. I tracked this down and this is what I found:
Abami is invited to the EU in Brussels:
The European Parliament invited Abrami to explain his proposal at a meeting on July14th in Brussels.
The European Parliament Invitation written by Jo Leien to Professor Abrami of the International Academy of Environmental Science: http://www.iaes.info/pdf/Prof.%20Abrami% 20let.pdf. Excerpt of the invitation:
Dear Professor Abrami,
I am writing to thank you very much for your letter of 13th May 2010 in which you set out the background to the interesting proposal of the International Academy of Environmental Sciences for the creation of an International or European Environmental Criminal Court.
I would like you to present the proposal to the Environment, Public Health, and Food Safety Committee at its meeting on Wednesday 14th July at 4.30 pm in the European Parliament in Brussels, and thereafter to participate in an exchange of views with the members of the Committee…blah blah blah
 
The Meeting’s Agenda
Now here’s the agenda for the 14th July meeting: http://www.iaes.info/pdf/ordine%20giorno%2014-7-10_EN.pdf. The meeting agenda includes topics on biodiversity, and the notorious Pt. No. 14:
14. Presentation of a proposal for an International or European Environmental Criminal Court
Exchange of views with Professor Antonino Abrami, acting President of the International Academy of Environmental Sciences (IAES)

So here we see the EU wants to clamp down real hard with environmental regulation. It’s gaming to set up a dictatorship through environmental regulation. But readers can interpret this how they wish.
Abrami’s Hearing: What is he calling for?
What function could such a court have? Here is the link to the Professor Abrami hearing at ENVI Committee http://www.iaes.info/pdf/ENVI_REL_EN_%20HEARING_DOC2.pdf. Professor Abrami outlines the function of such a proposed court, and an overview of the projects and the urgency of its realization. 
According to Abrami, there’s:
– A growing need for a coherent and coordinated body of legal regulations, bringing more restrictive limitations  in human activities that are inherently dangerous for the ecosystems.
– The adoption of transnational investigations and jurisdictional instruments meant to enforce environmental protection.
Abrami says:
It is necessary to consider the development of the “thirst” for knowledge of preventive and repressive measures within a system of Justice that prescribes effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.
Among other things, he asks:
Whether, and in what terms, great environmental disasters which destroyed eco-systems and /or human lives can fall under the category of Crimes Against Humanity?
I guess that means; “you mess with them bats, then you’re messing with the EU Justice”. That’s pretty radical. I certainly would not want to be that poor bloke who messed up on that BP platform.
Abrami is definitely calling for a draconian, radical clampdown for environmental protection. But in the hearing’s record I see no mention of clamping down on scepticism. I’m not a lawyer and I didn’t dissect the text. Maybe someone else will find something I missed.
In the meantime, I guess I can keep blogging without feeling like a criminal.

"When I was an undergrad learning geology, the maxim that was thumped into me wasn’t how to build a mine or drill for oil and gas, it was simply: “The present is the key to the past.” The thing that took a while to accept was that the past was really, really, long. It’s hard to comprehend the scale of geologic time: the timespan for continents to crash together and rip apart, for tiny sea creatures to live, die and condense into kilometres of limestone, or streams to carve epic canyons carrying mountains to the sea. We use comparisons our minds can grasp, such as if all cosmological time was the length of string or compressed into a single year (humans beings appear in the final six hours).  But kids deal with billions of years without a problem – 64 billion is my son’s favourite number. So, when I explained geologic time to my children as we travelled to the last students’ climate rally in Melbourne, they got it: geologically, things happen slowly. And yes, there are exceptions, volcanoes, landslides, earthquakes, to name but a few, but I am talking about the fundamental processes: mountain building, sediment creating, climate changing kind of processes. Although geologists can handle deep time, they really can’t handle unprecedented rates. It took life millions of years to change the composition of the atmosphere first time round. Granted, that was 2 billion years ago and times, clearly, have changed. However, through all the corridors of conceivable time, evidence indicates the climate has never, ever, changed as rapidly as we see today. Claude Albritton once wrote: It has not been easy for man to face time. Some, in recoiling from the fearsome prospect of time’s abyss, have toppled backwards into the abyss of ignorance.” And ignorance, particularly wilful and entrenched ignorance, is a much harder rock to smash. A fundamental tenet of the scientific method is that there is never certainty in science, only observation, experimentation, hypothesis refinement and the empirical accumulation of evidence. Our past and present leaders exploit that fact, warning of the dangers of scientific consensus as if it reeks of climate conspiracists. Yes, there have been warmer periods and colder periods in the geologic record and while the effects may be similar, the various causes over time differ. Tony Abbott recently stated that despite there being no humans around in the Jurassic to burn stuff and produce carbon dioxide, incredibly, the climate was even warmer then - ergo manmade climate change is “absolute crap”. He failed to comprehend the other mitigating factors, like the volcanoes in the southern hemisphere spewing out gases, including, wait for it … carbon dioxide. Our Earth is immensely complex and scientists the world over are doing their best to understand it. So when they form a consensus, we should listen. Perhaps we need to explain climate change to sceptical politicians as we would to very small children. Here, let me try. The sun is very, very hot. Heat comes from the sun and enters the Earth’s atmosphere. But, some of that heat bounces off the Earth and heads back out to space. And before the heat escapes off into space, gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, capture and absorb it. Consequently, the atmosphere heats up – warms if you will. More heat-absorbing gases in the atmosphere, the greater the impact. It’s really not rocket science, simply Earth science. Unlike many adults, kids know they have a lot to learn and they actively seek knowledge, they ask teachers, parents, peers. I don’t get it, they say how does it work? Kids love to learn, they are inquisitive, excited and determined – all the characteristics of good scientists. Kind of like all the good climate scientists out there churning out increasingly alarming reports. While politicians debate the cause, and incredibly, even the validity of climate change, scientists are measuring the effect. Because that’s what scientists do, they measure, they experiment, and they learn. It’s been stated that children will learn nothing from attending climate rallies except how to join the unemployment queue and that is fundamentally wrong. On Friday, children at my kid’s school will spend the morning discussing the protest, what it is about, why it is important and what it is hoped will be achieved. They’ll learn about the atmosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere and how they interact with the biosphere – namely us. While the past has impacted the future and will continue to do so for some time, decisions we make today are critical in ensuring a safe and sustainable world. Our government is showing an appalling lack of climate leadership, that has just been made glaring obvious on a global scale, with our PM’s decision to not attend the UN climate summit. But, on Friday, schoolchildren will show that the present is the key to the future. And as a scientist, academic and a parent, I cannot be prouder that my children are standing up for their future. • Emma White is a hydrogeologist and freelance writer"
"Atmospherically speaking, Brexit will certainly dominate Labour’s conference, as it has for the Liberal Democrats, and will for the Tories. All the conversations outside the hall, in fringe meetings, on beaches, in pubs, either side of the karaoke (activists love microphones, no one knows why) will revolve around it. The “Love Corbyn, Hate Brexit” tote bags will have been updated. “Remain, Reform, Revolt” on one side, and – optimistically – “Labour can stop Brexit” on the other; there will be no shortage of views as to how. Labour is, with or without Jo Swinson’s missteps, plainly the party of remain: in its membership and its voters; in its stated policy of backing a second referendum; in most of its MPs and the bulk of its shadow cabinet; in its visceral reaction to Boris Johnson and his crash-and-burn fantasies. Yet the leadership is still clinging to the dated electoral calculation that it can only win if they pick up votes from both leavers and remainers, and the idea that it is possible, if you’re clever enough, to simultaneously support both outcomes.  This will come to a head over the issue of a Labour-negotiated exit deal. The Trade Union and Labour Party Liaison Organisation (Tulo) reiterated on Tuesday night their determination to go into an election with the promise of negotiating their own Left Brexit, then taking that to the public for a vote. This apparently makes sense within the union DNA, negotiating a deal, then advising their members to vote for or against it. It sure as hell doesn’t make sense to anyone else, and it is not a tenable manifesto position, torching what should be their strongest argument: we can make this Tory-confected nightmare end. With John McDonnell now as openly pro-remain as he has ever been, this crack has snaked to the top of the party and cannot be papered over – especially with 91 motions submitted by constituency Labour parties (CLPs), the vast majority of which are calling for Labour to explicitly back remain. Remember the success of last year: 150 mainly pro-remain motions were composited in a tense, five-hour meeting into the single motion that Keir Starmer announced to a standing ovation: Labour became, in September 2018, a party that believed in a second referendum, with remain on the ballot. This is probably the most significant achievement any anti-Brexit campaign has ever managed, most of the other hurdles to Brexit having been erected by Brexiters themselves. Never underestimate how much people can get done when they understand the rules. However, Lexit has one more manoeuvre up its sleeve; this is where it all goes a bit The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. There are rules, and then there are deeper laws. There’s no way to head off a repeat of last year’s remain roar, but an alternative motion can change the frame, especially if it’s been submitted by more CLPs. Explicitly pushed by Momentum, and encouraged by the leadership, Labour for a Green New Deal have got 128 CLPs calling for the party to commit to zero emissions by 2030. It’s not quite “nearly double” the 91 Brexit-related motions that have been submitted this year, as a rather bellicose announcement from the New Dealers claimed, but they could certainly make a claim as bold as “they have more”. From the outside, it is impossible to imagine why these issues would ever be set in competition against one another: if there’s a remainer in the UK who doesn’t also want to tackle climate change, I’ve yet to encounter them. Indeed, one of the core arguments for staying in the EU is that climate change is best fought collectively, and the EU’s proudest moments (unless you count “not having a war”) have been its environmental achievements. The economist Ann Pettifor, the architect of the Green New Deal, is fiercely critical of the EU but a stalwart remainer, identifying these institutions as the bulwark against the rise of fascism, which is the major threat, both to social democracies and the environment. But this is a coded red-on-red battle: Lexiters versus left remainers (and, indeed, remainers across the membership spectrum, which is now pretty much all of it), struggling for control of the narrative. This is a very common line at the local level when criticism of the Brexit project, and Jeremy Corbyn’s failure to oppose it, comes up against loyalists who will hear no word against him. It is that trivial people fight to stay in the EU, while serious people are fighting for the environment, whose growing emergency will make our obsession with treaties and institutions look like deckchair-tidying on the Titanic. It’s a completely false binary, but a very convenient one, since it equates seriousness of political purpose with unquestioning loyalty to the party’s leadership. But it’s not without jeopardy. If this conference is successfully branded as a fight for climate justice, that won’t make Brexit go away. It won’t reduce the urgency of coming up with a manifesto position that voters can actually understand, and it won’t meet the democratic duty towards the members. There isn’t time for this division to play out subtly. It cannot be bumped down the list of priorities. Plainly, all these ambitions can work in concert, and become stronger and more inexorable when they do: you can fight for regional renewal founded on dispersed green infrastructure, and for a genuine and sustainable prosperity that’s based on an entirely different model of energy creation, at the same time as taking your place at the centre of an international rule-based order whose own green revolution will be reinforced by transnational solidarity. The tergiversations and control-freakery of the leadership have turned this into a false choice between climate justice and remain, but that loyalty-or‑bust reasoning may not survive the transparency of the conference floor. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
"The end of London fashion week was somewhat sombre on Tuesday evening. It culminated in Extinction Rebellion’s funeral march calling for the event to end in its current form, with the group criticising the clothing industry as a major offender in the climate crisis. Extinction Rebellion kept to the drama of which fashion is so fond. Starting at Trafalgar Square, a group of about 200 people – some in funereal outfits complete with black veils – gathered around two black coffins. “RIP LFW 1983-2019” read one, while the other simply said “Our Future”. They were accompanied by a live band as they made their way up to 180 The Strand, a venue that hosted fashion week shows.  Here they laid the coffin down, with participants throwing flowers on it. A speech urging the industry to bring an end to a system where each season means new clothes was perhaps less well received. The crowd also stopped outside the flagship store of H&M, a giant of fast fashion. Safia Minney, the founder of Fair Trade clothing company People Tree made an impassioned speech about how fashion needed to change its ways. “I’m calling on London fashion week to have the courage and the strength to change everything it does,” she said, while behind her, standing hands outstretched, several young people dressed in red robes. The protesters were mainly young. Mohan Keryk, 17, said the action was the start of things to come: “We have to continuously be active. We need the change.” Tolmeia Gregory, 19, who described herself as an environmental activist and sustainable fashion blogger, said: “There’s a big mindset shift that needs to happen. It’s an emergency, but a lot of people aren’t there yet.” The group maintains that it appreciates the creativity of fashion. This was certainly clear by the outfits on display – one young male protester wore a police officer’s helmet, high heels and gloves with crystals, and another had a picture hat and floor-length black cape covering their face, decorated with only sunglasses. Earlier in the day, the British Fashion Council’s Positive Fashion initiative – which focuses on sustainability, diversity and human rights – hosted a panel discussion. The event was standing room only. Experts including the journalist Tamsin Blanchard, the model and environmentalist Arizona Muse, Extinction Rebellion’s Bel Jacobs and the designer Phoebe English discussed issues around the climate emergency. The panel discussed how fast fashion was the biggest polluter, with Jacobs commenting she would “love to give the Heading for Extinction talk at Boohoo”. A rental model, growing in scope within high fashion, was mooted as an alternative option for the sector. Eighteen months ago, English took a two-season hiatus from fashion shows to reboot. “The more you read, the more horrendous the realisation becomes. For a time I was waking up and saying: ‘Why am I doing this? What is the actual point of what I do?’” she said. “It was an experiment – I was like: ‘I’ll try this thing, and maybe I’ll have to close down.’ But then, I found hunting for the solutions really exciting and reinvigorating.” English argued that the most important objective was “making excess unfashionable”. The funeral is the culmination of Extinction Rebellion’s actions at London fashion week. They also staged a die-in outside one of the show venues on Friday and a swarm outside Victoria Beckham’s show on Sunday, with protesters holding placards reading “fashion = ecocide” and “the ugly truth about fashion”. The group is targeting the fashion industry for its actual environmental impact. The United Nations has said it uses more energy than the aviation and shipping industry combined, with a projected 63% increase in the global consumption of apparel by 2030. Extinction Rebellion says the industry also gives the impression that the world is not in a climate emergency. “Culture is complicit in our destruction, when it should be taking responsibility for people getting their heads around this existential problem,” said Extinction Rebellion’s Sara Arnold ."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Australian Bureau of Meterorology has just released its latest ENSO Report. It starts out with:
The La Niña event in the Pacific Ocean has strengthened further over the past two weeks. All computer models surveyed by the Bureau predict the La Niña will last through the southern hemisphere spring, with the majority indicating the event will persist into at least early 2011.

The graphic above shows the 30-day moving SOI has reached a new high, even already surpassing the peak reached in January 2008. The following graphic in the BOM report shows sub-surface temperature from May-August, with the cool water progressing to the surface.
The BOM writes:
In the central Pacific, the sub-surface of the ocean is more than 6°C cooler than normal for this time of the year, on a weekly scale.

La Niña depresses average global surface temperatures, which will soon show up in the months ahead in the monthly temperature statistics. Dr Roy Spencer’s site here shows surface temperatures now dipping below last year’s level.
Forecasters are busy revising their projections
Meanwhile, forecasters have been busy revising their earlier projections. Here’s the forecast made back on July 16, 2010, i.e about 2 months ago. The blue line dips to about -1.7.
July 16, 2010 projections
Two months later, in their latest September 14 projections, the blue line now dips down to -1,9.
September 14, 2010 projections. Source: http://www.cpc.noaa.gov/products/people/wwang/cfs_fcst/images3/PDFcr_nino34SSTMonE120.gif
This La Niña is shaping up to be deeper than previously expected. Does that mean we’re headed for global cooling? No it doesn’t. This is just one ocean cycle. Maybe a few more EL Nino/La Niña flip-flops will tell us more, meaning we have to wait another 5 or 10 years.

"Our built environment is becoming one big computer. “Smartness” is coming to saturate our stores, workplaces, homes, cities. As we go about our daily lives, data is made, stored, analyzed and used to make algorithmic inferences about us that in turn structure our experience of the world. Computation encircles us as a layer, dense and interconnected. If our parents and our grandparents lived with computers, we live inside them. A growing chorus of activists, journalists and scholars are calling attention to the dangers of digital enclosure. Employers are using algorithmic tools to surveil and control workers. Cops are using algorithmic tools to surveil and control communities of color. And there is no shortage of dystopian possibilities on the horizon: landlords evicting tenants with “smart locks”, health insurers charging higher premiums because your Fitbit says you don’t exercise enough.  Digitization doesn’t just pose a risk to people, however. It also poses a risk to the planet. July was the hottest month on record. Large chunks of the Arctic are melting. In India, more than half a billion people face water shortages. Putting computation everywhere directly contributes to this crisis. Digitization is a climate disaster: if corporations and governments succeed in making vastly more of our world into data, there will be less of a world left for us to live in. To understand the relationship between data and climate, the best place to start is machine learning (ML). Billions of dollars are being spent on researching, developing, and deploying ML because major breakthroughs in the past decade have made it a powerful tool for pattern recognition, whether analyzing faces or predicting consumer preferences. ML “learns” by training on large quantities of data. Computers are stupid: babies know what a face is within the first few months of being alive. For a computer to know what a face is, it must learn by looking at millions of pictures of faces. This is a demanding process. It takes place inside the data centers we call the cloud, and much of the electricity that powers the cloud is generated by burning fossil fuels. As a result, ML has a large carbon footprint. In a recent paper that made waves in the ML community, a team at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, found that training a model for natural-language processing – the field that helps “virtual assistants” like Alexa understand what you’re saying – can emit as much as 626,155lb of carbon dioxide. That’s about the same amount produced by flying roundtrip between New York and Beijing 125 times. Training models isn’t the only way ML contributes to the cooking of our planet. It has also stimulated a hunger for data that is probably the single biggest driver of the digitization of everything. Corporations and governments now have an incentive to acquire as much data as possible, because that data, with the help of ML, might yield valuable patterns. It might tell them who to fire, who to arrest, when to perform maintenance on a machine or how to promote a new product. One of the best ways to make more data is to put small connected computers everywhere: Cisco predicts there will be 28.5bn networked devices by 2022. Aside from the energy required to manufacture and maintain those devices, the data they produce will live in the carbon-intensive cloud. Data centers currently consume 200 terawatt hours per year – roughly the same amount as South Africa. Anders Andrae, a widely cited researcher at Huawei, tells me that number is likely to grow 4-5 times by 2030. This would put the cloud on par with Japan, the fourth-biggest energy consumer on the planet. What can be done to curb the carbon costs of data? Greenpeace has long pushed cloud providers to switch to renewable energy sources and improve efficiency. These efforts have seen some success: the use of renewables by data centers has grown substantially. Meanwhile, efficiency gains from better techniques and bigger economies of scale have moderated the cloud’s power consumption in recent years. When it comes to ML, a group of researchers are calling for a more energy-conscious approach, which they call “Green AI”. These are encouraging trends, and tech workers themselves are likely to play a key role in advancing them: Amazon employees have been organizing for a climate plan since late last year, and they recently announced a global walkout for 20 September. Among their demands is for the company to commit to zero emissions by 2030 and to stop selling cloud services to fossil fuel companies. But it’s clear that confronting the climate crisis will require something more radical than just making data greener. That’s why we should put another tactic on the table: making less data. We should reject the assumption that our built environment must become one big computer. We should erect barriers against the spread of “smartness” into all of the spaces of our lives. To decarbonize, we need to decomputerize. This proposal will no doubt be met with charges of Luddism. Good: Luddism is a label to embrace. The Luddites were heroic figures and acute technological thinkers. They smashed textile machinery in 19th-century England because they had the capacity to perceive technology “in the present tense”, in the words of the historian David F Noble. They didn’t wait patiently for the glorious future promised by the gospel of progress. They saw what certain machines were doing to them in the present tense – endangering their livelihoods – and dismantled them. We are often sold a similar bill of goods: big tech companies talk incessantly about how “AI” and digitization will bring a better future. In the present tense, however, putting computers everywhere is bad for most people. It enables advertisers, employers and cops to exercise more control over us – in addition to helping heat the planet. Fortunately, there are latter-day Luddites working to stem the tide. Community groups like the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition are organizing to shut down algorithmic policing programs. A growing campaign to ban the government use of facial recognition software has won important victories in San Francisco and Somerville, Massachusetts, while workers at Amazon are calling for the company to stop selling such software to law enforcement. And in the streets of Hong Kong, protesters are developing techniques for evading the algorithmic gaze, using lasers to confuse facial recognition cameras and cutting down “smart” lamp-posts equipped with monitoring devices. These are just a few possible sources of inspiration for a broader movement for decomputerization, one that pursues social and ecological goals simultaneously. The premise of the Green New Deal is that we can make society greener and more equitable at the same time – that we can democratize as we decarbonize. We should apply the same logic to our digital sphere. Preventing a local police department from constructing an ML-powered panopticon is a matter of algorithmic, social and climate justice. As they used to say in the 1960s: one struggle, many fronts. For such a struggle to be successful, however, resistance is not enough. We also need a vision of the future we want. Again, the history of the Luddites can be helpful. In 1812, a group of Yorkshire Luddites sent a factory owner a letter promising continued action until “the House of Commons passes an Act to put down all Machinery hurtful to Commonality”. Following their example, we might derive a simple Luddite principle for democratizing technology: we should destroy machinery hurtful to the common good and build machinery helpful to it. What does this mean in practice? It’s hard to think of anything more hurtful to our common life than heating large portions of the planet beyond habitable levels. Privacy advocates have long called for companies to restrict their collection of data to the minimum necessary to perform a service – a principle now enshrined in the GDPR, the EU’s omnibus data regulation. A 21st-century Luddism should embrace this principle but go further. What matters is not only how much data a service collects, but what imprint that service leaves upon the world – and thus whether it should be performed at all. Decomputerization doesn’t mean no computers. It means that not all spheres of life should be rendered into data and computed upon. Ubiquitous “smartness” largely serves to enrich and empower the few at the expense of the many, while inflicting ecological harm that will threaten the survival and flourishing of billions of people. Precisely which computational activities should be preserved in a less computerized world is a matter for those billions of people themselves to decide. The question of whether a particular machine hurts or helps the common good can only be answered by the commons itself. It can only be answered collectively, through the experiment and argument of democracy. The zero-carbon commonwealth of the future must empower people to decide not just how technologies are built and implemented, but whether they’re built and implemented. Progress is an abstraction that has done a lot of damage over the centuries. Luddism urges us to consider: progress towards what and progress for whom? Sometimes a technology shouldn’t exist. Sometimes the best thing to do with a machine is to break it."
"We are sadly accustomed by now to the idea that our reliance on oil and gas causes random but predictable outbreaks of flood, firestorm and drought. The weekend’s news from the Gulf is a grim reminder that depending on oil leads inevitably to war too. Depending on how far back you want to stand, the possibility of war with Iran stems from a calculated decision by Tehran or its Houthi allies to use drones and missiles on Saudi installations, or on the infantile rage that drove President Trump to tear up a meticulously worked out and globally sponsored accord with Iran and to wreck its economy. But in either case, if you really take in the whole picture, the image is rendered in crude, black tones: were it not for oil, none of this would be happening. Were it not for oil, the Middle East would not be awash in expensive weapons; its political passions would matter no more to the world than those of any other corner of our Earth. Were it not for oil, we would not be beholden to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – indeed, we might be able to bring ourselves to forthrightly condemn its savagery. Were it not for oil, we would never have involved ourselves in a ruinous war with Iraq, destabilising an entire region. (I remember the biting slogan on a sign from an early protest against the war with Saddam Hussein: “How did our oil end up under their sand?”) Conveniently, the largest ever demonstrations about energy policy are scheduled to take place this Friday We’ve come to take for granted that this is how the world works. Within hours of the pictures of devastated oilfields, we had “explainers” from our various news outlets reminding us of the realities of our predicament: with Aramco largely offline, the world’s spare capacity was mostly gone. Hence oil prices would spike upwards. Hence there would be damage to the world’s economy. Reporters quoted gloating Revolutionary Guards from Iran and concerned Opec officials, and stock analysts waiting breathlessly to see how Wall Street would react. The drama seemed choreographed because we’ve seen it so often that everyone knows their parts. But this iteration of the opera is different in one way. An unspoken truth hangs over the whole predictable scene: this will be the first oil war in an age when we widely recognise that we needn’t depend on oil any longer. The last time we started down this path, in Iraq more than 15 years ago, a solar panel cost 10 times what it does today. Wind power was still in its infancy. No one you knew had ever driven an electric car. Today the sun and the breeze are the cheapest ways to generate power on our Earth, and Chinese factories are churning out electric vehicles. That is to say, we have the technology available to us that would render this kind of warmongering transparently absurd even to the most belligerent soul. We haven’t come close to fully deploying that technology, of course – and unlike 15 years ago we understand why. Thanks to great investigative reporting, we now know that the oil industry knew all about climate change decades ago, but instead of acknowledging it and helping us move to a new energy future, they instead spent billions building the scaffolding of deceit and denial and disinformation that kept us locked in the present paradigm. Just as they have profited from sea-level rise and Arctic melt, so they will profit from the war now starting to unfold. (Right on schedule, the share prices of fracking firms and oil majors all jumped perkily northwards on Monday morning.) If it happens, this war, like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, will cost untold lives, most of them civilian. It will also, like those conflicts, cost trillions of dollars. Imagine if we had spent those trillions of dollars not on cruise missiles and up-armoured Humvees, but on solar farms and offshore wind turbines. Imagine if we’d stuck insulation in the walls of every building in the US, and built a robust network of electric vehicle chargers. That’s not a fanciful vision – it’s exactly what legislation such as the Green New Deal envisions in the US – and indeed there are very similar proposals in the UK and Canada, and across the EU. But we are told that the Green New Deal is an impossibly expensive boondoggle – by precisely the same people now eager to pour blood and treasure down a hole in the desert. A trillion dollars spent on war returns nothing except trauma and misery; a trillion dollars spent on solar panels leaves behind a nation that gets its power for free each morning when the sun comes up. That new world is coming – in fact, you can sense its arrival in the somewhat muted reaction to the oilfield drones and missiles. Yes, the price of oil “spiked”. But it’s still historically low, because the planet is awash with oil – and that’s in part because demand growth has begun to soften. The day will come when blocking the strait of Hormuz or blowing up a petrol station will be an empty threat – and that will be a good day indeed. We can speed up that process immeasurably by pushing our politicians to act much faster on the transition to clean energy. There’s no mystery about the necessary steps. Big support for renewables, rigorous “keep it in the ground” policies, making polluters pay for the damage they’ve done: pretty much precisely the plans the Democrats are rolling out as they campaign. But we need the will to make these things actually happen. Conveniently, the largest ever demonstrations about energy policy are scheduled to take place this Friday. The climate strikes touched off by Greta Thunberg and her young colleagues around the world go multigenerational on 20 September (you can find the closest ones to you at globalclimatestrike.net). They are designed to deal with the greatest existential threat humans have ever faced: the rapid heating of our Earth. But they also serve as a chance to say no to this and other oil wars. We have to do it fast – if we don’t, we’ll just go from fighting wars over oil to fighting wars over survival on a fast-degrading planet. No one will ever fight a war over access to sunshine – what would a country do, set up enormous walls to shade everyone else’s panels? (Giant walls are hard to build – just ask Trump.) Fossil fuels are concentrated in a few places, giving those who live atop them enormous power; renewable energy can be found everywhere, the birthright of all humans. A world that runs on sun and wind is a world that can relax. • Bill McKibben is an author and Schumann Distinguished Scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College, Vermont.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith all the talk about heat waves and alleged record high global temps, one could be led to think that manmade global warming is real and that we’d better install the mercury lights made by Philipps and use electricity made by GE wind generators, and invest in green commodities packaged by Al Gore.
As the following graphic shows, it was a warm year globally. Careful though, some of them red dots are exaggerated in my view, as we know there are lots of instrumental issues and dubious computational methods involved (see  here).
And the media are still going wild with all the hype about heat waves. Is the globe really hot everywhere now?
And will it remain hot for the rest of the year? The answer is NO! 
The next chart shows the temperatures for the period July 4-11. Here, as Steve Goddard shows at WUWT here, 5% more pixels were cool than warm. The globe has definitely cooled over the last weeks, as it enters a La Nina phase.
The first six months were dominated by the recently fizzled out El Nino. Data now show we’ve entered a La Nina phase (see next chart), and models show with high certainty that we are now headed for a good cooling off, which means headlines of a record-setting 2010 were premature. Here’s the ENSO model forecasts for the next 6 months:
Now let’s look at the southern hemisphere. The following 3 graphics show the forecast for the week ahead, July 17 – 24. Do you see any heat waves in South America? I wonder if we’ll get any press releases on the extreme cold gripping South America? And have we heard anything about Antarctic sea ice almost reaching a record high?
And here’s the outlook for Africa, also more on the cool side:
Australia has reported record cold temps. What’s ahead for Australia in the days ahead? No heat-waves there either.
Okay, maybe I’m cherry picking. What’s ahead for the globe for the next 6 months or so? Here’s the global outlook according to NOAA:

To me it looks like a lot of cooling off going on. Again, all this hype about 2010 being the hottest is about to get doused with cold water. It was premature. I suspect this was known at NOAA, and so they rushed out their overheated press releases while they could. Don’t expect to see any more for quite some time. These headlines and press releases were to help Harry Reid (God forbid he gets his crap and trade bill through at the end of the month).
Joe Bastardi goes into the forecast at his European website here.  Here are some things he says:
The coming drop of global temperatures over the next year, to levels not seen since the 1990s, should put to an end to the AGW argument for good except for the most radical elements.
However, also coming is major drop of .5 to .7C in the global temps which will take us below normal for a time.
And Joe adds:
In addition, the reason for the drop will easily be linked with the cooling of the Pacific, which will remain in its cool stage for the next 30 years. Once the Atlantic, still warm, goes into its cool stage in 10-15 years, global temps will fall even further, back to where they were in the 1970s.
How cold was it in the 1970s? The link that follows is a clip that will tell you.

It even includes Stephen Schneider as a young whippersnapper acknowledging the coming ice age, and displaying his complete ignorance of global commerce, thinking every country is isolated from each other like North Korea.
There you have it. We’ll find out soon enough who’s right, and who’s full of it.

"A new effort to rally governments and corporations behind technologies that suck greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to help stave off disastrous global heating will be launched at the United Nations on Tuesday. The first annual Global Climate Restoration Forum, held in New York, aims to spur international support for emerging and sometimes controversial methods to claw back planet-warming gases after they have been emitted from power plants, cars, trucks and aircraft. The Foundation for Climate Restoration, the group behind the forum, has released a manifesto for its goal to “restore” the climate by reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to those of a century ago. Atmospheric CO2 is rising sharply, peaking at 415 parts per million this year, far above the level during most of human history, around 300ppm. The foundation aims to restore this historical norm by 2050, saying success would be on a par with the moon landing or the eradication of smallpox. It warns that the current climate is leading us “down a path toward the probable extinction of our species and thousands of others”. “Mother Earth will survive without us but we’d like for humans to survive too,” said Rick Parnell, chief executive of the foundation, which was created last year. “This is the beginning of a 10-year strategy to get governments and companies to understand the need to restore our climate now. Humanity got us into this situation, it can get us out of it.” Global average temperatures have increased by around 1C in the past century due to the buildup of planet-warming gases from human activity. World leaders have agreed to limit this rise to 2C, and ideally 1.5C, although global greenhouse gases are not declining and major emitters such as the US and Brazil have shown signs of going backwards. Any realistic chance of avoiding highly dangerous levels of global heating will likely involve the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, either through mass reforestation or nascent technology that either eliminates it from industrial processes or sucks it directly from the air. Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com The Foundation for Climate Restoration’s report outlines the most promising of these options, such as Climeworks, a Swiss company that uses giant machines to pull CO2 from the air and use it in greenhouses to boost plant growth. It has more than a dozen projects under way and has partnered with an Icelandic project that injects CO2 deep underground into basalt formations. Another avenue defined by the foundation as “permanent, scalable, and financeable” is a company that turns CO2 into limestone that can be used in building. It recently supplied concrete for a new terminal at San Francisco’s airport. The report also mentions the intentional placing of iron in parts of the ocean to boost its ability to absorb CO2, as well as efforts to seed reflective sand across the Arctic to reduce escalating melting. Some environmentalists have rejected such approaches as radical geoengineering that will have harmful unintended consequences. Others have criticized the development of CO2 removal technology as distracting from the need to reduce emissions. However, the UN-hosted forum highlights the narrowing window to confront the climate crisis before scientists’ warnings of severe societal impacts become reality. “Mitigation and adaptation are absolutely critical in climate change, the piece missing is restoration,” said Parnell. “It’s not about leaving things as business as usual, younger generations won’t allow that. But we need a breakthrough, we need to go further.” David Keith, a Harvard academic who has led solar geoengineering work, said it was “encouraging” that the ideas were being discussed but said the ambition of the forum may be a little unrealistic. “I think the timescales they propose for deployment of carbon removal make little sense and seem ungrounded in the real-world politics of cutting emissions which ought to be our first priority,” he said. Klaus Lackner, director of the Center for Negative Carbon Emissions at Arizona State University, said it would be difficult to restore the Arctic and that iron fertilization of the oceans “has not been proven. In fact most data suggest that its contributions would be small, they also would have large ecological impacts.” “I think [the foundation] wants to do the right thing, but it is also important to do a careful analysis,” Lackner said. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com The headline on this article was amended on 17 September 2019 to clarify that the UN is providing a venue for the forum but is not running the event. "
"On Wednesday in a committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Greta Thunberg delivered some very brief remarks. Presenting the Congress members gathered with a special report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released nearly a year ago, the Swedish climate activist said succinctly: “I don’t want you to listen to me, I want you to listen to the scientists. I want you to unite behind science. And then I want you to take real action.” Republicans who have accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from fossil fuel companies and electric utilities spouted their usual talking points (“We’re already doing enough!”; “What about China?”), cooked up by lobbyists in K Street boardrooms. Garret Graves – who has taken more than half a million dollars from Pacs linked to dirty energy interests during his short stint in Congress – said we need “more science, not less” and seemed to take some pleasure in lobbing similar red herrings at the youth assembled in front of him, who asked mainly that he and his colleagues begin taking the potential end of human civilization seriously. The Georgia congressman Buddy Carter went a step farther and peddled a standard denialist line: “I believe in climate change. The climate has been changing since day one … Does man have an impact? Yes, that impact might be debatable.” But many Democrats aren’t taking the science much more seriously. The IPCC report Thunberg presented does not lay out a legislative proposal, though it does set some parameters. Barring a truly miraculous level of technological advancement, if the world is to stay below 1.5C of warming, coal, oil and gas usage will have to decline by 94, 87 and 74% worldwide, respectively, by 2050 – and probably sooner in the countries such as the United States that are best positioned to transition rapidly, so as not to eat up more of the planet’s dwindling carbon budget than it already has. The world has 12 years to cut its emissions in half to keep warming below that threshold, which climate-vulnerable nations have long argued is critical to their survival. To listen to the science, as Thunberg suggests, is to reach some pretty radical conclusions. Most every elected Democrat has called for the US to recommit to the Paris agreement, but staying below the “well below 2 degrees” warming limit that document sets as its goal would require a rapid decline in the business model of the fossil fuel industry; added together, the national pledges it outlines as of now would shoot the world beyond 3 degrees of warming. Pushed by calls for a Green New Deal, those vying for the party’s nomination have by and large adopted ambitious pledges on climate – some more than others. Yet establishment Democrats in Congress are still attempting to pursue a middle ground on climate that simply doesn’t exist. On Wednesday, the 103-member New Democrat Coalition –whose Pac BP, ExxonMobil and the Edison Electric Institute have all maxed out on donations to this year – outlined a series of incremental and “pro-market” steps to curb emissions. A suite of legislation unveiled on Wednesday would do many great things, like investing in clean energy research and development via ARPA-E and limiting emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. It is not, however, a plan for fulfilling the challenge laid out by the IPCC, leaving the door open to define coal as a potential source of “clean energy” in pursuit of a “technology-neutral, market-oriented standard for electric energy generation” and providing a financial incentive for fossil fuel companies to capture carbon dioxide and funnel it back into pumping out more fossil fuels. Scientists don’t recommend a specific policy suite, but it would be hard to listen to them earnestly and reach the conclusion that you can gently nudge the fossil fuel industry toward a world warmed by less than 1.5 degrees, as New Democrats hope to. It’s also hard to square their argument that that approach would “build bipartisan consensus” with the last decade-plus of climate policymaking, where yielding off the bat to the Republicans and fossil fuel industry – boosting narrowly focused, technocratic measures – has failed to create any meaningful policy wins. The upshot? Thunberg’s right. And establishment Democrats pushing doomed strategies and policies are denying climate reality nearly as much as Republicans.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s a story on how a publicly funded broadcaster in Germany has abandoned obeying the laws of the Land, and succumbed to the temptation of practicing activism instead of journalism (a violation of German law). All of this of course on the premise of the fantasized urgent need to rescue the planet.
On June 9 the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE)  based in Germany sent a Letter of Protest to the Intendant of German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle demanding that it refrain from the illegal use of public funds by canceling its one-sided alarmist conference for journalists called: The Heat Is On – Climate Change and the Media.
Background here:
1. Journalism For Dummkopfs
2. From Journalism To Thought Control
3. Protest Begins To Mount!
4. EIKE Sends Letter Of Protest
Well, EIKE has received a reply from Deutsche Welle Intendant, Erik Bettermann, and the reply couldn’t have been more mind-blowing. Certainly makes one appreciate the frustration Steve McIntyre must feel at times.
First recall one workshop at the conference: How to professionally deal with climate scepticism, has the stated objective:
This workshop aims to point out what journalists must know about climate change policy, whom to trust and when to question their own professional procedures.
The panelists at the conference go on to warn:
Falling back on a “neutral” journalistic position can mean playing into the hands of the skeptics at the expense of the basis of life.
Obviously this conference has nothing to do with balanced journalism, rather just the opposite. So how did Intendant Bettermann respond to EIKE’s request they obey the law and return to balanced journalism?

Easy – Bettermann simply denied any one-sidedness, and asserted they are being fair and balanced. Bettermann’s letter starts with:
In response to your letter dated 9 June 2010, we would like to inform you that Deutsche Welle neither influences the global discussion on climate development in a one-sided manner, nor does it intend to, through its reporting or through the international convention Global Media Forum.
That’s a flat-out lie. And later writes:
As we have already mentioned, we enable representatives of a wide range of viewpoints and opinions to discuss in an international forum. And we will report on these discussions with our media in an honest, comprehensive and balanced manner.
That’s untrue as not a single non-alarmist view is included in the conference. He then adds:
In these discussions Deutsche Welle is only offering a forum and does not represent a decided point of view in one direction or the other.
Yet, just compare the contents of the conference announcement with the statements made by Bettermann. They could not be more diametrically opposed. The conference’s own program announcement is proof of its total one-sidedness, which means publicly funded Deutsche Welle is actively violating German law by not remaining balanced in its journalism.
Let’s be honest. Bettermann is no fool. He knows exactly what he’s doing. He has no intention of being fair and balanced on the climate issue. He’s hoping EIKE will give up trying to take on the state-funded Deutsche Welle and all its legal counselors, and simply go away.
Deutsche Welle has de facto gone rogue. It has long since abandoned journalistic principles. Rather, the broadcaster intends to shape political opinion and public policy in Germany. Now that’s real power! Boring journalism be damned.
But EIKE is not about to back down, and has sent a reply and intends to turn up the pressure. It’s a battle between David and Goliath. It’s a battle they will probably lose, but it’s certainly worth fighting. There’s simply too much at stake.
Tomorrow, EIKE’s reply to Bettermann’s denial.

"Some of Wall Street’s largest asset management companies are failing to live up to commitments to use their voting power to fight the climate crisis, according to a new report. The report, published on Tuesday by the Washington DC-based Majority Action and the Climate Majority Project, claims that BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager with more than $6tn under management, and Vanguard, with assets of $5.2tn, have voted overwhelmingly against the key climate resolutions at energy companies, including a resolution at ExxonMobil’s annual shareholder meeting, and at Duke Energy. Had BlackRock and Vanguard not torpedoed these investor efforts, at least 16 climate-critical shareholder resolutions at S&P 500 companies would have received majority support in 2019, representing a significant corporate shift on climate, the report claims. Refusing to use their proxy votes to support shareholders’ resolutions means letting companies off the hook – even as the climate crisis threatens their investors, their business models and the planet, the group says. “The climate crisis is well upon us, and leading investors are stepping up to press fossil-fuel-dependent companies to align their strategies to the goals of the Paris agreement but some of the largest US investment companies are severely lagging,” said Majority Action’s Eli Kasargod-Staub. “Blackrock and Vanguard have been using their shareholder voting power to undermine, rather than support, investor action on climate, including opposing every one of the resolutions proposed by the $34tn Climate Action 100+ coalition, calling for significant board room reform in response to its failure to act on climate change,” Kasargod-Staub added. Blackrock published a report in April on climate-related risk stating: “Climate change is a risk investors can’t ignore.” Vanguard publishes an annual “investment stewardship” report outlining its commitment to sustainable investing. Majority Action, which delivered a petition of 129,000 petition signatures to Blackrock in April, claims it ranks at the bottom of the list of fund managers using their voting powers to force companies to act responsibly on climate. “We have the largest investment stewardship team in the industry and engage with companies even in the absence of shareholder proposals,” Blackrock said in a statement to the Guardian.“We support shareholder proposals that we believe will enhance the value of our clients’ investments. But not all shareholder proposals are created equal, and it would be wrong to equate good governance with voting against management without regard for a proposal’s impact.” While funds like Blackrock and Vanguard may not be using their proxy power to force change, there is evidence that some of their funds are moving toward investing under environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. Blackrock has launched an array of sustainable equity exchange-traded funds, and it offers clients direction to build portfolios focused on companies that are likely to offer returns on clean-energy investments. Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi’s $800bn sovereign-wealth fund recently added a new criterion to its investment process: how will the Earth’s changing climate affect a potential asset’s price? According to the data provider EPFR Global, the total value of funds that have integrated ESG factors into their investment process has more than quadrupled since 2014, rising to $485bn as of April. Funds that may not be explicitly listed as ESG are also investing with the climate in mind. Blackrock holds that its 45-member environmental stewardship team engaged 250 companies last year on the subject of climate change. It says singling out the use of proxy votes is misleading because it ignores the totality of Blackrock’s engagement on the issue. In its 2018 stewardship report, the company said its discussion with clients addressed the robustness of board oversight, ESG disclosure frameworks, climate risk management, environmental impact management and sustainability around waste, water, energy efficiency, packaging and product life-cycle management. Nicholas Eisenberger at the advisory firm Pure Energy Partners said he was encouraged by the growing awareness of the urgency of the climate crisis in the business sector. “Large asset managers are just at the beginning of taking the urgent actions required to more aggressively confront the threat of climate change,” he said, describing them as battleships at the start of an emergency corrective turn. “We seen a fundamental shift in the last two years in the understanding of the dangers climate change presents but the steps we’ve taken are nowhere near adequate to the task yet.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German GKSS research centre located near Hamburg has put out a press release that kind of baffles me. Early Warning System For Heat Waves Necessary.
The press release starts:
After a very cold winter, a heat wave has gripped Germany. All signs point to July being the hottest month ever since records have been kept. The heat wave hit us just as surprisingly as the past extreme winter. So far there have not been any reliable instruments for predicting extremes. The Climate Service Center of the GKSS ResearchCentre in Geesthacht recommends improving forecast models.
I’ve been living in Germany since 1990, and to me this has not been a really hot summer. We’ve had some hot days, but with cool weather in between over the last 4 weeks – whoopie. It’s being hyped and milked for all it’s worth.
But that is not what surprises me. What surprises me is the claim there are no reliable instruments for predicting heat waves and cold waves. The press release states:
Currently it is not possible to make reliable seasonal forecasts for Europe, and to sort of predict extremely hot summers or heat waves. This is urgently needed in order to be able to implement the necessary adaptive measures and thus reduce the negative impacts on man and environment.
I think that’s crap. There are number of organisations that have had pretty good track records in making seasonal forecasts. So where could the notion that there are no reliable forecasts come from?
The press release amply cites the NOAA.

Voila! There’s your answer. If you rely on dubious institutions for your information, then you can only reach the “no-reliable-forecasts” conclusion. And we also know that the Met Office, with their super computers, failed miserably in their seasonal forecasts, so much so that they became a laughing stock and have since given it up.
But to say there no reliable forecasts available for Europe is false. There are. For example, how is it that Joe Bastardi of Accuweather has consistently called them right? Joe not only predicted the hot summer back in February/March (early warning enough I’d say), but also forecast the cold winter back last fall. Contact him. Maybe his data sources and models are better – less corrupt.
I called Rüdiger Braun, GKSS press spokesman, and he was kind enough to explain that the target is to simply build upon the existing system and to improve it.
Sounds reasonable. My suggestion then is that they start by separating the bad forecast models from the good ones, and to take it from there.
Finally, it’s peculiar how climate scientists insist their 20, 50 and 100-year projections are spot on, while other scientists fret about the lack of reliable 3-month forecasts.
And finally here’s the forecast for my town here in Germany. 20°C is a heat wave, right?

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe last two years of minimal solar activity did not prevent the earth from warming, and thus shows that the theory that the recent abnormally low solar activity could lead to a little ice age is false, so writes German FOCUS magazine.
Online FOCUS magazine  here reports on how solar activity has awoken, and thus the prospects of a new little ice age befalling the planet are now excluded.According to FOCUS, the sun has been showing some “hefty” activity over the last weeks. The series of violent eruptions had started already back in early spring, and increased in frequency over the summer.
FOCUS here is hyping the current solar activity, making it sound like the sun is really firing up. Solar Cycle 24 indeed has started, but is still sputtering badly, see the following graphic:


Not only is solar cycle 24 way behind schedule, and that scientists have had to postpone its projected start a number of times, solar cycle 24 is still well behind even the latest updated projection, and it may have a hard time reaching 75 sunspots when it peaks. Yet, FOCUS writes:
The sun is proving, in the most impressive way, that its period of minimum activity is now over and is now powering ahead toward its maximum of its new cycle, which will be in 2013.
And:
The increasing activity not only settles the dispute of a new little ice age for good, But in interaction with the El Niño, which dominated in the Pacific until summer, it could also make 2010 the warmest year since records have been kept.
So FOCUS is claiming that the recent low solar activity couldn’t stop the hot 2010.  And because solar cycle  24 is is getting active, FOCUS now sees nothing getting in the way of more warming. Rising temperatures despite 2 years of little solar activity proves the sun is not the driver. Worries of a little  ice age were for nothing. So get back to worrying about global warming!

FOCUS makes this earth-shattering conclusion based on just a couple of years of observation. This kind of junk science is not unusual in the German media.
In the report FOCUS emphasizes how some scientists were concerned about the possibility of a new little ice age beginning, like during the Maunder and Dalton minimums. FOCUS writes:
Due to the recent reduced radiation by the sun, cooling of the planet was expected. Some scientists even prophesied a little ice age.
FOCUS explains how some solar scientists believe  solar activity effected global temperature in the past.
The cause of the devastating cold periods was the sun. During the entire Little Ice Age, it showed only very minimal activity, which was evidenced by the very small number of sunspots. In one 30-year phase of the Maunder-Minimum, only 50 spots showed up  – normal would be thousands.
FOCUS then dismisses the theory applies today, saying  the theory of the recent solar minimum causing cool temperatures has failed:
Some climate sceptics even announced a cooling of about 0,2°C, but that was a false conclusion, as 2009 was the 5th warmest year since temperature recording began. The months of January to July, 2010 were the warmest such period ever – even though the sun was still close to its low period of activity.
So even with 2 or three years of low solar activity, it still got hot, and so the theory is dead, FOCUS  tells its readers. FOCUS avoids mentioning the impact of the 2009/2010 El Nino. Finally, FOCUS concludes:
Nobody has to worry about another little ice age occurring. Even if the sun were to go into a protracted minimum, the rise in temperatutres brought on by GHG would compensate for it.
I wonder what FOCUS will write if Joe Bastardi’s forecast for the next few years pans out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany people In Europe are now installing ground surface lights in their gardens to add a little flair to their evening patio parties. But now one German blog called Frischer Wind  (fresh wind) is a bit upset about it, calling such lights senseless and useless.
After all, all they do is throw light up into the dark night sky.

You see, these lights are already widely used in pedestrian zones, parks and plazas. They also provide much architectural flair to mansions, like around the swimming pool. They look great.
Unfortunately, a lot of regular folks are now picking them up at home centres and hardware stores and installing them in their humble backyards – because they too also want a taste of what it’s like to live as the rich and wealthy do. You know, like how Hollywood and elitist activists live.
Well, we can’t have all these regular folks doing that, now can we?
According to Christian Reinboth at Frischer Wind blog, it’s all a big waste that’s getting out of hand. This type of lighting contributes nothing except for illumination pollution. That’s right – there’s now too much lighting at night. To prove his point, he sets up a DIALux simulation series to demonstrate the inefficiency of these lamps by measuring ULRs (upward light ratios).

In the simulation, the illumination of a light mounted on a mast is supplemented by five 70-watt ground-surface lamps space 1 meter apart. The finding:
  The 5 ground-surface lamps contribute quite exactly nothing to the illumination of the area.
Horrors! In another scenario Reinboth determines:
…only 0.5% of the light emitted by the lamp serves as illumination – the rest is wasted directly into the night sky.
So be warned. Get them while you can. Already Edison’s light bulb is on the verge of being banned in the USA. In Europe everything 60W and above is already banned, and in a few years all incandescent bulbs will be illegal (I’ve stashed a good number of them away, so there!).  Next it’ll be the “senseless and useless” ground-surface lights, no matter what type they are. After all, they only consume energy and pollute the night skies with light.
There’s no end to possible illumination regulation. Lights can do so many horrible things. If the light colour is wrong, they attract and endanger poor little night insects, or they can cause glare, and they consume energy, which leads to climate change. The regulation is only beginning. The Dark Ages are about to return.

Watching some World Cup soccer, now taking place in South Africa, I’ve noticed fans have been attending the games wearing some pretty serious winter gear. Indeed it’s been awfully cold in South Africa. According to South African News24: 
Winter has struck with a vengeance in the Western Cape with some towns recording their first snowfalls in almost 20 years. 
The unusually wintry weather is causing traffic havoc too. 
The cold has also taken a heavy toll on penguins, killing 500 at Algoa Bay in the Eastern Cape, SA National Parks (SanParks). 
According to SanParks spokesperson Megan Taplin: 
 The chicks, aged between a few weeks and two months, are covered only with down feathers. They succumbed to the cold and wet weather that has hit Bird Island. 
Well, at least penguins would have nothing against a little warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe reduction in phytoplankton is not due to oceanic warming, but instead to overfishing. Guest writer Ed Caryl digs into the subject of phytoplankton.

The Phytoplankton Are Starving
By Ed Caryl
A recent press release from Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, announced an article published in Nature (behind a pay-wall) that we’ve been losing 1% of our phytoplankton each year dating back to 1899, meaning 40% since 1950. The article blames it on ocean warming. The article was discussed in July on WUWT and here. Let’s pull our heads back a bit more and look beyond warming.
Why are phytoplankton important?
Phytoplankton or algae are single-celled, photosynthesizing creatures at the “bottom” of the ocean food chain. They take in sunlight and CO2 and produce carbohydrates, just like plants do on land. They are the source of the biomass that all larger animals and fish feed upon. Without them, life in the ocean would not exist. Yet, much of the literature makes no mention of any dependence in the other direction, i.e. phytoplankton depend on the creatures higher up in the food chain.

Phytoplankton are a hybrid of plant and animal. Some have locomotion capability as if they were single-celled animals. They need the same nutrients as all plants: CO2, nitrogen (as nitrates or ammonia), and phosphorus (as phosphate); iron, zinc and manganese are also needed in trace quantities. When there is an excess of these nutrients, such as in agricultural runoff, “blooms” can occur where runaway reproduction produces so many that during the night when they are not photosynthesizing they can consume all the dissolved oxygen in the water, and thus suffocate themselves and the fish.
Why are phytoplankton disappearing in deep ocean areas?
In the deep ocean, away from nutrient-feeding rivers and streams, the phytoplankton population is generally low. This can be seen in the graphic above from satellite data where blue indicates low chlorophyll.
Upwelling from the deep-ocean delivers nutrients from the bottom and increases the population in areas close to shore where waters are shallow, and where rivers and streams bring nutrients from land. The phytoplankton population seems to have increased in shore areas in recent years, probably due to nutrient runoff from agriculture, while the mid-ocean gyres are still seeing population decreases.
The questions then are:
1) Why is the mid-ocean so generally poor in phytoplankton?
2) Why has the overall phytoplankton population dropped?

Let’s discuss the possibilities: Is increasing CO2 in the atmosphere causing it?
This is unlikely for three reasons. First, CO2 started increasing in a significant way many years after the reduction in phytoplankton started. Second, CO2 is a nutrient that should stimulate growth, not inhibit it. Three, the recent inshore population increase seems to go against the CO2 influence.
Is ocean warming the culprit?
Note that planktons are plentiful in very warm equatorial waters where nutrients are available. Even though the far north and south seem to have more phytoplankton, warm temperatures do not seem to be the limiting factor. Phytoplankton are not a single monolithic species. There are thousands of species of phytoplankton, adapted to various environments, including temperature.  Some phytoplankton also diurnally move vertically in the water column through large temperature gradients.
So, what could be limiting phytoplankton? The likely culprit is the limitation of nutrients. Phytoplanktons are starving in the mid-ocean. Why?
The oceans are mostly a closed ecosystem. Inputs to the system are sunlight and nutrients from rivers and streams. 95% of the biomass in the ocean is phytoplankton. Everything else in the ocean depends directly or indirectly on phytoplankton. Zooplankton: copepods, krill, and shrimp eat phytoplankton. Small fish, such as herring, sardines, and menhaden eat the zooplankton. Large fish eat the small fish. At the top of the food chain are: squid, tuna, salmon, sharks, whales, porpoise, etc…and finally us humans. But remember, this is a closed system. Except for what man removes, everything else recycles in the ocean. Everything in the ocean lives, excretes, dies, or is eaten by something. Even if it falls to the bottom, bacteria, worms, and crabs consume what is left. Only the non-digestible mineral skeletons and exoskeletons remain in the ocean-bottom sediments. Except for what man removes, the nutrients remain in the ocean. And when man does remove those nutrients, it’s forever.
Man’s removal from the oceans
The problem is that we have fished out the oceans. Only 10% of the large fish found in the oceans in 1950 remain. And we have been over-fishing the oceans far longer than just the last 60 years. Even backe in 1950, people were already noticing a reduction in stocks of whales, salmon, cod, halibut, and other fish. We probably have less than 10% of the large fish and whale stocks that were present before we began harvesting the seas in earnest.
Where does the nitrogen that phytoplankton require come from? At the the mid-ocean levels, some comes from nitrogen fixing bacteria, but the rest comes from excrement in the form of urea and ammonia from bacteria breaking down protein as carcasses decompose. Iron, molybdenum, and phosphates come from the same sources. But remember we are removing large amounts of fish protein from the ocean, especially whale, tuna, shark, and other large fish. 90% of what was there is now gone. We are removing more every year. The fish products are no longer available to the phytoplanktons. Their food supply has diminsihed. They are starving.
What does that mean for the carbon cycle?
Why is this important? If we have lost 40% of our phytoplanktons, then we have lost a significant part of the photosynthetic biosphere. Photosynthesis binds 100 to 115 million metric tons of carbon each year. Phytoplanktons are responsible for half the photosynthesis that occurs on the planet. If we have lost 40% of the phytoplanktons, then we have lost 20% of our total photosynthesis capability, or the conversion of more than 20 million metric tons of carbon per year, in carbon dioxide, into oxygen and water. This is a huge loss, but it pales in comparison to a larger loss.
Phytoplanktons have silica and calcium carbonate skeletons. Phytoplanktons are eaten by copepods and other zooplankton, which also have calcium carbonate skeletons and exoskeletons. 40% of the carbon is converted into calcium-carbonate shells and excreta that sink to the bottom, and 60% to dissolved organic carbon originating from flesh. In 1950 planktons were sequestering 16.6 billion metric tons of carbon. Today, planktons convert 10 billion metric tons of carbon. If we have lost 40% of the phytoplanktons since 1950, i.e. 40% of the carbon sequestration capability, then 6.6 billion metric tons of carbon should appear in the atmosphere.
Currently we are adding more than 5.5 billion tons of carbon yearly to the atmosphere from fossil fuel and cement production (here). In 1950, we were adding more than 1.5 billion tons of carbon per year. That’s a 4 billion ton increase. Four billion tons a year is the yearly average atmospheric carbon-in-CO2 increase. But if in that same period, 40% of plankton have starved out, they are no longer sequestering 6.6 billion tons of carbon. These figures don’t agree. This is probably because the plankton loss is not quite 40%, but somewhat below 30%. Still, the plankton loss alone can account for the rising atmospheric CO2 levels.
Maybe it’s time we curtailed eating fish for a while, and focus on consuming poultry, pork or beef.

Share this...FacebookTwitterScientists often say that if you want to see the climate change signal, then look at the poles, especially the Arctic. How often have we seen the following red-coloured graphic, or similar, and thought: Oh my God!
Well don’t panic. Even with all the “hottest-ever-first-6 months” in 2010 belly-aching, temperatures are about to take a dive. I’m not talking about because of fall and winter are approaching, I’m talking temperature anomalies over the winter. They are projected to be far below normal.
The NOAA models predict a major cooling for the Arctic this coming winter. Indeed they show a significant cooling globally. These models have been converging on an Arctic deep freeze for a few weeks now. Already the mercury north of 80° latitude has taken a dip back down to the freezing point, see DMI chart:
Now lets look at the NOAA Arctic seasonal forecast for the period Aug/Sep/Oct 2010:
In the above chart, you can see that the Arctic above Scandinavia, Russia, Siberia has cooled to a slight negative anomaly. The Canadian Arctic is still on the warm side. But almost everything above the 80°N line is blue, meaning colder than normal.
Now take a look at the next NOAA graphic which shows the global temperature anomalies for the period Jan/Feb/Mar 2011 – the dead of winter (entire NOAA graphic series here):
Look at all the deep blue up in the Arctic indicating well below normal temperatures! Some readers may say: “Well, it’s only 1 or 2°C below normal, what’s the big deal?”  It is a big deal. Today warmists are screeching about global temperature anomalies of +0.5°C.  So 2.0°C in the Arctic is huge. The Pacific and the Antarctic coast are also frigid.
Keep in mind this this post was written just by looking at the leading Climatic Indicators I have listed on my homepage. Anyone can go there and take a look at the charts. The data are there, take a look at them yourself and draw your own conclusions. Do your own thinking.
How long will the cold last? That depends on the developing La Nina. Again the big climate institutes point to a good-sized La Nina.
So, to summarise, expect Arctic sea ice to get pretty low this year, and to hear lots of headlines about it, but then watch the ice recover next year. Joe Bastardi thinks it could reach near record highs. This of course depends on how reliable the NOAA seasonal forecasts are.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Max Planck Institute has an interesting article (in German) here When Man Engineers Climate concerning the international legal aspects of employing technical means to engineer climate change. Personally, I think there isn’t much man could do, unless all resources were focussed in doing so. But others think it’s possible and even feasible.Scientists are developing processes to counteract the alleged negative impacts of climate change. But employing these untested processes could very well lead to unexpected results instead. Do these technical processes – should they function at all – comply with international norms?
There are several techniques that may be used to influence climate on earth, or what some call climate engineering, or geo-engineering or climate therapy. But the impacts of climate engineering would be completely unpredictable, and could cause more harm than good for a region. Who would be liable for damages? Think of the technical legal complications in proving in an international court that a negative impact was caused, or could be caused.
There are basically two general technical methods to counter global warming:
1. Reducing solar radiation by using reflective aerosols.
2. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere.
No. 2 for example, uses iron fertilisation to promote the growth of algae. The algae then absorbs CO2, which would disappear at the seabed when the algae dies off.  The Alfred Wegener Institute even conducted a controversial experiment to see how well that would work: The Lohafex Experiment. The scientists dumped iron sulphate over 300 sq km in the South Pacific. But things did not go as hoped. The fertiliser did indeed promote the growth of algae, but swarms of small crabs descended and torpedoed the project with their large appetites. No extra CO2 was absorbed in the end.
No.1 can be achieved by cloud-making, which reflects sunlight back into space. This can be done through salt crystals or using sulfuric acid. Mt Pinatubo showed that this works as it spewed 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, which scientists say caused global temps to drop 0.5°C.
Engineering climate (doing climate-therapy) would likely lead to unpredictable consequences. According to legal researcher David Reichwein:
Nobody knows what consequences such experiments could have on the global climate and how these consequences would impact different regions in different ways.

Reichwein adds:
A large-scale attempt to remove CO2 using iron sulphate to promote algae growth could have considerable negative impacts on ecological balance.
Climate therapy by using reflective aerosols could also lead to nasty side effects. For example a study based on a model conducted by Patricia Heckendorn of the Atmospheric and Climate Sciences Institute of the ETH Zurich showed that using sulfur aerosols in the stratosphere would likely lead to a considerable degradation of the ozone layer.
In Pinatubo’s aftermath, shifts in precipitation were observed. So a large-scale application by man could lead to devastating results, and thus would certainly be challenged legally.
The problem is that the impacts of climate therapy processes cannot be contained to a specific area. The threat of uncontrolled adverse impacts entail international law and human rights issues. Says Reichwein:
Geo Engineering up to now has yet to find a foothold in human rights treaties.
Employing geo-engineering processes will lead to the opening up of a whole new can of worms legally, let alone questions of technical feasibility.
In the meantime, hoards of companies, all with promises of delivering successful climate therapy, are lining up at the feeding troughs, which are filled by crooked politicians.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s what Joe says in his latest video. The PDO is now going into its cold phase and the current La Nina is going to be a bear – and quite possibly a polar bear at that.
The Pacific, the primary global climate driver, has been in its warm cycle since the late 1970s, and that’s coming to an end. That period was dominated by El Ninos, which kept the planet on the warm side. But now the Pacific has flipped and we’re now entering a cool phase, where La Ninas are expected to dominate.
I disagree with Joe when he says the brutal winters are going to start in 2013. In my view they’ve already started! So If Joe thinks the last couple winters have been mild, I sure hate to see what “brutal” is going to look like!

Joe thinks that brutal winters follow deep La Ninas. And because he thinks the next 2 years will be dominated by a major La Nina, then cold winters are expected to strike beginning in 2012-2013.
He’s getting bold with his predictions. But if he winds up being right, then the AGW theorists and their half-baked models are history. Joe says in the video:
Here we go. We spike this up. And now we’re into a major La Nina that’s going to last for the next couple of years. When we come out of that, there’s really good reason to believe the winter of 2012-13, and perhaps beyond, is going to be quite cold.
Then there are the wild cards, says Joe: solar activity and volcanoes, which impact the ENSO. Joe also mentions how the current La Nina has so far come on faster and harder than anything he can remember. You can see what he means looking at the following graphic:
Comparing this La Nina to the last one, this one is in a big hurry, and is shaping up to be a deep one. That all of this is occurring during a very slow solar cycle may be just a coincidence, but enough scientists are out there yelling “heads up!”
I myself am buying extra long-johns this fall for the months and years ahead. Last year’s pairs are already worn out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Arctic had a steep last spurt of melt over the last week, sending the ice area below 5 million sq. km. That puts 2010 as the third lowest ice extent, or the 2nd highest in the last four years, spin it the way you want.

But the melt is now pretty much over, and temperatures in the Arctic have started their plunge. The Danish Meteorological Institute’s latest graphic clearly shows.


The Arctic forecast for the next 14 days shows things are going to get cold fast, with frost spreading south into Canada.

Colder than normal Arctic is in the forecast for the coming winter
But this happens every year of course. Unless winds play some tricks, the sea ice area is not going to get less. The volume reduction is over. So what can we expect for the coming winter? Joe Bastardi for example predicted we would finish at about where we finished this years, but then predicted a recovery over the next couple of years. We’re entering a cold PDO, and the NOAA forecast for the coming winter indicates a colder than normal Arctic.
NOAA NWS Chart 
Remember, NOAA and GISS are used to painting the Arctic red, and not blue. So, if the foreacst pans out, both poles will be colder than normal. That means thicker and more extensive ice. That’s why I made the WAG prediction a couple weeks ago of 5.75 million sq km for September, 2011. Maybe it’s a bit on the high side, but more likely than the once almost certain death spiral made by the experts a couple of years ago.

"The UN secretary general says that he is counting on public pressure to compel governments to take much stronger action against what he calls the climate change “emergency”. “Governments always follow public opinion, everywhere in the world, sooner or later,” António Guterres, said on Tuesday in an interview with Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets, led by Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation, in partnership with the Guardian. Guterres, a former prime minister of Portugal, added: “And so … we need to keep telling the truth to people and be confident that the political system, especially democratic political systems, will in the end deliver.” Guterres refused to comment on Donald Trump and the Trump administration’s hostility to climate action, but a CBS News poll released on 15 September found that 69% of Americans want the next president to take action, while 53% say such action is needed “right now”. Guterres said that “it would be much better” if the US was “strongly committed to climate action”, just as it would be better if Asian countries [notably, China and Japan] stopped exporting coal plants. Until then, he said, “what I want is to have the whole society putting pressure on governments to understand they need to run faster. Because we are losing the race.” With five days remaining before the UN climate action summit on 23 September, the secretary general cited the “fantastic leadership” of young activists as a leading example of how civil society can pressure governments to honor the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit temperature rise to “well below” 2C and preferably to 1.5C. Recent election results across Europe – where green parties gained significant public backing – also left Guterres optimistic that at next Monday’s summit the European Union will announce that it promises to be “carbon neutral” by 2050, as the Paris Agreement mandates. “Nature is angry,” said Guterres, who recently returned from a visit to the Bahamas, where Hurricane Dorian unleashed what he called “total destruction”. He further cited ferocious drought in Africa, melting glaciers, bleaching coral reefs, the hottest month in recorded history last July, and potential future sea level rise of 10 to 20 meters (33 to 66ft) as evidence that, “You cannot play games with Nature. Nature strikes back.” Don’t bring a speech – bring a plan, Guterres famously told heads of state and government in the months leading up to this summit, and it appears that only leaders who followed his instructions will be allowed to speak at the plenary session. To gain a slot, a country had to commit to doing one of three things, said UN officials: be carbon neutral by 2050; “significantly” increase how much it will cut emissions (or, in UN jargon, significantly strengthen its Nationally Determined Contribution); or make a “meaningful” pledge to the Green Climate Fund, a pool of money provided by wealthy countries to help developing countries leave fossil fuels behind and increase their resilience against climate disruption. UN officials expect that 60 to 70 countries will have made sufficiently solid commitments by next Monday that their leaders will be invited to outline their country’s plans from the dais, with each leader granted a mere three minutes to speak. While emphasizing that he had no desire to intervene in the 2020 US presidential election, Guterres spoke positively about a proposal by a leading Democratic candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders, for a Green New Deal that would be global. Most of the leading Democratic presidential candidates endorse one form or another of Green New Deal, a program in which the US government would create millions of jobs by investing in solar power, energy efficiency and other measures to reduce heat-trapping emissions. But a new report by the Nation magazine pointed out that only Sanders’ Green New Deal meets the scientific imperative of cutting global emissions by 45% by 2030 on the way to carbon neutrality by 2050. Sanders’ Green New Deal does this by pledging not only to slash emissions in the US but to help developing countries cut their emissions as well. “The Paris Agreement was very clear,” said Guterres. “There was a commitment by the developed countries to mobilize $100bn per year, from private and public sources, to support the developing world both in mitigation [ie, reducing emissions] and adaptation [preparing against impacts]. Obviously, it is essential that all countries, including the United States, play a role in relation to this.” Rich and poor countries have wrestled with the question of whether and how much financial assistance the rich should give the poor ever since governments first began debating the climate problem at the UN “Earth Summit” in 1992. The poor argue that the rich countries’ emissions are the foremost cause of global warming and climate disruption, while poor countries are the ones that suffer most of that disruption. Rich countries generally do not dispute those facts, and have given lip service to providing assistance, but actual contributions have been modest. The US, for example, has contributed only $1bn, and the Trump administration blocked any additional contributions.  Guterres said in the interview that “of course” he was aware of the global dimensions of Sanders’ Green New Deal, and he added that, “Any attitude from a country like United States to increase … finance to the developing world would be of course welcome.” As required by UN protocol, the secretary general was careful to add, “That doesn’t mean that we want to interfere in the American election.” As a former elected official himself, Guterres also emphasized the need for governments to show the public that climate protection need not mean economic hardship. The secretary general advocates in particular climate-smart tax reform: reducing taxes on people’s incomes while increasing taxes on heat-trapping emissions. “If I [as a politician] take money from you with an increased carbon tax but I give you nothing in return, people will be against [it],” said Guterres. Although rarely described this way, corporate subsidies for production of fossil fuels are also a form of tax. “Let’s be clear: subsidies are paid with taxpayers’ money,” he said, adding with a smile, “I really do not like to see my money as a taxpayer going to bleach corals and melt glaciers.” Guterres disputed a common criticism of a Green New Deal – that it will cost too much – by turning the question around. “What is the cost of the consequences of taking no action?” he asked. Depending on what governments do at the climate action summit next Monday, and are pressured to do by civil society in the weeks and years to come, the world may learn the answer to that question soon enough.

"Trade unions representing hundreds of millions of people around the world have come out in support of what is expected to be the biggest climate mobilisation the world has ever seen. The global climate strike on Friday is set to see thousands of walkouts and demonstrations in cities on every continent except Antarctica.  For the first time adults, businesses and trade unions have been asked to join the youth climate campaign which has grown in just over 12 months from one teenager’s solo protest outside the Swedish parliament a year ago to a millions-strong movement of young people demanding radical action. College students and school children are expected to be joined by adults at more than 4,500 demonstrations in at least 130 countries on Friday as young and old, rich and poor take to the streets to demand politicians urgently tackle the climate crisis. Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, said its 200 million members in countries from South Africa to Germany, Mozambique to Turkey would stand shoulder to shoulder with the students. “The solidarity of the trade union movement globally is behind you,” she said. “The ITUC, with over 200 million members around the world, is totally in support of your leadership.” Burrow said her members would strike alongside students in the streets where the local laws allowed, and where that was not possible trade unionists would take “stop work action” or stage other forms of protest and workplace campaigns to demand radical climate action. Strikes and supporting actions are being planned by unions in scores of countries from the UK to South Africa, Italy to Australia, Brazil to the Philippines. “You need to know that your stand is our stand,” she said. “This is the challenge of our future. For unions we have been saying for a very long time, there are no jobs on a dead planet.” It remains up to individual trade unions to decide what action to take and organisers say it is unclear exactly how many trade unionists will take to the streets alongside the students on Friday. But the backing of some of the biggest and most powerful workers’ groups in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa is a significant boost for the climate movement. Jake Woodier, from the UK Student Climate Network, said: “Unions have a rich history of fighting for progress, so for the global climate strike to have the backing of The International Trade Union Confederation adds massive weight behind our calls for taking immediate action.” In the UK there are now over 200 demonstrations planned for Friday – the biggest mobilisation to date – and the Trades Union Congress last week urged its members to back the global strike with a “workday campaign action” with workers staging walkouts, joining demonstrations or holding environmental workshops. In New York, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who started the youth climate movement, will join students and adults ahead of a key UN climate summit taking place in the city next week. The demonstrations were given a boost after New York public schools said pupils could leave lessons to join the strike without being penalised. The New York demonstrations will culminate with protesters surrounding the UN Climate Summit on Tuesday, when world leaders meet in an attempt to step up action. But organisers say time is running out and are calling on everyone who is alarmed by the unfolding ecological crisis to join Friday’s demonstrations and send a clear message to politicians around the world. Woodier said: “We need ambitious plans – like a Green New Deal – that will tackle climate breakdown while making our societies more equal. To achieve climate progress we need everyone to take action before it’s too late.” Friday’s global strike marks the start of a week of climate protests around the world, culminating in a second global day of action, labelled Earth Strike, on 27 September. Leila Alam, 13, from Lahore in Pakistan, has been campaigning for clean air and water and said everyone should join Friday’s protests wherever they are. “We really want Pakistan to play its proper role in controlling climate change and to make sure we can adapt and not be unprepared for the coming challenges we have been warned of.” Jerome Foster II, a 17-year-old from Washington DC, agreed: “We are calling on everyone to join us. We need a truly diverse and multi-generational movement, made of people from all ages and backgrounds, not just the youth. “We need adults to stand up and call for action and to support young people and do things that young people can’t do. We should be fighting for our future.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitter12°F warming and 20 ft sea level rises over the next 100 years?  Yawn – how boring. That doesn’t scare anyone anymore. Boring, boring, boring.We need shock and awe. It’s time to get drastic and bury the needle, time to roll out the mothers of scare stories.
For the warmists it’s Hail Mary time.  The “”unless-we-announce-disasters, nobody-will-listen” gig has to be taken to a whole new unheard-of level. The populace is simply much denser than ever imagined. They just aren’t getting it. It’s not sinking in.
It’s time to bring in the super special effects. So leave it up to the German Die Welt online to do that. The normally respectable Die Welt online reports here on scientists studying the planet Venus and coming to the conclusion that Earth may end up like her hellish little sister planet, with surface temperatures of 875°F and atmospheric pressures of 1300 psi (90 times more than now on earth) and more.
This is not the first time a media outlet in Europe has ventured out to this extreme. But hey, things are desperate for the warmists – and especially for their vision of geopolitical and societal resurfacing.
The Die Welt piece starts with the title and introduction:
Hell Planet Venus Is Not So Different From Earth
875°F and sulphuric acid in the air: A climate of hell reigns on the planet Venus and scientists are now studying if those conditions are threatening the Earth.
Die Welt reports on what scientists said at an international Venus conference in Aussois, France. They have determined that inhospitable Venus is much more similar to Earth than previously thought.
Yes, be worried, be very worried. Die Welt writes the scientists believe that:
Venus in the past may have been very similar to Earth – with oceans – and even life. Then the climate changed, and the planet turned into red-hot desolation.
These claims, says Die Welt, are not just science-fiction fantasy, rather they are based on measurements from the European Venus Express probe launched in 2005, which is currently measuring and analysing Venus with an array of high-tech instruments.
Researchers from the Max-Planck-Institute for Solar System Research in Lindau and Germany’s version of NASA are also involved.
Even scientists like Colin Wilson of the University of  Oxford thinks it is probable that:
 In the past there had to have been a lot of water on Venus.
Just like Earth. But what really makes Venus interesting, says Die Welt:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




 —is the fact that it is a prime example of a runaway greenhouse effect that may have started in a way that is feared to be now taking place on Earth.
Die Welt describes how things work on Venus:
Due to its thick cloud cover, only 20% of the solar energy reaches the planet’s surface. This 20%, however, cannot be radiated back into space because of Venus’s dense atmosphere, and thus leads to enormous heating of the planet.
Die Welt then adds:
The manmade pollution of the Earth’s  atmosphere – warns a majority of climatologists – could also lead to a runaway situation whose final result would be what we have on Venus today.
That is: 875°F and an atmospheric pressure over 1300 psi.
Scientists are interested in finding out if volcanoes could have erupted and disturbed the atmosphere on Venus early on, and thus led to a runaway greenhouse effect, The scientists at the conference in Aussois are trying to determine the cause of resurfacing on Venus.
To summarise, Die Welt is attempting to get its readers to believe we are creating a hell on Earth. It doesn’t get more cynical than that.
Meanwhile, just in the time it took to read this post, hundreds of people died worldwide because of malnutrition. But governments and the media couldn’t care less of the current, real tragedy, it seems. It’s more important to go all out and spend billions to cynically concoct new bogus future scare stories to frighten citizens, and ignore the messy problems of today.
Journalists and governments need to wake up and get back to doing what they’re supposed to do. Funding and supporting scientists in concocting ridiculous scare stories is not one of them. Indeed it’s willful neglect of the pressing problems we face right now on the planet today.
In Germany this behaviour is a violation of the law and is called Unterlassene Hilfeleistung (neglect to provide rescue assistance).
The world is not facing a climate catastrophe. Instead it’s dead in the middle of a leadership catastrophe. So much so that one could argue it’s bordering on crime.
Voters and consumers, it’s time to run these bums out-of-town.

"At a meeting of the Senate climate crisis task force on Tuesday, lawmakers praised a group of young activists for their leadership, their gumption and their display of wisdom far beyond their years. They then asked the teens for advice on how Congress might combat one of the most urgent and politically contentious threats confronting world leaders: climate change. Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who has galvanized young people across the world to strike for more action to combat the impact of global warming, politely reminded them that she was a student, not a scientist – or a senator. “Please save your praise. We don’t want it,” she said. “Don’t invite us here to just tell us how inspiring we are without actually doing anything about it because it doesn’t lead to anything. “If you want advice for what you should do, invite scientists, ask scientists for their expertise. We don’t want to be heard. We want the science to be heard.” In remarks meant for Congress as a whole, she said: “I know you are trying but just not hard enough. Sorry.” The audience laughed. Supporters broke into applause. Senator Ed Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-sponsored the Green New Deal and leads the Senate task force, was perhaps surprised by her bluntness. But he smiled. Seated at the table with the teens were some of the most sympathetic and vocal supporters of bold action on climate change in Congress. But facing a Republican-controlled Senate and a hostile White House, the prospect of enacting reforms at the scale and scope called for by activists – and many scientists – is bleak. “We need your leadership,” Markey told Thunberg. “Young people are the army politically, which has arrived in the United States. You put a spotlight on this issue in a way that it has never been before. And that is creating a new X factor.” Still, he vowed to try: “We hear you. We hear what you’re saying and we will redouble our efforts.” Thunberg was one of several youth activists invited to address the task force during two days of action and speeches aimed at urging lawmakers to support “transformative climate action”. She was joined by activists from across the US and South America, part of a “multiracial, intergenerational” effort to combat climate change. In August 2018 Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden when aged 15. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries. Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.” Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings. Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. The meetings and speeches in Washington are intended to raise awareness ahead of a global climate strike on Friday in which students and workers will walk out of schools and offices to pressure their governments to act as world leaders gather in New York for the annual United Nations summit. “The generation of the Green New Deal will not only survive but we will thrive,” said Nadia Nazar, co-founder of the advocacy group Zero Hour, at a news conference earlier on Tuesday. “We will no longer be known as the kids fighting the apocalypse. We will be known as the solution to the climate crisis.” In the US, support for sweeping action on climate change is polarized. Many Republicans – among them Donald Trump – are still openly skeptical of the science behind global warming. Republican leaders have mocked Democrats for introducing a Green New Deal and have used the proposal as a cudgel against lawmakers and presidential candidates. The Green New Deal is an ambitious 14-page resolution that calls for a “10-year national mobilization” that would eliminate the nation’s emissions in one decade. Scientists say limiting warming to 1.5C would require cutting manmade carbon levels by 45% by 2030 and reaching net zero around 2050. Markey said their movement is shifting the political landscape. The senator pointed to the 2020 presidential debates as evidence of what has changed. Candidates are being asked about climate change and pushed to introduce plans to combat global warming. This is in stark contrast to 2016. “What has happened? You have happened,” he told the activists. “You are giving this extra level of energy to the political process that is absolutely changing the dynamics of politics in the United States.” The 2020 election, Markey said, will in many ways be a “referendum on climate change”. Thunberg arrived in the US after crossing the Atlantic on a solar-powered yacht. She rose to international prominence after launching “Fridays for Future”: student-led strikes that have spread to 135 countries. She has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. On Monday, she met Barack Obama. The former president shared a photo from their meeting, in which he praised Thunberg as “one of our planet’s greatest advocates” and someone who is “unafraid to push for real action”. Later on Tuesday, the group was scheduled to meet Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal in the House. On Wednesday, Thunberg will deliver what has been billed as a “major address” to members of Congress."
"As irony would have it, the Sunday of London fashion week was a freakishly warm day for mid-September. Victoria Beckham’s show was being held in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, so there was a queue snaking down King Charles Street in Westminster while ID cards were checked, bags were scanned and the audience lolled in the sunshine. On the other side of the road, the fashion queue was mirrored by an orderly lineup of climate crisis activists – many dressed not dissimilarly from the fashion crowd, with a lean toward asymmetric clothing and unusual sunglasses – holding placards reading “The Ugly Truth About Fashion” and “Business As Usual Is Killing The Planet”. Sara Arnold, an Extinction Rebellion spokesperson, talked eloquently about the need to “wake people up to their power as citizens, not consumers”. A fashion photographer, perhaps misjudging the mood, began to heckle her, only to be shushed by the very showgoers who the protesters were facing off against. “If we realise and act now, we have the power to change our course,” Arnold continued. The fashion industry audience listened politely, until all the Saint Laurent and Gucci handbags had been through the scanner and we could file into the show space, where a view of David Beckham and Dame Helen Mirren displaced from our minds any thought of the imminent demise of the human race. Welcome to Late Stage Capitalism: The Musical – the show formerly known as fashion week. Fashion week has never just been about fashion. It is a microcosm of everything that is compelling and seductive about modern life, and of everything that is terrifying about modern life as well. The gaudy consumerism that makes fashion week an increasingly queasy spectacle isn’t just about handbags: it’s about the processed food we eat, the packaging we use, the trips we make by car and plane. Fashion week is an all-singing, all-dancing, jazz-hands live-action hot take on how we live. Fashion has been the golden child of popular culture for two decades. From Sex and the City to Beyoncé’s politically charged wardrobe in the Formation video, from the Oscar red carpet to Chanel’s Superbowl-sized catwalk shows, fashion has broadcast to the whole world. Fashion weeks in Lagos and Copenhagen as well as London, New York, Milan and Paris have fed on the intravenous energy of their cities, becoming a modern version of the royal box at the opera house: the place to see and be seen as both powerful and glamorous. (We have a word for that, in fashion. It’s called being fabulous.) Fashion’s lure to celebrity extends way beyond the ranks of reality TV stars. Last Thursday, the day London fashion week began, I was at a lunchtime event with Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and then spent the evening down-table from Theresa May at a women’s-only dinner thrown by the designer Anya Hindmarch. If fashion is the new opium of the masses, fashion week is the A-list’s guilty pleasure. But the climate crisis has set fashion on a collision course with the zeitgeist. This is both a practical and a philosophical problem for fashion. Practical, first, because of the ever-increasing production of new clothes and the churn of landfill this leaves in its wake. But philosophical, too, because fashion has to be about looking ahead. If fashion doesn’t engage with the future, it literally isn’t fashion. “The climate crisis is this generation’s war, and wars change everything,” said Hindmarch at dinner on Thursday. There is a new seriousness to the mood music in fashion. Alpha front-row reading now means Fashionopolis: The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes by Dana Thomas, or The Testaments. (The most-Instagrammed bag of show week was a tote bag printed with the cover of the new Atwood novel. If you can’t track that down, there’s a Guardian x Katharine Hamnett tote in partnership with Friends of the Earth, on sale Thursday.) If you are reading a magazine, make it the new issue of Teen Vogue with Greta Thunberg on the cover. It is now more of a status symbol to boast about how old your clothes are, whether sourced from your own wardrobe or from a vintage store, than how new-season they are. Deadstock – unsold clothes from past seasons – is a buzzword all of a sudden. Backstage after the Preen show on Sunday morning, the designer Justin Thornton told me that some pieces in the collection would be made in limited runs, as they were being produced “out of deadstock we had in the studio from old seasons, that we wanted to reuse rather than buying new fabric”. Ganni, the cult Danish label that opened its first London store this week, regularly makes capsule collections out of old-season stock. Roland Mouret, who is on a mission against the wastefulness of single-use clothes hangers – “the plastic straws of the fashion industry” – also featured upcycled baseball caps by the Berlin milliners ReHats. A pivot away from new clothes doesn’t mean the end of fashion. Curated edits of pre-loved clothes are emerging as a model to bring hanger-appeal and contemporary relevance to secondhand clothes. At its most upscale, this can mean vintage Paris fashion hand-picked by Marie Blanchet at William Vintage. But it can also be rented designer pieces from MyWardrobe.com, from where you can borrow a Gucci handbag or a Burberry trenchcoat, boosting your wardrobe and the circular economy at the same time. Also on the rise is peer-to-peer rental on Hurr Collective, where a week’s rental of a new designer piece is usually around 15% of the retail price. It has become fashionable to predict that the future of fashion is the end of trends, but I’m not convinced. Watching models in white sunglasses and silk headscarves dance in feathered minidresses and foxy tailoring by the British luxury brand 16Arlington at its show this weekend, where the collection was inspired by the glamour of 1960s Italy, reminded me how evocative and desirable a retro look can be. These clothes were newly made, but a vintage-oriented fashion mindset could take such a show as a jumping-off point to fall back in love with old pieces in a wardrobe, an attic, or a secondhand store. With the future not looking all that pretty, nostalgia could be a rising stock. Fashion isn’t going away any time soon. But to keep pace with the zeitgeist, it needs to smarten up its act."

Share this...FacebookTwitterStanford researchers dispel the belief that high yield agriculture, with its intensive use of fuel-guzzling machinery and chemical fertilisers, emits huge amounts of “dangerous” greenhouse gases. Read here.High yield agriculture has resulted in a savings of the equivalent of 590 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide.
The Stanford news release writes:
– The yield improvements reduced the need to convert forests to farmland, a process that typically involves burning of trees and other plants, which generates carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
– The researchers estimate that if not for increased yields, additional greenhouse gas emissions from clearing land for farming would have been equal to as much as a third of the world’s total output of greenhouse gases since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in 1850.
– The researchers found that without the advances in high-yield agriculture, several billion additional acres of cropland would have been needed.
and
The researchers also calculated that for every dollar spent on agricultural research and development since 1961, emissions of the three principal greenhouse gases – methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide – were reduced by the equivalent of about a quarter of a ton of carbon dioxide – a high rate of financial return compared to other approaches to reducing the gases.
I wonder if these results will lead activist environmental organisations to reconsider the use of gene-improved plants, which have the potential to greatly improve yield. You also have to ask if organic agriculture, with its non-use of chemical fertilisers and thus lower yields, is bad for the planet. And, the results of this study should tell governments  concerned about GHG that bio-fuels are a bad idea because they require millions of acres of extra farmland, in addition to that used for food production.

"A “one-size-fits-all” solution to addressing the climate crisis through our diets could be unhelpful, as how we eat affects the environment in different ways depending on where we live and how our food is sourced, according to a new report. Although reducing the consumption of meat and animal-based products globally could lower greenhouse gas emissions, it could also have adverse impacts on people’s health and nutrition in some countries, according to a report published online in the Global Environmental Change journal on Monday.  The report, which assessed dietary patterns across 140 countries, paints a complex picture of the country-specific implications of dietary changes on both people and the environment. “We need to be careful about oversimplifying things or prescribing a ‘one-size-fits-all’, western-centric solution to the challenges of diet and climate,” said Martin Bloem, a director at Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future and one of the co-authors of the study. The report notes that many Britons are choosing vegetarian diets to reduce the environmental damage caused by their lifestyles, but suggests that they may better off going “two-thirds vegan” – eliminating animal products including meat and dairy from two in three meals. For a British person, going vegetarian would reduce the climate impact attributable to their diet by 36%, while cutting meat and dairy out of two-thirds of their meals would reduce it by 61%. That’s because dairy has a relatively high carbon footprint. In other countries, the impact of meat-based diets could be hugely different – for example, a pound of beef produced in Paraguay contributes nearly 17 times more greenhouse gases than a pound of beef produced in Denmark, partly to do with the deforestation involved in beef production in Paraguay. According to the study’s authors, diet-related solutions to the climate crisis ought to be sustainable and address the problems of undernutrition, obesity, poverty and economic development. Achieving healthy diet in most low- and middle-income countries could require an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and water use due to food production. “It is critical to recognise that different countries have different priorities and are at different stages of development – meaning there are different imperatives for these countries and their populations,” Bloem said. “A top-down diktat that recommends a plant-based diet without taking into account the nutritional needs of vulnerable populations or the availability of certain foodstuffs is neither helpful nor appropriate,” he added. “The fact is that in low-income countries, some people, especially young children, will need to eat more animal products, particularly dairy and eggs, to get adequate protein, vitamins, and minerals. Consequently the diet-related emissions and use of freshwater in these places will have to rise. This means that in high-income countries, where people generally have enough to eat – although [they] are not necessarily healthy – the shift towards more plant-forward diets and away from carbon- and water-intensive consumption patterns has to happen faster.” The report suggests that in the UK, while animal foods can be an important source of nutrients for young children, meat and dairy are overwhelmingly responsible for the greenhouse gas footprint of British diets. Plant foods account for 69% of the calories consumed in the UK but only 12% of greenhouse gases and 40% of the water footprint. “The solutions are not uniform and will inevitably involve trade-offs,” said Bloem. This article was amended on 18 September 2019 to make clear that 36% is the average amount that a British person’s carbon footprint attributable to their diet would be reduced by if they were to become vegetarian, as opposed to their overall carbon footprint."
"One is a student engineer who became obsessed after watching an incendiary film about air pollution. The other is a 16-year-old who went on China’s first climate strike. Zhao Jiaxin and Howey Ou are part of a small but growing minority of young Chinese determined to press their country towards more radical carbon-cutting action. The pair are also China’s sole winners of carbon neutral “green tickets” the UN is providing to 100 young people around the world.  China is the world’s leading carbon emitter. It generates 60% of its electricity from coal-fired power and coal consumption and carbon emissions have risen for two years in a row after a plateau between 2014 and 2016. Emissions are expected to rise again in the figures for this year. Yet within the country, the positive half of the picture is more likely to be heard: how devoted the nation is to Xi Jinping’s goal of constructing an “ecological civilisation”, how China is a climate change leader compared with the US, and how much record-breaking renewable energy capacity it continues to install. Howey does not think this is enough. She conducted a public climate strike in front of government offices in Guilin in southern China for several days in late May – Greta Thunberg called her a “true hero” – before the authorities said she had to stop because she did not have a permit. The 16-year-old, who spends her spare time planting trees around her hometown, was nominated to travel to this week’s United Nations climate summit in New York by the youth activist group Earth Uprising and nearly had to back out of attending because her chaperone was worried she would not stick to the Chinese government script. “People in China don’t know the situation and think the Chinese government is doing a lot and is great,” she said. “The point is that people here can’t petition to protest and do something about the climate. Even if people want to change [things] they think activism in China will fail and the cost is too [high].” In a country where the party line controls the climate debate to the extent that a general apathy infuses the broader public, Howey and Zhao are the sudden, fresh young faces of environmental activism. There are some signs they are not alone. Young people and women living in cities are increasingly aware of global climate issues and China’s place at the centre of them, according to a recent study in the journal The China Quarterly. “In China, the good news is that compared to the population, younger Chinese tend to be more concerned about climate change,” said Liu Xinsheng, the lead author of the report from Texas A&M University. “The bad news is that overall, average Chinese climate change concern is low relative to many countries around the world.” Zhao’s passion for climate issues was triggered by the documentary Under the Dome, which he watched four years ago while studying engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The film inspired him to set up an NGO to raise awareness of the climate crisis on campus and create a platform disseminating information on the social media app WeChat. “I found something I could do for society,” Zhao said of his awakening after seeing the film. “In my last year [at university] I felt that if I did not communicate, did not advocate about what I thought was true, then powerful [other ideas] would dominate society.”  Under the Dome, an examination of the policy failures and personal effects of air pollution in China, appeared online for several days in February and was viewed by as many as 300 million people before being banned. It is unlikely there will be climate strikes in China on Friday like those being staged in the west. The country passed a law after the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989 that imposed strict conditions on public gatherings and forced groups to register with the police if they want to stage a protest. Organisations connected to the government such as the China Youth Climate Action Network, founded in 2007, are one of the official routes young people can take to raise climate awareness. The group holds events and educational training to help raise awareness of climate issues among China’s young people. Zheng Xiaowen, CYCAN’s executive director, said: “I don’t think student protests are a helpful solution to the problem in China. Because of the unique cultural and political circumstances, Chinese people tend to resort to more moderate ways to voice their concerns. #FridaysForFuture I don’t have to stuck in the way of striking,I must do what I could do right now.If I keep‘preparing’,the time will lose.While the time is the most gracious thing to survive from climate crisis.Planted 6 trees in 13th,Sep.Starting #PlantforSurvive,This is WEEK1. pic.twitter.com/IFvFW0ypN8 “We need to advocate actions against climate change in ways that best suit China. For us, the best way is to work with the government and help come up with plans to tackle those issues together.” While small steps are being made, the lack of awareness of climate change in the country is alarming, Liu said, because China is the world’s leading greenhouse gas emitter and one of the countries that could be badly affected by extreme weather events and rising sea levels, with knock-on effects for the economy and health. “China has top-down policymaking,” Liu said. “It is hard to imagine without public awareness and concern for climate issues that the government policies will be successful.” No Chinese media outlets have signed up to a global pledge to increase coverage of the climate crisis in the week leading up to the UN summit on Friday, a pledge 250 media groups have agreed to including the Guardian and Bloomberg. The inertia bothers Howey, but she believes there is hope: “It is frustrating to me, but I’m still alive and have the passion for change.” Additional research contributions from Zhong Yunfan"
