Bremen’s Weser Kurier daily is very sure: “Climate change is damaging organs”
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
The newspaper of the German port city of Bremen, the Weser Kurier surprised its readers on September 8 with almost unbelievable news:
Climate change is damaging organs
It sounds like a paradox, but the consequences of climate change were visible to see with the St. Andreas Church organ a few weeks ago. ‘The instrument was beset by mold and mildew“, says organ builder Martin Hillebrand from Isernhagen. For about six weeks he and his team have been working in the church to meticulously clean the organ and to fine-tune the pipes.”
We already suspected climate change for many things, but its role as a vandal of church organs is something new. So how does it cause mold and mildew to infest the organ? How does that work? The Weser Kurier tells us:

The mold infestation in the instrument is not a single occurrence – quite to the contrary. According to Hillebrand about 70 percent of the organs in so-called village churches are under attack. ‘This involves mainly churches where the people congregate for mass only every other week or less often. These churches are thus heated less and so in the wintertime they quickly become very prone to moisture,’ said the expert. Fungus attacks are also helped by warm, moist climate in the summertime. ‘Research instituites have shown that this and the relative humidity will increase in the future,’ says Hillebrand.”
So it’s not really due to climate change, but moreso people are going to church less and less? Those who do not heat have to expect mold – that’s been a well-known rule for a very long time. Warm, humid summers in Germany are also known. In summer it’s warm, and in winter it’s cold. What’s new? Only the relative humidity remains. Has it really risen over the last decades because of climate change? Here we take a look at the data from Braunschweig at the norddeutschen Klimamonitor website (Figure 1).
Oh dear, the relative humidity has actually trended downwards over the last 50 years. Climate change is not guilty! The problem actually appears to be caused by the lack of heating in churches, which promotes mold infestation. The climate-activist Weser Kurier once again regrettably has told its readers nonsense. The editors would surely welcome some letters from readers. Here is their contact page.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s ambitious offshore wind energy project is increasingly threatening to become an expensive green energy folly.
Originally the flagship North Sea wind energy project was scheduled to be delivering clean energy by August 2013. However technical failures beleaguered the project and delayed the opening 7 months: until March 2014. 
BARD I offshore windpark shut-down extends 9 months. Builders have been unable to resolve technical faults plaguing the project from the start. Text added to photo by NTZ. Original photo: BARD.
But March came and passed, and again the technical problems persisisted and engineers were forced to delay the opening until August 2014, background here.
But that deadline too has now passed and the Austrian Der Standard here reports that the 400 MW BARD I offshore wind park shut-down will be extended at least another month as engineers struggle to get the park online by the end of September.
Engineers remain baffled
According to Der Standard: “Problems with over-voltages in the cable network plagued and ultimately led to a switch-off. The troubleshooting was supposed to be completed in August, however no exact analysis has yet to be produced.”

Hope to repair problems this month
A consortium of companies have been feverishly searching for the root cause of the network problems, but Der Standard writes that the reas0n for the faults is still unclear and that fluctuations in the grid “overloaded a filter” at the Tennet-operated Borwin 1 transformer station. “The repairs should be finished by the end of September.”
Here we are assuming they mean the year 2014. BARD 1 has not issued any press releases or provided comment on the new delays.
Delay costs up to 2 million euros a day!
The Bard 1 North Sea wind park consists of 80 units 5 MW turbines and is located offshore 100 km from the north German coast. The extended shut down will mean a further financial blow to the project, with cost overruns reported to be already well in the double digit millions of euros. Alarmist site klimaretter here writes of the shutdown.

The estimated costs run between one and two million euros per day.”

But in the end, everyone knows who is going to end up footing the bill. Germany already has among the highest electricity costs in the world. Germans will have to prepare to pay even more, and soon!

"With just 11 years left to prevent irreversible damage caused by the climate emergency, there are still options to wean the world’s economy off its reliance on fossil fuels. However, anything less than putting Britain on a war footing will not be enough. The government response so far has been timid. Theresa May introduced a net-zero carbon emissions target for 2050, but there are reasons why the Conservatives haven’t gone further: her party is hard-wired to fail. Clinging to a belief in the power of free markets, it neglects the fact that to decarbonise the economy greater investment from the state is required. Free-market advocates detest big government. But faced with the scale of the challenge, only government has the weapons powerful enough to tackle the crisis. So far May and her allies have been held back by their unswerving belief in the market economy and the mobilisation of private capital. Political will can be transformative. The government’s independent committee on climate change has a target for spending of 1-2% of GDP by 2050 on greening the UK economy, for both the public and private sector. But faced with the gathering crisis climate activists are starting to push for greater government investment. Doubling the UK’s investment rate – with the bulk coming from the state – in green infrastructure, technologies and industry should create millions of good jobs and build low-carbon wealth. State funding will be required to support people working in industries incompatible with a green future, such as mining, oil and gas, heavy industry and energy-intensive transport. When the state invests, the private sector is encouraged to raise its investment alongside these efforts. Last week, the government launched a half-hearted attempt to encourage more financing of green projects using market-based solutions. It might show that the Tories are moving in the right direction, but their plans came straight from the neoliberal playbook. Ministers announced with aplomb that companies listed on the London Stock Exchange would be forced to disclose their risks from climate change by 2022. Tinkering at the margins of an economic model driving environmental breakdown is guaranteed to deepen the climate emergency If only investors knew the scale of the risks, they would price them accordingly – penalising those with carbon exposure and rewarding those without. It is undoubtedly a positive step. Every little helps. But Tesco shouldn’t need to tell investors it would lose money if the world goes up in smoke. News of melting glaciers, vanishing biodiversity and extreme weather events is telling enough. On the left there is more momentum. John McDonnell has argued for the forcible ejection of companies from the stock exchange that do not have a plan for tackling climate change. Labour would create a sustainable investment board, supplemented by state-owned regional investment banks and a £250bn national transformation fund with targets to invest in low-carbon businesses. Climate activists are angling for a mass government mobilisation equivalent to Roosevelt’s New Deal, which lifted America from the morass of the Great Depression. In an attempt to outline a roadmap to a Green New Deal in Britain, the left-leaning thinktank Common Wealth is this week launching a bundle of papers. There will be six policy reports in total over July that will add up to a guide to turbocharging the low-carbon economy, while supporting communities through the transition. Mathew Lawrence, its director, argues that to finance the transition the largest ever peacetime mobilisation of resources will be required. “Tinkering at the margins of an economic model driving environmental breakdown is guaranteed to deepen the climate emergency,” he says. Markets on their own cannot drive a society-wide reorganisation of production and consumption at the pace and scale required. “We need a government-led process of economic restructuring,” he said. Among the measures are proposals to retool the financial system. A report will say that the green investment bank – sold off under Tory free-market dogma – should be brought back under state control. The Bank of England could adjust financial stability rules to penalise commercial banks for holding brown assets on their balance sheets, while promoting more green lending.  There can be no economic stability in a climate emergency. The foundations of our prosperity came close to tumbling down in the 2008 financial crisis. Brexit threatens our future living standards. But global heating stands to surpass them all. So far the UK is lagging behind. Ministers might talk about a bright new future of electric vehicles, with encouraging news that Jaguar Land Rover plans to build its electric XJ car in Britain. But its target of 2040 for ending petrol and diesel car sales would mean polluting cars still being sold in Britain a full decade after irreversible damage to the planet could be complete. There is evidence that government intervention can work. Despite deriving most of its wealth from fossil fuels, Norway has used spending and tax cuts to drive up the sale of electric vehicles to count for half of all cars sold. And it targets the end of petrol and diesel car sales by 2025. Britain has had some success. The carbon intensity of Britain’s energy production has improved markedly with the rapid increase in wind energy. As coal-burning power stations are phased out, about half of energy production is now from renewables and nuclear. Some Tories are moving in the right direction. Last week, the Conservative Environment Network set out a manifesto that included banning fracking, a sevenfold increase in offshore wind by 2050, an earlier ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans, as well as fertiliser and pesticide taxes. They should be encouraged to go further still. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt broadly welcome the thrust of the debate, but neither leadership contender has endorsed the recommendations. Both have made profligate tax and spending commitments in their campaign, with little reference to the emergency facing the climate. Rather than entering into a bidding war on tax breaks for the rich, the next prime minister should commit more money instead to a real response to the climate crisis. The scale of the emergency requires it."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIndependent German meteorologists have been increasingly criticizing the Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) – German Weather Service – for its climate activism and alarmism. The once staid yet highly professional and competent organization used to be among the most respected in the world.
But that appears to be no longer the case today as meteorologists ramp up their harsh criticism of the DWD’s forays into climate alarmism. They are clearly losing respect for and confidence in the organization.
Brandishing the “climate change bludgeon”
The latest wave of criticism was unleashed by statements made by the DWD spokesman Gerhard Lux in response to a spate of thunderstorms and deluges that have hit Central Europe in recent weeks. Lux claims that it is “another indication of climate change“. Moreover, one leading German meteorologist claims that the DWD has been overdoing it in issuing weather warnings for every perceived anomaly. According to Dominik Jung at Yahoo News:
Since the beginning of June the DWD has issued storm warnings on 36 of 66 calendar days.”
Although high profile meteorologist Jung says a number of these were of course legitimate, he feels overall the DWD has been overdoing it with the warnings:
Just how many of these storm warnings were actually justified, however, is not listed. I could list some examples of false storm warnings. It is as if nothing else could be expected that after the severe thunderstorms of the last weeks, immediately again the ‘climate change bludgeon’ is being brandished.”
Jung doesn’t understand what all the fuss over the recent “unusually rainy” weather is all about, noting that 6 of the last 8 months were drier than normal, and that overall “it all evens out”.
The opposite of what models predicted!
The UK’s Met Office was not the one proclaiming visions of barbeque summers. Leading experts in Germany in the early and mid 2000s warned of a future of “Sahara-summers” for Central Europe, claiming that we had to prepare for “hotter and drier” summers. Here Jung quotes an article by German Bild daily that featured IPCC climate scientist Professor Mojib Latif. Bild wrote:
‘The probability of an extremely hot summer is increasing.’ The heat and missing rain for Professor Latif are ‘indices that global warming in Germany has arrived’.“

But Jung reminds us that precisely the opposite has actually happened since: “11 summers later, we have yet to see one that has been drier than normal.” Jung adds that “Germany is still miles away from Sahara summers” and summarizes:
In 2003 the heat and drought were signs of climate change, 2014 is now a month of July that is too wet? Who is supposed to understand that?”
The term climate change “overstretched”
Jung also uses Latif’s prediction of warm winters with little snow and frost ahead for Germany as another example of a bad forecast (a prediction he made on April 1, just after David Viner’s made his now much ridiculed prediction). Today we see that here too the exact opposite took place. What followed was a series of brutal winters, to which Latif responded by claiming a cold winter does not refute a warming climate. But this is a reaction that baffles meteorologist Jung, who in turn points out:
Now we are being told that ONE overly wet month of July supports the climate change? The term climate change is being stretched.”
Science groping in the dark
Jung criticizes the constant flip-flopping that regularly goes on in climate science and asks: “Who takes this back and forth seriously?“…”The thought that the science is groping in the dark is becoming more pronounced than ever.”
Jung even goes so far as to question their competence and notes that “many people are no longer really taking it all seriously.” Jung speculates that the alarmism, no matter what the weather does, is in part motivated by the desire for more funding.
Retired meteorologist on DWD: “Makes me sad”
Retired meteorologist Klaus-Eckart Puls is even harsher with his criticism of the DWD and their recent climate alarmism shenanigans. Puls himself worked 30 years for the DWD. In an e-mail he communicated his reaction:
The DWD is developing more and more into a ‘political climate-alarmist’ institution – that makes me sad because I was actively in service 30 years.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German media are giving time and space to skeptical voices.
The latest is a report appearing in Germany’s print high-profile national daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) which features climate economist Richard Tol titled: “The apocalypse won’t take place“.
Image above, right: FAZ
The subheading reads: “Climate economist Richard Tol sees the consequences of global warming as manageable – he has become a “figure of hate for green activists”
The FAZ describes the controversial 44-year old Dutch scientist and outspoken IPCC critic as someone who in the early days was “quite green”, comes from a modest background, but who developed to become one of the world’s leading authorities in his field. The FAZ:
Tol is one of the most productive and most respected researchers in his field. He is (co)author of more than 250 papers in renowned journals and according to the Ideas-Repec databank, among the top 100 scientists worldwide.”
The FAZ reports on how Tol believes the IPCC has gone overboard with hysterical scenarios for the future and as a result had his name removed from the IPCC’s final report.

On claims that 97% of climate scientists are in agreement, the FAZ writes:
Such a consensus does not exist, he explains. ‘Climate science is very bitter and politicized.’ He sees the unpleasant tendency of scientists getting more attention by issuing ever more drastic warnings.”
According to the FAZ, Tol is confident that humans can overcome the challenges posed by climate change through their uncanny ability to adapt by applying their ingenuity. His come country of Holland is cited as an example with the construction of dikes to hold back the seas. Another example he cites is the huge gain in agricultural yields over the past decades that will provide ample supplies of food in a warmer world.
Overall Tol believes “the European Union is on the wrong path” with its climate policy of costly subsidies for the feed-in of green energies, which has scarcely has an impact on climate.
It should all be discarded and the ten thousand climate bureaucrats should look for new jobs. We need a policy change”
In the FAZ article, Tol is in favour of a carbon tax because in his view it is “the only effective measure.”

"Theresa May has urged countries to be more ambitious in tackling the climate crisis after Donald Trump reiterated his determination to ditch the Paris accord. The prime minister led a session on the environment at the G20 summit in Osaka, which will be one of her final appearances on the world stage. In the G20 communique, which was agreed after many hours of wrangling among the “sherpas”, who represent the group’s member states, 19 of the 20 reiterated their commitment to the Paris accord. The final wording echoed a statement from the last G20 summit, in Buenos Aires, but government sources suggested some countries, including the US, India and China, had tried to water it down. The US president had sought to excise the reference to the Paris agreement from the communique altogether, with the help of several other countries, reportedly including Brazil and Turkey. May said she was pleased there was a communique at all. At her press conference at the end of the summit, the prime minister said: “In recent months we have heard hundreds of thousands of young people urge us – their leaders – to act on climate change before it’s too late. “I am proud that the UK has now enshrined in law our world-leading net zero commitment to reduce emissions. And I have called on other countries to raise their ambition and embrace this target,” she said. The prime minister said the communique showed the 19 members’ continued support for the Paris agreement and she stressed the importance of cooperation with other countries.  “I firmly believe in the importance of international cooperation and compromise. In Osaka this week we have worked hard to bridge differences between G20 countries on some of the biggest challenges our nations face. “That has not been easy but we have made progress. I continue to believe that we are stronger when we work together.” May did not have a formal bilateral meeting with Trump at the summit, but said she had held discussions with him, and pointed out that he had visited the UK earlier this month. Earlier, a senior UK official said of the communique: “I think it was a long night for the sherpas and I think it’s definitely a challenging process but work is ongoing in relation to the communique so we’ll have to see where we end up.”  He said the UK had pushed for “the strongest wording we can deliver”. May has embraced the cause of tackling climate change as her three-year premiership draws to a close – telling journalists en route to Japan that she had been inspired on her walking holidays in Switzerland by seeing the rapid rate at which a glacier had receded over the past decade."
"Jessie Sims is one of 600 people in Stroud, Gloucestershire, to have had their homes retrofitted to make them more energy efficient. In 2013, the district council replaced the windows and doors, insulated the loft and floors, and installed solar panels on the roof as part of its programme to become carbon neutral by 2030. “I think it’s brilliant,” she says. “I used to have an old-fashioned storage heater, which cost a fortune to turn on and didn’t work well. Now it’s cosy and I’ve halved my fuel bills.”  Last week, the Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called on councils to lead the way in cutting carbon. “Local government and local communities are absolutely essential to confronting the climate emergency,” he said. It follows the announcement by Theresa May last month to commit to net zero UK carbon emissions by 2050. Stroud has been tackling the causes and effects of global heating since the 1990s. In 2009, it adopted a carbon management plan and in 2015 announced that it had become the first local authority in Europe to become carbon neutral. Energy-efficiency measures and renewable-energy installations include solar panels on all municipal buildings, secondary glazing and internal insulation on the council’s grade II-listed building, and ensuring all its electricity and heating comes from renewable sources. By creating a local waste-management company in partnership with neighbouring authorities, it boosted its low recycling rates to 61% and now sends the least waste per capita to landfill. Last month, it outlined its plans to become a carbon-neutral area by 2030, by ensuring all its own vehicles are electric or hybrid; making all homes (not just social housing) energy efficient; shifting to very low or zero carbon renewable electricity and heat generation; and tree planting. It also envisages a “dramatic” reduction in emissions from road transport by switching to walking, cycling and renewable-powered public transport. “We’ve reached all the low-hanging fruit,” says Simon Pickering, chair of the district council’s environment committee and a Green party councillor. “It will no longer be business as usual to cut the energy use of all buildings by at least 80%, generate over half the district’s electricity needs from renewable sources and transform how we travel.” With the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report last year warning that the human race has just 12 years to limit the most devastating impacts of global heating, stark images of the toxic effect of plastic on marine life in David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II, and Greta Thunberg and British pupils going on strike from school over the climate crisis, there is growing public awareness – and demand for action. Stroud may have started tackling its emissions earlier than most, but Nottingham is arguably the most ambitious council, having set a target for the whole city to be carbon neutral by 2028. It has met the previous target of cutting CO2 emissions by a quarter by 2020 two years early. Every new council house built has solar panels while council leaseholders have been offered discounted rates. It aims to plant at least 10,000 trees by 2023 and is creating bee-friendly areas in all neighbourhoods. It has one of the UK’s largest fleets of electric buses and claims to have the world’s largest fleet of biogas double-decker buses. The waste-collection depot has solar panels on the roof, to charge the council’s fleet of electric dumper trucks and street sweepers. A workplace parking levy on employers providing 11 or more parking spaces for staff generates £9m a year, which is ringfenced for renewable transport schemes and has already paid for the city’s new tram system. The trams are powered by the council’s not-for-profit energy company, which supplies all its electricity from renewable sources. Sally Longford, deputy leader of Nottingham city council, says: “The idea of being carbon neutral is scary for a lot of people, but a carbon-neutral city has benefits for everybody.” Retrofitting and tackling congestion and air pollution improve health, lower bills and create good green jobs, she explains. Oxford city council, meanwhile, is holding a citizens’ assembly to shape its action plan. It is on target to cut emissions by 40% by 2020 and plans to introduce a zero-emission zone in the city centre. It will also be trialling what it believes is the world’s largest hybrid battery to power ground-source heat pumps serving around 300 homes and increase electric vehicle-charging capability. Across Great Britain and Northern Ireland, more than 100 local authorities have recently announced a climate crisis. “In the past eight months local authorities representing more than half Britain’s population have declared a climate emergency in their areas,” says Kevin Frea, deputy leader of Lancaster city council and co chair of UK Climate Emergency Network.  But Simon Brammer, head of cities at sustainable energy charity Ashden, which has just produced a toolkit for councils, thinks they need to do more. “We think cities need to respond much faster,” he says. “They are responsible for producing up to 80% of the UK’s CO2 emissions.” And too often, these declarations are butting up against development demands. Manchester city council’s plan to become carbon neutral, for example, explicitly excludes airport emissions – and, indeed, the council has a part share in the airport . Norwich and Herefordshire councils have been criticised for approving ring roads, despite having declared a climate emergency. And while lots of local authorities have committed to tackling global heating, many have yet to do so, including most of the home counties and many other county councils. Cumbria county council has even approved a new deep coalmine. Planning laws can hamper council plans for new developments to be zero carbon or carbon neutral, or to approve onshore wind farms. From 2006, authorities were able to insist that houses were built to the highest energy standards, but this regulation was scrapped in 2015.  A report by the Association for Public Service Excellence (Apse), published later this week, says local authorities need to take an organisation-wide response to action on climate issues: from councils’ corporate financial strategy to all council services, in particular housing, waste and recycling, transport and infrastructure investment. Climate-emergency declarations are welcome, but they are statements of intent unless they are followed up in the short-, mid- and long-term with measurable outcomes, it will say. “Local councils can be at the heart of tackling climate change, but to translate declarations into tangible carbon-reduction actions there is a huge question of resources,” says Paul O’Brien, Apse’s chief executive. “If we are serious about tackling waste, sustainable housing development, air quality – to name just a few of the issues that contribute to carbon emissions – we will need a real step-up in the resources available to local councils. Climate action matters, but there is a disconnect between what local councils can realistically deliver when resources are being choked by austerity.” Back in Stroud, Sims is clear that cutting carbon has been beneficial for her as well as the planet. She says: “Now I eat well and heat well.” • Additional research by Jessica Murray Last year, Bristol city council became the first local authority to declare a climate emergency. It committed to making the council carbon neutral by 2025 and the whole city by 2030.  Now it has just published its implementation plan, which once passed at a full council meeting later this month, commits the council to a 200% increase in renewable energy, low-emission public transport, building a new waste centre to improve recycling rates, installing solar panels on 10,000 council houses, retrofitting 7,000 homes with insulation and other energy efficiency measures each year, as well as training councillors and staff in climate change issues. Other measures include assessing all major projects against their impact on emissions, expanding the number of electric car-charging points and a dramatic reduction in single-use plastics. In a statement, Bristol’s elected mayor, Marvin Rees, said the climate emergency was “one of the biggest global threats facing our planet”. “We might be one city in the context of a worldwide issue, but it’s vital we take immediate action,” he said. “Our response must be inclusive, to ensure that everyone benefits. “The report shows our biggest challenge is consumption of goods and services from outside Bristol. This is a fundamental challenge to city government, corporations and citizens to take urgent action to change behaviours.” But it is hard to see how the city will achieve its ambitious green targets if controversial plans to expand Bristol airport, which Rees strongly supports, are approved. The proposals are designed to double passenger numbers by 2045. North Somerset – a unitary authority that has also declared a climate emergency – will rule on the planning application for the airport. Some argue the council isn’t going fast enough. Green party councillor Carla Denyer, who proposed the climate emergency motion, welcomes the decision to introduce an annual carbon budget and to set a tougher carbon neutrality target but criticises the lack of concrete detail. “Eight months after full council declared a climate emergency, this is still a plan to produce a plan,” she says. “We need an end to the ‘business as usual’ approach, replaced with rapid and ambitious action, and unfortunately there isn’t enough of that in this report.”"
"Climate action lawsuits against governments and corporations have spread across 28 countries, according to a new analysis. The study reveals that more than 1,300 legal actions concerning climate change have been brought since 1990.  While the US – with 1,023 cases – remains the leader in climate litigation, other countries are increasingly seeing individuals, charities and states take action. Joana Setzer, co-author of the report by the Grantham Institute and the London School of Economics, said: “Holding government and businesses to account for failing to combat climate change has become a global phenomenon. “People and environmental groups are forcing governments and companies into court for failing to act on climate change, and not just in the US. The number of countries in which people are taking climate change court action is likely to continue to rise.” In the two and a half years since Donald Trump became US president, lawsuits have sought to prevent his attempts to undo environmental regulations. An analysis of 154 cases in the report shows that no such reversal of a climate regulation brought before the courts has yet survived a legal challenge. Countries where legal cases have been taken include Australia, where 94 cases were launched, the UK (53), Brazil (five), Spain (13), New Zealand (17) and Germany (five). One landmark case in Pakistan four years ago established the right to challenge a lack of action on climate change on the basis of human rights. Asghar Leghari, a farmer in the south Punjab region of Pakistan, took the government to court claiming it was violating his human rights by failing to tackle the impacts of climate change. He alleged that his leaders were failing to ensure water, food and energy security in the face of the challenges posed by climate change. The court found in his favour, and one of the outcomes was the establishment of a climate change commission. The Urgenda Foundation case against the state of the Netherlands successfully argued for the adoption of stricter emissions reduction targets by the government. The result is the subject of an appeal. In the UK, Client Earth has repeatedly won in court action against the British government over its failure to take action over illegal levels of air pollution. More recently, an action was filed before the UN human rights committee in May this year by a group of eight people who live in the Torres Strait Islands off the northern tip of Australia. It calls on the Australian government to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and adopt adequate coastal defence measures in consultation with the island community. The report, published on Thursday, says: “Climate change litigation continues to expand across jurisdictions as a tool to strengthen climate action. “The rise in strategic and routine cases, a ramp-up in legal action by NGOs, the expansion of climate change suits into other areas of law, and improvements in climate science suggest that the use of climate change litigation as a tool to effect policy change is likely to continue.”"

A wave of commotion has just been unleashed by the very recent FOX News report on Google’s contemplating of changing the way it ranks website pages with its famous search engine. Also read here.

Towering arrogance from speech-rights midgets? The self-appointed gate-keepers of the Truth: Image cropped here.
Rather than ranking websites on their popularity, a Google research group is looking into ranking websites based on how “factual” they are. If implemented, it would literally mean Google taking on the gatekeeper role of who deciding fact from fiction. Google has already created a “knowledge vault” containing “commonly believed facts”. In summary sites found to deviate from what Google considers facts, would be automatically down-ranked in searches. Result: dissident opinions would surely get buried.
Though the system may have some merits, it is chock-full of pitfalls and it risks the establishment of an information dictatorship – a so-called Orwellian Ministry Of Truth. In other countries such information control programs are the sort of things one associates with tyrannies and dictatorships, like Iran, North Korea, Red China, Russia, Venezuela or Islamic fundamentalist states. Note in all these states, leaders are convinced it’s for the overall good of the people.
“That is very troubling,” writes Jim Lakely, Director of Communications of the Chicago-based think-tank The Heartland Institute in an e-mail. He thinks there is no doubt that the ‘facts’ of politicized sites who clearly have a defined agenda will get favorable treatment in Google’s ‘knowledge vault’ while dissident sites will be locked out.
“I worry about this issue greatly… My site gets a significant portion of its daily traffic from Google,” Anthony Watts told FoxNews.com. “It is a very slippery and dangerous slope because there’s no arguing with a machine,” he added.
While Google maintains this project is only in the development phase, others are not so sure. One climate science dissident, who wishes to remain anonymous for the time being, believes that Google is already “heavily biased and directing traffic away” from climate science skeptic sites.
When it comes to science, the move reveals that Google seems oblivious to how the discipline works. It that is so, it makes the omnipotent company all the more dangerous. Science is always hotly disputed. For example is used to be a universal “fact” that saturated fats were bad for human health – before dissidents forced a rethinking. With Google’s new proposed policy, dissident voices would never see the light of day and progress would be stunted as a result. Dissidence is the life blood of science itself. By removing dissidence, as Google unwisely moves to do, science itself would de facto get starved and be catapulted back to the Dark Ages and the times of the Inquisition.
Global warming alarmists have long been working to get Google to suppress dissident voices on the subject of climate change. In 2009 conservative news site Newsbusters here wrote:

Former Vice President Al Gore a few years ago advised Internet behemoth Google about “aspects of search quality.”Such was reported by the New Yorker in its October 12 issue (subscription required). […] given the ongoing concerns about Google’s political leanings and how its search algorithms might be manipulated to favor liberal news outlets over conservative points of view, the very idea that Gore might have had any input to this process is worrisome to say the least.”
Thus we see that the Google project has long been in the works, and so the preparation appears to be grand and fundamental in scale. It cannot be that an organization with the power and might of Google would take it upon itself to police the world’s body of knowledge and to decide who is trustworthy and who isn’t. This borders on dangerous megalomania.
Censorship can be fought
The irresponsible and arguably arrogant deeming of “unreliable sources” is not something that Google alone is contemplating, but was already once reality among some powerful government institutions worldwide just months ago. For example Germany’s Federal Ministry of Environment issued a 123-page publication that singled out German and American journalists and scientists who it claimed were responsible for “spreading doubt and false information“ on climate change. Among them: Fred Singer, Sallie Baliunas, Willie Soon, Frederick Seitz, Joe Barton, Pat Michaels, John Christy and Ross McKitrick.
Fortunately the German journalists and scientists who were targeted did not take the state-sponsored attack lying down. The brochure is no longer available. A small victory for the freedom of scientific dissent.
So will Google and its many backstage operators be successful?
If anything, the move confirms yet again that the globalist alarmists have lost the argument and that the public debate has become unwinnable for them. This is the reason for the “state-of-emergency” scale move. Despite their huge advantages in the media and state funding, they are unable to explain the harsh winters, the models’s failure, the sea ice growth and the many other warmer Holocene periods. Now they are forced to shut down dissidents, a-la-Inquisition.
But it will never work. Every lie has a short shelf-life and can be propped up only for so long. Eventually it gets stale, and no one is left to swallow it.
Google’s move, however, is indeed extremely worrisome and very serious. The new US Congress needs to move swiftly and forcefully, and to put these obviously out-of-control Google executives on the hot seat for a serious grilling or two and a little schooling on the virtues of un-monopolized dissent. The human right to be heard, and to not be silenced, is at stake here. Sympathetic lawmakers need to be contacted.
Kennedy aptly concludes: “Whoever controls the Truth, controls the world“.
The power to determine the truth belongs to the people, and not to Google.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online center-left Die Zeit features an interview with Prof Hans von Storch, Professor at the Meteorological Institute of the University of Hamburg and Director of the Institute for Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Research Centre in Geesthacht, Germany.

The focus was on mainly storm activity and its possible link to man-made climate change.
In the end the very green-oriented Die Zeit did not get the sound bites it likely had hoped to get.
All within natural varibility
In the interview, in response to the question of storm frequency and intensity, von Storch, a renowned climate scientist with 40 years of experience, says:
We see no intensification in storm activity at our latitudes, and our climate models also indicate that we cannot expect it.
Also since 1950 they have not become systematically more frequent or stronger. Therefore we believe that Christian [October 2013 North Sea storm] moved within the range of normal variability.”
Von Storch also tells Die Zeit that storms do not occur with a rather regular periodicity, saying that “sometimes there are decades when they rumble a lot, and some decades when they don’t.”
The north German professor also tells Die Zeit it is very difficult to make comparisons between the storms of today and those of decades ago because the data recorded back then are nowhere near as complete:

If you simply compared the pressure values with those from a few decades ago, then you would reach the conclusion: Yes, the storms have become more powerful. But that would be a faulty conclusion.”
The reason for this, von Storch explains, is that the measurement of the storms core pressure was very inadequate and readings were often taken by ships that were not located near core of the storm. Today satellites provide very reliable data for comparisons.
Climate models do not indicate future intensification
On the future of storms and increased intensity, von Storch tells Die Zeit no one can rule it out, of course, but thinks it’s “implausible“. “Our climate models do not lead us to expect it.”
Von Storch also cautions against putting too much emphasis on model results:
Ultimately, however, observations and not climate models decide. We always have to expect that we will know the truth only afterwards. We can’t predict everything with certainty.”
“Pause” has led to more attention on natural fluctuations
Next Die Zeit looks at the warming pause, which it writes it has been confirmed “by some scientists” and asks if the “pause” has ended. Von Storch replies:
At least one finds no strong evidence showing that the long-term warming pause in the climate system has ended. The debate over this postulated ‘pause’ in the end has had a good side: Natural fluctuations have gotten more attention. We understand the climate a little bit better.”
In summary, von Storch sees 1) no data supporting a trend of stronger, more frequent North Sea storms, 2) models do not show an increasing trend, 3) recent storms have been within the range of natural variability, and 4) the pause has been substantial enough that it has shifted more focus onto natural factors.
The AGW theory of catastrophic warming has taken a significant blow.

"When Andrea Carnevali’s son started at St Mary’s Catholic primary school in Chiswick he was alarmed to find that pupils were sometimes kept indoors at break times, despite a large playground. The reason was the nearby six-lane A4 road, which has up to 100,000 vehicles thundering past the school each day. As evidence mounted about the impact of poor air quality on children’s health, the headteacher restricted time outside.  Carnevali and other parents decided to take action. Within months they had crowdfunded almost £100,000, and last month a 126-metre “living wall” of 12,000 plants was installed as part of a clean-air initiative at the school. They hope the wall – designed to trap exhaust particles, absorb sound and increase biodiversity – will transform one of London’s most polluted schools into one of its greenest. “We’re immensely pleased,” said Carnevali. “The council is monitoring changes in air quality, and we hope for a 40% improvement – but even 10% would be good.” St Mary’s living wall is one of many being installed around the country by local authorities and private developers. Tennis fans may have noticed two enormous living walls flanking the giant outdoor screen at this year’s Wimbledon championships. And they are increasingly a feature of hotel and retail developments. A stunning vertical garden graces Elephant & Castle underground station in south London, part of a plan to improve air quality at one of the capital’s busiest road intersections. In a variation on a theme, “living lamp-posts” were installed this month as a trial in Ebury Street in Belgravia, central London. They will be monitored for air quality improvement for a year; if the pilot is successful, it could be extended to some of the other estimated 494,000 lamp-posts in central London. In Hull, the council is considering a proposal to transform Whitefriargate, a historic thoroughfare now blighted by empty shops, with vertical gardens. “Demand is definitely growing. There’s been a steady rise in interest over the past two years, and a noticeable increase since the beginning of this year,” said Calvin Dalrymple, a living wall consultant with ANS Global, one of the country’s leading suppliers, and the creator of St Mary’s living wall. “It’s being mainly driven by local authorities, but also a greater awareness in the private sector of the need for sustainable architecture.” According to Benz Kotzen of the Green Roofs and Living Walls Centre at the University of Greenwich, “we need every tool to try to improve things, and there just isn’t enough capacity in urban environments to create green infrastructure at ground level. “It’s no longer good enough to have a building facade that just keeps out the weather. In the future, building facades will need to be much more functional – cleaning the air, collecting energy and improving biodiversity.” Vertical gardens could also be used to grow food, he said, adding that herbs, strawberries, tomatoes and rocket did particularly well. Living walls range from simple wire structures to support climbing plants to sophisticated modular systems, using soil or hydroponic manmade substrate, and solar-powered irrigation. The cost ranges from £200 to £800 per square metre. The main challenge with maintenance was working at height, said Kotzen. “Growing plants vertically is no more difficult than horizontally, but all gardens need maintaining.” Not everyone is a fan of the trend towards vertical gardens. “They’re not a solution, except for the wealthy,” said Mick Crawley, professor of plant ecology at Imperial College London. “There are much cheaper and more effective ways of improving air quality.” Local authorities struggling to pay for essential services would be better advised to plant trees, he said. London’s first living wall, installed in 2005 by Islington council at a children’s centre at a cost of £100,000, withered and died within four years after the irrigation system failed. “Living walls will die if they’re not designed properly and maintained,” said Dalrymple. “There are four key things to longterm sustainability: correct water management, correct substrate, maintenance and plant selection taking into account shade, wind and elevation.” With between 28,000 and 36,000 deaths in the UK each year attributed by Public Health England to long-term exposure to air pollution, living walls are expected to become more common. But the benefits go beyond improvements to air quality. Lucy Dunhill, who is behind the Hull proposal, said: “Visually, Whitefriargate is very depressing, with boarded-up shopfronts and very bad acoustics. Your eyes are not drawn up, you keep your head down when you walk along Whitefriargate.” Her green walls plan will, she hopes, “become an attraction in itself as well as improving the environment”. Andy Wayro, landscape design manager at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon, said its living walls were aesthetically pleasing, had reduced noise and connected people to nature. “The feedback from players and the general public has been really positive,” he said. At St Mary’s in Chiswick, children have been planting a section of the wall with wild strawberries, thyme, rosemary, sage and lavender, using wooden markers to allow them to monitor growth. “The children adore it, and so do the teachers,” said Carnevali. “Apart from any environmental benefits, they say it makes them happier and calmer.”"

Today’s modern wind turbines now soar to heights of up to over 200 meters, can have outputs of well over 5 MW, and blade tip speeds of over 300 kilometers per hour, thus making them especially lethal to avian wildlife, and hazardous for human health through infrasound.

Source: academia.eu, Erin F. Baerwald et al.
21,000 square meters of “swept area” of annihilation 
To give an idea of their scale, Danish company Vestas, for example, offers an 8-MW offshore turbine with a total height of 220 meters that is equipped with a monster rotor diameter of 164 meters. The result: horrendous blade speeds and pressure gradients. Flying wildlife stand no chance. Worse is the growing size of the hazardous swept area.
Vestas boasts that its V164-8.0 MW® turbine has a swept area of more than 21,000 square meters, which is “equivalent to almost three football pitches“. Vestas bellows: “When it comes to profitability, the bigger the swept area the bigger the revenue.”
Unfortunately for birds and other wildlife it is also: The bigger the swept area, also the bigger the wildlife annihilation area. But wildlife be damned.
Huge number of fatalities
Wildlife fatalities from wind turbines are poorly documented and mostly unknown. Estimates are on the low side and thought to be much higher, as the industry attempts to play down their real danger.
Birds, bats and other animals can be killed by turbines in any one of three ways: 1) through loss of their habitat due to the disruption of a vast installation area, 2) direct impact with high speed moving blades (birds) and 3) from barotrauma, where bats are the primary victims.
The most sinister of the three is barotrauma, which is a common way bats are killed by wind turbines.
Study shows mayhem

An article published at academia.edu by Erin F. Baerwald et al of the University of Calgary confirms the violent deaths that bats suffer from wind turbines. Bats do not even need to come into contact with the moving blades. It is enough for them to be close to the end of a moving blade to become victims of barotrauma. As the turbine’s blade slices by at 300 km/hr, the negative pressure in the blade’s wake causes the air in the bats’ lungs to expand and incur lethal injury.
Barotrauma typically occurs when an organism is exposed to a significant change in ambient pressure, such as when a scuba diver, a free-diver or an airplane passenger ascends or descends, or during uncontrolled decompression of a pressure vessel.
The academia.edu article writes:
The decompression hypothesis proposes bats are killed by barotrauma caused by rapid pressure reduction near moving turbine blades [1,4,5]. Barotrauma involves tissue damage to air-containing structures caused by rapid or excessive pressure change; pulmonary barotrauma is lung damage due to expansion of air in the lungs that is not accommodated by exhalation.”
Moving turbine blades create zones of low pressure as the air ﬂows over them. Animals entering these sudden low pressure zones may suffer barotrauma; academia.edu article writes:
Pressure differences as small as 4.4 kPa are lethal to Norway rats Rattus norvegicus) [6]. The greatest pressure differential at wind turbines occurs in the blade tip vortices which, as with airplane wings, are shed downwind from the tips of the moving blades [7]. The pressure drop in the vortex increases with tip speed, which in modern turbines turning at top speed varies from 55 to 80 m/s. This results in pressure drops in the range of 5–10 kPa (P. Moriarty, personal communication), levels sufﬁcient to cause serious damage to various mammals [6].” […] 
Even if echolocation allows bats to detect and avoid turbine blades, they may be incapacitated or killed by internal injuries caused by rapid pressure reductions they cannot detect.”
188 dead bats examined
Baerwald and her team examined 188 dead bats killed by a wind turbine facility in southwestern Alberta:
Of 188 bats killed at turbines the previous night, 87 had no external injury that would have been fatal, for example broken wings or lacerations (Table 1). Of 75 fresh bats we necropsied in the ﬁeld, 32 had obvious external injuries, but 69 had haemorrhaging in the thoracic and/or abdominal cavities (Table 1). Twenty-six (34%) individuals had internal haemorrhaging and external injuries, whereas 43 (57%) had internal haemorrhaging but no external injuries. Only six (8%) bats had an external injury but no internal haemorrhaging.
Among 18 carcasses examined with a dissecting microscope, ten had traumatic injuries. Eleven bats had a haemothorax, seven of which could not be explained by a traumatic event. Ten bats had small bullae — air-ﬁlled bubbles caused by rupture of alveolar walls — visible on the lung surface (Figure 1A). All 17 bats examined histologically had lesions in the lungs consistent with barotrauma (Table 1), with pulmonary haemorrhage, congestion, edema, lung collapse and bullae being present in various proportions (Figure 1). In 15 (88%), the main lesion was pulmonary haemorrhage, which in most cases was most severe around the bronchi and large vessels.”
In summary, the wind turbines are extremely lethal to wildlife on a scale so horrendous and embarrassing that it is being kept out of the public’s eye. What’s worse is that these turbines, and the growing swept areas of annihilation they bring with them, have been installed by the thousands and plans are being made to install many thousands more – many in natural areas. Wildlife will have no chance.
This is all endorsed by Greenpeace and the WWF.

"It might seem ambitious for an incoming House of Representatives crossbencher to be talking about changing the conversation about power in Australia, but Helen Haines is determined to try. “We’ve had a conversation in Australia that is so fundamentally steeped in what power looks like, and I guess by reducing it in so many ways to numbers, we’ve eliminated I think what traditionally democracy is about, which is about representation,” the member for Indi tells the Guardian Australia politics podcast. Haines succeeded fellow independent Cathy McGowan in Indi at the May federal election, and the context for the observation about reframing the conversation about power is triggered by an assertion from me that numbers ultimately determine status in Canberra. In the last period of McGowan’s parliamentary service, Scott Morrison governed in minority, which made the House of Representatives crossbenchers kingmakers, increasing their influence. Haines acknowledges that period has passed, although she points out circumstances can change when prime ministers govern – as Morrison is about to when parliament resumes next week – with a one-seat majority if you exclude the Speaker. But she also wants to project her community focus back into the national conversation about politics rather than just accept the default Canberra determinism of arithmetic. Her goal over the coming term is to make a worthwhile contribution “outside the numbers and power game of Australian politics” – and that means focusing on activity that’s rarely reported in today’s frenetic political media cycle. She’s focused on delivering community petitions to the parliament, asking questions of the government, pursuing committee work and working out if constituencies can be built for private member’s bills fostered in “good relationships across the floor”. “While I accept, because it is so obvious that this crossbench at this particular point in time doesn’t have the power of numbers, we are still representatives of our communities and we still have at our disposal all the parliamentary tools.” Haines, who has a midwifery and health research background, is a community organiser, not a political careerist, so her objectives in entering politics are different to some of her peers in the class of 2019. One of her goals is to make a contribution on climate change, which was a top-of-mind issue for constituents in her regional electorate during the recent campaign. After completing her induction in parliament this week ahead of the opening of the new session next Tuesday, Haines took herself to the Australian National University to meet climate scientists and science educators to gather evidence about what ideas she should project into the political debate. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Having held Indi, previously a safe Liberal seat before McGowan took it in 2013, in large part because of her positive pitch on climate action, Haines rejects emphatically the notion that 2019 was a climate election and the climate lost. She says people who think that concern about global warming is a niche issue, or an obsession of unrepresentative post-materialist progressives, need to visit her local community. “If you think that climate politics belongs outside of conservatism, I would say have a look at Indi. “I don’t accept for one moment that the debate on climate is over, and I don’t accept for one moment this notion of a mandate on climate,” she says. “I work with the evidence I have in my electorate and people want to see good strong climate policy that actually reduces emissions.” She points out there are 100 community energy groups operating across Australia and 11 of them are in her electorate. “If you want to see action on climate at a micro level then come to Indi.” Haines is concerned about the lack of progress over the past 10 years, and is looking for ways to contribute to breaking the policy deadlock which has caused enormous frustration for her constituents. “We need to stop backing ourselves into corners about whose ideology is right on this.” She says the view from the ground up is that renewable energy projects are positive for regional Australia, and are a huge opportunity for regional cities. As well as shifting the dial on climate policy, the independent also wants to use the next three years to continue to innovate in the way she delivers political representation to her community. The process of getting McGowan elected, and getting herself elected in 2019, holding out competition from major party candidates, has yielded a substantial group of engaged citizens supporting grassroots politics in Indi, but Haines is conscious that she needs to engage beyond “the orange army”. McGowan and Haines are products of Voices for Indi, a political movement created as a result of dissatisfaction with Australia’s political process and lack of engagement. The techniques used in Indi have been shared with other independents. She says her recent objective has been to ask her activists to engage in conversations with another 20 people with a view to expanding her footprint in the electorate and widening the circles of engagement and deliberation. Haines is particularly focused on getting people currently disengaged with politics to communicate with her – which is a significant preoccupation in Australian politics at the moment. She says she intends to use the “power of the people” to extend the local conversation with a view to having that better reflected in Canberra, and “my methodology is to start with people on the ground”."
"The UK will stop hiding its “true impact” on the climate by revealing its consumption of carbon emissions from across the world, Jeremy Corbyn was due to pledge on Sunday. In an attempt to place his party at the forefront of the battle against the climate crisis, the Labour leader was due to say, is “even greater than we think” and demands an end to “passing the buck to poorer countries”.  Corbyn is due to announce that the next Labour government will “show true international leadership” by making the country the first major economy to measure the emissions it imports, as well as those it produces. The UK currently only measures its production of carbon emissions. It comes after concerns over so-called “carbon leakage”, which sees countries reduce their domestic production of carbon by importing products responsible for emissions. Overall, global emissions have increased since 1997, even though they have fallen among 38 developed nations that signed the Kyoto protocol to reduce their mean annual greenhouse gas emissions. According to government figures, the UK’s consumption of emissions is 69% higher than the amount it produces. While its carbon production footprint has fallen by 40%, it has only fallen by 10% when consumption is measured. Some experts warn that it was only the financial crisis and economic downturn in 2007 that ended the increase in the UK’s consumption of carbon emissions. Speaking at the party’s international social forum on Sunday, Corbyn was due to say that the next Labour government will “face up to the climate emergency by recognising our real carbon footprint”. “Currently, when we measure a country’s emissions, we are talking about the greenhouse gasses generated as goods and services that are produced in that country,” he was expected to say. “But for a country like Britain, that measurement hides the country’s true impact on our climate because we don’t only contribute to climate breakdown with what we produce, we contribute with what we consume too. “Over the last two decades the UK has reduced emissions – but it has done so in part by offshoring those emissions. That isn’t tackling global emissions – it is passing the buck to poorer countries. “It’s time we were honest about our contribution to the climate crisis: it is even greater than we think. So under Labour, Britain will become the first major economy in the world to measure these consumption emissions and take action to reduce them. We shouldn’t see this as a burden. Offshoring our emissions isn’t just bad for the climate, it’s bad for UK industry. “And we will send financial and technical support to the developing world, helping them adopt greener methods of production and reducing the carbon content of the goods we import.” The announcement comes with Labour under pressure from both the Lib Dems and the Greens in the polls. Both are preparing a series of measures on climate change, while the Greens performed strongly at the European elections. Labour would amend the Climate Change Act to instruct the Committee on Climate Change to include an assessment of our “total footprint emissions” in their annual report to parliament."

Share this...FacebookTwitterChief Executive Johannes Teyssen of German power giant Eon announced yesterday the spin off of its fossil fuel and nuclear generation operations, saying it will focus instead on renewables like wind power, energy efficiency technology, and smart grids. The announcement yesterday sent shock waves through Germany’s power generation market and the political landscape.
The moves produces a host of important questions? Who will take over the massive conventional power generation operations Eon is spinning off? In a nutshell, what is going to happen to a large part of Germany’s steady base-power supply in a power grid that is becoming increasingly dangerously precarious?
Daniel Wetzel at Die Welt writes of the “hidden dangers of the power revolution” and that Eon’s move is of “importance for the future of the German energy market, for the electricity supply security and the competiveness of the entire nation.”
Another blow was delivered on Monday as Vladimir Putin announced that Russia was cancelling the construction of the South Stream pipeline as a result of political conflict over the Ukraine crisis. The pipeline was planned to deliver huge amounts of natural gas to stabilize the European energy grid.
Over the past years, government intervention has made fossil energies unattractive and is forcing a shutdown of its 9 remaining nuclear reactors by 2022.
Where will the power come from when the wind doesn’t blow?

Today Holger Steltzner at Germany’s flagship Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes that the Eon move presents the German government with 2 major problems: “It has to make sure that the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants succeeds, and it must explain where the power will come from when the wind doesn’t blow.”
23 billion euros to subsidize 2 billion euros of renewable power
Steltzner describes a hostile German power market that has been grotesquely distorted by massive government subsidies in wildly fluctuating renewable energy sources. Stelzner writes:
With 23 billion euros annually, the government subsidizes renewable energy that is worth only 2 billion on the market.”
An irresponsible and reckless experiment?
In summary Germany’s wildly executed Energiewende experiment has just gotten a whole lot more interesting: a major gas supply pipeline from Russia has been cancelled, and the future of a large part of Germany’s electric power supply backbone is now in the dark. And if the trend continues, a whole lot more risks ending up in the dark.

===========================
Fear of a serious factual discussion: Climate alarmists pressure BBC to censorship of the public climate debate
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning
(German passages translated by P Gosselin)
In February 2014 Lord Nigel Lawson, former Chancellor of the Exchequer under Margaret Thatcher, took part in a climate debate on BBC Radio. In it he represented climate-realistic positions while his discussion partner Sir Brian Hoskins defended the climate alarmist direction. The debate was moderated by Justin Webb of the BBC. What follows is an excerpt (via GWPF):
Lord Lawson: No measured warming, exactly. Well that measurement is not unimportant. But even if there is some problem, it is not going to affect any of the dangers except marginally. What we want to do is focus with the problems there are with climate – drought, floods and so on. These have happened in the past – they’re not new. As for emissions, this country is responsible for less than 2% of global emissions. Even if we cut our emissions to 0 – which would put us back to the pre-industrial revolution and the poverty that that gave – even if we did that, it would be outweighed by China’s increase in emissions in a single year. So it is absolutely crazy this policy. It cannot make sense at all.
Sir Brian Hoskins: I think we have to learn two lessons from this. The first one is that by increasing the greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide, to levels not seen for millions of years on this planet, we are performing a very risky experiment. We’re pretty confident that that means if we go on like we are the temperatures are going to rise somewhere between 3-5 degrees by the end of this Century, sea levels up to half to 1 metre rise.
Justin Webb: Lord Lawson was saying there that there had been a pause – which you hear a lot about – a pause of 10 / 15 years in measured rising of temperature. That is the case isn’t it?
Sir Brian Hoskins: It hasn’t risen very much over the last 10-15 years. If you measure the climate from the globally averaged surface temperature, during that time the excess energy has still been absorbed by the climate system and is being absorbed by the oceans.
Justin Webb: So it’s there somewhere?
Sir Brian Hoskins: Oh yes, it’s there in the oceans.
Lord Lawson: That is pure speculation.
Sir Brian Hoskins: No, it’s a measurement.
Lord Lawson: No, it’s not. It’s speculation.”
As a consequence, some BBC listeners complained that a climate realist should have never been invited on the show. Supposedly people became afraid when they noticed Lawson’s arguments came across as far more convincing than those from Hoskins. In a look back at the event in the Daily Mail, Lawson commented on am 9 July 2014:

The BBC was overwhelmed by a well-organised deluge of complaints — many of them, inevitably, from those with a commercial interest in renewable energy, as well as from the Green Party — arguing that, since I was not myself a scientist, I should never have been allowed to appear.”
Over the following months the complaints were reviewed by the BBC Complaints Office. In June 2014 an egregious step was taken: The complaints were upheld by the BBC. They claimed in short that Lawson had made false arguments. In reality a faulty accusation, as Lawson explains in his Daily Mail piece:
In fact, there was nothing I said in the entire Today programme discussion that was incorrect, nor, indeed, did Sir Brian Hoskins suggest otherwise. This can be confirmed by reading the full transcript, still available on my foundation’s website at thegwpf.org/Hoskins-vs-lawson-the-climate-debate-the-bbc-wants-to-censor, and possibly also on the BBC’s website, if they have not removed it out of embarrassment. The only untruth came from the unreliable Mr Chong of the Green Party who accused me of claiming on the programme that climate change ‘was all a conspiracy’. Needless to say, I said nothing of the sort, as the transcript makes clear.”
It appears the BBC will no longer be providing the climate realistic side any broadcast time. Already one can hear cheers from the climate-alarmists: Finally no more annoying discussions! Enough with democratic wastes of time, long live the IPCC dictatorship! Lawson explained in a piece in the Daily Mail:
The head of the BBC’s Editorial Complaints Unit, a Mr Fraser Steel, whose qualifications for the job are unclear and whose knowledge of the complex climate change issue is virtually non-existent, has written to a little-known but active Green Party politician called Chit Chong to apologise for the fact I was allowed to appear on the programme and to make clear this will not happen again. Among the reasons given in Mr Steel’s letter for upholding Mr Chong’s complaint and over-ruling the BBC’s head of news programmes is the mind-boggling statement that: ‘As you have pointed out, Lord Lawson’s views are not supported by the evidence from computer modelling.’ Evidence? However useful computer models may be, the one thing they cannot be is evidence. Computer climate models are simply conjectures, expressed in the form of mathematical equations (the language of computers), which lead to forecasts of future global temperatures, which can then be compared with the evidence on the ground.”
The director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, Benny Peiser, criticized the decision by the BBC in an interview in the iai news (excerpt):
IAI: So do you think that, when it comes to the media, it is a one-sided kind of alarmist perception of risk that comes into question?
PEISER: Of course, because they are well-known for pointing out everything that is alarming and being silent on reports that show it is not as alarming. So you have a bias in favour of alarm, and a kind of ignoring any evidence that suggests that it might not be that alarming.
It’s about people who think we are facing doomsday, and people who are thinking that the issue of climate change is exaggerated. And if you deny anyone sceptical of the apocalyptic doomsday prophecies, then you get in a position where the BBC is so biased that MPs are beginning to consider cutting the license fee, or abolishing the license fee altogether, because people are beginning to be upset by the BBC’s bias.
This is a self-defeating policy; the BBC is digging its own grave by annoying half of the population who are known to be sceptical about the alarmist claims which are not substantiated, which are not founded on any evidence. They are only based on on some kinds of computer modelling, which is not scientific evidence.
IAI: So scientific evidence, such as computer modelling and research, is being used as an instrument in the rhetoric?
PEISER: Well there is a big difference between observation, what you actually observe in reality – that’s what I would call evidence – and computer models that try to model the climate in 50 or 100 years time. I wouldn’t call that evidence. There is a difference between evidence and people saying, “if we don’t act now then in 50 or a 100 years time we will face mega catastrophe”. That’s not evidence, it is speculation.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSwindlers are out there trying to sell us that bad weather is something new and happening because atmospheric CO2 concentration are “too high”. If only we paid carbon taxes and gave them more regulatory power, then we could prevent bad weather from happening and return to a Garden of Eden.
To some us all this sounds silly, of course. But many dimwitted people actually believe it.
Steve Goddard at Twitter brought my attention to the following newspaper clipping (I’ve cut and pasted piecemeal below) from the Perth Australia Daily News, dated 1936. As you will read, the scale of the disaster and the extremes are beyond anything we have ever witnessed today.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA heated exchange has just taken place at Twitter between Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski and some of Germany’s leading climate alarmism politicians and ideologues who are pushing for a fast-track green coup d’état.
The row swirls around a critical opinion piece written by Bojanowski – on the roadmap-for-politicians IPCC final Synthesis Report. The Spiegel piece is titled: “Final IPCC Report: At the IPCC alarm comes before accuracy“. 
In it Bojanowski identifies a number points where the IPCC misleads the public and needlessly sounds the alarms. At Twitter Bojanowski calls these points “gross problems” that “need to be discussed”. 
In summary, the ever inquisitive Spiegel journalist writes that the IPCC final report “should rationally inform of the science  – rather it suppresses central contradictions“. He also adds that “the new synthesis report suppresses important scientific findings“. 
Bojanowski brings up some gross examples of IPCC factual suppression and how the UN body made glaring contradictions. The first concerns the subject of species extinction. In the 2013 IPCC main report, no predictions were made on to what extent species were threatened, demonstrating that too little is known to make reliable forecasts. But the latest synthesis report claims species have already began dying off due to climate change.
Bojanowski also points out that the latest synthesis report writes of numerous species having been forced to relocate because of climate change. But the main 2013 report writes: “There’s very little confidence in the conclusion that already some species may have gone extinct due to climate change.”
Another misleading claim by the new synthesis report is that today’s climate change is happening faster than at any time from natural causes over the last 1 million years – thus stressing out species. But learned-geologist Bojanowski cites the main IPCC report’s real findings:
At the end of the ice age, as the first part of the UN climate report shows, in large parts of the world climate fluctuations of 10°C in 50 years, i.e. 20 times faster than in the 20th century, took place and large climate-caused species extinctions are not documented.”
The Spiegel journalist also writes how the IPCC is not really being truthful with its predictions for the future. In the new synthesis report for policymakers the IPCC warns of a 4°C warming by the end of the century, and that this will be a formidable threat to species. Here the IPCC even asserts “high confidence”.
However, Bojanowski reminds Spiegel readers what the experts wrote in the main IPCC report (translated from the German):
Climate models are unable to illustrate key processes with respect to species development which foremost impact the susceptibility of species with respect to climate change.”

In a nutshell Bojanowski comes down hard on the IPCC report – for blatantly putting alarmism ahead of scientific accuracy.
Some German activists and Green politcians have reacted irritably to Bojanowski’s article. Green Party honcho Dr. Hermann Ott tweeted:
@GYGeorg …sad! Dear@Axel_Bojanowski, we have discussed so often about climate change – for what? @sven_giegold“

 Bojanowski replied (not sure what he means with “twse”):
@GYGeorg@sven_giegold Dear @Hermann_Ott ,IPCC without critique, even if sometimes make mistakes like for example twse the Synthesis Report, would be sad, would it not?
Ott responds:
@Axel_Bojanowski (3) ..and when we destroy confidence in science then the door and gate are open to chaos, see USA @GYGeorg@sven_giegold“
Bojanowski replies:
(1)Dear @Hermann_Ott also science has to earn its trust,gross problems like those in the S’report have to be discussed @sven_giegold“
Looks like the IPCC was caught red-handed playing it fast, loose and alarmist with the science, and now the howls of objection from the warmist ideologues are beginning in earnest.

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo days ago I wrote about the first part of an analysis (on Germany winter temperatures) by Kowatsch and Kämpfe appearing here at EIKE. Winter temperatures in Germany have been falling for a quarter of a century now. Much to my satisfaction, that post has been widely shared among social media.
Today I’m writing about the second part: What is the primary driver behind Europe’s variability, i.e. what causes periods of cold winters and periods of milder winters? The main drivers, Kowatsch and Kämpfe conclude, are oceanic cycles.
Figure 1 below shows a plot of German winters since 1881. Shown is the temperature lower curve and the number of days with westerly winds (upper curve) – along with their corresponding smoothed curves.

Figure 1: Germany’s mean winter temperature (lower blue curve) follows the course of the frequency of days with mild westerly winds (W, SW and NW, violet upper curve). Both are accompanied by a smoothed curve).
It’s no surprise that the more days a winter has with winds coming from the west (Atlantic), the milder the winters turn out to be. A correlation here does not surprise us. Here the mechanism that drives Europe’s winters is the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which is the pressure difference between southwest Europe (Portugal to the Azores) and northwestern Europe (Iceland).
When the NAO is very positive it means there is a powerful Azores high and a powerful Icelandic low which serve to pump Atlantic air eastwards into Central Europe (Figure 2, right). If the Azores high and the Iceland low are both weak, then cold air from Eastern Europe or Siberia can make its way over across Europe and the winters tend to be much colder (Figure 2, left).

Figure 2: Prevailing weak NAO pattern shown left leads to cold Europe winters. Strong positive NAO pattern shown right leads to mild winters (Source: UKMO).
Next Figure 3 shows the NAO chart for the past winter, which was most of the time was highly positive, meaning many mild westerly winds swept in from the Atlantic and over Europe.

Figure 3: Winter 2014/15 saw an overwhelmingly positive NAO, thus producing a mild winter for Western and Central Europe. 
So what drives the NAO air pressure difference? Kowatsch and Kämpfe have analyzed this and found there is a strong correlation between NAO and the Atlantic Multidecadal Osciallation (AMO). Figure 4 below shows the inverse relationship between the AMO and the winter-time westerly wind frequency over Europe:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Figure 4: The higher the AMO value, the less westerly weather that occurs.
Not only does the AMO drive the NAO, but it is also is a major factor driving Arctic sea ice extent. Arctic sea ice extent does not drive the winters over Europe, as some scientists have been hypothesizing over the recent years. Rather it is the AMO that is driving the Arctic sea ice and the European winters as well.
Although good satellite sea ice data records for the Arctic go back only 35 years, one sees a distinct relationship between the AMO and wintertime Arctic sea ice, see Figure 5 below:

Figure 5: As AMO values rise (green curve), sea ice area (blue) reduces significantly.
EIKE adds:

And there are clear indications that this relationship applies over the long-term as well. During the 1930s, i.e. during the last AMO positive phase, large melting of the sea ice and strong melting of the Greenland glaciers were observed.”

And when the severe winters of 2009/10 and 2012/13 caused the proponents of the global warming theory to scramble for an explanation, they concocted and put out the tale that “melting Arctic sea ice was disturbing the large scale circulation and thus favored winter cold at the middle latitudes“.
The scientists claimed that especially the low levels of Arctic sea ice in September were suddenly responsible for causing cold winters. Yet, the following chart shows no relationship at all:

Figure 14: The extent of September Arctic sea ice has no impact whatsoever on winter temperatures over Central Europe (Germany). Arctic sea ice cover in blue; Germany winter temperatures in red. The same is true for other times of the year (autumn ice cover or winter ice cover to winter temperatures show no relationship).
EIKE warns that the climate system is much more complicated than meets the eye: “Still the complicated and yet to be researched relationship between ocean currents, AMO, sea ice and large weather patterns have with a high probability an impact on Europe’s climate and weather, and there exists no easy explanations”. Studies have shown that solar activity also play a role in Europe’s winters.
At the end, Kowatsch and Kämpfe look at the (lack of) success that institute’s and experts have had in forecasting the winter of 2014/15. It shows that the science of forecasting is lacking terribly. Of the 7 forecasts examined, 2 were completely faulty, 3 were poor, and 2 were only about half correct and would not earn a grade any higher than a C -.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnthony Watts has posted a story “written by” Larry Bell, who according to NewsMax is “a professor and endowed professor at the University of Houston, where he directs the Sasakawa International Center for Space Architecture and heads the graduate program in space architecture.”
Honestly speaking I don’t care how distinguished Prof. Larry Bell may be, or how distinguished others might think he is. In my book, I don’t think much of the character at all. In my view his piece automatically gets an “F” as a grade.
The reason is that he evidently thinks it is not necessary to cite sources and to give credit where credit is due. He appears to think it’s perfectly okay to copy and paste other people’s work and give readers the impression it’s all his very own.
On June 9th I posted a piece titled: Giant Of Geology/Glaciology Christian Schlüchter Refutes CO2…Feature Interview Throws Climate Science Into Disarray, which got a fair amount of attention, including Larry’s.
Eight days later, on June 17, he posted his “own” version at NewsMax. At the end of the story NewsMax even had the temerity to write: “© 2014 Newsmax. All rights reserved.”
Of course much of the story is Larry’s own. But the quotes of Prof. Schlüchter were translated from the original German to English by myself. Unlike Larry, I cited at least a half dozen times the German source. Larry on the other hand simply helped himself to my hard translation work, without citing it.
Maybe steps can be taken to change his thinking, and that of NewsMax’s.
In the future I’d appreciate if the good professor practiced proper academic behavior and cited his sources.
All he had to do was cite and add a link or two.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow climate politics are becoming a real threat to the very defense of our freedom, democracy and western civilization.

The real enemy, according to some German politicians, activists. Copyright: Eurofighter, Geoffrey Lee, Planefocus Limited.
Germany’s socialists, pacifist greens and anti NATO activists (who are well represented in German government) have found a new excuse for shirking their NATO defense responsibilities and reason for shutting down important military operations thus unwittingly playing into the hands of our enemies – many of whom are at Europe’s very own doorstep!
“Eurofighter Typhoon is a climate-killer”
Their latest claim: “the Eurofighter Typhoon is a climate killer” and so it needs to be grounded. Protecting the climate is much more important than defending the freedom and democracy of the very citizens they were elected to represent.
According to the doomsday-obsessed, leftist Klimaretter here: the Eurofighter’s CO2 footprint is intolerable and represents a real reason to stop its use. It writes: “For the climate the Eurofighters are real poison.”
Klimaretter explains how leftist Parliamentarian Eva Bulling-Schröter sent a query to the German government concerning the Eurofighter Typhoon of the 74th Neuburg Fighter Wing in Bavaria on July 16, 2014. The German government in turn sent its reply on July 31.
Of fourteen questions three are of particular interest: Nos. 3, 4, and 7.
3. How high was the fuel consumption (kerosene) of the Neuburg Fighter Wing in 2013?
In 2013 at the tactical 74th Neuburg a.d. Donau Fighter Wing, 12,751,000 liters of jet fuel were given out to the EUROFIGHTER. That is an equivalent of approximately 10,200 tonnes of jet fuel.
4. How high was the CO2 emission of the Neuburg Fighter Wing in 2013?

Based on the fuel consumption of then tactical 74th Neuburg a.d. Donau Fighter Wing in connection with the average conversion factor for kg jet fuel to emitted kg CO2 of 3.15, in the year 2013 approximately 32,130 tonnes of CO2 were emitted.
7. How high was the CO2 emission of the “Eurofighter” weapon system per flight hour?
One EUROFIGHTER per flight hour needs average 3.5 tonnes of fuel. Using the conversion factor of 3.15 for kg jet fuel to emitted kg CO2 yields an average CO2 emission per EUOFIGHTER flight hour of approx. 11 tonnes.”
Klimaretter promptly points out that flying a Eurofighter for a single hour produced as much Co2 as one citizen does in an entire year. It adds:
‘The Eurofighter weapons system is also a climate killer as the fighter jet emits as much carbon dioxide as a German citizen does in one year,’ assesses Eva Bulling-Schröter the results of her query. ‘Weapons only bring death and suffering; they also damage our environment and climate.'”
When compared to global natural and man-made total emissions, the 10,000 tonnes emitted by the Eurofighter is a mere drop in the ocean, and theoretically has an impact on the climate than can be measured only in pico-degrees.
Klimaretter does not stop at pushing for a grounding of the Eurofighter at the Neuburg base, but even implies that the military all over the world contributes substantially to climate damage, posing the question under the photo it posted:
US American soldier in the Iraq War: Just how much the military contributes to climate change worldwide has been hardly studied so far.”
Yes, this needs to be studied, the leftists are demanding. And should the military emit too much CO2, then it too will have to be grounded all over the world.
Oblivious to gathering threat from extremists worldwide
Indeed Islamic fanatics, the ISIS, Taliban, Boko Haram, Russian rebels and a host of other menacing threats to our western civilization and freedom probably could not find better, unwitting allies in Germany than the leftwing socialist/green parties – and kooky climate-doomsday websites like Klimaretter.

"The government’s own advisers have declared themselves shocked that the UK has no proper plans for protecting people from heatwaves, flash flooding and other impacts of the climate crisis. The Committee on Climate Change said the UK’s climate crisis preparations were being run like Dad’s Army and left the population at real risk, adding that funding for programmes to tackle problems resulting from global heating had been cut.  The CCC’s annual progress reports, published on Wednesday, also found that just one of the 25 emissions-cutting policies it said were vital in 2018 had been delivered in full. Lord Deben, who chairs the committee, said ministers could be sued in court if the failure to act continued. Theresa May announced in June that the UK would be the first major economy to set a legally binding target to end climate emissions by 2050. However, the CCC said the targets for 2025 and 2030 were likely to be missed by an even bigger margin than last year. Targets do not themselves reduce emissions, the report says, and new policies were essential to deliver cuts. It said the UK government risked embarrassing itself when, as is likely, it hosts a crucial UN climate summit in 2020. The CCC assessed government plans for adaptation to the climate crisis in 33 priority areas. “There are no areas where government is planning properly,” said Chris Stark, the CCC chief executive. He said it would be prudent to prepare for a 4C rise, a level scientists see as catastrophic. Debden said: “The whole thing is run by the government like a Dad’s Army. We can’t possibly go on with this ramshackle system; it doesn’t begin to face the issues. It is a real threat to the population. “You need to make real changes to protect people here and now from the climate change that we know is happening. We are not even preparing for 2C [rise in global temperature] let alone the position we might be in if the world does not [drive emissions down to zero]”. Lady Brown, who chairs the CCC’s adaptation committee, said the fact its analysis was based on the government’s own assessment of climate risks made the failings “even more shocking”. The CCC said the number of policy officials working directly on adaptation fell from several dozen in 2013, when the first national adaptation plan was published, to a handful for the second publication in 2018. Government funding for services to help regions, businesses and people adapt has ceased, the report says, and ministers have failed to start communicating with the public over the need for changes in behaviour, such as eating less meat and using less water. A government spokesman said: “As the CCC recognises, we are the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions, have cleaned up our power sector [and] cut emissions faster than any G7 country while growing the economy. “We know there is more to do. We’ll set out plans in the coming months to tackle emissions from aviation, heat, energy and transport as well as further measures to protect the environment from extreme weather including flood protection, tree planting and peatland management.” The CCS’s assessment acknowledges good progress in a few areas, such as phasing out coal burning and planning for flood protection. But its assessment of carbon cutting measures pointed out the government had held back onshore wind farms and should end the sale of petrol and diesel cars soon after 2030, not in 2040 as planned. It said tree planting rates had missed targets every year since they were set in 2013. The one action out of the 25 requested by the CCC for 2018 that was delivered was that a carbon tax on power station emissions continues after Brexit. The UK is already seeing the impacts of climate change, the CCC said, with deadly heatwaves like the one in 2018 now twice as likely as a few decades ago, leaving a fifth of homes and buildings prone to overheating. “It is outrageous that the housebuilders have done absolutely nothing as far as I can see to ready the houses they are building now,” said Deben. Brown said the UK was getting more short, sharp bursts of rain that caused flash flooding, particularly in towns and cities, but urban green space had fallen from 63% in 2001 to 55% in 2018. “That needs to be going up,” she said. “It helps absorb water, cool the urban heat island and gives us better places where our kids can go out and play, which will help with health.” MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs parliament’s business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: “The CCC reports show the government has failed dismally to back up its rhetoric with ambitious policies which deliver the cuts in emissions the UK needs to achieve.” Doug Parr of Greenpeace UK said: “This is a truly brutal reality check on the government’s current progress in tackling the climate emergency. The new prime minister really must take the government’s net zero commitment and turn it into something practically meaningful.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterOne of the last remaining bastions of the global warming scare is sea level rise.
Unsurprisingly, a handful of alarmists are still desperately clinging to accelerating sea level rise, insisting that it is just around the corner. However a new analysis on the subject by veteran meteorologist Klaus -Eckard Puls of the European Institute of Climate and Energy (EIKE) shows that sea level rise is not accelerating, and that there are signs showing a deceleration. That bastion is on the verge of collapse.
The EIKE review first starts by focusing on German coastal sea level rise, sections 1-4, before shifting on global sea level rise, section 5-10. The focus here is on the latter.
Concerning global sea level data, Puls starts by looking at a peer-reviewed tide gauge analysis conducted by distinguished Swedish scientist Nils-Axel Mörner who evaluated 182 tide gauges scattered around the world, some going back more than 200 years.
Mörner’s results uncovered gaping differences when he compared the tide gauge results to those reported by the TOPEX/POSEIDON/JASON satellite. His conclusion:
Removing outliers of obvious uplift or subsidence, there are 182 records left, which forms a nice Gaussian distribution around a mean value of +1.65 mm/yr.
Satellite altimetry is a new and important tool. The mean rate of rise from 1992 to 2013 is +3.2 ±0.4 mm (UC, 2013). This value is not a measured value, however, but a value arrived at after much “calibration” of subjective nature (Mörner, 2004, 2011a, 2013a). The differences between the three data sets (±0, +1.65 and +3.2 mm/yr ) are far too large not to indicate the inclusions of errors and mistakes.”
He adds:
The evaluation of worldwide 182 tide gauges yields a mean secular sea level rise of 16 cm, without a GIA [Glacial Isostatic Adjustment] correction. A secular acceleration in rise was not found, and thus there is no AGW-CO2 climate signal.”
Puls also quotes an article by Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt at DkS:
Despite the satellite measurements, naturally the tide gauge measurements were continued. And they don’t mislead in any way as they stubbornly stick to their old course of being significantly below 2 mm/year.”

Puls provides three charts showing the glaring discrepancy:

 Chart: climatesanity.wordpress.com/sea-level-rise/
“Amazing agreement between tide gauge data and GRACE”
So which is right? TOPEX/POSEIDON/JASON or the observed tide gauges? Next Puls looks at the data obtained from the GRACE satellite, which show they are practically in exact agreement with the tide gauge measurement. Puls writes, citing multiple sources of peer-reviewed literature:
Both extremely different measurement methods of tide gauges [1.7 mm/yr] and gravity measurements (GRACE satellite [1.6 mm/yr]) agree with each other amazingly well at [near] 1.7 mm/yr, They are off by only a millimeter!  That leads us to the question we often find in the literature of why the TOPEX/POSEIDON/JASON satellite measurement method – the only one of all methods – yields values that are almost double.”
From this Puls summarizes at the end:
The constant stream of alarmist announcements of a supposed dramatic sea level rise now taking place and in the future cannot be confirmed. Rather it is even refuted by the measurement data. Worldwide neither the tide gauge data (200 years) nor the satellite data (20 years) indicate an acceleration in sea level rise. This is in stark contradiction to all the former and current claims of the IPCC, some institutes and a number of climate models. Moreover there is evidence that indicate the satellite data have been ‘overly corrected'[28]: “Instead of the satellite data being adjusted to match the real measured data at the surface and being adjusted downwards, there is now a discrepancy between the tide gauge and satellite measurements, unfortunately even today. And it appears to bother no one. A mysterious case.”
Puls is telling us that if you wish to have the true story on sea level rise, then look at the tide gauge data and to be very careful with the (calibrated) data from TOPEX/POSEIDON/JASON. Again some, it would appear, are playing it very loose with the data.
Overall the review by Puls is comprehensive and an English version would be extremely useful, especially for the scientists at the IPCC.

"There is so much bad news about the climate emergency that it is easy to sink into a heatstruck daze and suppose that we can do nothing to prevent catastrophic global change over the next 50 years. This would be a mistake. There are still things to be done which will diminish future damage and – more hopefully still – undo the effects of some of our past crimes against the environment. Research has just shown that there is far more land in the world on which trees can be planted than anyone had supposed. This matters. There is no doubt that reforestation must form part of any strategy to diminish the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and so avert the kind of temperature rise that will cause a civilisational breakdown as the seas rise and the deserts spread on land. The new estimates show that with a truly heroic effort, it would be possible to plant or allow to regrow enough trees around the world to remove from the atmosphere two-thirds of the emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere by human activities. The figures involved are boggling: a trillion trees, covering in total an area as large as the US and China combined. The total cost is estimated at $300bn, a figure to make even a Bezos blink. But the prize is almost beyond price. Without the sequestration of carbon the world will bust through 1.5C of warming and head for much worse. Planting trees is by far the least expensive and most practicable way available at present to do this.  It won’t be enough, of course. Important – vital – as these efforts are to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and undo some of the damage we have done in the last century, they will be wholly inadequate without a corresponding effort to stop the production of more greenhouse gases. Here the signs remain extremely gloomy. The time for change was yesterday. A study published in Nature this week shows that the power plants already built, under construction or planned will all by themselves consume enough fossil fuels and emit enough carbon to break the 1.5C barrier and probably the 2C one as well. Any serious attempt to stabilise the climate even at that uncomfortable level must start with a commitment to plan no more power stations that run on fossil fuels, and to lower drastically the number of planned ones that are actually built. When measured against the size of the challenge, even a reforestation plan on this scale does not appear ambitious. But it is, in political and economic terms, especially when measured against the willingness up to now of politicians and consumers to do what they must. The most obvious obstacle is the raging pace of deforestation in the world today, especially in the tropics. Last year was the third worst since proper records from satellite images began in 2002; and unlike the two worse ones, the damage recorded in 2018 was all done directly by humans, rather than by fires. Although the government of Indonesia, previously one of the worst offenders, has managed to reduce the amount of land being lost to palm oil plantations, the real problem lies in Brazil, where the land is cleared, often in a very wasteful way, for soya beans and pasture – both used for meat production – and the populist rightwing Bolsonaro government appears to be deliberately accelerating the pace of forest destruction.  Reforestation and the preservation of existing forests is also a marker of the way in which the green movement is not just about economics. It must also speak to our spiritual sides if it is to mobilise a global coalition. Trees, and still more forests, do not just remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They seem to suck some of the darkness and self-obsession out of the humans in their shade. They remind us that we share the earth with life forms older than we can imagine and stranger than we can ever understand, and that we’re bound to them in webs of mutual interdependence. Preserving and restoring the great forests would be worth doing for itself even if it had no economic use. But the climate emergency means that this plan is also a precondition if the next century is to have much more than a subsistence economy."

Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber and his WBGU have just released their latest Special Report: Climate Protection as a World Citizen Movement. The 126-page report is the 9th of its kind since the first one was published in 1995.

Professor Schellnhuber telling German Parliamentarians to act as he and his WBGU recommend, or else sea levels will rise 230 feet. Photo cropped from bundestag.de.
Totalitarian designs
The latest Special Report is shrill and the underlying message is: Time is running out and unless policymakers do as us German scientists say, the world will end in catastrophe. The Special Report suggests that the normal democratic processes are failing and that governments must start heeding the instructions of the elite German group of Potsdam scientists. Schellnhuber, a person who openly admits having no background in sociology, insists that he and his fellow WBGU scientists be given the helm in all decision matters concerning climate policy.
Schellnhuber, the WBGU Chairman and Director of the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), once recommended a watering down of democracy and more policy-making power being placed in the hands of far-sighted “experts”.
4 recommendations
The alarmist, climate doomsday obsessed site Klimaretter here writes that Hans Joachim Schellnhuber not long ago appeared before German Parliamentarians to present the “impending climate catastrophe” up close and “to explain the four recommendations of the Council”.
The climate alarmist Klimaretter gives their four recommendations:
First recommendation, Klimaretter writes:
First the expertise of climate science must be securely anchored in the political process of climate action. Also when, as Schellnhuber emphasizes, policy making and science are of two different realms, science is essential for keeping the world climate policy on course: ‘Without a compass, you cannot steer a ship.'”

Here we see Schellnhuber & Co. are not content with simply supplying governments with data, but they also insist on being the ones guiding future policy for global society. But how can we know that their science is not being tainted by their political convictions? We can’t. This is why it is so dangerous to put so much into the hands of such a tiny group…who happen to be the most alarmist at that.
The second recommendation, Klimaretter writes:
Secondly there should be the right for countries to file climate protection lawsuits in constitutional courts in order to increase the societal pressure on the governments. A strong involvement by the civil society is decisive in pushing climate protection forward. The ‘global societal contract for climate protection’ does not only manifest itself in demonstrations such as the recent one in New York, but also in the strengthening of the Divestment Movement.
Not only do the WBGU scientists want to be the ones running planetary policymaking, but they want it institutionalized.
Third recommendation:
Thirdly the two-degrees Celsius target has to be established as international law because only by limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius can the consequences for the societies in many countries be managed. A continued business-as-usual CO2 emission would not only lead to a melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, but also of the East Antarctic. That would bring about a sea level rise of 70 meters.”
Here the scientists, who to many readers, by now are surely beginning to appear as the quintessential mad scientists, are claiming that sea levels will rise and drown large parts of the planet if their requests do not become binding international law. Hard to be believe they’ve made it this far.
Fourth recommendation
Schellnhuber warns that time is running out and is calling for “flat zero” global carbon emissions already by the year 2070 in order to reach the 2°C target. “At the latest by 2030 Co2 emissions must reach their peak and start downward.”
That demand, and their seemingly complete unawareness of the 18-year pause and growing scientific literature showing only moderate CO2 sensitivity, suggests that the WBGU are very remote from reality.
Since the WBGU was established in the early 1990s, they’ve published 9 lengthy special reports and 14 even lengthier flagship reports…all pushing for radical societal transformation. Seems the Potsdam scientists are more preoccupied with being the architects of social adventurism than serious scientists objectively looking at the recent data and findings.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote here about how parts of Europe woke up to snow! Global warming alarmists have been telling us that winters would get milder and that spring would arrive earlier and earlier each year.
For example just two years ago Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) scientist Friedrich-Wilhelm Gerstengarbe told German ZDF television that spring would be arriving earlier and earlier – because of global warming.
Unfortunately this is turning out not to be the case. The opposite is in fact happening.
Josef Kowatsch and Stefan Kämpfe at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) write that spring in Central Europe has been cooling for almost 30 years now – and not warming – and it’s been arriving later and later.
To determine the spring trends, Kowatsch and Kämpfe looked at the mean temperature for February in Germany, which is a country that is ideally situated in Central Europe. Cold and snow at the end of February have a considerable impact on when vegetation starts to blossom. What follows is a chart depicting the February mean temperature for Germany over the last 28 years.

Figure 1: Data from the DWD German Weather Service show that the February trend has been cooling more than 0.5°C per decade over the last 28 years.
Figure 1 does not show any signs of spring coming earlier in Central Europe. The next chart looks at the Germany February trend for the last 22 years:

Figure 2: The 22-year February trend for Germany also shows a marked decline in temperature. Cold weather naturally acts to delay the onset of spring.
Kowatsch and Kämpfe write that if it were not for urban sprawl, the cooling trend would be even more pronounced:

Without population growth, industrialization and urbanization, the temperature measured today in Germany would be about 1°C cooler because almost every weather station is sited near the edge of a city or even in the city or airports. They are benefitting from various warming effects, which we will not look into in this article.”

The Germany February temperature trend for the last 17 years also shows a stark cooling:

Okay, February is only a single month that is crucial in determining how quickly spring in Central Europe gets started. Kowatsch and Kämpfe also posted the DJF winter temperature trend. Here we also see no warming over the last 28 years:

Figure 4: Winter mean temperature trend for Germany. Data taken from the DWD German Weather Service. We should be calling it cooling, and not warming!
How often do the German media show the above charts? Never. Kowatsch and Kämpfe write that the media have been warming-brainwashed, and the data clearly show that “spring has been starting later and later over the past 30 years“.
Not only do the temperature data show spring coming later and later, but so does the vegetation. Kowatsch and Kämpfe at EIKE provide the following chart:

Figure 5: Between 1990 and 2015 the budding of wild goose berries is now happening about 10 days later because the high winter months January and February (blue) have cooled. The green curve shows when the wild goose berries began to blossom, example in 2013 they did not blossom until after 1 April.
An analysis of the month of March in Germany also shows a cooling trend, Kowatsch and Kämpfe have determined:
 Figure 6: March mean temperature for Germany has fallen more than a degree Celsius over the last 27 years.
This year February and March have been relatively mild, but Kowatsch and Kämpfe write that they have been near the mean of the last 30 years. They also write that behavior of various animal species also show spring coming later.
They summarize:

Winter and pre-spring have gotten somewhat cooler since the late 1980s, especially February. The temperature trend lines are negative. Therefore the start of spring is currently being delayed and is coming later than the relatively warm 1990s.
Overall the start of spring 2015 is at the mean of the last 120 years and corresponds to claims made in the biological literature, spring literature, and in German spring songs.
After almost 30 years of winter cooling we see: In the open unbuilt areas of Germany, where today there are no longer any weather stations, the following remains valid: Spring awakens in March. 
Spring awakens in March as it did 150 years ago at the end of the Little Ice Age.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe descriptions of urban warming dwell on the heating of the air by the local infrastructure. There is more to it than simple conduction to the air mass from warmed surfaces.
In the far infrared, where the peak radiation wavelength is determined by the temperature, much of the energy from warmed surfaces is absorbed by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere within a meter or so. These gases then re-radiate to any other nearby surfaces or gases further away and conduct by collisions with other air molecules to heat the air. There are also windows in the infrared spectrum that let warm surfaces radiate directly to other surfaces. Thus for a temperature measuring instrument, the temperature measured is a combination of the air temperature conducted to the thermometer by air flowing past it and IR heating from nearby surfaces. This is why in the polar regions when measuring very low temperatures, a person approaching the thermometer will raise the temperature reading.
This second source of increased temperature causes “urban warming” even where the location is strictly rural. A measuring station at an isolated research station or farm can have “urban warming” when the thermometer is in close proximity to just one heated building.

Figure 1 is a visible and FLIR IR image of the MMTS station at the Perry, Oklahoma Volunteer Fire Department. The image is from an article by Anthony Watts here, used by permission.
Painting the MMTS white only reduces direct heating by sunlight at visible wavelengths. In the long wavelength IR, any paint, black, white, or any other color, has the same emissivity, more than 0.9, and will absorb IR equally well. In Figure 1, the west-facing uninsulated door is very warm compared to the north-facing wall. It is being heated both by the sun and the building interior. The MMTS is slightly warmer (perhaps 2 or 3 degrees) than the mounting pipe. The pipe is unpainted, somewhat shiny, with a lower emissivity, reflecting more of the IR. Thus it appears black, where the MMTS is a warmer dark purple.
Pierre has posted on a German study of the temperature shifts with the installation of electronic thermometers here. This shift is due to the different way a glass thermometer in a wooden shelter responds to IR in the vicinity and the way a compact modern MMTS responds. There is also the issue of the need for cabling that leads to a distance bias to the nearest building.
Every weather station should be checked for IR emissions in the “view-shed”, the surrounding surfaces and buildings. This should be done at several hours of the day, to catch sunlight warming all the surfaces, and internal building heating variations.

The Philippines enacted the Renewable Energy (RE) Act of 2008 (Republic Act 9513), which contains various subsidies for renewable energies such feed-in-tariffs (FIT).
Photo: Nonoy Oplas
While it was signed into law in December 2008, FIT was not implemented until July 2012 because many sectors including manufacturing opposed higher price on already expensive Philippine electricity rates. But the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Greenpeace and other environmental groups in the country lobbied hard to implement the FIT and the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) was pressured to give in to their lobbying, but at a lower rate as requested by the National Renewable Energy Board (NREB).

Figure 1. Proposed vs approved FIT in the Philippines, pesos per kWh. (Rates approved in mid-July 2012).
Prior to July 2012, there were not many renewable plants that were put up because of the uncertainty when the FIT would be granted and implemented. After July 2012, there was certainty and more renewables were put up.
The ERC started public hearings regarding how much would be added to the monthly bill of electricity consumers in the Philippines when FIT is reflected. In August 2014, the National Transmission Corporation (Transco), the FIT administrator according to the law, said that the forecast annual payout for renewable energy companies based on the FIT petition would be P8.5 billion ($192.3 million) for 2015 and P10.25 billion ($231.9 million) for 2016. Wow! (Source: Philippine Star).
Last February, Manila Electric Cooperative (Meralco) and all other electric cooperatives and distribution utilities in the Philippines started collecting the introductory FIT of PHP 0.04 per kWh. If this rate is retained throughout the year, the projected collection by Transco to be distributed to the renewable firms will be PHP2.7 billion. If the 12 percent VAT is included, this will be a P3.02 billion (US$ 68.3 million, at prevailing P44.2/$ exchange rate) siphoning from the pockets of electricity consumers nationwide.
FIT rate will be adjusted and rising through time as more renewables are added to the country’s power generation mix.
Rising FIT has happened and continues to happen in Germany, which probably has one of the world’s most elaborate renewables subsidy schemes. The FIT keeps rising as more renewables, wind and solar especially, are added yearly to the energy mix and electricity distributors are forced to buy them even when cheaper electricity from coal, natural gas, nuclear and hydro are available.

Figure 2. FIT paid by consumers in Germany, in Euro cents per kWh. Source: BMU: Germany’s Electricity Price More Than Doubles…Electrocuting Consumers And Markets, 7 December 2014.
So electricity prices in Germany keep rising. This will happen to the Philippines too, no thanks to RA 9513 the renewables cronyism law.

What makes FIT a formula for ever-rising price  of electricity? As contained in Section 7 of RA 9513, the FIT forces the following:
(a) Priority connections to the grid for electricity generated from emerging renewables such as wind, solar, ocean, run-of-river hydropower and biomass power plants,
(b) Priority purchase and transmission of, and payment for, such electricity by the grid system operators;
(c) Fixed tariff to be paid to renewables producers  for 20 years; and
(d) Compliance with the renewable portfolio standard (RPS).
The RPS as contained in Section 6 of the law, is the minimum percentage of generation from eligible renewable energy resources to be set by the NREB.
So combining FIT and RPS, this means that even if cheaper power from say Quezon coal or Sual coal, Magat or Pantabangan hydro, Sta. Rita or Ilijan natural gas are available especially during non-peak hours, but wind power from Ilocos are available, Meralco and the various provincial electric cooperatives of the Luzon grid are forced to buy from the expensive wind power plants.
While many environmental activists were among the groups that opposed electricity price hikes in the past, it is sure they will rein in their noise and militance now that their beloved renewables will be among the major contributors to rising electricity prices in the country. Double talk can happen anytime.
Recently, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced 14 renewable energy projects with combined capacity of 304 MW, which have been endorsed as qualified for the FIT program. The DOE has issued certificates of endorsement (CoE) to five biomass, three small hydro, two solar and four wind power  projects.
This means that the resulting power capacity will be dispatched to the grid at a fixed rate over a period of 20 years.
The installations for RE power totaled 750 MW: run-of-river hydro and biomass projects at 250 MW each, wind power at 200 MW, and solar power at 50 MW, but may soon be raised to 500 MW.
Aside from FIT and RPS, RA 9513 gives many other subsidies or relaxation of regulations and taxation to the renewable producers, privileges that are denied to producers of conventional but cheaper power sources. These privileges include: (a) income tax holiday for 7 years; (b) duty-free importation of renewable energy machinery, equipment and materials within the first 10 years; (c) special realty tax rates; (d) net operating loss carry over (NOLCO) to be carried for the next 7 years; (e) 10% corporate tax rate (not 30%); (f) tax exemption of carbon credits; and (g) tax credit on domestic capital equipment and services.
This author is not against renewable sources per se. They are fine, along with geothermal, big hydro, coal and natural gas. What is objectionable is the cronyism and favoritism granted to the renewables which results in ever rising electricity prices in the country. The case of Germany is already a guide for us. The same pattern is happening too in Spain and UK.
Government intervention and cronyism in energy policy is wrong and counter-productive. Governments should get out of electricity pricing and stop forcing grid operators and electricity distributors to buy from renewables when their rates are expensive. RA 9513 needs major amendments to remove the FIT and RPS schemes.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt EIKE distinguished German physicist and climate expert Prof. Dr. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke writes how we are witnessing a notable paradigm shift in climate research today: the resurrection of medieval scholasticism. In plain language: the science of the Dark Ages.

German climate physicist Prof. Dr. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke says today’s climate science paradigm has shifted to a “medieval scholasticism” and is a real threat to science and society as a whole. Photo: EIKE. 
Scholasticism dominated medieval western Europe and was based on the writings of the Church Fathers, with strict adherence to traditional doctrines. To say the least, it was effective in stifling enlightenment.
The breakthrough from this crusty, dogmatic approach, Lüdecke writes, came with Galileo, who gave highest priority to systematic and numerical measurement, which today remains the standard method of science. With Galileo’s approach hypotheses or theories that are not confirmed by measurements get discarded and are no longer pursued. The method led to giant leaps and bounds in technology, medicine and science, from which today humanity is benefitting immensely.
Richard Richard Feynman summarized Galileo’s approach beautifully, saying that if a hypothesis disagrees with observations, then it’s wrong.
This fundamental approach, the Lüdecke writes, is no longer in use in climate science and, what is worse, the old medieval scholastic method is even now dangerously invading other fields of science.
According to Lüdecke, the key question today: Is the climate change witnessed since 1850 unusual, and thus due to man, or is it well within the range of natural variability the planet has seen throughout its history? The German physicist says a hypothesis’s burden of proof is clearly not on its skeptics, but on the one proposing the hypothesis. He writes:
It is senseless to favor a certain hypothesis – senseless according to our still valid scientific paradigm – when no confirming measured data can be shown to support it. One can occupy himself with a hypothesis, put it at the center of his research, and even have complete faith in it. However one cannot use it as a basis for taking rational action without first having confirmed measurements. In summary: If we cannot observe any unusual climate activity since 1850 compared to the times before that, then we have no choice but to assume natural climate change.”
In order to assume there has been “unusual activity”, Lüdecke says, it would be necessary to have comprehensive data about the oceans before 1850. This doesn’t exist, and so a comparison is not possible. Lüdecke reminds: “It is mandatory to prove that the climate data since 1850 are indeed unusual when compared to the period before that.” A comparison is already very difficult to do with atmospheric temperatures. With ocean data: “Who today can tell us what temperature distributions the oceans had back during the Medieval Warm Period?” Lüdecke writes Assuming that today is unusual without being able to compare it to anything from the past is not science at all, he tells us.

When it comes to extreme weather events, there are plenty of paintings and recorded accounts showing that they too existed earlier on, and that today’s events are nothing new, Lüdecke writes. Even the IPCC has reached that conclusion. The German climatologist puts the assumptions of more future extreme weather events in the category of “crystal balls” and not modern science.
Prof. Lüdecke also blasts the over-emphasis on climate models, writing that “the models fail already for the past” and that they cannot even predict the next El Nino correctly or the missing tropospheric hot spot. He writes:
Using the R. Feynman yardstick these climate models are not only inaccurate or a bit false; they are totally false. […] Anyone selling climate forecasts from climate models as scientific is using a medieval paradigm. He is conducting moral sciences instead of physics.” 
Ouch. Lüdecke also then calls the alliance between the IPCC and policymaking “dubious” and one that was set up with the target of reaching an already predetermined result. He calls the manner in which policymaking is moving ahead “embellished nonsense”.
In his conclusion the German professor advises those engaged in a discussion with alarmists, or listening to a presenation by an alarmist, to not go easy on them. There are three points, he advises:
1. The modern science paradigm of priority on measurement over theoretical model remains valid. The climate alarmist must prove that his hypothsies is confirmed by observations and measurements. It is not up to you to prove his hypothesis is false.
2. When the climate alarmists “starts beating around the bush” insists he name a peer-reviewed paper that proves, based on measurements, that the climate change since 1850 is unprecedented compared to earlier times (there isn’t any).
3. Don’t let yourself be drawn into the discussion over climate models. That the models are unable to describe the climate development means they are false, as to point no. 1.”
The distinguished professor ends by blasting climate policymakers, warning they are bordering on “criminal activity” in their conscious misuse of science to formulate policy:
We are allowing hundreds of thousands of people in the poorest developing countries to starve in order to be able to finance climate protection and energy transformation that are not based on today’s valid science paradigm. That is not only idiotic, but also borders on criminal activity by the politically responsible persons.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn Empirical Review of Recent Trends in the Greenhouse Effect
By Robin Pittwood, Kiwi Thinker
Abstract
The core of the human caused global warming proposition is that an increasing level of greenhouse gases acts to reduce heat loss from the planet making the atmosphere here warmer. The amount of warming anticipated by the IPCC models is from about one to several degrees C for a doubling of CO2 concentration.
But a conundrum has arisen lately:  While CO2 has continued rise significantly the temperature has not.  There has been no global warming since about 1997. Scientists on both sides of the debate have noticed this and have offered something like 55 explanations as to why this could be so. Some of those explanations lock into the dogma built into the IPCC models, taking for certain that the greenhouse effect is increasing, but because there is no atmospheric temperature rise, they then have to explain the retained heat is somewhere else.
Is the greenhouse effect occurring as the IPCC models propose?
This study analysed two important factors directly associated with the greenhouse effect, atmospheric temperature and outgoing radiation and finds that outgoing radiation has not declined. The missing heat has gone back to space as usual.  But more importantly the (lack of a) trend observed in an empirical derivation of the Stefan Boltzmann relative emissivity factor directly contradicts the greenhouse theory built into the IPCC models.
Article
Regular readers at any of the main climate change blogs will be aware that since about 1997 there has been nearly no global temperature rise. And they will know too, that this is despite atmospheric CO2 concentration continuing to rise. To date there are some 55 ideas to explain this slowdown in global warming. Some of the ‘explanations’ presume the so-called ‘greenhouse effect’ must still be increasing as the IPCC models calculate; it’s just that the heat has been hidden elsewhere, maybe deep in the ocean.
This study, based on 34 years of satellite data; outgoing long-wave infrared radiation (OLWIR) and temperature, demonstrates otherwise.
I used three data sets, OLWIR from NOAA, and the average of both UAH and RSS for global temperature.
I obtained monthly average OLWIR (W/m2) for each 2.5 degree latitude by 2.5 degree longitude area of the globe. After converting the netCDF files to Excel, I scaled each 2.5*2.5 area’s OLWIR to account for the varying size of its area, resulting in a global average OLWIR.  (There was some missing data mid 1994 to early 1995. I populated this by a linear interpolation).  The resulting annual average OLWIR is shown in the graph below for the years 1979 to 2012. A linear regression fit shows a generally increasing trend in OLWIR over this period.

The temperature data is also plotted on the graph below. A linear regression fit shows a generally increasing trend for the years 1979 to 2012.
The relationship between temperature and emitted radiation follows a universal law of physics, Stefan Boltzmann’s law states the emitted radiation is the product of the fourth power of absolute temperature and an emissivity factor. A reduction in the emissivity factor means less outgoing radiation for a given temperature.  That would indicate a stronger greenhouse effect.  An increase in the emissivity factor means more outgoing radiation for a given temperature.  That would indicate a more transparent atmosphere.  The study derived earth’s emissivity factor for each of the 34 years and the results displayed.

Using an average global temperature of 287 Kelvin added to the temperature anomaly, the relative emissivity has been derived for each year using the formula:
j / (k*T^4)
where j is OLWIR, k is the Stefan Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
If the greenhouse effect was increasing, relative emissivity should be declining. A quick look at the graphs shows clearly this is not the case.

Our planet’s relative emissivity has been flat-lining, despite increasing CO2 concentration over the study period. The derived emissivity factor, being basically constant, directly contradicts all of the IPCC models. No increased greenhouse effect is observed.
Findings:
The two primary findings of this empirical study are:


Outgoing radiation has not declined over this period as expected by IPCC models. The missing heat has gone back to space – as usual and as per Stefan Boltzmann’s law, via OLWIR, and,
The increasing greenhouse effect expected by IPCC models, has not exposed itself. There has been no increased greenhouse effect over this period. [A closer inspection of the relative emissivity trend shows the atmosphere is even becoming a little more transparent – though little should be made of this given the variability of the data].


Conclusion:
The core of the human caused global warming proposition is that an increasing level of greenhouse gases acts to reduce heat loss from the planet making the atmosphere here warmer. But is the greenhouse effect occurring as the IPCC models propose? This study analysed two important factors directly associated with the greenhouse effect, atmospheric temperature and outgoing radiation and finds that outgoing radiation has not declined. The missing heat has gone back to space as usual.
But more importantly the (lack of a) trend observed in an empirical derivation of the Stefan Boltzmann relative emissivity factor directly contradicts the greenhouse theory built into the IPCC models.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Krüger of the German climate blog Science Skeptical here has an analysis of Germany’s electrical power cost development since its renewable energy feed-in act was enacted in 2000. Germany’s Feed-in Act, the so-called EEG Gesetz, requires power companies to buy at exorbitant rates all renewable energies produced. Result: sky-rocketing prices.
I’ve shortened the text somewhat while translating.
===================================
Germany’s electricity price just behind leader Denmark in the EU: Since the introduction of its Feed-in Act in 2000, the electricity price has more than doubled!
 By Michael Krüger
 (Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Since the EEG renewable Feed-in Act took effect in 2000, it has been promised by green energy proponents time and again that the power price would fall in Germany. So what does the reality look like today? On this subject I have found the news from the Bundesnetzagentur (Federal Network Agency) on the latest power prices in the daily media.

The first chart above is a comparison of the per kilowatt-hour price of power for all EU countries. Germany (Deutschland) now has the second highest electricity prices after Denmark. The second chart shows the per kilowatt-hour feed-in surcharge levied on consumers. The final chart shows the cost of one kilowatt-hour of electricity households must pay – currently at 29.13 cents per kilowatt-hour.
In 2000, when the Feed-in Act was introduced, Germans paid only 13.94 cents per kilowatt-hour, which at the time had hardly changed since German reunification in 1991. After the liberalization of the power market in 1998, the price of power even dropped some. Today, in 2014, the price is now 29.21 cents per kilowatt-hour, i.e. it has more than doubled in 14 years. The cost-driver is the EEG Feed-in Act surcharge, which has risen from 0.41 cents in 2003 to 6.24 cents today. It represents 22% of the cost of a kilowatt-hour.
Conventional power plants inefficient in standby mode
Because of the expansion of renewable energies and because they must be bought first by the power companies, the conventional power plants no longer operate at full-capacity. If the wind blows briskly and the sun is shining, then the conventional power plants must reduce their production. And when the wind dies down and the sun doesn’t shine, then the conventional power production must ramp up again. As a result the capacity utilization and the output of the conventional power plants is substantially reduced and generation becomes inefficient and more costly. A businessman who is only allowed to sell when the weather is bad of course cannot earn anything and would soon go bankrupt. The very same is true today with conventional power in Germany. 
Moreover, the situation is getting worse as renewable energy continues to expand. Conventional power plants have since become so uneconomical that power plant operators prefer not to build any new ones and to switch off the old ones. New plants are no longer being planned and old power plants are being left on because the federal government has made it illegal to shut them down in attempt to keep the supply intact. Naturally all the added costs ultimately have to be borne by the power consumer.

Windparks to nowhere
Renewable energy producers are paid compensation to the full amount – even when their power is unneeded and cannot be fed into the grid because no line is available to feed the power into the grid. This is the case because grid expansion is progressing too slowly to keep up with the expansion of renewable energies. There exists windparks for example, that are located away from any grid feed-in point and are unable to feed in the power. However, the consumer still has to pay for the power they never feed in. Other costs that need to be passed on to the consumer are the expansion of the power grid, which is necessary for transmitting the renewable energy, for example to bring the wind power produced at the North Sea to southern Germany and to deliver solar energy produced in the south to northern Germany.
Another cost driver is the Emissions Certificates Trading introduced for CO2 in 2005. Currently CO2 emission certificates cost about 5 euros per tonne, but were as high as 30 euros. These were costs that naturally got passed on to the consumer. German environmental activist group BUND announced with glee that expected rising costs of emissions trading certificates would add another 2-4 ct/kwh. Super.
Cost of green energies: social and environmental blight
Summary: The points listed above have resulted in Germany’s electricity prices more than doubling since 2000. An end to the rising price spiral is nowhere sight despite more promises from the renewable energy proponents. Power consumers in Germany now have to pay almost twice as much as the consumers in neighboring France (which relies heavily on nuclear power) and more than double than consumers in the USA. The EEG renewable energy Feed-in Act does not decrease the prices, rather it causes them to skyrocket. It is only a question of time as to how long Germany can keep this up.
Proponents of renewable energy often like pointing to the social costs of conventional energy, but they ignore the social costs of renewable energies, which take up lots of natural space, crowd out wildlife and litter the landscape. Then there are the economic costs and social damage that high power costs inflict. Production and jobs move to foreign countries where energy and labor are cheaper.
Electricity is increasingly becoming a luxury
Consumers are seeing less money in their wallets, which in turn impacts buying power. Electricity is increasingly becoming a luxury, and energy poverty is spreading. The number of consumers getting their power shut off is on the rise in Germany. Just in 2011 in Germany, 6 million households (15% of all German households in Germany) were threatened with a power cut-off. The energy supply cut-off to 1 million households had already taken place. The power was turned off for 300,000 households. The trend is upwards.
The blame of course for all the misery gets placed on the evil power companies, grid operators, and the former conservative-free democrat government of the previous years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI spent a few days with my wife in Amsterdam, and so blogging was a bit on the light side. Today’s story is a short one about acid rain and forest die-off. Most people over 40 will certainly recall that one.
Whenever scientists are completely wrong, they hope no one will notice years later and that all will be forgotten.
Such is the case of the 1970s forest die-off scare (acid rain). Back then a “consensus” of scientists warned that the Earth’s forests were being wasted away because of acidic rain produced by man’s emissions from the burning fossil fuels. Lots of background info on this here,
The first warnings of an acid rain induced forest die-off in Germany were sounded by scientist Bernhard Ulrich, who warned that polluted rain was causing the soil to become too acidic for trees, which in turn would soon get very ill and die. Moreover by 1983 there was a claimed consensus. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) recently wrote on the forest die-off scare:
In the year 1983, an extremely informative study that recently appeared and maintained that during the course of this alarm debate, that there was not a single forest scientist in Germany who did not agree with this diagnosis.”
The leading German daily then summarizes that the acid rain, forest die scare turned up in the end being just a wave of hysteria that had gripped the scientific community. Today nobody hears about the acid rain; the problem has literally just vanished from existence. FAZ writer Jürgen Kaube even asks in his piece: “What ever happened to forest die-off?”
We suspect the same will be true of global warming in about 20 years time. Maybe sooner – especially when we look at the recent record high sea ice levels, recent cooling weather sweeping across the USA and the dozens of predictions of a coming climate cool-down coming from experts.

"Lydia Lunch turned 60 this year, but age has done little to dim this counterculture icon’s lust for life. Decades after her start as the nihilist 16-year-old frontwoman of 1970s no-wave band Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, the New York-born “apocalyptician” is a revered veteran of the US underground: a writer, spoken-word performer, musician, actor and artist. Lunch’s style is raw and incendiary, all sex and death and taboo-busting feminist rage. And in 2019, the sexagenarian is as unapologetic and active as ever – still writing, touring, collaborating and performing. Lunch is in Colchester when we speak, luxuriating in a “fabulous cottage-type hotel” conveniently situated near the cultural centre where she’s set to play that night with her band, Big Sexy Noise. On the stage and the page, she’s a formidable presence – seducing, goading and tongue-lashing her audience. In conversation, via Skype, she’s surprisingly jovial: affable, accommodating, disarmingly witty, a potty-mouthed doyenne dealing out double-entendres. Is she misunderstood? “Oh, chronically! But I get off on it. I’m not a miserable person, I just deal in miserable subjects.”  The last time the Guardian spoke with Lunch, in 2015, she was scouting around for a home for her archive, an honour that’s since gone to New York University. “They’re opening a new exhibition space next year and I think they’re gonna launch it with my archives, which is great.” It’s a fitting location: although she left for good in 1990, and doesn’t consider it home (“even when I lived there”), New York informed much of who Lunch became, and the art she’s made since. Lunch’s work is defiant, thrilling and unflinching. Her latest release, So Real It Hurts, is just so: an anthology of new and established writings that include everything from violent feminist revenge fantasies to diatribes on pollution and politics (and yes, Trump) in the Anthropocene epoch. They detail deviant delights, heroes sung (Hubert Selby Jr) and unsung (Herbert Huncke) alike. They offer alternative historical testimony documented in killer style: pre-gentrification New York, (the “devil’s litterbox”); the no-wave scene (“a collective bowel-cleansing caterwaul … a mad collective of death-defiant miscreants”); and the start of the race riots of 1967, witnessed first-hand by an eight-year-old Lydia when her hometown – which became the centre of the chaos – erupted into violence, with a baseball-bat carrying hoard “stampeding directly in front of my house”. The anthology, she tells me, “was rejected by 26 American publishers – and I’m quite happy to say that. I wanted that stamped on the front cover, actually.” She eventually found a publisher, Seven Stories, that appreciates her calling as a “stubborn, independent town-crier”. “I asked them, ‘Why do you want to publish this book?’ And one of them said, ‘Because I laughed at every chapter.’ Finally! Someone gets it. Yes! I mean, this [life] shit is deadly serious, so lets have a party and celebrate the fact that we’re still alive in spite of this nightmare. That’s what my whole career has been about.” Opening the anthology is an introduction by the late celebrity chef and travel writer Anthony Bourdain. Were they friends? “We knew of each other. He’d read something I’d written for a photobook of [Bourdain’s partner] Asia Argento. And we’d met when he did his Lower East Side special. One of the questions I asked him was, ‘How did you do it?’ How did he go from being a heroin addict scumbag cook to [a sober and successful celebrity]? He said, ‘It was a total fluke.’ I just think that’s great. Because some people are born ambitious and they plan for success; other people just do what they do, and wherever it goes is where they get.” Like Bourdain, Lunch found community through food as a young runaway. As legend tells it, the young hellion earned her nom de plume after gaining renown as both an expert food thief and an on-the-fly chef, transforming produce she’d filched into nourishing lunches for fellow punks such as Dead Boys. In 2012 she released a cookbook, The Need to Feed, telling Vice: “Cooking is one of the most intimate things this side of sex – cooking leads to good sex. You are touching something that someone else is digesting. Your DNA is on the food they eat. It’s a form of impregnation – which is basically what my entire artistic motive is, anyway.” Does she still enjoy cooking? “I do. It’s very witchy. But you’ve gotta be careful about where your food comes from – especially in the UK and the States – because we end up consuming so much poison.” Lunch knows a thing or two about toxins. Before she was old enough to pick her own poisons, Lunch grew up on one of America’s Superfund sites: land contaminated by life-endangering hazardous waste. At last count, says Lunch, there are 39,000 hazardous sites spread across America. So Real It Hurts points the finger at big conglomerates and the US Department of Justice. But this isn’t a new theme for Lunch; she’s been speaking out about environmental justice since her early20s. “I think those of us doing spoken word when I got started, under Reagan and Thatcher – John Cooper Clarke, Exene Cervenka, Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra – I think we comprehended more than we knew. I go back to some of the speeches I wrote in 84, and I’m like, yup, I could do that one tonight.” She’s cheered by today’s climate activists, citing Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion (“big fan”), but is also incredulous at current political inaction. “I mean it’s just ridiculous that we’re still having this conversation. There were 379 tornados in 13 days in America last month. In India? Drought. China? Flooding. I was in Mexico City a month ago; they have the worst air pollution in decades. You can’t get away from it. There’ll be more plastic in the ocean than fish soon. I mean, wake the fuck up.” I tell her that a recent investigation has revealed that British people are ingesting a credit-card-sized amount of plastic every week thanks to microplastics in our air, food and water supplies. “If only we could shit those credit cards out and use ’em at the ATM, eh?” Lunch’s sense of humour is dark, delightful and revelatory. In the chapter Motherhood: It’s Not Compulsory, we meet Lunch the baby whisperer, an intentionally childless hellraiser with an almost supernatural ability to soothe other people’s fractious children. In Assume the Position, she divulges her “decades-long” kink for cops, detailing her various illicit and comic encounters with the long arm of the law. And in Detox, we find Lunch in self-help guru mode, encouraging us to indulge in regular masturbation and ditch toxic household cleaning products for DIY vinegar concoctions: “With all the money you save from not making multinationals richer, you could get a massage once a month for the rest of your life! Or, start saving for your own funeral. It might come sooner than you think.” Many of us – Lunch included – are surprised she’s still around given her propensity for extreme living. In the chapter Drunk on Fuck, she writes of reaching a point where her libido and the need “…to possess, to consume…” had reached danger point, prompting a long bout of celibacy. Is she dating again now? Does she still enjoy lovers? “Is that an invitation?” she parries mischievously. Lunch has described herself in previous years as a self-confessed adrenaline junkie, obsessed by “death’s black magnetism”. She’s survived childhood sexual abuse and domestic violence, dated various unhinged lovers (from a suspected psychopath to an ex-alcoholic who went on to murder his wife), escaped deranged stalkers and haunted the same streets as such serial killers as Richard Ramirez. “I didn’t think I’d live this long either, it wasn’t my goal actually, but I’m not gonna resist it [life] either. I’m having too much fun. I’m too stubborn to die, too much to do still.” Would she change anything, if she could go back? “God, no. Not a lick of it. And if she could go back and talk to her 16-year-old self? “I’d say, ‘Keep going, kid; you’re on the right track.’” She remains a cult figure, despite collaborations with the likes of Sonic Youth and Nick Cave. But a critical reappraisal of Lunch’s work is overdue; her “varied and hairied” career is the subject of an upcoming documentary by long-time friend and collaborator, Beth B. Besides, says Lunch, looking for evidence of her legacy in “the usual, convenient places, like music” may well be folly in 2019. “Maybe today’s counterculture exists elsewhere, in architecture, science, medicine.” What makes Lunch happy these days? “Laughing after I’ve cried. I think my rebellion – as I’ve said for years – has always been and will always be pleasure. It’s in talking, in sharing conversation with others; it’s in laughter; it’s in stretching both middle fingers up into the air and saying, ‘Still here, motherfucker’. Yeah.” • So Real It Hurts is out now, published by Seven Stories.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s early November and now is a good time to look at some of this year’s global crop harvest results. Let’s recall that global warming models projected poor harvests and hunger in the future due to droughts (and floods).
But that is hardly the case…at least certainly for this year. And recall how Joe Bastardi last spring projected a “Garden of Eden” harvest for the US Great Plains. Looks like he was right. The story is similar many places worldwide, and not just the US.
10-foot corn
For example Bloomberg here reports of a record US corn harvest in 2014, writing:
From Ohio to Nebraska, thousands of field inspections this week during the Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour show corn output in the U.S., the world’s top producer, will be 0.4 percent above the government’s estimate. Months of timely rains and mild weather created ideal growing conditions, leaving ears with more kernels than normal on 10-foot (3-meter) corn stalks and more seed pods on dark, green soy plants.”
All-time high of 3.631 billion bushels of soybean
Bloomberg also writes here that the US production of soybean “will jump 10 percent this year to an all-time high of 3.631 billion bushels, and inventories before the 2015 harvest will be double a year earlier.”
In Europe the story is the similar. Last May the online marktkompass here already wrote of record wheat harvests:
In all regions of Central and Eastern Europe the weather for growth was close to being optimal and the yield potential has drastically improved.”
“All-time records” in Europe
In Germany’s agricultural state of Mecklenburg West-Pomerania, corn and barley reached record harvests. The online bauwesta reports that both winter and summer barley harvests set all-time records. Overall across Europe Crop Site reports this year’s cereal harvest “has generally been strong in Europe and Ukraine“.
Doom and gloom media silent on bumper crop yields
Moreover, numerous analysts report of falling grain and commodity prices. All of this, of course, is great news for consumers and a planet that still has close to a billion people who do not get enough to eat. Yet the good news is generally not getting reported by the doom-and-gloom obsessed media.
“Bounty of wheat, barley and oats”

Almost every country one looks at in Europe, one is finding record bumper crops this year. The usually gloom-obsessed UK Guardian also reported in September on UK 2014 harvests:
Long sunny spells after a mild winter and early spring delivers a bounty of wheat, barley and oats. […] 2014 could be the biggest yield ever for wheat when the final data is released in October.”
If climate change is supposed to be resulting in poor harvests, higher food prices and acute hunger for the poor, as many experts have warned incessantly, then the opposite must mean that climate change is not happening at all, or that it is having a profoundly beneficial effect for man instead.
Glut of apples
The Guardian also reports of bumper apple harvests and that “growers still face losses due to glut of apples and supermarket price wars.” The Guardian adds, “A cold winter gave the trees a good rest, then plenty of rain – especially in August – helped plump up the fruit, and then a dry September allowed the picking to get started early.”
If anything, all the bumper crops are leading to only one single food crisis: the rock bottom prices farmers are getting for their crops!
“bumper world harvest this year”
thompsonslimited.com here reports that the bumper-crop low-price crisis has also not spared Canada for almost everything from apples to zucchini. It writes that the “world commodity prices are worryingly low for arable farmers following a bumper world harvest this year.”
Russia “in awash in grain”
www.martellcropprojections.com here writes that Russia “is awash in grain from a bumper harvest in the growing season just ended.  The 2014 grain harvest increased to 105 million tonnes threatening to break a record.”
The Crop Site also reports of record rice production in Bangladesh, and bumper maize harvests in Pakistan. Even Scotland’s 2014 cereal harvest “is estimated to be the largest in 20 years, with favourable conditions expected to produce more than three million tonnes of cereals.”
So, if you are not moping about all the good news on this year’s global harvest, and failed predictions of catastrophe, and wish instead to celebrate the good news with glasses of cheer, the wine-searcher here reports that France is “looking forward to a bigger and better wine harvest“. Indeed all the natural ingredients needed for fermenting or brewing your favorite spirit appear to be in bountiful supply this year.
Visions of Ehrlichian-style widespread crop failures and mass starvations postponed yet again. And they show absolutely no signs of ever materializing any time soon.
In fact one could easily argue that the world is better fed today than at any time in human history. We can in part thank higher CO2 concentrations and warmer climate for that.

"Britain’s leading companies, investment funds and pension schemes must show by 2022 how the climate emergency could jeopardise their finances, under government plans to boost the UK’s green credentials. Firms must document within the two-and-a-half-year deadline how extreme weather and changes to climate rules, such as a ban on plastic packaging, could hit their profits.  The Treasury is also urging City banks to play a bigger role in supporting the UK meeting its legal target to create a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. Under a new government strategy, banks will be pushed to invest in sustainability and come clean about their own exposure to the climate crisis. The Treasury said its green finance strategy would help the City emerge as a green finance capital by funding green investment, an education charter, a green home finance fund and by establishing a new green finance institute. The institute succeeds the green finance taskforce that was launched in 2017 and will encourage investment in sustainable businesses such as renewable energy firms. Financial services firms will also be expected to disclose how climate emergency risk impacts their activities by 2022. John Glen, the City minister, said the green finance strategy would help establish London as “a pre-eminent international centre for green finance”. He said: “The UK has a long history of leading the way in tackling climate change, but we need to do more to protect our planet for future generations.” The Treasury’s flurry of green finance initiatives has emerged as it prepares to face questions from a committee of MPs over its role in supporting the government’s climate targets. The Treasury select committee launched an inquiry last month to scrutinise the role played by Treasury officials, regulators and financial services firms after Theresa May’s announcement that a net-zero carbon emissions target would be enshrined in law. Philip Hammond responded to the policy by saying a net-zero carbon economy would cost £1tn to create. The claim was quickly rebuffed by No 10 in a rare rebuke to the chancellor. John McDonnell recently outlined plans to give the Bank of England powers to help scrutinise the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency. The shadow chancellor has promoted the idea of a sustainable investment board to oversee lending to British businesses with the aim of boosting productivity, with Bank of England governor Mark Carney as a key member. The new body would be supplemented by state-owned regional investment banks and a £250bn national transformation fund with targets to invest in low-carbon businesses. McDonnell said: “From the government, this is too little and too late. It’s also totally ineffectual and toothless. “While it’s true that the finance sector will need to play a huge role in securing a sustainable economy for the future, it seems like the government is still stuck in the mindset of fiddling around the edges and hoping the free market will solve the climate emergency.” Climate emergency campaigners have supported the concept of a Green New Deal that mostly involves state support for a switch to low-carbon energy use and greener infrastructure. Hammond said he preferred to encourage the private sector to back green companies through a green finance institute, headed by former Barclays executive Rhian-Mari Thomas. He pointed to the already burgeoning market for green bonds, which act like mortgages for businesses that want to pursue environmentally friendly projects. All the main city regulators said they backed the chancellor’s move, saying a new stewardship code that required investors to check the “environmental, social and governance issues, including climate change” of UK businesses would make them more sustainable.

"The vast expanse of sea ice around Antarctica has suffered a “precipitous” fall since 2014, satellite data shows, and fell at a faster rate than seen in the Arctic. The plunge in the average annual extent means Antarctica lost as much sea ice in four years as the Arctic lost in 34 years. The cause of the sharp Antarctic losses is as yet unknown and only time will tell whether the ice recovers or continues to decline. But researchers said it showed ice could disappear much more rapidly than previously thought. Unlike the melting of ice sheets on land, sea ice melting does not raise sea level. But losing bright white sea ice means the sun’s heat is instead absorbed by dark ocean waters, leading to a vicious circle of heating. Sea ice spreads over enormous areas and has major impacts on the global climate system, with losses in the Arctic  strongly linked to extreme weather at lower latitudes, such as heatwaves in Europe. The loss of sea ice in the Arctic clearly tracks the rise in global air temperatures resulting from human-caused global heating, but the two poles are very different. The Arctic is an ocean surrounded by continents and is exposed to warming air, while Antarctica is a freezing continent surrounded by oceans and is protected from warming air by a circle of strong winds. Antarctic sea ice had been slowly increasing during the 40 years of measurements and reached a record maximum in 2014. But since then sea ice extent has nosedived, reaching a record low in 2017. “There has been a huge decrease,” said Claire Parkinson, at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in the US. In her study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, she called the decline precipitous and a dramatic reversal. “We don’t know if that decrease is going to continue,” she said. “But it raises the question of why [has it happened], and are we going to see some huge acceleration in the rate of decrease in the Arctic? Only the continued record will let us know.” “The Arctic has become a poster child for global warming,” Parkinson said, but the recent sea ice falls in Antarctica have been far worse. She has tracked Antarctic sea ice for more than 40 years. “All of us scientists were thinking eventually global warming is going to catch up in the Antarctic,” she said. Kaitlin Naughten, a sea ice expert at the British Antarctic Survey, said: “Westerly winds which surround the continent mean that Antarctic sea ice doesn’t respond directly to global warming averaged over the whole planet.” “Climate change is affecting the winds, but so is the ozone hole and short-term cycles like El Niño. The sea ice is also affected by meltwater running off from the Antarctic ice sheet,” she said. “Until 2014, the total effect of all these factors was for Antarctic sea ice to expand. But in 2014, something flipped, and the sea ice has since declined dramatically. Now scientists are trying to figure out exactly why this happened.” Prof Andrew Shepherd at Leeds University in the UK said: “The rapid decline has caught us by surprise and changes the picture completely. Now sea ice is retreating in both hemispheres and that presents a challenge because it could mean further warming.” He said it would also be important to find if the ice’s thickness has changed, as well as its extent. The new research collated microwave satellite data from 1979 to 2018, providing excellent measurements of sea ice as the different signals from ice and ocean are very distinct and microwaves can be detected day or night and usually through clouds. Sea ice expands in winter and retreats in summer every year, so Parkinson used annual averages to assess the long term trends. The biggest single year fall was in 2016, when an El Niño boosted human-caused warming to result in record global temperatures. She said rates of decline after 2014 were three times faster than the most rapid melting ever recorded in the Arctic. Sea ice extent had a small uptick in 2018, but in 2019 so far there had been a further reduction, she said. Parkinson said the dramatic plunge was a strong piece of evidence that scientists could use to narrow down the causes of the change. “As a Nasa scientist, my key responsibility is to get the satellite data out and I hope others will take this 40-year record and try to figure out how these dramatically rapid decreases since 2014 can be explained,” she said."

================================
Why there is global warming
by Harold Faulkner
People in the USA are being told by the U.S. government and media that global warming is man-made. If that is true, how can the government and media explain the high temperatures the Earth has experienced in past years when there were far fewer people?
Let us look back in the world’s history: for example, between roughly 900 AD and 1350 AD the temperatures were much higher than now. And, back then there were fewer people, no cars, no electric utilities, and no factories, etc. So what caused the Earth’s heat? Could it be a natural occurrence? The temperature graph shows the temperatures of the Earth before Christ to 2040.

In the book THE DISCOVERERS published in February 1985 by Daniel J. Boorstin, beginning in chapter 28, it goes into detail about Eric the Red, the father of Lief Ericsson, and how he discovered an island covered in green grass.
In approximately 983 AD, Eric the Red committed murder, and was banished from Iceland for three years. Eric the Red sailed 500 miles west from Iceland and discovered an island covered in GREEN grass, which he named Greenland. Greenland reminded Eric the Red of his native Norway because of the grass, game animals, and a sea full of fish. Even the air provided a harvest of birds. Eric the Red and his crew started laying out sites for farms and homesteads, as there was no sign of earlier human habitation.
When his banishment expired, Eric the Red returned to congested Iceland to gather Viking settlers. In 986, Eric the Red set sail with an emigrant fleet of twenty-five ships carrying men, women, and domestic animals. Unfortunately, only fourteen ships survived the stormy passage, which carried about four-hundred-fifty immigrants plus the farm animals. The immigrants settled on the southern-west tip and up the western coast of Greenland.
After the year 1200 AD, the Earth’s and Greenland’s climate grew colder; ice started building up on the southern tip of Greenland. Before the end of 1300AD, the Viking settlements were just a memory. You can find the above by searching Google. One link is: www.greenland.com/en/about-greenland/erik-den-roede.aspx. 
The following quote you can also read about why there is global warming. This is from the book EINSTEIN’S UNIVERSE, Page 63, written by Nigel Calder in 1972, and updated in 1982:
The reckoning of planetary motions is a venerable science. Nowadays it tells us, for example, how gravity causes the ice to advance or retreat on the Earth during the ice ages. The gravity of the Moon and (to a lesser extent) of the Sun makes the Earth’s axis swivel around like a tilted spinning top. Other planets of the Solar System, especially Jupiter, Mars and Venus, influence the Earth’s tilt and the shape of its orbit, in a more-or-less cyclic fashion, with significant effects on the intensity of sunshine falling on different regions of the Earth during the various seasons. Every so often a fortunate attitude and orbit of the Earth combine to drench the ice sheets in sunshine as at the end of the most recent ice age, about ten thousand years ago. But now our relatively benign interglacial is coming to an end, as gravity continues to toy with our planet.”

The above points out that the universe is too huge and the earth is too small for the Earth’s population to have any effect on the earth’s temperature. The earth’s temperature is a function of the sun’s temperature and the effects from the many massive planets in the universe, i.e.:
The gravity of the Moon and (to a lesser extent) of the Sun makes the Earth’s axis swivel around like a tilted spinning top. Other planets of the solar system, especially Jupiter, Mars and Venus, influence the Earth’s tilt and the shape of its orbit, in a more-or-less cyclic fashion, with significant effects on the intensity of sunshine falling on different regions of the Earth during the various seasons.”
Read below about carbon dioxide, which we need in order to exist. You can find the article below at: www.geocraft.com/ice_ages.html.
FUN FACTS about CARBON DIOXIDE
– Of the 186 billion tons of carbon from CO2 that enter the Earth’s atmosphere each year from all sources, only 6 billion tons are from human activity. Approximately 90 billion tons come from biologic activity in earth’s oceans and another 90 billion tons from such sources as volcanoes and decaying land plants.
– At 380 parts per million CO2 is a minor constituent of the Earth’s atmosphere–less than 4/100ths of 1% of all gases present. Compared to former geologic times, the Earth’s current atmosphere is CO2-impoverished.
– CO2 is odorless, colorless, and tasteless. Plants absorb CO2 and emit oxygen as a waste product. Humans and animals breathe oxygen and emit CO2 as a waste product. Carbon dioxide is a nutrient, not a pollutant, and all life– plants and animals alike– benefit from more of it. All life on Earth is carbon-based and CO2 is an essential ingredient. When plant-growers want to stimulate plant growth, they introduce more carbon dioxide.
– CO2 that goes into the atmosphere does not stay there, but continuously recycled by terrestrial plant life and earth’s oceans– the great retirement home for most terrestrial carbon dioxide.
– If we are in a global warming crisis today, even the most aggressive and costly proposals for limiting industrial carbon dioxide emissions and all other government proposals and taxes would have a negligible effect on global climate!
The government is lying, trying to use global warming to limit, and tax its citizens through “cap and trade” and other tax schemes for the government’s benefit. We, the people, cannot allow this to happen.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhether it’s war, rape, storms, depression, etc., there’s almost nothing that doesn’t get blamed on CO2 nowadays.
One of the favorites in the climate blame-game is the alleged dying off of coral reefs due to global warming from man-made CO2..
But that is turning out to be false, too. The online Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes today that climate change is not responsible for the dying off of the Caribbean coral reefs after all, citing a new report by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
The IUCN writes (emphasis added):
Climate change has long been thought to be the main culprit in coral degradation. While it does pose a serious threat by making oceans more acidic and causing coral bleaching, the report shows that the loss of parrotfish and sea urchin – the area’s two main grazers – has, in fact, been the key driver of coral decline in the region. An unidentified disease led to a mass mortality of the sea urchin in 1983 and extreme fishing throughout the 20th century has brought the parrotfish population to the brink of extinction in some regions. The loss of these species breaks the delicate balance of coral ecosystems and allows algae, on which they feed, to smother the reefs. […]
‘Even if we could somehow make climate change disappear tomorrow, these reefs would continue their decline,’ says Jeremy Jackson, lead author of the report and IUCN’s senior advisor on coral reefs.”
Surprise. Another climate myth gets debunked.

Climate change: “an excuse for doing nothing”
Next is a nice video featuring the report’s lead author Jeremy Jackson who explains the significance of the report. He makes a surprising comment on climate change.

At the 3.48 mark, Jackson states:
There’s nothing in my report, except the realization that climate change hadn’t been as severe as we feared so far, that’s new.  The fact and the thing about climate change is that it is an excuse for doing nothing. You know if it’s all those goddamn gringos in the north that made things bad, then I don’t have to do my job.”
He’s right. What Jackson hopefully realizes is that with just a fraction of the money that is spent on the bogus problem of climate, it would likely be enough to solve all the Caribbean coral reef problems.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA recent publication in Nature purported it had finally detected the radiative forcing of increasing atmospheric CO2.
German physical chemist Dr. Siegfried Dittrich slams the media’s assertions of proof that CO2 was guilty of the warming, claiming they are faulty and that they were passed on uncritically by German news weekly FOCUS ONLINE. Here’s the translation:
==================================
Climate Warming From Carbon Dioxide?
By Dr. Siegfried Dittrich, on the DPA German News Agency release appearing at Focus-Online 27 February 2015: “Climate warming through carbon dioxide: The proof: CO2 is indeed guilty of the greenhouse effect“.
‘The real guilt by CO2 for the greenhouse gas effect is finally proven.’ This was the subheading of a DPA release appearing at FOCUS Online on 27 February.
Later in the text it is written: ‘For the first time we are seeing the enhancement of the greenhouse effect in nature’, and at the Hamburg-based Max Planck Institute for Meteorology it was gleefully added that finally also the magnitude of the anthropogenic impact has become visible.
It all goes back to the latest surface radiation measurements recently published in an essay in Nature (details here and here). However no one seems to have noticed that the measurements actually showed the exact opposite of what is claimed to have been proven above, namely nothing other than what serious climate critics have always been saying about anthropogenic greenhouse effect.

The number for the increase in CO2-dependent back radiation given by Nature of 0.2 watt/m2 per decade is indeed in reality nothing more than trifle. Why would the earth be shocked when 1367 watts per square meter strikes the surface at noon along the equator? The ever-changing deviations from this so-called solar constant mean value are in fact considerably greater than the above given 0.2 watts/m2.
According to the IPCC, the surface radiative forcing increase in the event of a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration is exactly 3.7 Watt/m2, a figure that has been independently confirmed on multiple occasions. Over the last decade the atmospheric CO2 concentration increased some 20 parts per million. Currently it stands at about 400 ppm. Here any undergraduate student is able to compute that the resulting surface radiative forcing increase is approximately 0.2 watt/m2, which has been confirmed by the above mentioned measurements.
Also the resulting global temperature increase can be computed using one of the IPCC equations, which also can be derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law.
In Nature it is expressly remarked that the measured difference in surface radiative forcing of 0.2 watt/m2 is solely for cloud-free zones on earth. With an average 40% cloud cover and a 30% overlap between the present water vapor and CO2 absorption spectrum, the above calculated temperature value gets reduced from 0.06°C to 0.03°C. Here in reality we are talking about an effect that is barely measureable, and one that has no dramatic impact when combined with the fictional water vapor amplification, which incidentally the superfluous ‘Energiewende’ is based on ad absurdum. It is more than regrettable that FOCUS uncritically passed on these misinterpretations. A correction should be made immediately.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNow that a couple of surface temperature data sets are showing 2014 was a “record warm year,” people are wondering if it means the warming pause is over, and if so, how much climate sensitivity to CO2 there really is.
Online Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski (a geologist) has an analysis of 2014’s “record warm year” and asks if it means global warming has resumed after “a pause since the end of the 1990s”. He describes how climate scientists have been dumbfounded by the “unexpected warming pause”. A number of scientists blame the oceans for absorbing the heat out of the atmosphere. Japan’s meteorological services report that global surface temperature has risen 0.7°C in one hundred years, he writes.
On the significance of the warm year, the Spiegel science journalist quotes the German Climate Consortium: “The following years will allow us to judge the extent global warming at the surface of the earth has resumed.” And even the most alarmist organizations are conceding the global warming pause is real. For example the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) indirectly admits to Spiegel that the global temperature has paused, but reminds us that the 14 warmest years on record occurred over the past 15 years.
On the future of warming, Bojanowski describes a science fraught with uncertainty when it comes to future projections:
The UN IPCC continues to predict a hefty global warming should carbon dioxide emissions not be drastically reduced. But there are major uncertainties in the calculations and for this reason short-term fluctuations will remain unexplainable.”

Readers should note at this point that this too also has to apply for “short-term” warm fluctuations, such as the one from 1980-1998. That one too must have been in large part due to natural factors.
Bojanowski sums up his analysis by pointing out there is also uncertainty not only at the earth’s surface, but in the troposphere as well, writing that “satellite meaurements are astonishing” researchers:
Moreover satellite measurements for upper air levels, which have been taken since the mid 1990s, show hardly any warming. Because of this, scientists are debating if the sensitivity of air temperature with respect to greenhouse gases is possibly less than assumed.”
Bojanowski also points to conflicting scientific literature and papers when it comes to the stability of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. He adds, “The uncertainties show that the decisive questions about the future cannot be answered using short-term fluctuations.” And:
A warm record here, a warming pause there – the concerns and questions surrounding climate change remain the same.”

"The world’s oceans are facing a “new industrial frontier” from a fledgling deep-sea mining industry as companies line up to extract metals and minerals from some of the most important ecosystems on the planet, a report has found. The study by Greenpeace revealed that although no mining had started on the ocean floor, 29 exploration licences had been issued covering an area five times bigger than the UK. Environmentalists said the proposed mining would threaten not only crucial ecosystems but the global fight against climate breakdown.  Louisa Casson, an ocean campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “The health of our oceans is closely linked to our own survival. Unless we act now to protect them, deep-sea mining could have devastating consequences for marine life and humankind.” The licences, issued by a United Nations body, the International Seabed Authority, have been granted to a handful of countries that sponsor private companies. They cover vast areas of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, totalling 1.3m sq km (500,000 sq miles). If the mining goes ahead, large machines will be lowered on to the seabed to excavate cobalt and other rare metals. Campaigners said that, as well as destroying little understood regions of the ocean floor, the operations would deepen the climate emergency by disrupting carbon stores in seafloor sediments, reducing the ocean’s ability to store it. The industry has said deep-sea mining is essential to extract the materials needed for a transition to a green economy by supplying raw materials for key technologies including batteries, computers and phones. Its advocates say deep-sea mining is less harmful to the environment and workers than most existing mineral and mining operations. However, the report said: “The deep-sea mining industry presents its development as essential for a low-carbon future, yet this claim is not substantiated by actors in the renewable energy, electric vehicle or battery sectors. Such arguments ignore calls for a move from the endless exploitation of resources to a transformational and circular economy.” The environmentalist Chris Packham, writing in the Guardian, said deep-sea mining posed a serious threat to global oceans. “We’ve already seen the huge destruction ravaged upon our planet by corporations mining on land. Are we really prepared to give the go-ahead to the mining industry expanding into a new frontier, where it will be even harder for us to scrutinise the damage caused?” The report called on governments to agree on a strong global ocean treaty in the next 12 months, citing scientists, governments, environmentalists and representatives of the fishing industry, who warned of the threat posed by deep-sea mining to marine life. The report said the UK government held licences to exploit more of the international seabed than any government apart from China. It accused ministers of positioning the government as a leader on marine protection while simultaneously investing in deep-sea mining. Casson said: “We need the UK government to show strong global leadership and champion ocean protection. They have backed the call for global action to safeguard our oceans but they are also a leading advocate for deep-sea mining. Such hypocrisy is unacceptable.” A government spokesperson said: “The UK continues to press for the highest international environmental standards, including on deep sea mineral extraction. We have sponsored two exploration licences, which allows scientific marine research to fully understand the effects of deep sea mining and we will not issue a single exploitation licence without a full assessment of the environmental impact.”"

===========================================
Around $80 billion wasted on power for online devices in 2013
Simple measures can keep problem of inefficient ‘network standby’ from worsening in years ahead, IEA report says
 2 July 2014 Paris
Today, the world’s 14 billion online electronic devices – such as set-top boxes, modems, printers and game consoles – waste around USD 80 billion each year because of inefficient technology. By 2020, the problem will considerably worsen, with an estimated USD 120 billion wasted. But a report by the International Energy Agency points to a different path, identifying simple measures that can be implemented now to improve energy efficiency in networked devices, resulting in massive savings of energy and money.
The report, More Data, Less Energy: Making Network Standby More Efficient in Billions of Connected Devices, shows that electricity demand of our increasingly digital economies is growing at an alarming rate. While data centre energy demand has received much attention, of greater cause for concern is the growing energy demand of billions of networked devices. In 2013, a relatively small portion of the world’s population relied on these devices to stay connected. But energy demand is increasing as a growing share of the world’s population becomes wired and as network connectivity spreads to devices and appliances that were previously not connected, such as washing machines, refrigerators, lights and thermostats.
‘The proliferation of connected devices brings many benefits to the world, but right now the cost is far higher than it should be,’ said IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven. ‘Consumers are losing money in the form of wasted energy, which is leading to more costly power stations and more distribution infrastructure being built than we would otherwise need – not to mention all the extra greenhouse gases that are being emitted. But it need not be this way. If we adopt best available technologies we can minimise the cost of meeting demand as the use and benefits of connected devices grows.’

As the report explains, much of the problem boils down to inefficient ‘network standby’ – that is, the maintaining of a network connection while in standby. In many devices, standby is a misnomer: it suggests that the device has gone to sleep and is almost off. In reality, most network-enabled devices draw as much power in this mode as when activated to perform their main tasks.
In 2013, the world’s networked devices consumed around 616 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity, the majority of which was used in standby mode. Of that total, around 400 TWh – equivalent to the electricity consumed annually by the United Kingdom and Norway combined – was wasted because of inefficient technology.
‘The problem is not that these devices are often in standby mode, but rather that they typically use much more power than they should to maintain a connection and communicate with the network,” said Ms. Van der Hoeven. ‘Just by using today’s best available technology, such devices could perform exactly the same tasks in standby while consuming around 65% less power.’
The report describes technologies and technical solutions as well as a range of policy options that are available to reduce energy waste. It projects that if better energy efficiency measures were applied to online devices in the coming years, 600 TWh of energy would be saved. That’s equivalent to shutting 200 standard 500MW coal-fired power plants, which would cut emissions by 600 million metric tons of CO2
In the report, the IEA calls on policy makers, standards development organisations, software and hardware developers, designers, service providers and manufacturers to work together to reduce energy demand. To achieve this, the agency urges an international initiative to enhance standards, as the issue is global.

=======================================
Fun with Climate Models: Flops, Failures and Fumbles
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
What’s great about science is that one can think up really neat models and see creativity come alive. And because there are many scientists, and not only just one, there are lots of alternative models. And things only get bad when the day of reckoning arrives, i.e. when the work gets graded. This is when the prognoses are compared to the real, observed measurements. So who was on the right path, and who needs go back to the drawing board?
When models turn out to be completely off, then they are said to have been falsified and thus are considered to have no value. The validation of models is one of the fundamental principles of science, Richard Feynman once said in a legendary lecture:

Failed hypotheses have been seen very often in science. A nice collection of the largest scientific flops is presented at WUWT. Unfortunately the climate sciences also belong to this category. Roy Spencer once compared an entire assortment of 73 climate models to the real observed temperature development, and they all ended up overshooting the target by far:

And already yet another model failure has appeared: In August 2009 Judith Lean and David Rind made a daring mid-term climate prognosis in the Geophysical Research Letters. They predicted a warming of 0.15° for the five-year period of 2009 to 2014. In truth it did not warm at all during the period. A bitter setback.
Over the last years it has started to dawn on scientists that perhaps something was missing in their models. The false prognoses stand out like a sore thumb. Not a single one of the once highly praised models saw the current 16-year stop in warming as possible. In September 2011 in an article in the Journal of Geophysical Research Crook & Forster admitted that the superficial reproduction of the real temperature development in a climate model hardly meant the mechanisms were completely understood. The freely adjustable parameters are just too multifaceted, and as a rule they are selected in a way to fabricate agreement. And just because there is an agreement, it does not mean predictive power can be automatically derived. What follows is an excerpt from the abstract by Crook & Foster (2011):
In this paper, we breakdown the temperature response of coupled ocean‐atmosphere climate models into components due to radiative forcing, climate feedback, and heat storage and transport to understand how well climate models reproduce the observed 20th century temperature record. Despite large differences between models’ feedback strength, they generally reproduce the temperature response well but for different reasons in each model.”
In a member journal of the American Geophysical Union (AGU), Eos, Colin Schultz took a look at the article and did not mince any words:
Climate model’s historical accuracy no guarantee of future success
To validate and rank the abilities of complex general circulation models (GCMs), emphasis has been placed on ensuring that they accurately reproduce the global climate of the past century. But because multiple paths can be taken to produce a given result, a model may get the right result but for the wrong reasons.”
Sobriety in the meantime has also spread over to IPCC-friendly blogs. On April 15, 2013, in a guest post at Real Climate Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Francisco Doblas-Reyes, Sybren Drijfhout and Ed Hawkins made it clear that the models used in the 5th IPCC report were completely inadequate for regional climate prognoses:
To conclude, climate models can and have been verified against observations in a property that is most important for many users: the regional trends. This verification shows that many large-scale features of climate change are being simulated correctly, but smaller-scale observed trends are in the tails of the ensemble more often than predicted by chance fluctuations. The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble can therefore not be used as a probability forecast for future climate. We have to present the useful climate information in climate model ensembles in other ways until these problems have been resolved.”
Also Christensen and Boberg (2012) were critical about the AR5 models in a paper appearing in the Geophysical Research Letters. The scientists presented their main results:
– GCMs suffer from temperature-dependent biases
– This leads to an overestimation of projections of regional temperatures
– We estimate that 10-20% of projected warming is due to model deficiencies”

In January 2013 in the Journal of Climate Matthew Newman reported in an article “An Empirical Benchmark for Decadal Forecasts of Global Surface Temperature Anomalies” on the notable limitations of the models:
These results suggest that current coupled model decadal forecasts may not yet have much skill beyond that captured by multivariate red noise.”
In the prognosis time-frame of multiple decades, they do not perform better than noise. An embarrassment.
Also Frankignoul et al. 2013 expressed serious concerns in the Journal of Climate because of the unimpressive performance of the climate models. They graded the models plainly as “unrealistic” because they did not implement the role of ocean cycles correctly.
In July 2013 Ault et al. looked at a paper in the Geophysical Research Letters and at the models for the tropical Pacific region. They made an awful discovery: Not one of the current models is able to reproduce the climate history of the region during the past 850 years. Excerpts from the abstract:
[…] time series of the model and the reconstruction do not agree with each other. […] These findings imply that the response of the tropical Pacific to future forcings may be even more uncertain than portrayed by state-of-the-art models because there are potentially important sources of century-scale variability that these models do not simulate.”
Also Lienert et al. (2011) found problems with the North Pacific. And in July 2014 in an article in Environmetrics, McKitrick & Vogelsang documented a significant overestimation of the warming in the climate models for the tropical region over the past 60 years.
In March 2014 Steinhaeuser & Tsonis reported in Climate Dynamics on a comparison of 23 different climate models and the extent to which they were able to reproduce temperature, air pressure and precipitation over the 19th and 20th centuries. The surprise was great when the scientists found that the model results deviated widely from each other and were unable to give a correct account of reality. A more detailed discussion is available at The Hockey Schtick.
In a press release from September 17, 2012, scientists of the University of Arizona complained that as a rule climate models failed when looking at periods of three decades and less. Also attempts at prognoses for regional levels were unsuccessful:
UA Climate Scientists put predictions to the test
A new study has found that climate-prediction models are good at predicting long-term climate patterns on a global scale but lose their edge when applied to time frames shorter than three decades and on sub-continental scales.”
In October 2012 Klaus-Eckart Puls at EIKE warned that up to now the temperature prognoses of the climate models have been false for every atmospheric layer:
For some decades now climate models have been projecting trends (“scenarios”) for temperature for different layers of the atmosphere: near surface layer, troposphere, and stratosphere. From the near surface layer all the way to the upper troposphere it was supposed to get warmer according to the AGW hypothesis, and colder in the stratosphere. However meteorological measurements taken from all atmospheric layers show the exact opposite!”
So what is wrong with the models?
For one they still have not found a way to implement the empricially confirmed systematic impact of the ocean cycles into the models. Another problem of course is that the sun is missing in the models as its important impact on climate development continues to be denied. It’s still going to take some time before the sun finally gets a role in the models. But there are growing calls for the taking the sun into account and recognition that something is awry. In August 2014 in the Journal of Atmospheric Sciences a paper by Timothy Cronin appeared. It criticized the treatment of solar irradiance in the models. See more on this at The Hockey Schtick.
The poor prognosis-capability of climate models is giving more and more political leaders cause for concern. Maybe they should not have relied on the model results and developed far-reaching plans to change society. To some extent they have already began to implement these plans. Suddenly the very credibility of the climate protection measures finds itself at stake.
The best would be a moratorium on models. Something needs to be done. It is becoming increasingly clear that the present wild modeling simply cannot continue. It’s time to re-evaluate. The climate models so far are hardly distinguishable from computer games on climate change where one sits comfortably on the couch and shoots as many CO2 molecules out of the atmosphere as he can and then reaps the reward of a free private jet flight with climate activist Leonardo di Caprio.

"About a quarter of the world’s highest-emitting, publicly listed companies fail to report their greenhouse gas emissions and nearly half do not properly consider the risks from the climate crisis in decision-making, new research has found. The findings show the distance even the world’s biggest companies still have to cover to meet the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change, according to the group of investors coordinating the report.  The research covered a sample of 274 of the world’s highest emitting companies which are publicly listed, and therefore must make official disclosures of key financial data. It was carried out by the Grantham Research Institute on climate change at the London School of Economics and commissioned by the Transition Pathway Initiative, a group of investors supportive of the Paris agreement, with about $14tn (£11tn) in funds under management. Of a smaller sample of 160 of the biggest emitters, only one in eight – 20 companies – globally were found to be reducing their emissions at the rate necessary to meet the Paris goal of holding temperature rises to within 2C of pre-industrial levels. Simon Dietz, co-director of the Grantham Institute, said: “It’s over three years since the Paris agreement was signed, and this research shows the corporate sector is improving its climate planning and performance, but not fast enough. Cutting through the noise, we can see that barely 12% of companies plan to reduce emissions at the rate required to keep global warming below 2C.” The researchers examined companies in key sectors including oil and gas, steel and aluminium, utilities, car manufacturing and air transport, which combined account for more than 40% of emissions from public companies around the world. New rules have been introduced in the UK that require big companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions. In many countries they are not required to do so but are encouraged by many stock exchanges and investor groups. The Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosure, backed by the Bank of England, has said such reporting is essential to allow investors to make properly informed decisions about their portfolios. Faith Ward, co-chair of the Transition Pathway Initiative, said investors would be taking note: “This research shows clear leaders and laggards emerging within sectors from airlines to aluminium, and that gives investors an investment-relevant decision to make today. “As the effects of climate change accelerate, we can expect to see more capital flow away from those companies that bury their head in the sand, and towards those companies aligning with a 2C pathway.”"

Germany’s Bun­desnet­za­gen­tur (Federal Network Agency for Electricity, Gas, Telecommunications, Post and Railway) is the federal authority overseeing and regulating the German electrical power grid, among other networks.
At its site it has a link to an expert assessment report that analyzes the needs of and risks to the German power grid for the coming 2014/15 winter.
The name of the report: “Examinations for the winter of 2014/15 with respect to risks for system security and the necessity for reserve power plants”.
The 102-page highly technical assessment examines a variety of scenarios in order to see how well Germany’s electrical power grid will hold up this winter. Looking at the report’s conclusion, one can only conclude that the power grid is more unstable and prone to a collapse than at any time in Germany’s post-war period. It’s a debacle knocking at the door.
In the summary on page 97 for example it writes (link added):
Scenarios were parameterized on the basis of historical data and realistically form expected critical situations, but do not necessarily show the worst-case scenario.
Considered scenarios show massive threats to the security and reliability of the electric power supply system which are not manageable without a substantial intervention by the ÜNB and the use of a secured redispatch-potential.
There are no safety reserves for managing additional critical or unexpected situations.”
On page 98 the report re-emphasizes.

In critical situations a substantial threat to system security is to be feared.”
The report’s summary adds: “Ssecure management of the expected critical situations requires comprehensive measures.”
This all means that on a cold winter day, Germany’s power grid could could very well collapse and citizens be left in the cold and dark for hours or even days. Parts of the report have been blacked out, which is hardly reassuring to the reader.
So why has Germany’s power grid, once one of the world’s most stable, become so vulnerable? An editorial piece at the Financial Times sums it nicely. It writes: “Merkel’s decision to phase out nuclear power has been a huge mistake.”
The FT piece writes that Germany has added a huge amount of intermittent wind and solar energy. Not only does this energy act to destabilize the power grid, but it also is costing German citizens and the economy a bundle. What a bargain: Poor quality for high cost! The FT writes that the Energiewende is “designed to make the economy predominantly dependent on renewable sources such as wind and solar power“, and adds that these are “burdens on households and businesses“, something that “Germany can ill afford”, the FT writes.
What’s worse for clean-energy-minded Germans is that the elimination of nuclear energy has led to an increase in coal burning. In the end, Germany’s power system is now dirtier, more unstable than ever, and now costs consumers far more. Does that sound like a great deal? Sounds to me like a monumental mismanagement.
Those of us living in Germany may want to consider installing a wood-burning stove in the weeks ahead as winter quickly approaches.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Germany protests over a broad range of issues have been heightening.
In Dresden citizens have been turning out by the thousands in “Monday demonstrations” to protest the perceived threat of the Islamification of Europe and the so-called “liar media”, which they no longer trust. Since the Paris attacks by radical Islamic terrorists, the protesters have only become more emboldened.
Citizens are also clearly beginning to feel they are being misled by the “liar media” and politicians regarding wind energy. The glaring difference between what was promised and what is actually being delivered can no longer be ignored. Enough is enough!
Germany’s online SVZ.de writes that the “conflict over wind turbines is escalating” and that “criticism and fears are becoming louder” and that “citizen protest groups are forming at many locations“.
What does it mean? It means that wind and solar power are nothing like they were once cracked up to be. They are poor performers, costly, and are creating a nationwide blight that risks permanently scarring Germany’s once idyllic landscape and natural heritage.
Everything and anything can now be sacrificed at the alter of climate protection. Recently Die Welt published a scathing commentary on the “immensely dangerous power of the eco-cartel“, writing that “totalitarian undercurrents are plainly visible” and that the movement is all about power and money, and less so about environmental protection. Germany’s green movement has been corrupted to the bone.

In the state of Mecklenburg-Pomerania the SVZ.de site writes how an organization called Freier Horizont was established last November and serves as the umbrella for 40 citizens initiatives. “They are protesting against what they see as the uncontrolled expansion of wind energy and speak of horror landscapes.”
Freier Horizont Chairman Norbert Schumacher worries that wind energy will have negative impacts on the region’s coastal tourism. Citizens are concerned that Germany’s cherished Baltic Sea coast will be “blighted” and believe political leaders and wind energy developers are not taking their concerns seriously.
They aren’t, of course. It’s all about money. Even the most self-professed Greens are selling out to the big money of wind energy. For example Die Welt writes of German Green Party honcho Boris Palmer, someone “who grew up protesting the installation of power transmission towers is – no joke – demanding that natural parks and reserves be opened for the 200-meter tall rotating monsters, even if they are located right next World Heritage Sites.”
Greens like Palmer no longer have qualms about that, and so it should not surprise us that they are ready to trample and permanently damage heritage locations – e.g. like the Nazca Lines in Peru. It’s all in the name of the Green Allah: Climate Protection. Green madness has taken over in Germany, but citizens are waking up.

======================================
This September is bringing with it already the first hints of winter for North America with snow predicted to fall over a vast area of the upper western USA, perhaps as far south as Denver, says meteorologist Joe Bastardi at his latest Saturday Summary.
Parts of Europe have already seen their first notes of winter, with snowfalls recorded in Austria, Germany, and Great Britain – read here.
About ten years ago many climatologists, those obsessed with the hypothesis of global warming, were already writing the last will for winter weather in many regions. They were convinced by their computer models and simulations, which foresaw a rapid rise in global warming. But then came the global warming pause, followed by about 8 years of modest global cooling, all accompanied by an unexpected string of nasty winters.
And listening to the latest forecasts for the coming winter, Mother Nature is once again set to defy the warming climate models.
First Joe Bastardi gives us a brief preview of his winter forecast for North America starting at the 11:52 mark of Weatherbell’s latest Saturday Summary.

Chart: Weatherbell Analytics Saturday Summary.
The above chart shows Weatherbell’s projected temperature anomaly for the upcoming winter.

Joe says they had already issued the forecast back in April and bases it on weather patterns already observed in the past. He thinks that the models used by climatologists don’t consider all the factors or underestimate some of them. Today he says their models are now also pointing to a colder and snowier winter for large parts of the US with the likelihood how heavy snows near the northern Southeast.
“Frigid conditions”
The US Farmers Almanac also came out predicting a brutal winter for much of the USA. Managing editor Sandi Duncan says Americans need to prepare for a “shivery and shovelry” winter. “We’re calling for some frigid conditions, bitter conditions,” she said.
The American National Weather Service (NWS) currently is pointing to a normal winter for USA, with warmer than normal temperatures out west, cool in the south, and normal in the east.
Central Europe (Germany) winter forecast
The German language www.wetterprognose-wettervorhersage.de site writes that long-term models point to the September, October and November autumn as too dry but with near normal temperatures.
For winter the site writes:
December will be slightly too warm, January and February for the most part normal temperatures with a tendency for higher precipitation. In other words, this variant points to a slightly warmer than normal, but in some regions a very snowy winter.”
Sounds like a potentially good ski season in the Alps!

"From climate change to child labour, the responsibility for solving major societal problems is increasingly being shifted to the individual. People feel in order to save the world they have to be “good”. Yet that is bad – because it paralyses change. Global challenges must be tackled by institutions. That’s why the UK’s Committee on Climate Change was absolutely right to criticise the government in the strongest terms today for failing to take more action against the climate crisis.  Personal sacrifice alone cannot be the solution to tackling the climate crisis. There’s no other area in which the individual is held so responsible for what’s going wrong. And it’s true: people drive too much, eat too much meat, and fly too often.  But reaching zero emissions requires very fundamental changes. Individual sacrifice alone will not bring us to zero. It can be achieved only by real structural change; by a new industrial revolution. Looking for solutions to the climate crisis in individual responsibilities and actions risks obstructing this. It suggests that all we have to do is pull ourselves together over the next 30 years and save energy, walk, skip holidays abroad, and simply “do without”. But these demands for individual action paralyse people, thereby preventing the large-scale change we so urgently need. We do not just need the 5-10% of the population willing and able to put time, money and effort into change. We need everyone to turn the tide towards sustainability worldwide. There is hope that lies in the fact that we do not have to wait for each individual on Earth to become a better person and save the planet. All we need is to create a consensus within society that we should not destroy our home and demand that governments make this their first priority. Some people argue that this is a cheap and convenient excuse to shift responsibility from the individual to the politicians. But it is neither cheap nor convenient. Each one of us remains individually responsible: to stay informed, to demand something different, and to keep politicians and institutions in check.  We don’t expect individuals to take the lead when it comes to other social and economic challenges, such as unemployment. There is a decades-long economic consensus that unemployment should be kept as low as possible. But you would not ask an individual who warned that unemployment was too high: “so, what action do you personally take in the fight against unemployment?” Because that question is absurd. Unless you are the CEO of a big company, or the mayor of a city, as an individual you have no significant impact on unemployment. The same is true of the climate crisis. What we need is citizens to make adamant demands of their politicians and institutions for more urgent action. Just as no party that pledged to increase rather than reduce unemployment would ever get elected in the UK or any other country, no political party should be allowed to dodge a clear strategy against climate risks. This is a challenge for politics, not for the individual. In a society where environmentally and socially harmful goods and services are often indistinguishable from environmentally friendly or fair products, it’s naive to think that asking the individual to save the world through consumer choice will be effective. And neither is it always the moral thing to do: is it right to demand from an Indian farmer that he cares about climate protection? What about the struggling single mother in London or Berlin with her three children? If we take civil and human rights seriously, we cannot assign solving global problems to the individual. And the call for greater individual responsibility actually risks becoming detrimental to the cause as it prevents people from realising the scale of political change that needs to happen. Instead of seeing the big picture, people are diverted to the fine print on the refrigerator shelf in the supermarket. There has been a trend towards shifting responsibility for societal success from our political institutions to the individual. But it’s only as a society that we can collectively demand our politicians take the action needed to address the climate crisis. • Anders Levermann is a professor at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research"
"Your article (Planting billions of trees ‘best way to save planet’, 5 July) cites Tom Crowther, who led the research, as saying: “Personally, Brazil would be my dream hotspot to get it right – that would be spectacular.” And a dream it will remain until his exciting plan is rooted more firmly in global socioeconomic reality. At the moment, far from replanting cleared land, Brazil is surging ahead with forest devastation on a frightening scale. Just-published official figures show an extraordinary 769 sq km, an area larger than the whole of Middlesex, was felled in June. The destruction of the Amazon forest, which Brazil successfully curbed after 2012, is roaring ahead again. Over 50% more trees were felled in June 2019 than in June 2018.  This is largely because Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, is an unabashed ally of agribusiness and is turning a blind eye to illegal deforestation. He reacted angrily to criticisms of Brazil’s environmental policies made by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron at the recent G20 meeting. Earlier this week, he said he had flown over Europe twice and had not seen “even a square kilometre of forest”, adding: “They have no authority to discuss the environmental issue with us.” But Bolsonaro cannot be blamed for all the problems. The Amazon forest is being cleared so that Brazil can produce more beef and soya to send abroad. Much of the trade is handled by multinationals. This will stop only if there is a major shake-up in the world food system. Consumers worldwide must stop eating food that is causing forest devastation. Brazil’s thousands of indigenous and peasant communities have profound knowledge of the forest and would like nothing more than the power to protect it and replant devastated areas. But at the moment they are still being dispossessed. The first step in realising Crowther’s dream is to put an end to their expropriation.Sue BranfordClun, Shropshire • Before we get too excited by this study, ponder the caution by its leader that it will take 50-100 years to have full effect – and reflect that the International Panel on Climate Change “warns that we have only 11 years to halve global emissions to meet their 1.5C target” (Letters, 28 June). Peter GreavesLondon • Tree planting may have “mind-blowing” potential to tackle the climate crisis. However, the climate crisis is just one symptom of our continued destruction of the planet. The climate crisis has barely got going, but we are already in the midst of an extinction crisis that could soon rival that of the Cretaceous, when the dinosaurs became extinct. Today, we are losing species at a mass extinction rate, and at this point it’s nothing to do with climate. Planting billions of trees will accelerate the extinction crisis, since closed canopy forest is not the natural state of most areas of continents. During the ice ages, and the intervening interglacials that dissected them, areas that we regard as natural forest today weren’t closed canopy, but instead were savannah or steppe, habitats that also absorb and store a great deal of carbon. Covering these areas with closed canopy forest will reduce biodiversity and condemn many species to extinction – species that still survive in the remaining fragments of these habitats, or in the farmland that we have replaced them with. Planting billions of trees may be one way of solving the problem, but will create more. Perhaps we can just produce less carbon in the first place. We have the technology, and we know how to make it work.Martin DohrnBristol • Your article reinforces the idea that the only way to get a tree or forest is to plant it. Creating woods in the way promoted by Defra grants and the Woodland Trust results in serried ranks of trees in plastic tubes that are often left long after they should be removed. Planting saplings grown abroad is almost certainly how ash dieback came to Britain. Any piece of land, anywhere in the world below the tree-line, left alone without any human interference or expense, will undergo a natural growth via scrub to a fully mature forest of properly native trees. As it does so, it will be taking lots of CO2 out of the atmosphere. Whether the new forest is planted or natural, when it is mature it no longer has any good effect on CO2 levels: the rotting dead leaves and fallen trees release exactly the same amount of CO2 as the trees take in by photosynthesis. To make a mature forest a contributor to CO2 reduction you need to cut down the mature trees and use the wood for building (or burn it to replace fossil fuels). Then let the felled forest regrow.Dr David CorkeDirector, Organic Countryside CIC • I have been concerned about deforestation since I was a teenager.

Photo: Benny Peiser, Lord Lawson (GWPF)
Five years after its inauguration in 2009, the London-based Global Warming Policy Foundation has announced the launch of its new campaigning arm, the Global Warming Policy Forum.
The new organisation will be able to conduct campaigns and activities which do not fall squarely within the Foundation’s remit as an educational charity. This arrangement reflects those used by other organisations with dual structures, such as Amnesty International UK and Greenpeace UK.
The Global Warming Policy Foundation’s news and opinion pieces will henceforth be covered by the new website of the Global Warming Policy Forum, as will the CCNet newsletter, founded and edited by Dr Benny Peiser since 1997.
Trust and credibility in the eyes of the public
The Global Warming Policy Foundation calls itself an all-party and non-party think tank which is open-minded on the contested science of global warming and says it is deeply concerned about the costs and other implications of many of the policies currently being advocated. Its key to success is the trust and credibility that we have earned in the eyes of a growing number of policy makers, journalists and the interested public.
Members include renowned climate scientists
Its academic advisory council includes renowned scientists from all over the world, including Richard Lindzen, Ross McKitrick, Nir Shaviv, Robert Carter and Henrik Svensmark.

Public has lost trust in climate science
The GWPF site states that this is of great relevance today in light of scientific scandals and the public’s loss of trust in climate activists and politicians. “For us, public trust is our most important asset. It has been accumulated as a result of the reasoned and moderate positions we have taken, the integrity of our foundation and the credibility of our actions.”
Along with the newly founded campaigning forum, the Foundation will continue to advance its charitable objects by commissioning and publishing reports and papers and by organising lectures and debates on key matters relating to climate science and policy. “While the Foundation will continue to publish our reports and videos, the Forum will campaign in a way that will make our work even more effective,” said Dr Peiser, the Director of both arms of the GWPF.
To shape future evolution of climate science
Lord Lawson, the chairman of both GWPF arms said: “This reorganisation will enable us to build on the progress of the past five years and make substantial further progress over the next five – years which may well be decisive in the evolution of climate change policy.”
The new campaigning organisation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Global Warming Policy Foundation. In recent years, the GWPF’s influence has grown rapidly, among both UK and international policy makers and the news media and is widely regarded as one of the world’s leading think tanks on global warming policy issues.
Independent, no funding from energy companies
The GWPF writes that it is funded overwhelmingly by voluntary donations from a number of private individuals and charitable trusts. In order to make clear its complete independence, it does not accept gifts from either energy companies or anyone with a significant interest in an energy company.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is the press release by GEOMAR on the very recent Muscheler et al paper showing the sun’s profound impact on northern hemispheric climate. Other sites touched on this paper, here and here.

Now I’ve translated the entire GEOMAR press release from the German. The results of the study are impressive:
=================================
The sun controlled climate during the ice age
Irregularities in solar activity impacted the climate 20,000 years ago.
04 Sept 2014/Kiel. In a model study, climate scientists of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel reconstructed the relationship between solar activity and climate during the last ice age. With their climate-chemical model, they were able to make a considerable contribution to a study by the Swedish Lund University published in the international journal Nature Geoscience.
A known pattern of behavior of the sun is its irregular solar activity. The most well-known activity cycle is the 11-year sunspot cycle where every 11 years there is a switch between sunspot maximum and sunspot minimum. There are also other known fluctuations of other timescales. Sunspots are places on the sun’s surface that appear to be darker because the solar radiation is emitted into the universe with reduced strength. At the same time high energy radiation, foremost in the UV range, leaves the sun. During a sunspot minimum there are fewer sunspots and thus less energy-intensive radiation reaching the earth. When sunspots reach maximum activity, precisely the opposite is true.
More solar radiation, particularly in the UV range, during a sunspot maximum leads to a warming of the stratosphere (between 15 – 50 km) in the tropics and lead to an increased ozone production. Through complicated interactive mechanisms this in turn leads to atmospheric circulation changes which are perceived at the earth’s surface. The mechanisms on how changes in solar activity impact the atmosphere are still the subject of ongoing research. There is especially much speculation on the relationship between large sunspot minima and cold, snowy winters or on whether the current low sunspot activity might be responsible for the pause in global warming.
Scientists of Lund University (Sweden), in cooperation with GEOMAR climate scientists Prof. Dr. Katja Matthes and Dr. Rémi Thiéblemont, have succeeded in reconstructing solar activity back in the last ice age. The study was published in August in the international journal of Nature Geoscience.

Ice cores from Greenland were used to get information on solar activity for that period, a time when Sweden and North Germany were under a thick sheet of ice. The evaluation principle works in a similar manner as with tree-rings: The ice cores contain many layers from which information on temperature and precipitation conditions can be derived. The radioactive, cosmic molecules of beryllium and carbon play an important role here. Namely they are created in the atmosphere when the solar magmatic field around the earth is weak and thus allow lots of cosmic radiation to come through. When the ice core contains lots of radioactive beryllium and carbon, it means there was a weak protective shield, and so indicates weak solar activity.
A combined analysis of ice cores and dripstones allowed the scientists of Lund University to reconstruct solar activity until the end of the last ice age. It shows that the 11-year sunspot cycle also existed at the time, displaying a typical pattern of solar activity. “First of all we have succeeded in producing a high resolution record of solar activity,” says Prof. Matthes. “With our climate model, which transfers the solar signal from the stratosphere to the earth’s surface more accurately than other models, we were able to reconstruct typical atmospheric circulation patterns for a solar minimum, thus enabling us to infer possible temperature and precipitation patterns over Greenland that correspond very closely to the conditions at the end of the last ice age. The agreement is impressive and allows us to suspect that the mechanism for influence on climate by solar activity back then and today function very similarly.”
The results confirm the evidence from other studies showing years with low solar activity are associated with harsh winters over the Northern Hemisphere. One example are the strong winter outbreaks connected with snowfall and storms, as experienced in 2008 and 2010 in North Europe and North America. During these years we found ourselves in a sunspot minima.
“The effect of solar activity on regional climate fluctuations is very revealing. Estimations of future solar activity could lead to more precise climate forecasts over the next deacades,” explains Prof. Matthes.

"This week we learned that there has been a “precipitous” fall in Antarctic sea ice since 2014. That won’t increase sea levels, but it’s still bad because white ice reflects more of the sun’s heat back away from Earth than dark water. As the ice melts, more heat will be absorbed, which will melt more ice. This vicious feedback is known as the “albedo effect”. The term comes from the Latin albus, meaning white, from which we also get “albino” and “album” (which in ancient Rome could mean a blank tablet). In English it is first recorded, meaning “pure whiteness”, in a letter by the astronomer royal John Flamsteed, complaining about Isaac Newton’s Optics: “He calls the colour of that representation of the sun which is made by the collection of his rays … whiteness … but ’tis far from albedo.”  From then on “albedo” could be used medically (for an unusual whiteness of bodily fluids) or botanically (a fruit’s pith). The modern astronomical use dates from 1860, and denotes the reflectivity of a planet or other object in space. Some experts suggest that we could nudge Earth’s albedo back up again by painting all roofs white, which has to be worth a try."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) presents a detailed analysis on the IPCC’s recently published final 40-page Synthesis Report released earlier this month.

Image source: IPCC
EIKE, however, concludes that the IPCC report is fraught with error and distortion. Author Klaus-Eckart Puls writes:
Not only does it contain major contradictions, simplifications and even falsehoods with respect to the earlier comprehensive partial reports, it is a stark contraction to almost every measurement and trend in nature. This is being noticed by event the alarmist tending media [3] : ‘Indeed while the previous climate reports [The 3 comprehensive reports of 2013/14] for the most part provided the science and the contradictions, the new Synthesis report suppresses most of the scientific findings.'”

Puls then provides a list contradictions, falsehoods and distortions stemming from the new Synthesis Report, all of which are refuted by measurements and facts which Puls provides:
1. air temperature
2. sea level rise
3. ocean temperature
4. storms
5. polar ice
6. extreme weather
7. crop yields
8. species extinctions
9. man is responsible
Puls summarizes (reiterating some of what he wrote in his introduction:
In the 40-page Summary for Policymakers [1] published in early November, the IPCC in large part contradicts the depictions and data in its own(!) comprehensive reports (several thousand pages) it released at the end of 2013 and early 2014. The summery-statements stand also in crass contradiction to almost every trend-measurement found in nature over the past 150 years.
For example the online SPIEGEL [3] writes: ‘Final IPCC Report: At the Intergovernmental Panel on climate Change, Alarmism Comes before Accuracy’ … ‘The document is supposed to rationally inform on the science – instead it suppresses the central contradictions.’ … ‘Indeed while the previous climate reports [The 3 comprehensive reports of 2013/14] for the most part provided the science and the contradictions, the new Synthesis Report suppresses most of the scientific findings’.”
Thanks – that suffices!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski here looks at the new paper “Climate change in the Fertile Crescent and implications of the recent Syrian drought,” PNAS, March 2, 2015 by Kelley et al, which claims the 2007−2010 drought contributed to the war in the region.
A number of major news outlets, such as the New York Times and the AP were quick to uncritically dispense it as gospel truth.
Anthony Watts provides good background here.
Spiegel’s view is much more critical and skeptical of the paper’s findings and overall methodology when compared to the New York Times or AP. The online German magazine writes:
An alarming study has created a commotion worldwide. The authors claim that climate change contributed to the drought and civil war in Syria. However this claim is hardly tenable.”
Models in wide disagreement
Bojanowski writes that the decisive evidence in the paper is based on climate models, which show drier conditions for Syria as the greenhouse effect intensifies. However Bojanowski later points out that the climate system in Syria is highly complex and that even the IPCC questions the capability of models reliably simulating the climate system of Syria and that the models are in wide disagreement:
The region lies on the boundary of three climate regions where the weather patterns are hardly understood, the IPCC report says. Foremost the climate simulation models diverge widely from each other when it comes to precipitation. It thus appears unwarranted to use the results of models as a way of confirming the effect of greenhouse gases, believes [William]Briggs.”
Sparse data
Another problem with the study, Spiegel reports, is that the data used were way too sparse, and quoted climate scientist Tim Brücher of the Max Planck Institute for Meterology: “The data should have been handled more critically.”
“Renders a poor service on behalf of climate science”

Probably seeing the paper more as an embarrassment rather than a contribution to science, even warmist institutes were unable to refrain from critique. Bojanowski quotes Thomas Bernauer, a conflict researcher at ETH in Zürich: “The entire paper is problematic as it renders a poor service on behalf of climate science.”
“Study is problematic at a number of levels”
In total Bojanowski says scientists criticize the paper on five aspects, saying that after the criticism, nothing is really left of the paper. According to Spiegel, University of Hamburg expert Tobias Ide says, “The study is problematic at a number of levels.” Peace scientist Christiane Fröhlich of the same university says the civil war “had more to do with wealthy citizens provoking it“.
“A distraction” from the real causes
Francesca De Châtel, Syria expert at Radboud University in Nijmegen, called the paper “a distraction” from the real causes of the war, and pointed out that drought periods are more the norm for the region. The problems stem foremost from land mismanagement and shoddy agricultural practices. Bojanowski quotes De Châtel: “The role of climate change is not only irrelevant, emphasizing it is even damaging.”
No evidence linking drought to civil war
Also Norwegian doctoral candidate Ole Magnus Theisen states that there is no evidence of a relationship between drought and conflict, Spiegel writes.
Bojanowski adds that “the climate argument allows politicians to blame others outside of the country for the hunger.” The Spiegel journalist sums up the science of tying climate change to war in general:
The main causes of civil wars are political. The future security of Africa does not depend on climate, rather on political and economic development.”
In summary one would not be wrong in concluding that the PNAS was definitely asleep during the review of the paper. Hard to get any shoddier.

"A group of wealthy US philanthropists and investors have donated almost half a million pounds to support the grassroots movement Extinction Rebellion and school strike groups – with the promise of tens of millions more in the months ahead. Trevor Neilson, an investor and philanthropist who has worked with some of the world’s richest families, has teamed up with Rory Kennedy – daughter of Robert Kennedy – and Aileen Getty, whose family wealth comes from the oil industry, to launch the Climate Emergency Fund.  Neilson, who has worked with figures such as Bill Gates and Richard Branson, said the fund was inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protesters in the UK in April. Neilson said the three founders were using their contacts among the global mega-rich to get “a hundred times” more in the weeks and months ahead. “This might be the single best chance we have to stop the greatest emergency we have ever faced,” he told the Guardian. The new fund has the author and environmentalist Bill McKibben, who set up 350.org, and David Wallace Wells, who wrote international best seller Uninhabitable Earth, on its advisory board. The money will initially be used to support school strike and Extinction Rebellion groups in the US, but will also be available to help “seed” similar groups around the world. It offers tiers of funding to support different-sized groups, from teenage activists wanting money for leaflets and megaphones, to funding for salaries and offices for established groups in big cities. It has already committed some of the fund to support Extinction Rebellion groups in New York and Los Angeles. Neilson, who co-founded investment company IX investments, said although he had been a longtime backer of environmental projects, it was only when he was forced to flee his house in California last year during a wildfire that he realised that radical action was needed. “Something about throwing my two-year-old and wife in the car and evacuating from the worst fire in the history of southern California brought the issue into a new type of focus,” he said. He said the new fund would back non-violent legal action.“It will provide resources to grassroots activists who seek to disrupt in a non-violent way [and] to demand that governments declare a climate emergency and put in place policies to address this crisis.” He said that most “of the world’s biggest philanthropists are still in a gradualist mindset”, adding: “We do not have time for gradualism.” “History shows us that change comes from the people. It is grassroots movements throughout history that force governments to act when government is resistant.” A spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion welcomed the move, saying: “It’s a signal that we are coming to a tipping point. In the past, philanthropy has often been about personal interest, but now people are realising that we are all in this together and putting their money forward for our collective wellbeing.” "

Last week big Obamacare booster and anti-CO2 activist George Clooney took his private jet all the way from Las Angeles across the US, Canada, and the Atlantic, before finally landing in Germany…to seek medical help for his chronic back problems. Apparently Obamacare and America’s best physicians are unable to take care of it.
Much of the German media have been reporting on Mr. Clooney’s visit to a clinic in Solingen last Friday, see video here.
Spiegel writes:
The actor had himself examined last Friday by the Neurosurgery Department of the Städtischen Klinikums Solingen, so confirmed clinic director Hermann-Josef Bökmann, according to the DPA news agency.”
I guess Obamacare and the US medical system aren’t good enough for the ailing actor.

And how does the environmentally conscious Clooney justify burning tonnes of jet fuel and spewing greenhouse gases directly into upper troposphere (where it supposedly really hurts the climate)? Well damn it, my back hurts! And Obamacare is for the simple folks, anyway. 
The media also report that this month Clooney will be taking his jet to Italy to get married. For that event Hollywood stars Ben Affleck, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon will also be flying in on private jet(s), also spewing more tonnes of greenhouse gas into the upper troposphere on the carbon account of Mr. Clooney.
Spiegel writes here that last Friday’s examination took “several hours” and looked into his chronic back problems/pain stemming from an accident he suffered while filming “Syriana“. Spiegel also adds Clooney had admitted to alcohol problems, and taking pain-killers to keep the back pain bearable.
Searching for that 1 non-consensus doctor? 
So why did he really fly by private jet all the way to Europe for private care? I’d guess he’s decided not to take the advice of 99% of the doctors at home, who have likely advised him that the needed treatment is (risky) back surgery involving who knows what.
This is not really the kind of medicine anyone likes to swallow, especially when you know the treatment could seriously alter lifestyle. Yet, let’s recall how Clooney once spoke to the public on following doctors’ advice and that of activist climate scientists:
If you have 99 percent of doctors who tell you ‘you are sick’ and 1 percent that says ‘you’re fine,’ you probably want to hang out with, check it up for the 99. You know what I mean?”
Obviously George is searching the corners of the globe, in his private jet, for that 1 doctor who doesn’t agree with the other 99, climate protection and medical consensus be damned. Do as I say, not as I do. Skepticism for me, but not for you.

Zurich Insurance Group shuts down climate office that was opened in 2008

By Sebastian Lüning, Fritz Vahrenholt
The Zurich Insurance Group is closing the climate office it had opened in 2008, a Zurich spokeswoman confirmed to E&E Publishing. Over the past several weeks and months Zurich Office Director Lindene Patton had been actively promoting the idea of the climate catastrophe to the US Senate. Patton had also co-wrote the US National Climate Assessment, which flopped completely thanks to the alarmist tendencies of her colleagues.
Apparently the Zurich has slammed on the brakes because the lobbying efforts closely tied to the IPCC are no longer getting acceptance from the public and parts of US politics. In general the insurance business is suspected of using extreme weather warnings to peddle their products to customers and to justify high premiums.

The following is an excerpt of an article by Evan Lehmann of the E&E News Platform dated 27 June 2014 on the closure of the Zurich climate change office:
Leading insurer to close its climate change office, leaving the industry ‘mute’
Zurich Insurance Group is closing its U.S. climate change office six years after opening it to help persuade companies to press public officials for solutions to climbing disaster losses, according to several sources. The move seems likely to end a high-profile advocacy effort that exposed federal lawmakers to the financial concerns of a major insurer regarding rising temperatures. Some observers also say the closure stands to lessen an industry voice that might resonate with Republicans in a debate that’s often characterized as driven by Democratic ideology. Zurich’s decision comes amid a flush of visibility for the office and its director, Lindene Patton, who in recent months helped write the National Climate Assessment, testified before a Senate panel and spoke at the White House. In some circles, that has distinguished Patton as an unusually credible advocate for climate action who speaks from the suit-and-trouser world of the financial sector, where crunching numbers outpaces environmental ideology. One observer described her as a “dynamo.” […] 
When Zurich announced its ‘climate initiative’ six years ago, it was an effort, in part, to rally other members of the massive industry to get involved in shaping public policy. It warned of worsening climate risks that foretold of more than just sharpening damage from floods and storms: The industry also faces increased pressure from regulators and, in the eyes of customers, reputational risk if it doesn’t act, the company said. […] ‘The internal meaning could be that they don’t want to stick their neck out, that they want to be less visible with regard to climate change in general,’ said Walter Stahel, director of risk management research at the Geneva Association, a Swiss think tank funded by the insurance industry. ‘And they want to break it down into much more concrete [efforts] to impose adaptation measures.’ […] A Zurich spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that the climate office is being closed.”

What is especially tragic about the whole nonsense is that the paper only serves to shift the focus away from the real causes behind the worsening tragedy in the Syrian region.
A couple of days ago I wrote about a Spiegel piece that shredded the paper and exposed it as very shoddy work of science.
At Twitter the author of the Spiegel piece, Axel Bojanowski, got a reply from another rather high caliber German journalist, Gabor Paal, who confirms that the situation in Syria has much less to do with climate change, and much more to do with lousy land-use and agricultural practices.

@Axel_Bojanowski I was in Syria in 2008. Scientists acquired funding with reference to ‘climate change’. Land-use was clearly the bigger problem.”

So what we have here is yet another journalist casting grave doubt on the claims made by Kelley et al.
Paal provided the link to a 2008 radio documentary on Syria he had produced with the focus on the crop failures that the Middle Eastern country had been experiencing and their causes. The radio documentary was featured at SWF South German Broadcasting. Throughout the documentary the emphasis on the reasons for the crop problems in Syria was squarely on land-use and poor agricultural practices, with climate change not playing any real role.
The documentary begins by explaining how Syria is divided into 5 different climate zones. In Zone 5, the largest and most arid, groundwater has been pumped out to such an extent that vegetation can no longer thrive. At the 10-minute mark:
More than half the country belongs to Zone 5, the steppes and desert region. Here it rains less than 200 mm per year. Zone 5 is government property. There are no privets lots. Agriculture would be possible here only with irrigation, but the water table has dropped so much that the steppes have become so barren that the government has forbidden all use. The blame for this is not climate change, but rather the way the land is managed.”
The documentary explains how 75% of all farmers raise sheep to earn a living, and that millions of sheep are living where less than 150 mm of rain falls yearly. Vegetation has no chance. “15 – 20% of the steppes are lost and maybe we cannot recover them.” The documentary adds that there are 15 million sheep in Syria and that the figure is 4 times more than 10 years ago.
“Media fixated on climate”
Another problem the region faced, Paal said, was the threat of the UG 99 fungus that threatened the region’s grain crop.
At the very end of the SWR report Paal stated:
In the public media reporting, agricultural research has not made any progress. The media are fixated on climate and the focus on the ground beneath their feet has been lost. And now in the wake of the food crisis, international agricultural reseach has the chance to benefit once again.”
Today, some 7 years later, Kelley et al tells us that this has not come to pass – tragically. The focus still remains on the bogus problem of climate change and people are suffering more unimaginable misery than ever because of it.
Someone needs to go to jail.

"Oregon politics has been thrown into chaos for more than a week after Republican legislators fled the state and took refuge in neighboring Idaho. As police were ordered to bring them home, rightwing militia groups vowed to defend them, raising the prospect of violent confrontation.  The issue that sparked the disorder in the Pacific Northwest state: climate crisis. The Republican senators were responding to an incremental, market-based, cap-and-trade plan aimed at curbing climate crisis. But, when faced with the climate bill, Republicans pulled their senators out of the state, and denied the Senate a quorum. Earlier in the session, they did the same thing when faced with a bill raising taxes for education, and Democrats broke the deadlock by abandoning bills intended to limit exemptions to vaccination and introduce gun control measures. But this time, Democrats looked set to call their bluff, triggering a sometimes shocking escalation in rhetoric as police were asked to bring the fleeing senators to heel. Senator Brian Boquist – a former special forces officer and the owner of a business that reportedly deployed “paramilitary force” in overseas conflicts – hinted he would violently resist arrest. Boquist told reporters: “Send bachelors and come heavily armed. I’m not going to be a political prisoner in the state of Oregon. It’s just that simple.” Faced with the effort to stop the climate crisis bill, several armed rightwing groups said they would defend them. On Thursday, a convoy of logging trucks blocked the streets of the state capital, Salem, while hundreds of protesters – some sporting the insignia of patriot movement groups – demonstrated outside the state house against the climate crisis bill, despite the fact it was no longer even on the table. Having killed the climate crisis bill, the Republican senators said they would return to their jobs on Saturday. “Our mission was to kill cap-and-trade,” said senator Herman Baertschiger “And that’s what we did.” Nine of the 12 minority Republicans duly returned on Saturday. Rightwing patriot movement groups have, along with many Republicans, long expressed disbelief in human-induced global heating, and have sometimes embraced conspiracy-minded beliefs about environmental measures. The so-called “Agenda 21” conspiracy theory – which holds that there is a UN-driven plot to undermine US sovereignty, and exert “full spectrum dominance” over a submissive population – is heavily discussed on the websites of groups such as the Oath Keepers. Some observers also saw the protest as evidence of a widening divide that exists in Oregon, and other western states, between urban liberals and rural conservatives – a miniature version of the national split between red states and blue. But it also pointed to the mainstreaming of patriot movement groups as a part of Oregon’s conservative coalition. This has led to accusations by many that the local Republican party has become dangerously extreme and even courts “an armed wing”. Joe Lowndes, a political scientist at the University of Oregon who researches rightwing politics, said: “If the Oregon Republican party were a European political party it would be an authoritarian far-right party. It really has that character, that extraordinary truculence,” he said. During the standoff over climate crisis, Lowndes said, Republicans “were essentially gloating about having an armed wing of the party. That’s when you cut into the structure of constitutional democracy”. He says that climate crisis politics represents a “sweet spot” for Republicans in Oregon. “There’s a distinct way that Republicans can use rightwing populism around that issue, bringing in farmers and loggers while you’re doing the work of wealthy interests,” Lowndes said. Senate Republicans did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The situation has led some to warn that conservatives elsewhere in the US may be similarly obstructive in the difficult but urgent efforts to address the climate crisis and may seek to adopt similar tactics. “Unlike Vegas, what happens in Oregon doesn’t stay in Oregon,” said Eric Ward, executive director of the Western States Center, a progressive nonprofit. He added: “It should be a warning and a wake up call to the rest of the nation that, even when a governance system exists, even if you have a supermajority, that democratic practice itself is still vulnerable to being undermined, and that’s what we’re seeing.” Citing the presence of often-armed patriot movement groups, and the unwillingness of Republicans to draw “a clear moral line” around such groups, Ward said: “If we were in Afghanistan, if we were in Iraq, if we were in Sudan, if we were in the former Yugoslavia, and this was taking place, we would call it a political crisis, and we would call it a threat to democratic practice.” Others have observed an emerging nationwide pattern among conservatives of stretching or disregarding the norms that have previously helped political systems to function. Joseph Fishkin, a law professor at the University of Texas, co-wrote an article on the practice of “constitutional hardball” whereby such groups take extreme actions to violate previously existing norms. “This would be an example of the kind of escalation that qualifies as constitutional hardball,” he said. A spokesperson for the senate Democrats admitted: “We are in uncharted territory, but we are taking a long-term view and will not be deterred from passing significant climate action legislation,” adding that Democrats may change quorum rules to prevent future deadlocks. Such a long-term view may be at odds with the pressing nature of the climate crisis – and the current political crisis in the state. Ward was adamant that Democrats needed to do more. “Our leaders need to actually stand up and lead and not cower, not appear to be hiding. Representative democracy is worth fighting for. Having resilient and sustainable communities is worth fighting for,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUpdate 01/09/2014 19:18 CET: The opinion poll presented at the Plenum link below just seems to be too wrong. To me it appears to be a national poll, and not of Saxony. The Plenum story does not specify exactly the region the poll was taken.
====================================
Germany’s version of the UKIP Party in the UK is the so-called Alternativ für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany), or AfD Party.
The AfD party has been very critical of euro, green-energies, and mega bailouts. Some its members have expressed doubts on climate science. Disenchanted voters view the AfD as the alternative to what they see as entrenched arrogance that has long pervaded over the other established parties; CDU, SPD, Greens, Links (Communist), and FDP.
Yesterday state elections were held in the German eastern state of Saxony with results showing the AfD party taking in 10% of the vote. The unexpectedly high result for the AfD took many pollsters by surprise.
Final result:
CDU (conservatives) 39.4%
SPD (socialists): 12.4%
Links (communists): 18.9%
Greens: 5.7%
AfD (alternative): 9.7%
Just a week before yesterday’s election, some opinion surveys by polling institutes were showing the AfD struggling to reach the 5% hurdle, which is necessary for a party to take seats in parliament.

For example on August 20 a survey commissioned by Stern-RTL showed the AfD barely at the critical 5% mark, the SPD social democrats all the way at 24%, and the German environmentalist Greens even at 10%. The Plenum site actually does not specify exactly the region the poll was taken – only mentioning that it was done in the run-up to the Saxony election. The figures seem to reflect the national sentiment.
The online Fulda info here presents the results of a national survey by renowned polling institute Emnid conducted about 10 days ago, commissioned by flagship daily Bild am Sonntag. It showed the AfD as a marginal party at only 4%!
Needless to say, the media reaction was one of shock and awe, and indicates that both the established parties and media do not have their finger on the pulse of public sentiment. The opinion survey seem to more reflect the wishes of the establishment, and not the reality.
Repeated, widespread campaigns had been launched by the established parties and the media in attempt to portray the critical AfD as a fringe, right-wing party. The 10% result shows, however, that the attempts failed and that the AfD voters think very little of the shenanigans.
In the Saxony elections the newly minted AfD soared past a number of parties and picked up 10% of the vote, surprising pollsters and the sending a sharp signal to the established parties that the days of political consensus on major issues such as the euro, the role of the EU, mega-bailouts, and renewable energy may be coming to an end.
With war breaking out to the east and south of Europe, the European economy struggling, energy prices spiraling out of control, citizens are demanding that their wishes be taken seriously.

Share this...FacebookTwitterVery recently the Australian Meteorological Institute issued a bulletin advising that the chance of an El Niño in 2014 had “clearly eased“. And if one were to occur, it was “increasingly unlikely to be a strong event“.

Like this year’s El Niño itself, reliable prediction method remains elusive as ever. Graphic: NOAA. 
This of course all flies in the face of multiple recent warnings of a “super El Niño ” being in the works and set to push global temperatures to a new all-time record highs – all coming from leading institutes and experts. Once again these forecasts are turning out to be completely wrong.
“Efficient 12 month forecasting scheme”
That the experts are all wrong should be quite surprising because not long ago a team of scientists led by Josef Ludescher, which included climate pope Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber of the renowned Potsdam Institute, published a paper titled: Improved El Niño forecasting by cooperativity detection“, which purported the ability of predicting El Niño events up to one year in advance with high certainty.
The authors announced that they had “developed an approach based on network analysis, which allows projection of an El Niño event about 1 y ahead“, and claiming they can “develop an efficient 12-mo forecasting scheme” and “achieve some doubling of the early-warning period”.  Moreover they added:
Our method is based on high-quality observational data available since 1950 and yields hit rates above 0.5, whereas false-alarm rates are below 0.1.”
Today we know that the probability of the heavily ballyhooed super El Niño occurring this fall has been evaporating rapidly. What happened? In climate science it often seems that the “0.1 chance” of something not happening in reality occurs 90 percent of the time.
The very same authors followed with another paper earlier this year appearing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences titled: “Very early warning of next El Niño“. The abstract this time stated that already in September 2013 they had been forecasting “the return of El Niño in late 2014 with a 3-in-4 likelihood”.
At the online Austrian news agency pressetext.at here, lead author Ludescher is even quoted saying:
Compared to the previous approaches, our methods offer very clear advantages: Firstly we reach a very high rate of accuracy and secondly prognoses can be made for a time period of up to one complete year.”

Note how the author had been quite convinced by the new “unique avenue” for predicting El Niño events well in advance.
But now that this year’s projected El Nino is failing to show up, maybe the scientists had indeed been a little too optimistic with their one-year forecast.
Even the 2-month forecasts are failing!
Maybe a forecast a whole year in advance is asking for too much. But surely the new Ludescher method at least should yield much better results for the much shorter 2-month forecast. After all, if it’s 76% accurate one year in advance, it really ought to be 90% or better for a measly 2 months ahead. Here as well it’s turning out that climate scientists are unable to get the El Niño forecast correct for just 2 months in advance, never mind an entire year! At his KlimaLounge blog, for example, Stefan Rahmstorf wrote here in May warning that a powerful El Niño was on the march, and used a graphical animation to “impressively show” the development. Today that “powerful El Niño” also is no longer in any discussion.
So even the 2-month forecasts are unreliable. Scientists are baffled once again.
Also a look back at Real Climate here is worth a read: They wrote that this year’s El Niño had only a “2 in 10 chance” of fizzling.
El Niño to send “world climate off the rails”
Back in May, citing experts at NOAA, the Climate Prediction Center (CDC) and the International Research Institute (IRI) for Climate and Society, German online Die Welt here wrote: “The world climate could go off the rails over the coming months” and that the probability of an El Niño occurring in fall and winter were 80%.
To his credit, Die Welt journalist Joachim Müller-Jung added that we’ve heard such predictions before:
Also in 2012 they calculated that there was a more than 70 percent chance an El Niño would occur. The anomaly fizzled with hardly a murmur or fanfare.”
Again, in climate science the improbable has a way of occurring far more more often than not. Many scientists are merely shooting in the dark. Clearly there is still a lot they still do not understand at all about the climate.

"BP’s chief executive, Bob Dudley, has branded the UK backlash against the oil company’s arts sponsorship the “oddest approach” in the climate debate. The oil boss spoke out against the mounting opposition to its arts funding after high-profile protests targeted its support for the Royal Shakespeare Company, the British Museum and the National Portrait Awards.  He told a Chatham House event that the recent spate of protests is “very curious” and “just feels odd” when there is “overwhelming feedback” in support of its arts funding. “The rest of the world finds this the oddest approach,” he added. In response Culture Unstrained, a campaign group hoping to end oil sponsorship in the arts, said Dudley’s comments “seem out of touch with reality” given the high-profile and widespread opposition to BP’s sponsorship across the cultural sector in recent weeks. Actor Sir Mark Rylance resigned from the Royal Shakespeare Company last month, saying that BP’s sponsorship deal allowed the company to “obscure the destructive reality of its activities” on the environment. A judge and several leading artists also wrote to the director of the National Portrait Gallery on the eve of its annual awards last month calling for an end to its long-standing links to the company. In February, hundreds of people occupied the British Museum to object to its relationship with BP. The museum’s director, Hartwig Fischer, has since rejected calls to drop its sponsorship deal with BP, and publicly endorsed the funding. Dudley acknowledged that climate demonstrators’ anger over progress by the energy industry towards a lower carbon future is escalating. “Tensions are running high and we recognise there are real concerns being expressed – about BP, and about the energy sector more broadly,” he said. BP’s London headquarters were brought to a standstill after Greenpeace blockaded the company’s entrance in early May, before climate protesters struck again at the company’s annual general meeting later in the same month. In June Greenpeace activists scaled an oil rig as it was being towed to one of BP’s North Sea projects. “All this might suggest that the demonstrators’ view of the future is worlds apart from BP’s. The frustration from my side is that we agree on much more than people realise. Like our critics, BP believes the world is not on a sustainable path,” he said. “In order to progress we have to talk constructively. Not broadcast our opinions at each other but really talk. That means taking the time to listen, understand each other’s perspective and then work together to find the solutions. And fast,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany readers and myself have become quite dismayed by the Vatican’s new position on the junk climate science-based, anti-humanity movement against fossil fuels.
Interestingly today I read a report in the Catholic Herald here where it is clearly miffed by how Britain’s UKIP party “now commands the support of an estimated one in six Catholics” and is “causing increasing alarm among Church leaders.” My, how could that be!
Well, we all understand that things move glacially slow at the Vatican, and we don’t expect them to see the light any time soon, even though it’s staring at them straight in the face. These things can take centuries.
Catholics reject intolerance and hatred
One reason Catholics are rejecting the positions held by the Church is no better illustrated than by the following article appearing in the The Daily Mail:
I’ve never supported the British National Party or the Ku Klux Klan. I’ve never belonged to the Paedophile Information Exchange, or denied the Holocaust, or made a penny from the banking crash.
But if you read The Guardian newspaper’s website, you might think otherwise. A commentator on it urged my own children to murder me.
He did so because of one of the many stories I’ve written for this newspaper about climate change. I first reported on the subject nearly six years ago: my article was about the ‘climategate’ scandal, where leaked emails…”

…”But ultimately, where are they taking us? Citing climate change is certainly an effective way of making schoolchildren feel fearful and guilty, much as preachers once used to.”
Read more at the Daily Mail.
Leaders will have to learn to face one fact: thanks to the Internet followers are much better informed today and many can see the cliff up ahead which their leaders are blindly leading them to. The Catholic Church is part of that green movement.
Catholics want nothing to do with and are appalled by the hate and bigotry that gets aimed at honest dissenters such as David Rose. And we reject the deception-riddled plot to deny the world of life-giving fossil fuels as well as the mentally ill hysteria of a world coming to an end.
If anything what we need is an encyclical on the necessity of fossil fuels.
It’s truly stunning that the Church can be so tolerant of the bigotry and intolerance on one side of the debate, yet be so quick to condemn honest dissent on the other.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMood change in climate modeling: Trust in the scientific community is disappearing
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In the last few days we wrote two posts on the shocking deficits seen in the current climate models (see here and here). In our last part today we will look at how scientists estimate the modeling situation and look to see if there are new ideas to solve the problems.
In August 2014 a lead author of the 5th IPCC climate report, Richard Betts, publicly commented in a surprising manner. Betts directs the climate impact department of the UK Met Office, and at his website he describes himself as a climate modeling expert. In a comment at Bishop Hill, Betts wrote:
Bish, as always I am slightly bemused over why you think GCMs are so central to climate policy. Everyone* agrees that the greenhouse effect is real, and that CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Everyone* agrees that CO2 rise is anthropogenic. Everyone** agrees that we can’t predict the long-term response of the climate to ongoing CO2 rise with great accuracy. It could be large, it could be small. We don’t know. The old-style energy balance models got us this far. We can’t be certain of large changes in future, but can’t rule them out either.”
In a footnote Betts added the 2 comments:
*OK so not quite everyone, but everyone who has thought about it to any reasonable extent
**Apart from a few who think that observations of a decade or three of small forcing can be extrapolated to indicate the response to long-term larger forcing with confidence.”
Betts no longer gives climate models a central role in climate policy. There are still too many unknowns, he admits. Quite obviously even IPCC authors are now getting cold feet and are no longer able to exclude that CO2 may have only a minor impact on climate.
A month earlier in July 2014 in the Wall Street Journal climate modeler Robert Caprara conceded that a variety of freely selectable parameters exist in climate models, which allow the desired result to be “modeled in”. Caprara writes:
My first job was as a consultant to the Environmental Protection Agency. I was hired to build a model to assess the impact of its Construction Grants Program, a nationwide effort in the 1970s and 1980s to upgrade sewer-treatment plants. […] When I presented the results to the EPA official in charge, he said that I should go back and “sharpen my pencil.” I did. I reviewed assumptions, tweaked coefficients and recalibrated data. But when I reran everything the numbers didn’t change much. At our next meeting he told me to run the numbers again. After three iterations I finally blurted out, “What number are you looking for?” He didn’t miss a beat: He told me that he needed to show $2 billion of benefits to get the program renewed. I finally turned enough knobs to get the answer he wanted, and everyone was happy.”
In the climate debate Caprara recommends having an open discussion and listening to the arguments of the other side instead of cursing the other side in an attempt to disqualify them:

So here is my advice: Those who are convinced that humans are drastically changing the climate for the worse and those who aren’t should accept and welcome a vibrant, robust back-and-forth. Let each side make its best case and trust that the truth will emerge. Those who do believe that humans are driving climate change retort that the science is “settled” and those who don’t agree are “deniers” and “flat-earthers.” Even the president mocks anyone who disagrees. But I have been doing this for a long time, and the one thing I have learned is how hard it is to convince people with a computer model.”
Already in a paper from October 2012 a team of scientists led by Clara Deser in Nature Climate Change admitted that the strong natural climate variability that had been underestimated had been poorly accounted for by the climate models and so the models could not fulfill the high expectations of the political decision makers. The paper’s abstract states:
Communication of the role of natural variability in future North American climate
As climate models improve, decision-makers’ expectations for accurate climate predictions are growing. Natural climate variability, however, poses inherent limits to climate predictability and the related goal of adaptation guidance in many places, as illustrated here for North America. Other locations with low natural variability show a more predictable future in which anthropogenic forcing can be more readily identified, even on small scales. We call for a more focused dialogue between scientists, policymakers and the public to improve communication and avoid raising expectations for accurate regional predictions everywhere.”
Also well-known climate scientist Judith Curry has little trust in climate modeling. In October 2013 she complained in her blog about the missing estimations of climate historical studies – to the benefit of climate models. Huge sums had been invested in the models, without a correct result. The falsely claimed consensus by the IPCC catapulted the climate sciences backward at least a decade, said Curry:
My point is that ambitious young climate scientists are inadvertently being steered in the direction of analyzing climate model simulations, and particularly projections of future climate change impacts — lots of funding in this area, in addition to high likelihood of publication in a high impact journal, and a guarantee of media attention. And the true meaning of this research in terms of our actual understanding of nature rests on the adequacy and fitness for purpose of these climate models. And why do these scientists think climate models are fit for these purposes? Why, the IPCC has told them so, with very high confidence. The manufactured consensus of the IPCC has arguably set our true understanding of the climate system back at least a decade, in my judgment. The real hard work of fundamental climate dynamics and development and improvement of paleo proxies is being relatively shunned by climate scientists since the rewards (and certainly the funding) are much lower. The amount of time and funding that has been wasted by using climate models for purposes for which that are unfit, may eventually be judged to be colossal.
A more precise knowledge of paleoclimatology is essential and should have absolute priority ahead of free-style modeling because historical data are important calibration and check data for climate models. When the formulae are not correct, then even the largest super-computers are unable to deliver anything useful.

Also astrophysicist Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has no trust in climate models, as he explained at an event at Sandia National Labs, a research and development facility of the US Department of Energy.
The IPCC should finally open itself up to alternative models. In our “The Neglected Sun” book we presented a semi-quantitive approach where solar and ocean cycles played an important role. The awful accuracy rate of the IPCC models shows that it is time for a change. A serious check of the ideas of IPCC critics has to be conducted. Here models by Nicola Scafetta and Frank Lemke, which reproduce the temperature curve better than the IPCC forecasts, must be given serious attention. When it comes to oceans cycles, scientists have already given in and have even started to insert them into the models, thus making reliability of the climate prognosis dramatically better. An approach is for example DelSole et al. 2013 in a paper in the Geophysical Research Letters.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMy last post featured a commentary by renewable energy expert Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, who forcefully conveyed the folly of Germany’s mad rush into renewable energy, and the country’s hysterical obsession with its suicidal fast-track shutdown of its stable base-electric-power generation.
What follows are German electrical power supply charts that clearly illustrate in no uncertain terms Prof. Vahrenholt’s points. To show just how unreliable wind and sun really are, the first chart shows Germany’s power production, broken down according to the respective sources, over the last 3 and half days:

Power generation Germany vs date/time. Source: www.agora-energiewende.de/Graph.
 Dark blue – conventional power (fossil and nuclear)
 Medium blue – wind
 Yellow – solar
 Green – biomass
Note how there has been a virtual blackout by sun and wind since December 3 as Germany’s weather has been dismally gray and windless over the period. Such conditions are not uncommon in Europe and can persist for 2 weeks or more.
Note how there are times when sun and wind combined were less tha 2% of the needed supply. Unfortunately, power utilities simply cannot call Mother Nature up and place orders for power days in advance. They have to just take what Mother Nature sends, whether they want it or not, and German law says they have to pay for it even when they do not feed it in.
Supply havoc for no benefit
What follows next is a chart depicting Germany’s power supply from each energy source over an entire year (sorry about the suboptimal quality of the graphics).

Here we see that especially in the summertime both wind and sun can make a major contribution. But once again their wildly fluctuating supply creates havoc and problems that far outweigh any “benefit” the theoretical, imperceptible 0.02 or so degrees of less warming the planet might see over the next 30 years.
Large-scale exodus of Germany-based industry looms
And when the sun does shine and the wind blows many conventional power plants have to be throttled down to near idle, but can never be shut down because they have to be ready to fire up again as soon as the sun and wind diminish. This means these conventional power plants often run very inefficiently and highly uneconomically. So it’s little wonder E.ON is ditching the loss-making business of forced part-time power plant operation and going to renewable energies where profit is guaranteed by government mandated subsidies.
And with a power supply that is becoming exceedingly unstable and exorbitantly expensive, energy intensive industries are gearing to move operations, and the thousands of jobs they provide, out of Germany and over to foreign locations where electricity is affordable and reliable.
Large-scale storage technology still pie-in-the-sky
And does one see the pump storage (Pumpenspeicher) contribution in the above chart whenever the sun and wind go AWOL?
Of course we don’t. That’s because there is none to speak of in Germany. Yet, this is one of the main solutions that the government energy masterminds propose in order to compensate for windless and sunless periods. It still has not sunk into their heads that this amount of pump storage capacity is a technical impossibility in Germany, even with massive terra-altering. Never mind the economic unfeasibility of the idea.
The question remains: After Germany shuts down its remaining nuclear power and coal-fire plants, what will the country do when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow?
That question has yet to be answered.

"Donald Trump is set to hail his administration’s “environmental leadership” on Monday in a speech in which he is expected to declare the US a world leader on the issue. But since taking office two and a half years ago, the US president has been at the helm of an administration that has pursued numerous cuts in environmental protections and last year saw a rise in greenhouse gases of 3.4% – the biggest rise in emissions since 2010. He has also regularly publicly aired his doubts over the existence of climate change – previously calling it a “hoax”, suggesting that the climate could “change back again” and falsely claiming it was a phenomenon invented by China. A report by the State Energy and Environmental Impact Center at New York University’s school of law published in March said the Trump administration had “set its sights on watering down or outright repealing a half-dozen health and environmental rules critical to the health and welfare of all Americans as well as the planet”.  Here are five of the biggest environmental setbacks under Trump: In June 2017, less than five months after his inauguration, Trump announced his plan to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. He told an audience outside the White House: “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris”. He claimed the agreement, signed by the US and nearly 200 countries in 2015, promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions to keep global heating below 2C, unfairly disadvantaged the US and negatively impacted jobs and factories.  Trump attracted broad criticism in December 2017 when he announced plans to slash the size of two national monuments in Utah. Bears Ears was cut from 1.5m acres to 228,784 acres and Grand Staircase-Escalante almost halved from approximately 2m acres to 1,006,341 acres – marking the biggest elimination of public lands protection in America’s history. In August 2018 officials announced plans to allow more mining on the land and to sell some of it off – despite previously vowing not to. The following month, the administration announced plans to remove key provisions from the Endangered Species Act – prompting conservationists to warn it could put vulnerable plant and animal species in more danger. The Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of finalizing plans to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era rule intended to cut emissions from power plants and encourage them to move towards natural gas and renewable power. The regulations, which were announced in 2015 and had the backing of hundreds of businesses, were billed at the time as the “biggest step that any single president has made to curb the carbon pollution that is fueling climate change”.  The Trump administration plans to remove protections from thousands of America’s streams and millions of acres of wetlands, which is feared will harm wildlife and enable pollution to enter drinking water. Under the proposal, fewer waterways would require permits to pollute – including agricultural runoff and industry waste. Currently, protected waterways provide drinking water to approximately 117 million people. In September 2018, the Trump administration announced its plans to repeal rules that aim to restrict methane leaks on public and tribal lands. The Obama administration tried to cut leaks by forcing oil and gas companies to capture methane (a key gas involved in global heating), update technology and arrange to monitor leaked gas. But the Department of the Interior has branded the rule “flawed” and “unnecessarily burdensome on the private sector”."
"I feel for readers who have been missing birds and bats in their gardens (Letters, 28 June). I can’t be sure of the reasons – climate change could, of course, be a factor – but I would like to ascribe the continued presence of both in my garden to the fact that I have never used chemical or other means to get rid of insects. My lack of gardening rigour has meant the garden is slightly messy, so various forms of wildlife have been able find places to live. A hedgehog, badger and fox have all been sighted, and we have often heard, although never seen, a tawny owl.Cherry WestonWolverhampton • Digging patches of my garden over the last few months, I haven’t seen a single worm. Seems odd.Dr Nigel MellorNewcastle upon Tyne  • Normally, at this time of the year, my suburban garden would be a haven for slugs and snails. This year, almost none. Is this a gardener’s prayer answered or another sign of the loss of biodiversity because of the climate emergency?Ian DuncanTwickenham, Middlesex • In an effort to save our swifts, nine nest boxes were put up in my city-centre neighbourhood seven summers ago. None have been occupied and the traditional roof sites are no longer in use. Only the odd swift can now be seen where there were hundreds 30 years ago. Woods around Nottingham have few songbirds. Villages have few swallows or house martins. Once common farmland species (corn bunting, yellowhammer, skylark) are absent. Even the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust’s reserves have fewer species. Town dwellers may still have garden birds. And some, like jays, long-tailed tits and goldfinches are increasing there, refugees from the hostile rural environment. The decreasing bird population tells a sad tale of our effect on the environment. Early last week on holiday in the Outer Hebrides, I looked down on Castle Bay harbour in Barra to see a single gull drift over the docking ferry.Steve BrazierNottingham • Possibly the reason why Professor Michael Symonds has not seen any bats flying in his garden this year is that they have migrated to the church I help clean to soil the freshly polished brasses.Jane MothSnettisham, Norfolk • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski, a geologist, writes about Europe’s largest natural catastrophe, which occurred in 1540.
No, it wasn’t a mega-volcanic eruption, a super earthquake, or a monster meteor hit. It was a severe “unprecedented” drought that fried and scorched the continent to an extent that dwarfs anything we have experienced over the past 100 years, scientists have uncovered. In the introduction Bojanowski writes:
Hardly any rain and extreme heat eleven months long. More than 300 chronicles reveal the gruesome details of a gigantic catastrophe in the year 1540. And they show: The disaster can happen again.”
I hope Spiegel publishes this article in English later on because it succinctly reminds us that there is a lot more to climate and extreme weather than a trace gas and that weather and climate have always been brutal. Voodoo science, rain-dancing and bicycle riding aren’t going to tame the weather.
Bojanowski writes that there was no warning that a catastrophe was about to grip the continent. Europe had enjoyed a spell of rainy mild weather accompanied by bumper harvests. Culture and society flourished. In December 1539 heavy rains led to flooding and people had to flee their homes. “They had no idea how precious the rain would soon be.”
In his article Bojanowski describes how suddenly in January 1540 a drought ensued and would last 11 months. Scientists say it was “far worse” than the European heat wave of 2003 according to a new paper authored by Oliver Wetter et al appearing in the journal Climate Change. The study’s abstract reminds us that extreme extremes are all too familiar in the past when CO2 were at a critically low level of 270 ppm (my emphasis).
The heat waves of 2003 in Western Europe and 2010 in Russia, commonly labelled as rare climatic anomalies outside of previous experience, are often taken as harbingers of more frequent extremes in the global warming-influenced future. However, a recent reconstruction of spring–summer temperatures for WE resulted in the likelihood of significantly higher temperatures in 1540. In order to check the plausibility of this result we investigated the severity of the 1540 drought by putting forward the argument of the known soil desiccation-temperature feedback. Based on more than 300 first-hand documentary weather report sources originating from an area of 2 to 3 million km2, we show that Europe was affected by an unprecedented 11-month-long Megadrought. The estimated number of precipitation days and precipitation amount for Central and Western Europe in 1540 is significantly lower than the 100-year minima of the instrumental measurement period for spring, summer and autumn. This result is supported by independent documentary evidence about extremely low river flows and Europe-wide wild-, forest- and settlement fires. We found that an event of this severity cannot be simulated by state-of-the-art climate models.

Spiegel writes that according to one wine grower, “It rained only 3 days in March.” Bojanowski writes that as the year progressed, the soil dried out and the air above it became oven hot as the summer sun relentlessly scorched the continent day after day. The result? Bojanowski describes a scene of multiple days over 30°C, rivers drying out, animals dying of dehydration, large-scale crop failures, forest infernos, and people collapsing like flies from heat stroke. The social fabric came apart at the seams: “Tensions erupted into persecution and executions. people barricaded themselves in homes in fear of the violence.”
The Spiegel journalist also writes that the mega-drought of 1540 shows that the hypothesis drawn up by climate scienists claiming the 2003 heat wave was exascerbated by man-made global warming is overly simplistic. He quotes Rüdiger Glaser of the University of Freiburg:
Indeed it just isn’t that simple: The fact that 1540 saw an even worse heat wave without the artificially enhanced greenhouse effect relativizes the assessment of a man-made impact on the weather of 2003.”
Near the end of the article Bojanowski writes that experts say that the same catastrophe could happen again today and that Europe is ill-prepared. Moreover, it is doubtful that droughts of such magnitude can be predicted early nowadays and the reasons for the 1540 extreme event are subject to pure speculation only.
See Spiegel photo gallery of Germany’s 2003 summer scorcher.
So, should it surprise us that the extreme heat of 1540 precluded the Little Ice Age? What evidence of solar activity do we have for the year 1540? There are lots of factors that need to be pieced together in the hopes of finding out what may have caused the catastrophic 1540 heat wave. One factor can be excluded: trace gas CO2.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you take the annual CO2 atmospheric content, and differentiate it, that is calculate the year-to-year change, then you get a plot that looks a lot like the ocean temperature. This has led many people to think that the ocean is the source of the additional CO2. This is not the case.
The additional CO2 is from about one-half of our emissions. The year-to-year “noise” is from the year-to-year change in ocean temperature riding on the change from our emissions. Changes in our emissions are somewhat filtered by the time constant of CO2 biosphere absorption. Here is what happens.
Many of you will be familiar with the concept of “half-life” from radioactive decay. For a radioactive element, half of the radioactivity will decay in a certain period of time, then half again in the next period, and so on until the radioactivity can no longer be detected. The same principle applies to absorption. Half of a compound will be absorbed in a certain period, then another half in the next period, then another half, and so on. Here is the curve for a pulse of CO2 absorbed into the biosphere.

Figure 1 is the absorption curve for a single pulse of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere. The half-life of that pulse is a bit over 8 months. It is undetectable after about six years.
Imagine that you have just taken a deep breath, held it until the maximum CO2 has been exchanged, then exhaled. Half of the CO2 in that puff will be gone from the atmosphere in 8 months, 33% will remain in a year, only 11% will be around in 2 years, and so on. The series is actually 1/3, 1/9, 1/27, 1/81… Now add up all breathing for many years, or all the fossil fuel emissions.

In Figure 2 above the top gold trace is the summation of all the individual annual half-life traces. For instance, year one is the sum of the remainders from year -4 to year zero. It is the sum of 1/243 + 1/81 + 1/27 + 1/9 + 1/3 = very close to 1/2. The CO2 fraction that we observe is close to 0.5. If emissions completely ceased in year six, the extra CO2 added to the atmosphere would be nearly zero in year 10.

Figure 3 is a plot of annual fossil fuel emissions and the amount of those emissions that annually remain in the atmosphere. The remainder plot has been corrected for half-life.

Figure 4 is a plot of the fraction of emissions that remain in the atmosphere, the ocean temperature anomaly (from UHA satellite data), and the change (delta) in emissions with the data corrected for half-life using the fraction change data. (The half-life has been decreasing over time by 2.8% per decade). The left scale is for both the remaining fraction and temperature anomaly. The right scale applies to the delta emissions (the annual change in added emissions). This is scaled to match the fraction change. On a year-to-year basis the ocean temperature changes overwhelm the emission changes, but not the emissions themselves.

Figure 5 is a plot of  change: SST, CO2, and annual emissions added since 1980. This is the annual delta (differential) of all three. The Mt. Pinatubo cooling and the 1998 and 2010 El Niño warming is clearly visible in the CO2 data. It looks like the CO2 increase is due to ocean temperature, but this is an illusion. The annually added emissions are much larger than the ocean temperature CO2 flux change.

Figure 6 is a scatter plot of CO2 and SST anomaly with a linear trend applied. The trend is 17,239 million metric tonnes of CO2 emitted per degree C of SST change. Now look back at Figure 6. The long term change in temperature is about 0.3°C. This would be equivalent to about 5 billion tonnes of CO2. But the increase in CO2 over that time period was 483 billion tonnes, about 100 times that amount. The long-term CO2 increase is due to emissions, not ocean temperature. Temperature drives only the short-term changes.
About half of fossil carbon emissions appear to be responsible for the atmospheric CO2 rise, and that fraction is decreasing. The year-to-year changes in the CO2 rise are mostly due to ocean temperature changes, but those changes should be considered weather.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWeatherbell Analytics presents its latest Saturday Summary featuring the one and only Joe Bastardi.
There used to be a time when meteorologists truly admired and trusted the work and data put out by national weather services. After all if you couldn’t trust them, who could you trust!
But those days are becoming a thing of the past.
I don’t want to give the impression that Joe Bastardi doesn’t admire and respect these institutions, I’m sure he still does so very much, but if his latest video is anything to go by, he is adding reservations to that trust – at least when it comes to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).
Starting at the 6:60 mark Joe focusses attention on global sea ice, showing that right now globally it’s about 1 million square kilometers above average…in a world that is supposedly in the midst of runaway global warming.

Global sea ice on the rebound. Image cropped from Weatherbell Saturday Summary.
Then at the 8:56 mark Joe brings up the recent (some would call absurd) claim made that Antarctic sea ice is expanding to record high levels because of global warming. (With that kind of logic one could hypothesize that the snowball earth episodes occurred when the earth was a hot house). Bastardi:
Now the guy, I believe the guy that was saying that the Arctic was in a death spiral, now he’s saying that it’s global warming that’s causing the Antarctic to have more ice. It is absolutely astounding to me…the National Snow and Ice Data Center …that no matter what happens, the answer is global warming. That by itself should make you suspicious, okay.”
To me that sounds like “buyer beware” if you are getting your information from certain leading individuals at the NSIDC.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome days ago I wrote about how German news weekly Der Spiegel had resorted once again to catastrophe-hopping when it recently rolled out its print edition whose front cover featured a burning planet caused by human climate change.
Skeptics in Europe reacted harshly, but at the same time dismiss the doomsday piece as a desperate sensationalism stunt in a bid to stem its hemorrhage of readers.
Alarmist views “wrong, completely naïve”
Some criticism even came from rather hefty figures in the climate scene. For example Swedish professor Lennart Bengtsson, former IPCC climatologist and former head of the German Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg.
Hat-tip: Hans Labohm
Bengtsson posted a commentary concerning the Spiegel doomsday piece at the Swedish Anthropocene site here. He calls the alarmist views of book author Naomi Klein, which Spiegel cited in its article: “not only wrong, but also hopelessly naïve.”
No basis showing weather has gotten more extreme
Bengtsson, who has gravitated from being an regular alarmist to a non-alarmist luke-warmer over the years, thinks that the growing emission of greenhouse gases is a problem over the long term, but that it is not an urgent problem. He writes there is no scientific basis showing the weather has become more extreme.

The storms are not worse than before, and they will be fewer in a warmer climate as a result of the polar regions warming up.”
No urgency
On sea level Bengtsson writes that it is now rising at about 3 mm per year, but has not accelerated over the past 23 years. It makes no sense to rush and to make “hasty and inaccurate decisions“. He writes: 
The reason for the increased emissions of carbon dioxide is the increasing earth‘s population and the desire of all the poor to live a life that is a little better and more hopeful, and perhaps someday even take a taxi at any time – surely among some of Naomi Klein’s environmental sins.”
Bengtsson calls the belief that a non-capitalist system can solve the earth’s energy and environmental problems “completely naïve” and uninformed, citing past failed experiments in socialism.
If anyone ought to be familiar with the costs needed to solve the problems left behind by communist East Germany, it is Spiegel. The Elbe River was a dead river at the time of the German reunification. Now, thanks to the capitalist system, it has returned to life.”
As an example of a successful approach to lower CO2, emissions, Bengtsson uses the United States: “In fact, one of the few countries that has significantly reduced CO2 emissions are the United States, through its growing gas exploration!” 
Bengtsson adds: 

The only hope to solve the planet’s long-term environmental problems is via the open and free society, not least of all by a socialist dictatorship on a global scale. This at least Spiegel’s editors ought to know.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s increasingly obvious that warnings of a “rapidly warming planet” are coming from another alien world, one where the climate is completely different from the one we have here on Earth.
Recently we have been seeing headlines telling us that the GLOBAL WARMING STOP has been extended yet another month, now at 17 years and 9 months, read here and here.

17 years and 9 months take us all the way back to the end of 1996, i.e. before the Kyoto Protocol was adopted. That means there hasn’t been any warming since activists and bureaucrats declared it a problem that needs to fought.
The question remains: How much longer will the period of zero-warming need to continue before scientists, activists and bureaucrats come to their senses and wake up to reality of our non-warming world?

Topic for the Geritol generation
Lord Monckton even writes at WUWT (my emphasis):
On the RSS satellite data, there has been no statistically-significant global warming for more than 26 years. None of the models predicted that, in effect, there would be no global warming for a quarter of a century.”
That means no children or young adults know what real warming is. Soon global warming will be something that only old folks will be discussing while consuming Geritol at the retirement home. By then the younger generations will only think that old folks believing in warming have all gone senile and have lost it. many of us are beginning to believe this today.
Earth to Warmworld. Earth to Warmworld…do you read me? Come in, please. Is anyone out there?

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is Professor Fritz Vahrenholt’s reaction to German power giant E.ON’s decision to split off its fossil fuel and nuclear power generation operations, and Russia’s announcement it has cancelled the construction of South Stream gas supply pipeline to Europe.
=========================
This week two events have occurred and will have serious impacts on the European and German energy market: 1) the withdrawal from conventional power generation by Europe’s and Germany’s largest power company, E.ON, and 2) Russia’s canceling the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline. The public reaction in Germany was quite subdued. That in itself shows how little the German public comprehends the issue of power supply stability.
But this is exactly what these two events are all about.
E.ON accepts that there is no longer any future for coal and nuclear power in Germany, as this is the will of the federal government and the German public. That is indeed suicidal for Germany as a location for business, and E.ON knows it. The forced shutdown of nuclear power plants, without compensation, and the loss-intensive relegation of coal and gas power plants to serve as uneconomical back-up power plants for the most-unstable renewable energies, has left a deep impression on the bottom lines of German power producers.
E.ON will place all its conventional operations into a subsidiary company, which will then be put on the auction block. E.ON’s abandonment is striking proof that a market-oriented commitment in Germany’s energy sector is politically unwelcome. Ultimately it is E.ON’s silent wish that in the end – with political guarantees from the German government – a buyer will take over the risk of producing conventional energy in Germany. If it is not the state-controlled companies in France or Russia, then it will be the German state itself who will take over the supply of energy, and certainly over the coming years – after one of the feared brown-outs. That of course will be because of politics. But the political reaction will claim: The energy supply has to be placed in the hands of the state because the market failed. Perhaps the managers at E.ON saw it coming, and so are now attempting to salvage a part of the capital.
With regards to Russia’s sudden cancellation of the South Stream pipeline project, this is also a question of securing an uninterrupted supply. In the wake of geopolitical tensions Russia is pulling out, surely in part because of the pressure from the falling oil and gas prices which are making the project increasingly uneconomical. Russia is turning to China for a solution.

And also here the German public has been surprisingly subdued. As politics pretty much has blocked the possibility of producing its own shale gas, a major part of the political left is busily attempting to torpedo the planned TTIP trade agreement with the USA, which also would include natural gas. Yet Germany continues on as if it’s business as usual, because the overwhelming majority believes wind and sun will suffice. A look out the window can be enlightening. Just as I am writing this, the PV production in Germany is zero – it’s dark outside – and the wind is hardly blowing…I’d estimate producing a maximum of 5000 MW in total, a tiny fraction of Germany’s total demand. Who is going to supply the other 50,000 MW that will power the German Rail, steel mills, subways, water supply, and my desk lamp and laptop?
One thing is now certain: It’s not going to be E.ON.

The Climb Out Of The Ice Age
Part 2
By Ed Caryl
Below is a plot of sea level and temperature for the last 21,000 years, when the world warmed out of the last ice age, and civilization became possible. This is the end of the Upper Pleistocene and the dawn of the Holocene. Note, that at the end of the last ice age it took 12,000 years for all the ice to melt. It was a long slog out of the caves. That first warm period, from 10,200 Before Present (BP) to 8200 BP was warmer than it is today, even though a third of the ice was still melting. The last major ice melted about 6500 years ago.

Figure 1 is a plot of the last 21,000 years. The heavy purple and green traces are sea level with the scale on the right. The thin rust and blue traces are temperature from a greenland ice core and the Antarctic Dome C ice core respectively with the scale on the left. Three other time lines are: thick blue, the time of the last North African Pluvial period, when the Sahara was a grassland; dark orange, the time of the Persian Gulf flooding; and the light orange timeline, interrupted several times, were times of Alpine glacier recession. The short 8.2 kilo year cold period is marked in light blue. Various sea level high stands just above the green sea level trace are labeled in the legend. The grey time-line is the time of the Clovis Amerindian culture. The pink timeline is the time of the Folsom Amerindian culture.
I call your attention to several things in Figure 1. From right to left, old to more recent: The end of the ice age began about 20,000 years ago, when the northern hemisphere suddenly warmed by 5°C as seen at the source of the Greenland ice, the North Atlantic. The Southern Ocean, as seen at Dome C, did not warm for another 2000 years. But, the Bølling Interstadial warming took place simultaneously, globally, 14,500 years ago. During that short warming interval, the ancestors of the American Indians made their way across the Beringian plain, down either the west coast of what is now Canada, or down through an ice-free corridor through Alaska and central Canada, thence down across the length of the Americas to as far south as Terra Del Fuego in just a couple of thousand years.
In North America, by 13,500 years BP, the Amerindian Clovis culture was living off the megafauna, the large mammals present in this era, using beautifully worked large stone spear-points. 1500 years later, after the megafauna were killed off, either by the Clovis people or the cold Younger Dryas period, they morphed into the Folsom Culture, using smaller stone spear-points more suited to the smaller remaining animals.
In North Africa, and southwest Asia, beginning 15,000 years ago, because earth’s axis tilt began to favor the northern hemisphere during summer, the deserts were favored with additional summer monsoon rainfall. This allowed more human migration from north Africa into the Levant. At this time the Persian Gulf was a low valley watered by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and several others, some now dry wadis, combining into the Ur Schott river, and before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), at least two large lakes. Fresh water springs, now 4 or 5 fathoms under the gulf off Bahrain, supplied additional water.

Figure 2 is a history of the Persian Gulf over the period from 74,000 years before present to 6,000 years ago. Source here.

There must have been people living in this valley, though because it is now flooded with 40 to 60 meters of water, the archeology necessary to prove it will be very difficult. But we do know that those occupation sites shown in the Stage IV panel above appeared very suddenly 8500 years ago on the Arabian shore and the people in those sites came from somewhere close by as they share a common and unique culture, the Ubaid culture. This valley may have been the source of the Eden stories. The sea level at the time of the Ubaid culture didn’t stop rising when it reached the level it has now. It rose an additional 5 meters in this area, flooding what is now southern Iraq for a hundred miles inland. Ur was established as a port, on the shore of this inland sea. There is evidence of reed-hulled sail boats in this time period, including bitumen fragments of the coating used to protect the reed structure, ceramic toy models, and an image on pottery showing a bipod masted craft. The ruins of Ur are now in the desert northwest of Basra, Iraq, far from the sea.
In this same period, Doggerland in what is now the North Sea, was also being flooded. The last bit of land there, what is now Dogger Bank, was an ever-shrinking island for several thousand years. Human produced artifacts have been dredged up by fishermen for many years. The last bit of land there went under about 6500 years ago.
Florida was also much larger before the sea level rose. Any coastal activity by Clovis culture people along the coast of the Americas is now under water. This is also true of many areas along in the Red Sea, the coast of India, and southeast Asia. A large area in what is now the South China Sea, the Sunda Strait, was also dry land and almost certainly settled.
The warm period from 11,500 to 8200 years ago was a time of many important advances for the human race. In this period, most of the important animals and agricultural crops we know today were domesticated in the Persian Gulf and Fertile Crescent region. Before this time people were nomadic, moving from one food source to another in the course of each year, building shelter as needed or living in caves. After this time many people lived in villages in permanent dwellings. By 8000 years BP, corn (maize) was domesticated in central Mexico.
As an example, Jericho is the oldest permanently occupied town, with the oldest level dating from 11,400 years BP. Before this time, the site had been used only as a temporary camp, as there is a large permanent spring nearby. The oldest level even had a 2 meter wall all around it with a watchtower that is still standing as it was buried in the tell. The dwellings were round pit houses, half sunken into the ground, with stone walls and a “wattle and daub” or adobe roof. World-wide, this type of house appears as the first permanent type dwelling in many cultures. It is still found in Northern Syria. At a similar village 5 miles north of Jericho, seedless domesticated figs have been found dating from this era. These would have had to have been propagated by cuttings, as the seeds never developed beyond the embryonic stage. Grains found at early Jericho were still of the wild variety, though they were gathered in quantity and stored for later use.
At Ur and H3 (above map, Figure 2, stage IV), domesticated grains were found, and 8200 years ago, evidence of irrigation, as well as domestic cattle, sheep, and goats. At this time, the domestic cat is found, though who domesticated who has not been established. Cats seem to have wandered in from the desert, found a source of food (domestic mice and domestic house swallows feeding on the stored domestic grain) and shelter, and decided to stay on. Some authors say this is “self-domestication.” I suspect cats domesticated us.
The first Holocene cold snap occurred 8200 years ago. Global temperature dropped about 2 degrees as seen at both poles. This lasted for about 200 years and was accompanied by drought and famine. This forced an increasing reliance on domesticated crops and animals, triggered the use of irrigation in Mesopotamia, and the domestication of corn (maize) in Central America. In North America, this split up the Folsom Culture people and drove the beginning of tribalism in the Paleo-Amerindians. This cold and arid spell was overcome by the technology, and the animal and plant domestication, that had developed in the earlier warm period.
Advances were made possible by the warm period that began more than 3000 years before all the ice melted. Sea levels were rising to be much higher than today and the human race was thriving on all continents except Antarctica. Warm is good. Cold is bad.
Next: The later Holocene and the rise of empires.

I’ll be opting out of Germany’s Kirchensteuer (Church Tax) and will not attend any services in the future. With their latest planned encyclical they are indicating that they have shifted back to the Dark Ages of bad-weather witches, superstitions and Medieval indulgences. Worse, they are openly subscribing to nutty end-of-times theories.
This comes on the heels of a recent announcement that Pope Francis intends to issue an encyclical on climate change. I am not renouncing Catholicism Christianity, rather I am solely renouncing my recognition that the Vatican and Pope are the faith’s administrator and moral compass. It’s the last straw in an unending string of corruption, child sexual abuse and scandals that have raged within the Catholic Church in recent times.
False prophecies based on junk models
The Vatican announces that it accepts a science (but it is one that is built on the false prophecies of faulty climate models made by unscrupulous scientists who claim they can now see decades and even hundreds of years into the future) and that bad weather is now due to the sins of man. It’s back to the dark days of Church-sanctioned witchhunts of the sort that once punished, tortured and burned people for brewing bad weather. Stunningly, once again, this is where today’s Catholic Church is heading today.
We can only speculate on why the Vatican has decided to take this extreme, divisive, and hugely misguided step, especially at a time when climate science is hotly debated and more tenuous then ever. It has elected to ignore the long-term data, the role of the sun and oceans, the complete lack of correlation between CO2 and global temperature, and seems to have declared the debate over among Catholics. It has entered a bargain founded on a monumental lie and bought into the silly end-of-world scenario. Such a Church is no longer worthy of being followed.
Vatican aligning with population control ideology
Even more disturbing is that the Vatican has opted to align itself with those who possess ideologies that are openly hostile to and spiteful of humanity. In May 2014 the Vatican held a workshop where the invited delegates included Naomi Oreskes, Arctic sea-ice crackpot Peter Wadhams, and Professor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber of the ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Pesearch. Strangely it doesn’t seem to bother the Vatican that Professor Schellnhuber once openly stated that the ideal human population for the planet was less than 1 billion people, implying an excess of more than 6 billion inhabitants. He also once said that the planet would “explode” if the population reached 9 billion.

This kind of environmental stewardship is one that advocates the pre-emptive abortion of future generations – a denial of life for future generations – i.e population control. This is hostile to the human race and it is appalling to any practicing Catholic. Either Pope Francis is stunningly naïve, or just diabolically evil.
And don’t expect the Vatican to backtrack anytime soon and to admit that it may have acted too hastily. Recall that It did not apologize to Galileo until 1992 – some three hundred and fifty years after the great philospher’s death. Galileo’s crime: he dared to challenge the consensus of the time.
Poorest urgently need affordable fossil fuels
I can no longer stomach this giant step back to the witch-hunting Dark Ages the Catholic Church is contemplating. The Vatican appears to have unwittingly elected to abandon the poorest among us, and their urgent need for affordable and reliable energy that only fossil fuels and nuclear power are able to deliver. The move by the Vatican risks putting the lives of tens of millions of the world’s most impoverished at risk. This Pope needs to remember that the road to Hell is often paved with good intentions. Though his intentions may be good, they are in this case based on horribly false prophesies peddled by charlatans who arrogantly refuse to debate.
What’s going to be next? An encyclical on the virtues of veganism – based on junk science nutrition?
Defying a corrupt Vatican is the Catholic thing to do
It’s important to keep in mind that rejecting a corrupt, incompetent or misguided Vatican is in fact the most Catholic thing to do. The collection money you give every week will do a lot more good if you give it directly to the needy. The Vatican or the regional Bishop need not send over a minion priest with the errand of saving my soul. Instead the Vatican should worry about its own.
Little wonder that Pope Benedict XVI resigned. The Vatican appears to be well on the way to becoming a cesspool of corruption and self-deceit. I can no longer bear it. The witch-hunting, end-of-world climate encyclical will be the last straw.

"We rarely devote much attention to what happens in the largest state of the US. No, not Texas – Alaska, which is bigger, geographically, than the next three states combined (Texas, California and Montana). Separated from the mainland by Canada, Alaska is the biggest state yet has fewer inhabitants than the smallest (Rhode Island). This creates enormous challenges for governance, including in higher education. And Alaska governor Mike Dunleavy’s new budget will make these challenges far, far worse. In a shocking example of political overreach, Dunleavy announced 182 line-item vetoes to his state’s 2020 budget last week. He thereby cut the budget proposed by the Alaska legislature by almost $410m in general funds. Almost one-third of the cuts will come from the University of Alaska system, which will see its budget cut by $130m – that’s a staggering 41% reduction of state funding to the university.  In a shocked response, the University of Alaska system’s president, James R Johnsen, said Dunleavy’s veto “will strike an institutional and reputational blow from which we may likely never recover”. Scott Downing, faculty senate leader at the University of Alaska Anchorage, told the Washington Post: “It’s going to be devastating. The effects on programs, on the students, on staff and faculty are just going to be – it’s kind of unthinkable.” Dunleavy has defended his draconian budget cuts as a “policy choice” to increase the Permanent Fund dividend Alaskans receive each year – a major election promise he made during his campaign. While this might be good news for drug dealers – research shows a 14%  increase in substance-abuse incidents the day after the annual payout – there is little evidence that the dividends actually boost the state economy. But the University of Alaska system does. Economists have shown that investing in universities boosts the economy of countries and states. They found direct and indirect effects of higher education spending that led to a significant increase in GDP across time and space. From Ohio to West Virginia, public universities have added billions to the state economies. Alaska is no exception. As my colleague Marshall Shepherd noted, the University of Alaska system provided $714m (directly) and $402m (indirectly) to the statewide economy in 2012 alone. Investing in higher education is also a matter of social justice. The cuts will undoubtedly hit the regional campuses the hardest. These campuses service rural populations, and often ethnic minorities. Alaska Natives constitute the majority of students in some of the regional campuses of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, such as Kuskokwim (70%) and Bristol Bay (62%). Many will be unable to attend university if their regional campus is closed (or certain programs are closed). But the impact goes well beyond regional economics and even the state of Alaska. The budget cuts would be a disaster for US climate research. The University of Alaska System is the primary academic institution for Arctic research in the US and “every climate change researcher, educator, scientist and student in the lower 48 whose work touches the American Arctic” relies on the center’s work, Victoria Herrmann, the president of the Arctic Institute, told Gizmodo. “If the UA [University of Alaska] is defunded at the current rate, Arctic research in every corner of America will suffer.” She added, lest we forget, that “what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic”. Bluntly stated, the idea of an annual payout is to bring people to Alaska and to keep them there. It is unclear whether it achieves that. What we do know is that the University of Alaska system retains many of the most mobile, higher-educated workers that the state economy depends on. Research has found that 68% of two-year graduates and 42% of four-year graduates remain in the state. How many young Alaskans, if forced to leave the state to find (better) higher education elsewhere, will return to Alaska after finishing their degree? Dunleavy’s draconic budget will be devastating for the state of Alaska and will have negative consequences for the rest of the US and the world. It is up to the Alaska legislature to stand up to Dunleavy’s short-term opportunism and veto his budget. Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia This article was amended on July 16 2019 to clarify that state funding of the university was cut by 41%. An earlier version stated that this was the size of the cut to the university’s overall budget, which is incorrect."

====================================
Imagine there’s a climate conference, but no one goes
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Imagine there’s a climate conference, but no one goes. Already months ago South Korean UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon busily sent out invitations to world leaders, kindly requesting them to appear at the Climate Change Special Conference in New York on 23 September 2014. The aim of the conference is to agree on concrete actions for a CO2 reduced world in order to curb a menacing climate catastrophe. At the German Huffington Post Ban Ki-moon set forth his underlying motivation for September 2014 conference(translated from the German):

I have travelled the world in order to see the impacts with my own eyes. From the Arctic to the Antarctic, from low-lying islands of the Pacuífic, which are threatened by rising sea levels, to the melting glaciers of Greenland, the Andes and the Alps. I have seen expanding deserts in Mongolia and in the Sahel Zone, and threatened rainforests in Brazil. Everywhere I have spoken with the affected people who are deeply worried about the threat to their way of life and their future because of climate change.”
Dear Mr General Secretary: If you really wish to cut back on CO2 emissions, then you should NOT jet around the globe in your UN jet to supposedly see climate change with your own eyes. Perhaps you have heard that the Pacific Atolls are living corals that are growing along with sea level rise. The glaciers already melted before, 1000 years ago during the Medieval Warm Period when it was as warm as today. Currently the Sahel desert regions are not expanding as you claim, rather they are becoming greener. Moreover the rainforests of Brazil are threatened foremost by deforestation thanks to palm oil and biofuels. That is something to be really worried about, and not about climate change.
As opposed to the UN General Secretary, many world leaders have obviously realized that the science is overheated. An increasing number of scientists are distancing themselves explicitly from the catastrophe mindset. After 16 years of no global warming, the basis for trust between policymaking and the IPCC scientists is sustainably disturbed. We believed you and you’ve disappointed us, the scathed politicians bemoan behind closed doors.
So it is little surprise that hardly anyone has the desire to attend the Climate Summit Circus. Already in May, 2014, German Chancellor Angela Merkel respectfully declined -she had other more important appointments. What could they possibly be about? Even today there is still no entry in Merkel’s Online  appointment book for the 23rd of September. Perhaps an appointment with the hairdresser that can no longer be put off? Crochet evening with good friends? Let’s keep it a surprise for now.

In the middle of August 2014 India Prime Minister Narendra Modi also declined the invitation to attend. India today is the world’s third largest CO2 emitter. Perhaps someone in New Delhi got cold feet over the requested “concrete measures”. Or perhaps they simply looked at the latest global temperature charts.
Also in Peking they were not amused. Suddenly the world’s largest CO2 emitter, China, no longer has much desire to show up in New York. Chinese Prrsident Xi Jinping wasted little time in canceling his flight ticket. Nothing will result from all the negotiations anyway, the UN needs to know.
No German Chancellor, no Indian Prime Minister and no Chinese President. Consequently the UN General Secretary became visibly nervous and had to make late nominations. He was able to find a person -in the political little leagues: Bonn’s Lord Mayor Jürgen Nimptsch cordially expressed his willingness to travel to the Conference. Ban Ki-moon was most pleased, and the conference was saved. Now if all citizens of Bonn made massive efforts, then they would be able to offset the Indian and Chinese CO2 surpluses of the next few years in about an estimated 2 billion years.
And things don’t look all that rosy when it comes to a climate agreement. The famous Kyoto-Protocol expired at the end of 2012. At that climate conference in Doha, 144 countries promised to vote to extend the treaty by 2020. So far today 11 countries have signed the extension document. In the meantime, have the other 133 countries reconsidered? So far not a single one of the 28 EU countries have signed on, also not Germany. But already Mauritius and Micronesia are on board (they would be beneficiaries of climate protection payments).
The climate alarmism-driven US-President Barack Obama also has realized that it no longer makes sense to strive for a large, new international climate treaty. Realistically it would never work anyway. In Paris at the end of 2015 there preferably will be a non-binding treaty. World leaders would more likely sign that. After all, they would not have to fulfill it…especially when they lose desire to do so…

What Is The Temperature Trend At Barrow Alaska?
By Ed Caryl
If you ask this question of Wolfram-Alpha, the online Guru that Siri depends on for answers, you get this plot.

Figure 1 from Wolfram-Alpha.
If you look at all the available temperature data bases for Barrow, you get multiple answers, none that agree, and none agree with Wolfram-Alpha, or even come close.

Figure 2 is a plot of Barrow temperatures from five different sources. The BEST data nearly coincides with the Barrow Airport NWS Average (the blue line us under the red line) until the last decade. The Russian data ends at 2000.

During the search for this data, I came to the conclusion that RAW data simply does not exist for any stations except for the filled-out sheets from COOP stations or the electronic reports from the automated stations. All the on-line data, whether from BEST, NOAA, USHCN, GHCN, GISS, or wherever, has been manipulated in some way. USHCN, NOAA and GHCN seem to be the prime manipulators, filling in missing records with estimates, inventing data for “zombie”stations that won’t die, and “homogenizing”data to supposedly correct for UHI. GISS then takes the GHCN data and adds their own special sauce where they think it is necessary.
Of the 19 stations examined in my previous article, only Barrow received the “special sauce”. For all the others GISS simply passed along the GHCN data with no changes. All the changes in the last three years and nine months in those GISS files were GHCN changes. But Barrow is special. Here is what GISS did to Barrow

Figure 3 illustrates the GISS “homogenization” change to Barrow temperatures (the green stair-steps), adding more than one degree per century to the warming trend by cooling the past.
Without the change illustrated in figure 3, 1940 would be the warmest year by 0.04°C. This change obviously has nothing to do with Urban Heat Island, it is in the wrong direction. Changes like this give a whole new meaning to the term “hutzpah”.
So from where did Wolfram-Alpha get their data? I have no idea. The source they cite has no connection to climate. It’s appearance suggests it was made up from whole cloth.
So who do we trust with the temperature records? We certainly cannot trust GHCN and GISS, nor any of the other agencies because they get their data from GHCN. GISS simply further corrupts that data. They are also continuously changing the data on a monthly basis, not just the previous month, but months in the distant past. For an excellent review of the “dancing data” see this recent article, and the associated comments.
Who can we trust? No one.

"Britons use 840bn litres of water a year showering, with some power showers using up to 15 litres a minute. Aerator shower heads, such as Lowenergie’s (£12.99), save water by acting as a sieve, reducing space for the water to flow through while maintaining water pressure.  Microbeads were banned in the UK last year, but most soaps are still wrapped in plastic. Seek out alternatives. Aerende’s bergamot and mint wool soap (£12) is handmade by young people in Hertfordshire with disabilities, wrapped in wool from Herdwick sheep, packaged in recycled paper and contains no parabens. The average person uses 300 toothbrushes in their lifetime, with an estimated 80% ending up in the sea. Zero Waste’s bamboo, replaceable-head toothbrushes are 100% biodegradable and made from sustainable bamboo (£6.99). Use with a zero-waste toothpaste such as Georganics’ natural toothpowder (£6.90), which is free from peroxides and comes in a recyclable glass jar. The UK sends an estimated 300,000 tonnes of clothing to landfill each year. If you are not going to wear an item at least 30 times, don’t buy it. Instead, consider renting (try hirestreetuk.com or frontrow.uk.com). If you do buy new, use the app Good on You to check clothing brands’ sustainability rating. The charity Traid will collect old clothes free of charge for its shops in London, Hertfordshire, Surrey and Brighton. The global footwear industry emits 700m tonnes of CO2 a year. AllBirds is a favourite of actors Ashton Kutcher and Amy Adams, and uses sugarcane, sheep’s wool and recycled bottles to make its carbon-neutral trainers. You can recycle old trainers at Runners Need. Help eliminate food waste by purchasing a “wonky” veg box from Odd Box (from £9.95) or one of Lidl’s Too Good to Waste boxes (£1.50). Alternatively, search Social Farms & Gardens to see how you can get involved at your local community farm. Pets are estimated to consume about 20% of the world’s meat and fish. Reduce your dog’s environmental impact with Yora (£13.99), a protein-packed food made from insects, oats and potato. According to Sam Jones of Cycling UK, only 2% of all journeys in England are taken by bike. Happily, the government has just refreshed its Cycle to Work scheme, extending the tax-free savings to ebikes over £1,000. These have integrated motors, making the scheme more accessible for those with a lower level of fitness or a longer commute. Make the office a cuppa with an eco-friendly kettle. Vektra’s vacuum eco kettle (£59.95) keeps water hot for four hours, so you don’t have to waste power and water by repeat-boiling. Dr Neil Jennings of the Grantham Institute for climate change and the environment at Imperial College London recommends setting your office printers to double-sided, and automating systems to power down over the weekend and evenings. Since the Paris agreement was adopted, the world’s biggest banks have poured $1.9tn into financing the fossil fuel industry. Make the switch on your lunch break – Triodos Bank invests in social and environmental initiatives and publishes details of where it invests. Cook once, eat twice and bring leftovers for lunch. A vegan’s carbon footprint is half that of a meat-eater’s, but if you can’t face forgoing animal products then cut down. Researchers have found that eating just one vegetarian meal a week for a year saves the greenhouse-gas equivalent of driving 1,160 miles. Ditch the tupperware: transport sarnies in black+blum’s stainless steel sandwich box with bamboo lid (£29.95). Don’t flush anything that isn’t biodegradable, to avoid feeding fatbergs, which block sewers and cost the UK about £100m annually. Flushable wipes and chemical-free sanitary products can be found at Natracare.  Only about 30% of the Earth’s forests remain. Change your homepage to Ecosia, which has servers that run on 100% renewable energy and uses its profits to plant trees – almost 60 million of them, so far. Many household cleaning products are filled with toxins, so get creative and make your own. A combination of baking soda, vinegar and essential oils is perfect for scrubbing floors, bathrooms and kitchens. Avoid air fresheners – most emit more than 100 chemicals, some of which may be pollutants. Lola Grogan, founder of the Eco Laundry, recommends Sonnet, which offers ecologically conscious bleaches and laundry products.  A typical 6kg wash load of acrylic fabric releases more than 700,000 plastic fibres into the sea, where they are eaten by fish and, eventually, us. “Only wash clothes when you have a full load, and at low temperatures – higher temperatures can mean more fibres are released,” says Grogan. Most washing machines don’t have filters, so invest in a microfibre-trapping laundry device, such as the Cora Ball (£29). Opt for a fridge with an A+++ energy label, which shaves about 5% off an average household’s electricity bill when replacing an A+ fridge. Freezers cut food waste by almost 50% and are more efficient when fully stocked. Use a lid to cover pots on the stove, reducing energy use by two-thirds and heating food faster. And don’t be a microwave snob – it is a more eco-friendly way to reheat food. Stream films through a smart TV rather than a less energy-efficient games console. The US nonprofit the National Resources Defense Council found that the PS4 and Xbox One required 30 to 45 times more power to stream a film than players such as Apple TV, Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV. Depending on your music habits, listening to CDs may be more environmentally friendly than doing it digitally. Research by Bach Technology in 2012 showed that streaming an album 27 times can use more energy than creating and posting a CD to a consumer. Reusable face pads (try cheekywipes.com) can be used to remove makeup and then machine washed. When it is time to reapply, go for Ecotools’ makeup brushes, made from recycled bamboo, plastic and aluminum and packaged in recycled paper. Get some shut-eye in cotton/bamboo bedding from Urban Collective (from £116.99). Bamboo is fast-growing and self-replenishing, consuming one-third the amount of water during the growing process than cotton. It also has antibacterial properties.

"Several French temperature records were broken on 28 June during this historic heatwave, including the highest temperature ever recorded in the country since records began – 45.9C. The previous high was set during the 2003 heatwave, which was the most significant episode in France’s meteorological history until now. Saharan air has engulfed the country. On 20 June, while meteorologists were discussing the projections of the American global forecast system model, a map with a disturbing resemblance to Munch’s painting The Scream came to my attention. Within a few days, the media spotted this comparison and the image went viral. In 15 years of model observation I had never seen such high temperatures predicted for France, especially in June. The forecast, made more than a week in advance, proved correct: records were not just broken, they were smashed. But summer still has a long way to go, and the fact that temperatures have risen so much so early in the season is not reassuring. With a pre-industrial climate, the probability of an episode such as the 2003 (and now the 2019) heatwave was less than 1 in 100 according to climate models. Today, the same risk is 25%. If we reach an increase in global temperatures of 1.5C the chance will rise to 40%; at +2C it will be more than 60%.  At the same time, the probability of events colder than normal in both summer and winter is decreasing. When a heatwave occurs, physical processes trigger its continuation: less ground humidity, increasingly high energy flows and increasingly hotter air masses, even at altitude. Thus we observed temperatures of up to 7C at the top of Mont Blanc, at 4,800m, which is 14C above seasonal norms. The 2003 heatwave could have been a European trigger for global action against the climate crisis. During the very high temperatures 16 years ago, more effective health responses were put in place to limit the number of deaths were such a phenomenon to recur. But that was all. We cannot make that mistake again. The 2019 heatwave should be a warning to us: as scientists have been warning for decades, it is time for a Europe-wide response to fight the climate crisis.  We must come up with a better plan for how to deal with these heatwaves. Even if we limit the current warming to +2C, our continent will experience heatwaves as intense, and even more intense, than the one we have just lived through far more frequently. Our societies will not be able to get through such violent episodes without significant damage. • Ruben Hallali is a French meteorologist and founder of HD Rain"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn insightful commentary in Germany’s flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung looks at the status and future of global climate policy development. In the commentary, climate policy expert Oliver Geden of the Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) in Berlin writes that “climate diplomacy has long since maneuvered itself to a dead-end” and that “global climate protection is on the verge of upheaval“. Both climate science and climate-economic science have led policymaking into an impossible situation.
Geden first points to 25 years of no progress in getting policymakers to curb greenhouse gas emissions. “When one compares the mood that prevailed between the 4th IPCC report of 2007 and the Copenhagen Climate Conference of 2009, we notice that nobody is risking announcing a coming breakthrough in climate negotiations. Moreover, also warnings of approaching large catastrophes are getting less coverage“. Climate conferences have suffered a long string of failures, and the result, Geden writes, is that a new approach appears to have been adopted by countries:
Unlike the situation before Copenhagen, no climate diplomat or NGO representative still seriously believes it is possible to get big emitters like the United States or China to obligate themselves to far-reaching emissions reductions through a UN treaty.”
The focus he writes, is “no longer on what is desired, but on what is doable; not on nice-sounding intentions but on actually achieved results.” Governments appear to have abandoned binding targets for 2025 or 2030 altogether. The focus is no longer on reducing emissions, but has shifted “to putting the brakes on the rise in emissions“. If Geden’s perception is accurate, and there is no reason to doubt it isn’t, then impatient activists will have to accept waiting many more years before to reaching the desired emissions cuts.
Geden observes that the international paradigm shift now taking hold will have considerable implications for climate science itself, as it will herald “a pragmatic change of course.” He writes that “the climate-political debate is no longer about whether climate change is happening, but rather it is irrefutable that it is for the most part only about its extent, character and speed“. The consequences, he writes:
This is going to promote a depoliticization of climate science, where scientitific uncertainties will once again be discussed with greater calmness.”
Geden also sees climate economists having taken over centre-stage in the debate as they struggle to determine which global climate targets are realistic and which ones aren’t. He writes that with each passing year, the chance of successfully reaching the “2°C target” becomes ever more diminished. Geden feels a paradox has arisen: “With each year of globally increasing emissions, model assumptions on transformation-capability are appearing more and more optimistic.” While political advisors no longer see a 3% annual reduction in emissions after 2020 as realistic, the IPCC still envisions emissions reaching a peak by 2030 with 6% annual emissions reductions thereafter as being realistic. The IPCC even adds in its calculations “negative emissions” through CCS technology. Here Geden writes that with such calculations of postponed emissions reductions and “negative” emissions, climate economists are only unwillingly confirming their “political capabilities” and that economic science is putting its reputation at risk over the midterm. Consequently one has to expect policymaking will distance itself from it. In summary, since climate science and climate sconmic science appear to have painted themselves into a corner, Geden writes:
The relationship between climate policy and climate science currently finds itself in a phase of upheaval…[…] Climate science will have to get used to the fact that its comparatively privileged status will remain restricted when it comes to its access to media, general public and research funding. Its real influence on political action will hardly go beyond the extent that is usual in other political fields.”

"Michael Barrett (Letters, 9 July) calls upon the religions to join with ecologists to take action on climate change as it offers “a compelling cause” to tackle declining memberships. We are already on board. Since Pope Francis’s letter to the world, Laudato Si’, Catholics have been reflecting on how we can work for climate justice. Thousands of our churches now run on renewable energy, while thousands of parishioners have taken to the streets to demand political action. Last month, for instance, nearly 1,500 Cafod supporters joined people from other faith communities as part of a climate and environment lobby of parliament. Some 12,000 people of all faiths and none travelled from across the country to speak to more than 350 MPs about the political and economic decisions needed if the UK is to reach net-zero emissions. And faith leaders undertook a Walk of Witness down Whitehall to show our commitment to protecting creation and our poorest sisters and brothers – those who will pay the greatest price if we fail to urgently cut emissions.  So, people in faith communities are taking action. But not because it’s a membership drive. It’s because we hear the cry of the Earth and of the poor, who experience the injustice of climate change right now through lost lives and livelihoods. We care for our common home because it’s our moral duty to act.Christine AllenDirector, Catholic Agency for Overseas Development  • The government may be responding to the climate crisis like a “Dad’s Army” (Report, 10 July) but more than 120 local authorities led by all of the main political parties have declared that this really is a climate emergency and that they will go into battle with or without government support. Between us we have multibillion-pound budgets, cross party determination, increasing public support and some legislative powers. We are already building up some impressive examples of what can be done and are pooling our experience and expertise. But we can’t win the campaign our own: we need the government to send reinforcements, bringing legislation and resources to support renewable energy, zero-carbon building, public transport, carbon sequestration, action on biodiversity and much more.Cllr Kevin FreaCo-chair, UK Climate Emergency Network • Your coverage of the Committee on Climate Change’s report, with its stinging criticism of government failure to tackle climate change, does not sufficiently identify how the aviation industry needs to be held to immediate account. Given that parliament and many city councils and local authorities have declared a climate emergency, aviation should no longer be protected from scrutiny. The suggested action by the CCC is for a plan to be published limiting the increase in air traffic to 60%. This target is too generous, and is unattainable if all airports are allowed to expand as currently planned. It certainly does not enable the government to achieve net carbon neutrality. We call for no airport expansion, and for a process to begin to roll back existing flights. This could begin with the introduction of a frequent-flyer levy, banning short-haul flights, and forcing airlines to fly planes full (ie to share passengers and cancel low-density flights).

What is shocking is that the government, distracted by the not-so-smooth process of grappling with Brexit, still doesn’t appear to get it. By failing to see the problems with fracking despite all of the evidence, green-lighting climate-damaging infrastructure like more new roads, and blithely approving another runway at Heathrow, it’s clear the government has been resisting the hard and immediate policy work needed to kickstart a massive programme of change.

Many have been watching the gradual development of Andreas Rossi’s “E-Cat,” a device Rossi claimed to produce heat from fusing nickel and hydrogen at commonly used temperatures, as opposed to those in core of a star.

The next big event, the release of a paper reporting on a month-long test in March by a group independent from Rossi and his partner, Industrial Heat, happened today. The results are pretty much what I was expecting and essentially completely positive.
In a nutshell, the device produced so much energy that only a nuclear reaction can explain it, reaction products were seen, but no nuclear radiation was detected.
The test ran with an E-Cat cell in three phases:
1) no fuel charge
This was to verify the test setup measurement equipment could accurately measure both the electrical power into the cell and the heat released from the cell by convective heating and black body radiation.
2) approximately 800 W input power for 10 days, this produced some 1600 W excess power.
3) approximately 900 W for the rest of the test, this produced some 2300 W excess power.
This confirms what supporters expected. While the COP (ratio of output power to input power) was lower than expected, the authors make it clear that they deliberately ran the cell at low power to reduce the chance of thermal power.  They point out that the adding a little more than 100 W input power increased output by about 700 W.  That incremental amount is more in line with what was expected.
That’s mostly all that’s important – put power in, get significantly more power out. From what I’ve read, Industrial Heat has not yet used E-Cats to make high pressure steam and then electricity.  That may merely mean they haven’t settled on the mechanical design of the reactor, there’s no point in making a boiler until then.
The most interesting part of the report is the isotopic analysis of the fuel before the test run and the “ash” afterwards. The bottom line is that the reviewers have no idea what is happening during the test run.  They are utterly mystified and reject most of their speculation.
The fuel charge, only one gram, was assayed before the start of the test. The key components were determined to be nickel (Ni), lithium (Li), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), and hydrogen (H).  (Two assay methods found carbon (C) and oxygen (O), but the paper seems to dismiss them citing the tiny granules of powder they used.)  The Ni and H were expected per Rossi’s descriptions in the past.

He also referred to a catalyst, saying it was inexpensive and not an impediment to wide scale deployment. The assay suggests the catalyst is
LiAlH4 which releases monoatomic hydrogen when it is heated, fitting the speculation about the catalyst’s role.
Each element was found to have the naturally ocurring ratios of its isotopes.
There had been speculation that Rossi used nickel enriched with particular isotopes, but apparently not.
The ash after the test run was also assayed. The small samples involved seem to preclude measuring the actual weight of various isotopes, so the paper concentrates on the percentages.  It would have been nice to have accurate weights.
Natural nickel is primarily 58Ni and 60Ni. Those were nearly completely consumed, and the nickel in the ash was nearly all 62Ni.  I had expected Ni + H leading to Cu, but several of the relevant Cu isotopes are radioactive, 62Ni is stable.
Lithium may not be a catalyst at all – natural Li is nearly all 7Li, a surface assay of the ash showed the lithium was nearly all 6Li. I’m no nuclear physicist, I’ll refrain from any speculation.  The authors explore a couple paths, but ultimately throw up their hands and simply say more study is needed.  Hydrogen wasn’t assayed – did it even participate?
All in all, this is a great, maybe historic, result. There has been plenty of evidence that the E-Cat works, but Rossi has always been directly involved.
Now we have an independent team working in their own space and with tools from their universities. They see it work and present multiple lines of evidence confirming it is a nuclear process.
That there is no explanation for the process is annoying, but won’t block commercialization of the E-Cat. The shouting isn’t over, the science has barely begun, but we may be at the start of civilization’s next major energy source.
Interesting times.

"When Amanda Little was on tour to promote her 2010 book Power Trip: The Story of America’s Love Affair with Energy, she discovered something unusual. Despite the book’s focus on fossil fuels, her audience was overwhelmingly interested in one specific chapter – the one about food production. The people she spoke with were eager to learn about and even potentially reform their diets – they wanted to be more virtuous eaters. These conversations eventually led her to write her second book, The Fate of Food: What We’ll Eat in a Bigger, Hotter, Smarter World, released earlier this month. In her meticulously researched 352-page book, Little explores what it will take to continue feeding 7.5 billion people in a world where farming practices are becoming dangerously compromised due to the effects of a climate crisis – catastrophic droughts, record-breaking heatwaves, and wildly swinging weather systems. What began as an 18-month project ballooned into a five-year mission to understand an enormously complex, intricate and surprisingly emotional issue. I spoke to Little about her book, food systems on the brink of collapse, and what our meals might look like in 2050. At first glance, the topics of food and climate change may seem unrelated. What’s the connection? The single biggest threat of climate change is the threat to food systems. As an environmental reporter, that really surprised and intrigued me. I thought it was going to be flooding, I thought it was going to be drought, displaced populations, rising sea levels – that seemed to be how humanity was going to experience climate change, but I began to realize that the single biggest disruption across the board for everyone on this planet is going to be the changes, both subtle and radical, to food production. Are some of these changes already happening? Climate change is becoming something we can taste. I would be at a maize farm in Kenya, a cattle farm in Tennessee, an apple farm in Wisconsin, a coffee farm in Guatemala, a peach farm in Georgia – I mean I talked to so many farmers who were saying to me some variation of, “Climate change is something we can taste. This is affecting the way my fruits grow, this is affecting the way my vegetables grow, this is affecting the way my cows grow.” We think about climate change as something that is so diffuse and so remote, but this story is evident in the impact on these food systems. I felt like I had to tell the story and put a name to it as a real phenomenon in our midst. Many of us have deeply emotional connections to food. How does that manifest in terms of how we view this problem? Some of [these solutions] make people very uncomfortable, like “I’m not sure I want to live in a world where the only way we feed humanity meat is if we grow it in a bioreactor.” But let’s be realistic. I mean, it would be great if we could all subsist on $6 heirloom tomatoes, wouldn’t that be wonderful? But we have 7.5 billion people, so how are going to do that? That’s not something that makes people smile. If you can do your backyard farm and you have your chicken coop and that saves you time then power to you and you can totally continue to eat like that, and in no way are some of these other solutions going to threaten that, but we also have to have practical solutions that can scale for everyone. So, what is the solution then? I was really struggling with that question – how are we going to fix a failing food system if we can’t necessarily rely on a critical mass of backyard-farming vegetarians to do it from the ground up? I began to feel confused about what the realistic solutions really were and that some of the sustainable food movement and its rejection of large-scale food production and affordable food was unrealistic. People would like to hear that there’s one solution, but unfortunately it’s going to take many, many different approaches and require lots of technology, a shift in consciousness, self-control, respect for tradition, a deep understanding of how we’ve misapplied technology – it’s going to require a lot of different facets to this solution. It’s not a silver bullet, it’s a silver buckshot. But can we do it? Can we feed humanity sustainably and equitably by mid-century? Yes. But it’s going to look a lot different. So, let’s say we do course-correct and innovate and use this third-way agriculture to create a more sustainable, scalable way to feed the world. What would it look like? Can you walk us through what a typical American meal might look like in 2050? My hope is that it’s very similar to what we’re eating today. It’s the way that the food is grown and where it’s grown that has the potential to radically change. It may be that the meat we’re eating tastes as delicious as the meat we’ve eaten for many generations, except it didn’t come from a live animal, it came from either a plant-based protein or from cultured meat grown in a bioreactor. That’s very hard for people to relate to and accept, but right now we’re already seeing some versions of this. The burger that we’ve been eating from Burger King, the patty comes from this plant-based protein with synthetic blood - the Impossible Burger. It tastes just like a meat patty but its provenance has shifted. It’s very possible that we’ll continue to find a way to produce the foods we love most, it’ll just require very different growing methods. It is meat, the cells came from the animal, but they grew not attached to that animal, and without the sentience and without the bones and organs and without the potential suffering along the way.” Will we continue to eat Spanish tomatoes? Well, yes. That strain of heirloom tomatoes that came from Spain will continue to be in our diet, but instead of being grown in Spain they may have been grown in a vertical farm in Newark, the plant roots dangling in a mist of nutrients, and the sun not coming from the sun but from artificial lights. We may continue to grow corn in regions like western Kenya that depend on that as a staple crop, but they may have to be engineered or genetically edited to tolerate more heat, more drought, seasonal shift, new invasive insects. It is very possible that some of us will choose to tap into this hi-tech, very sci-fi style of nourishing yourself, like food pellets and food bars that are highly-specialized, personalized all-in-one meals that meet our specific nutritional needs. How about coffee? What does the future look like for caffeine addicts? The coffee plant is a very particular plant that likes its conditions just so. I visited some science labs in Ethiopia and there’s all this research going into these species of arabica coffee that have over many millennia, adapted to different environmental strains. For example, here is a gene which is native to one kind of coffee plant. Could we splice that gene into what is now a very dire strain of arabica coffee and give those plants the ability to withstand higher levels of heat, more drought, more sun exposure? How do we build resilience into the plant and help them adapt to these new pressures? From what I’ve seen, the scientists and the farmers and the consumers are so deeply committed to finding ways to continue producing this beloved crop, that they will find a way to do it. It’s just going to require much greater resilience, among the farmers themselves and the plants. On a final note, your book has a distinctly optimistic tone. Was that deliberate? I was always surprised that people would come away from the book feeling uplifted, because for me I was feeling like, “Oh my gosh, this problem is so serious that we’re doing these extreme things? I can’t believe this is really happening.” This is hard-won optimism. But the through-line in this story was about ingenuity and adaptation and survival. Story after story. Whether I was writing about robotic undersea lasers or GMOs or AI and robotic weeders or farmscrapers – along the way these were stories of adaptation and ingenuity in response to real problems. Maybe if we read these stories and we get a sense of how hopeful some of this adaptation and ingenuity is, we can also at the same time come to terms with how serious the problem is."

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday parts of the German mainstream media have begun reporting on the 9th Extreme Weather Conference in Hamburg, which began today and is slated to end on Friday. The direct link to the program-pdf here. Of course the focus of the Congress will be on the claimed “increasing frequency of extreme weather events”.
In all 3000 experts are attending, along with 2500 Hamburg school pupils.
What especially raises eye brows is the fact that the event is sponsored by the Munich Re reinsurer, the biggest in the world. The Munich-Germany-based reinsurer of course stands to profit handsomely from the spreading of extreme weather fear; it makes it it a lot easier to jack up premiums (see “Spiegel Online doubts the catastrophe scenarios of the Munich Re“).
Also very murky is the identity of the organizer of the Congress: Institute for Weather and Climate Communication” (IWK). At their Die kalte Sonne website here, German skeptics Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt looked into who is behind the mysterious IWK? They write:
The result is sobering: Apparently the institute really does not have its own Internet platform. So we took a look at the legal page of wetterspiegel.de. Here indeed the “Institute for Weather and Climate Communication GmbH” is given. Listed as the managing directors are Frank Böttcher and Alexander Hübener. Frank Böttcher? Indeed we’ve written about him as well: “Extreme weather “expert” Frank Böttcher does not not know about the latest literature: Latest research results on global cyclone activity are damaging is climate-alarmist business“. Without climate fear and extreme weather alarm, the number of visitors for the commercialized Extreme Weather Congress would certainly be limited. Thus it’s little wonder that Böttcher, because of promotional reasons, is fervently preaching climatic doomsday to attract visitors into his auditorium.”

Lüning and Vahrenholt also look at a list of persons slated to appear: “Paul Becker of the German Weather Service, a climate alarmist to the bone. Peter Höppe of the Munich Re reinsurer will attend the introductory press conference, thus getting his sponsoring money’s worth.”
No skeptic was invited to the present at the Extreme Weather Congress. For the second year in a row Lüning and Vahrenholt were denied the opportunity to present there.
Vahrenholt and Lüning also ask themselves whether Mojib Latif will be able to muster the courage to disclose some inconvenient things that up to now he only has quietly admitted in the scientific literature. See “Mojib Latif: the proof of an anthropogenic climate contribution is difficult because the natural ocean cycles dominated” and “Mojib Latif in the presentation in USA: CO2 sensitivity was set too high by the IPCC“.
There is a bit of hope: “honest broker” and alarmism-critic Hans von Storch has also been invited, and so maybe he will infuse a little sobriety into the Hamburg climate panic-fest, see “Climate scientist Hans von Storch: Climate models possibly do not take solar activity sufficiently into account” and “Judith Curry prognosticates warming pause until the 2030s: Hans von Storch in such a case demands a vote of no-confidence against CO2“.
Overall, however, in view of the sponsorship by the world’s biggest player in the re-insurance industry, the murkiness surrounding the event’s organizers, and their exclusion of scientists with other views and data, the event has everything to do with serving corporate special interests rather than those of science.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOne thing we can be predicted with very high certainty: On March, 20, 2015 most of Germany will see a partial yet substantial eclipse of the sun.
40 gigawatts of rated power blocked in just minutes!
Normally that would be no big deal. But for the first time in history, due to Germany’s massive installed solar capacity of 40 gigawatts, an eclipse of the sun could mean a collapse of Germany’s intense power grid, with possible ramifications for the European power network.

Animation: A. T. Sinclair/NASA (http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/.html)
Today’s print edition of Spiegel features an entire story on the coming event, should skies be clear. At it’s online site here it gives a preview of the upcoming event, writing:
The German power grid operators are dreading March 20, 2015. On this day Germany will see a partial solar eclipse during the morning. Should there be no clouds in the sky at this time, all solar power generating systems all over the country would be feeding in drastically less power into the grid in just a matter of minutes – and the grids would become dangerously destabilized.”
Already grid operators are scrambling to avoid such a scenario, and are considering refusing the feed in the power of large solar power plants on that day. Even though the eclipse will sweep across Europe around mid morning, a time well below peak solar power production, no large enough conventional back up system is on hand to react that quickly and that massively on such short notice. Another possibility would be to request large energy consumers in industry to scale back their consumption for the period the eclipse will have an impact.
German T-Online writes:
The shadow of the solar eclipse on March 20, 2015 will sweep across the North Atlantic. Thus in North Germany almost 83% of the sun will be blocked, so reports the website sonnenfinsternis.org. In South Germany it will still be at least 67%. Starting at 50 percent coverage, a solar eclipse is easy to notice.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew paper by Brandt et al on increased precipitation has been greening the Sahara since 1980. Yet another IPCC model projection that is headed off in the wrong direction. Hat-tip DkS.
Press Release No. 121/2014 of the University of Bayreuth, Germany  dated 30 June 2014. My emphasis:
==============
New research works show: Not global climate change alone, but rather foremost the local actions of people impact the face of the environment
Are the earth’s deserts continuously expanding? Or is green vegetation now spreading into regions that were once barren deserts? The West African section of the Sahel zone located at the southernmost edge of the Sahara, which extends from the Atlantic to the Red Sea, has been the source of reason for a wide variety of prognoses over the recent years. Extreme periods of drought during the 1970s and 1980s were considered as indices of growing desert regions across the globe. “Desertification” was the buzzword. However, over the last two decades a rise in precipitation has been observed across the West African Sahel. As a result there has been talk about the blanket perception that “the desert is greening”.
With this controversy as the backdrop, an international research team led by geographer Martin Brandt of the University of Bayreuth examined the vegetation development in the West African Sahel more closely. High and coarse resolution satellite data as well as wide range of measurement results from the last decades enabled conclusions to be drawn on climate and vegetation trends and field research brought regional and local particularities to light. Here some determinations were made: There is no uniform development in the West African Sahel. Not only the climate but also especially various forms of land-use – farming, forestry management or village development – are mostly responsible for the way the landscape there appears, and which resources it offers the people.
In the journal “remote sensing”researchers from Bayreuth (Germany), France, Spain and the Senegal report on their results. “The activity of man on location, for example the sustainable cultivation of selected green plants or the reforestation of forests, can impact the face of the landscape considerably,” says Martin Brandt. “Such initiatives and measures by the local population are far less dependent on large-scale climatic trends than what was earlier assumed. For this reason environmental and climate research should not be one-sidedly guided by blanket buzzwords such as ‘desertification’ or ‘greening Sahel’.”
Regional differences due to land and forest management – case studies in Mali and in the Senegal
Thanks to  satellite time series analyses , the scientists were able to determine that the vegetation density in the West African Sahel increased from 1982 to 2010. This development is especially pronounced in the Senegal and in western Mali. Here there are clear regional differences with respect to plants that have multiplied over time: Not only does one observe the wild growth of trees, bushes and grass, but also foremost the expansion of crops and plants due to farm and forest management measures. In total one notices that in the West African countries, with the exception of Gambia and the Ivory Coast, the forest levels have decreased markedly even though the vegetation density has increased as a whole.
The field research work by Martin Brandt (left) concentrated on two regions: the Senegal and Mali: The region surrounding the city of Bandiagara in southern Mali has seen a complete transformation of its vegetation over the last 50 years: Many tree and bush types that were still common in the 1960s have disappeared. Periods of drought did not alone damage the plants through a lack of water, but also it was because income from agriculture fell due to poor harvests, and so the people tried to compensate by felling trees and selling lumber. However in the meantime, a vegetation-rich landscape has since appeared – and not only because the precipitation amounts have been increasing for two decades and extended periods of droughts have failed to occur. “A targeted reforestation and planting of trees on agricultural land have changed the landscape considerably,” reports Brandt, and adds: “Without a sound botanical and ecological knowledge by the local population, this development would not have been possible.”
The transformation to an agricultural landscape  was also found by the scientists from Bayreuth at another region – one located in the Senegal, north of the city of Linguère. This region is mainly settled by nomads belonging to the Fulbe ethnic group who practice intensive pasture farming. In order to feed their livestock with leaves during dry periods, they cut or fell trees and bushes during dry periods. Nevertheless, state-sponsored reforestation and protective measures have led to a considerable increase in vegetation over the last two decades and it has become more adaptable to climate fluctuations. Today three especially robust tree types make up more than 90% of the vegetation found in the region surrounding Linguère. “Alone in the immediate proximity of the city there is a fenced-in area of at least 5000 hectares on which a special species of acacia has been placed,” says Martin Brandt. However he also points to the unmistakable damage in some places arising from the overuse of the tree stock. This completely bare ground is very difficult to regenerate – an example of how intervention into the vegetation by man can be destructive when it is not approached with ecological farsightedness.

Intervention by man stimulates a differentiated agricultural landscape – Plea for research without blanket buzzwords
The newly published scientific results refute the claims that the West Sahel is being hit by a growing desert that is a consequence of a global climate change. However they also refute the suggestion that the “greening of the desert” will take off by itself due to the increasing annual precipitation. The moderate trend reversal after a severe period of drought indeed does entail an increase in vegetation density. But it neither means a return to the conditions that existed before these extreme climatic events, nor does it automatically mean a widespread growth of green vegetation. Moreover, anthropogenic factors – and conversely their absence – have had a decisive impact on landscape and vegetation. Targeted farm and forest management measures that are oriented on scientific knowledge can significantly foster a differentiated man-made landscape.
Martin Brandt, who will soon receive his doctorate at the University of Bayreuth, also here sees reason for hope: “Should the climate prognoses of the UN IPCC do come true, the living conditions in some arid and semi-arid regions of West Africa – foremost in the region of the Sahel zone – will worsen. Appropriate concepts for land and forest management and for environmental protection however do offer the opportunity to adapt quickly enough to such climate developments in order to soften the impacts on poeple..”
International support project
The research works in Mali and in the Senegal were part of an international project: “Climate Change, Environmental Changes and Migration: Social-Ecological Conditions of Population Movements with the Example of the Sahel Countries Mali and Senegal (micle)”. The “micle” research project was funded from 2010 to April 2014 by the German Ministry for Education and Science (BMBF) and coordinated by the Institute for Social Ecological Research (ISOE) in Frankfurt. The Geographical Institute of the University of Bayreuth – together with the Institute for Geography and Regional Research of the University of Vienna – was involved as an associated partner. The leadership of the sub-project “Physical Geographical Perspectives ” was done by Prof. Dr. Cyrus Samimi, who today leads the research group for climatology at the University of Bayreuth. Prof. Dr. Martin Doevenspeck , Professor Regional-Related Conflict Research at the University of Bayreuth, was responsible for the sub-project “Social-Geographic Perspectives”.

"Has the Confederation of British Industry got its head in the sand, or in the record levels of carbon-intensive concrete just poured at the Hinkley C nuclear site (Build more nuclear reactors to help climate crisis, says CBI, 28 June)? Nuclear power, apart from destroying biodiversity throughout its life cycle, produces up to 37 times the CO2 emissions of renewable energy sources, owing partly to the mining and refining of uranium. The impact of this process on people and the environment is not included in the rationale for nuclear power in the UK. As the CBI looks for investment from abroad, UK taxpayers will pick up the bill for the likely time and cost overruns of new nuclear build under the regulated asset-based funding proposals so welcomed by the CBI. Nuclear has failed to achieve the investment needed so far because it is no longer seen as economically viable. Even Hitachi (one of the world’s largest multinationals) cannot magic Wylfa Newydd into a commercially viable business. In January this year, Hitachi announced it had failed to squeeze the UK government for the very high levels of subsidies desired by large investors upfront for Wylfa. Nobody can afford the costs or the many risks attached to building new nuclear power stations.Linda RogersPAWB (Pobl Atal Wylfa B/People Against Wylfa B)  • The doctors’ letter (Doctors against climate catastrophe, 28 June) omitted two key concerns. The first is that gas escapes from previously frozen deposits could outweigh reduced human emissions, so geo-engineering may yet be necessary. The second is the need for funding for useful actions that already exist. It is no use politicians declaring a climate emergency and then lacking the backbone to deal with it. If taxes (including mine) need to increase, then so be it. If this seems overly alarmist or they are unforgivably prepared to let the world’s poor go hang, MPs should remember just how much food Britain imports and ask exactly who would guarantee our supplies if major global disruption occurred.Iain ClimieWhitchurch, Hampshire"
"Record-breaking heat across Alaska is pushing tourists to beaches, and sending flames across the unseasonably hot, dry state. Anchorage experienced higher than average temperatures nearly every day of June, reaching a balmy 80F on days that once maxed out at a mild 67. The weather is forecasted to heat up further through and after the Fourth of July, with temperatures expected to climb to nearly 90F in Fairbanks and Anchorage over the weekend. If the forecasts are correct, the state could set several new local heat records before the week is out. Alaska’s heating has a cascading effect. As ocean temperatures rise, the coasts heat up, with potentially catastrophic consequences on land and in the water. And all that local heat contributes to faster planet-wide warming. Alaska is no stranger to large wildfires, and so far this year’s fire season is only slightly worse than average. But with about a quarter-million acres burned in roughly the last week, nearly 120 fires still uncontained, and the heat still rising, authorities aren’t taking any chances. With resources spread thin and fearing further sparks, the state fire marshal’s office issued a statewide ban on the sale and personal use of fireworks ahead of the holiday. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.  Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change. Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.  Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America. When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.  Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique last year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage. Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but our impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. With the ‘rapidly accelerating’ likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK, it is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather. Alaska is trapped in a kind of hot feedback loop, as the arctic is heating up much faster than the rest of the planet. Ocean surface temperatures upwards of 10F hotter than average have helped to warm up the state’s coasts. When Bering and Chukchi sea ice collapsed and melted months earlier than normal this spring, the University of Alaska climate specialist Rick Thoman characterized the water as “baking”. “I intentionally try to not be hyperbolic, but what do you say when there’s 10- to 20- degree ocean water temperature above normal?” Thoman told the Guardian. “How else do you describe that besides extraordinary?” The northern Bering & southern Chukchi Seas are baking. Large areas away from land with ocean surface temperatures more than 5C (9F) above the 1981-2010 average. Impacts to the climate system, food web, communities and commerce. #akwx #ClimateCrisis @Climatologist49 @amy_holman pic.twitter.com/HkrHpZGs8g The hot water has affected sea birds and marine life, with mass mortality events becoming commonplace in the region. The National Park Service characterizes Alaska’s increasingly frequent sea bird die-offs, called “wrecks”, as “extreme”. “The folks in the communities are saying these animals look like they’ve starved to death,” said Thoman. Accelerating ice melt stands to put the state’s coastal communities at risk, reshaping food sources the people rely on and the very land on which they live. Where there are no built roads, Alaskans rely on frozen ground as infrastructure for traveling. Less ice means less of the life that’s evolved to depend on that ice, both animal and human. “It’s really affecting people’s ability to provide for themselves and their families,” said Brendan Kelly, a University of Alaska marine biology professor and executive director of Study of Environmental Arctic Change. “The amount of time people have to fish, to hunt, to trap is shrinking from both ends.” Dozens of towns in Alaska are now or will soon be in need of relocation from eroding land and rising oceans. “Things are changing so rapidly in Alaska right now we just can’t keep up,” said Thoman."

Update: Read here.
This post is about an interview by the online Swiss Der Bund here with Swiss geology giant Christian Schlüchter titled: “Our society is fundamentally dishonest“. In it he criticizes climate science for its extreme tunnel vision and political contamination.
Geologist Sebastain Lüning sent me an e-mail where he writes: “This is probably the best interview from a geologist on climate change that I have read for a long while. My highest respect for Prof. Schlüchter.” Fritz Vahrenholt calls it “impressive”.

His discovery of 4000-year old chunks of wood at the edge of glaciers in Switzerland in the 1990s unintentionally thrust the distinguished geologist into the lion’s den of climate science. Today the retired professor and author of more than 250 papers speaks up in an interview.
Almost glacier-free Alps 2000 years ago
Early in the interview Schlüchter reminds us that during Roman times in the Alps “the forest line was much higher than it is today; there were hardly any glaciers. Nowhere in the detailed travel accounts from Roman times are glaciers mentioned.” He criticizes today’s climate scientists for focusing on a time period that is “indeed much too short“.
In the interview, Schlüchter recounts how he in the 1990s found a large chunk of wood near the leading edge of a glacier. The chunk of wood, he describes, looked as if it had been dragged across a cheese shredder. It was clear to Schlüchter that the specimen had to be very old. Indeed laboratory analysis revealed that it was 4000 years old. Next they found multiple wood fragments with the same age, all serving to fill in a major piece of the paleo-puzzle. His conclusion: Today where one finds the Lower Aare-Glacier in the Bernese Alps, it used to be “a wide landscape with a wildly flowing river“. It was warmer back then.
Until the 1990s, scientists thought that the Alps glaciers had been more or less consistently intact and only began retreating after the end of the Little Ice Age. Schlüchter’s findings showed that glacial retreats of the past also had been profound.
This threw climate science into chaos and it remains unreconciled today.
Ice-free 5800 of the last 10,000 years
But not all scientists were thrilled or fascinated by Schlüchter’s impressive discoveries. He quickly found himself the target of scorn. Swiss climate scientist Heinz Wanner was reluctant to concede Schlüchter’s findings. Schlüchter tells Der Bund:
I wasn’t supposed to find that chunk of wood because I didn’t belong to the close-knit circle of Holocene and climate researchers. My findings thus caught many experts off guard: Now an ‘amateur’ had found something that the Holocene and climate experts should have found.”
Schlüchter tells of other works, which also have proven to be a thorn to mainstream climate science, involving the Rhone glacier. His studies and analyses of oxygen isotopes unequivocally reveal that indeed “the rock surface had been ice-free 5800 of the last 10,000 years“.
Distinct solar imprint on climate
What’s more worrisome, Schlüchter’s findings show that cold periods can strike very rapidly. Near the edge of Mont Miné Glacier his team found huge tree trunks and discovered that they all had died in just a single year. The scientists were stunned.

The year of death could be determined to be exactly 8195 years before present. The oxygen isotopes in the Greenland ice show there was a marked cooling around 8200.”
That finding, Schlüchter states, confirmed that the sun is the main driver in climate change.
Today’s “rapid” changes are nothing new
In the interview he casts doubt on the UN projection that the Alps will be almost glacier-free by 2100, reminding us that “the system is extremely dynamic and doesn’t function linearly” and that “extreme, sudden changes have clearly been seen in the past“. History’s record is unequivocal on this.
Schlüchter also doesn’t view today’s climate warming as anything unusual, and poses a number of unanswered questions:
Why did the glaciers retreat in the middle of the 19th century, although the large CO2 increase in the atmosphere came later? Why did the earth ‘tip’ in such a short time into a warming phase? Why did glaciers again advance in 1880s, 1920s and 1980s? […] Sooner or later climate science will have to answer the question why the retreat of the glacier at the end of the Little Ice Age around 1850 was so rapid.”
On science: “Our society is fundamentally dishonest”
CO2 fails to answer many open questions. Already we get the sense that hockey stick climate claims are turning out to be rather sorrowful and unimaginative wives’ tales. He summarizes on the refusal to acknowledge the reality of our past: “Our society in fundamentally dishonest“.
“Helping hands for politicians”
In the Der Bund interview Schlüchter describes a meeting in England that turned him off completely. The meeting, to which he was “accidentally” invited, was led by “someone of the East Anglia Climate Center who had come under fire in the wake of the ‘Climategate’ e-mails“:
The leader of the meeting spoke like some kind of Father. He was seated at a table in front of the those gathered and he took messages. He commented on them either benevolently or dismissively. Lastly it was about tips on research funding proposals and where to submit them best. For me it was impressive to see how the leader of the meeting collected and selected information. For me it also gets down to the credibility of science. […] Today many natural scientists are helping hands of politicians, and no longer scientists who occupy themselves with new knowledge and data. And that worries me.”
Schlüchter adds that the reputation of science among young researchers is becoming more damaged the more it surrenders to politics. He indirectly blasts IPCC chief scientist Thomas Stocker:
Inventing the devil was one of man’s greatest inventions ever achieved. You can make a lot of money when you paint him on the wall.”
Northern hemisphere still gripped in ice age mode
Schlüchter also says that the northern hemisphere is still in the ice age mode and that the glaciers during the Roman times were at least 300 to 500 meters higher than today. “The mean temperature was one and half degree Celsius above that of 2005. The current development is nothing new in terms of the earth’s history.”
At the end of the interview Schlüchter says that solar activity is what is sitting at the end of the lever of change, with tectonics and volcanoes chiming in.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooks like yet another model projection is about to join that now overflowing mass grave of failed climate and weather model projections. The latest to join it is the projection that 2014 would bring a “super El Niño”, and with it, the warmists are hoping, a new global temperature record.
At Weatherbell Joe Bastardi has posted his latest Saturday Summary and in it he shows us why all of it is looking more like super El Hypo. Currently the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is positive, which, Joes says, makes it unlikely a “super El Niño” is in the pipeline this year. He says the current SOI value “has nothing to do” with a super El Niño.
At the 5:45 mark he shows the SOI plot of 1997, when it was seriously negative, dipping below -20.
He compares the 1997 SOI with today’s situation:

2014 SOI positive in June. Image cropped from Weatherbell Saturday Summary, 7 June 2017.
Currently, it’s still in positive territory, not what would expect to see in June! Joe then adds:

You need three months of plus 2°C or greater in the ENSO 3/4 and we just don’t see that and neiter do the models really.”

The charts show that there is no similarity with the event of 1997/98, and the current situation resembles more 2002 and 2009. The south Pacific is showing a cold PDO signature which “cuts the feet out from under” a developing El Niño.

Arctic ice poised for impressive rebound
At the 10:30 minute mark, the NWS/NCEP/CPC forecast shows how Arctic sea ice is projected to be above normal by late summer, something that has been unseen since 1996.
If that forecast should indeed pan out, then naturally skeptics are going to have a major field day with this. Just warning!
The NWS/NCEP/CPC forecast is even surprising Joe:
It’s forecast to stay above normal for 5 months at the height of the melt season. That has not happened since the AMO flipped from cold to warm back in the mid 90s. And that’s our theory that the Atlantic Decadal Oscillation, not CO2, that is controlling what the Arctic ice is doing – the bulk of the Arctic ice.”
With the latest projection, the warmists absolutely must be in major panic mode right now and gearing for major damage control. Expect them to be concocting some wacky explanation for this. I can hear it already: Warming causes more Arctic ice after all! The circus that climate science is becoming is taking on ever more impressive dimensions.
In summary, Antarctic sea ice is above normal, the Arctic is projected to be above normal this summer, and the super El Niño is turning out to be nothing but super el hypo.
Though the 2014 will end as a relatively warm year, it very very likely won’t be warm enough to end the streak in the warming gone AWOL, which is now close to being 18 years long. Moreover, El Niños are usually followed by (cool) La Niñas. The situation for the warmists is looking increasingly dire.

"Kenya has been urged to halt construction of the country’s first ever coal-powered plant near the coastal town of Lamu, until an assessment is made of its environmental and cultural impact, in the latest setback to the $2bn project (£1.6bn). Plans for the 981MW station, backed by a Chinese-led consortium, are in limbo after Kenyan judges revoked the environmental licence at the end of June. They ruled the authorities had failed to carry out a rigorous environmental assessment and to inform local people of potential impacts.  Environmental campaigners – who took Amu Power and the Kenyan National Environment Management Authority to court over the station – hailed the ruling as a victory for grassroots lobbying. They had argued that the adverse effect the plant would have on local fishermen and farmland had not been considered. Unesco’s World Heritage Committee, in a meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan this week, called on Kenya to revise the environmental assessments of the coal plant and to consider the potential impact of pollution on the “fragile” stone buildings of Lamu old town, a 14th-century tourist destination and world heritage site. If Kenya fails to submit a new environmental impact statement by February 2020, Lamu could be added to its list of world heritage sites in danger, the committee said. Activists say the plant could trigger breathing problems for locals and acid rain as well as increase Kenya’s total greenhouse gas emissions by 700%. The plans lie in contrast to Kenya’s existing commitment to fighting the climate emergency, including generating two-thirds of its electricity by renewable sources and reducing its carbon footprint by a third by 2030. The fossil fuel plant was an example of the dilemmas faced by developing countries with rich environmental and cultural resources, activists said at the Unesco meeting. “One of the challenges Africa faces is the pursuit to modernise with large development projects as well as rapid and unplanned urbanisation that destroys rich cultural resources. Lamu is a key example of this,” said Mohammed Athman, a board member of Kenyan environmental organisation Save Lamu.  The US ambassador to Kenya, Kyle McCarter, has been widely criticised by activists for wading into the debate to argue that coal is environmentally sound, that the plant would boost the country’s economy and that a critical analysis of the project by a US thinktank amounted to the work of “highly paid protesters”. “Coal is the cleanest, least costly option,” the Trump-appointed former Republican senator in Illinois wrote on Twitter, ahead of the ruling on the 26 June. He also cited his experience with coal in his home state as evidence that fossil fuel would work well in Kenya. Mithika Mwenda, the executive director of Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, one of many groups opposing the initiative, raised concerns over the ambassador’s “absurd” comments. “What interest does the US have in the coal-fired project?” Mwenda said in a statement. “How will the economy grow if the Kenyan taxpayer is going to be subjected to hugely unsustainable debts, even before we can start producing power?” In sharp contrast to McCarter’s comments, the Chinese ambassador to Kenya told opponents of the plant on 28 June that he supported the will of the Kenyan people on whether or not they want a coal-fired station, according to a Kenyan newspaper.  A US state department official told the Guardian that the US backs an approach that takes into account “all forms of energy”, including renewables, and stressed electricity must be affordable and reliable to attract investment. “American companies and investors are ready to partner with Kenya to help them achieve an affordable and reliable power grid, in all forms of energy, to support the exponential growth expected in Kenya’s prosperous future using whichever source they choose,” the official said. Construction on the plant was due to begin in 2015, but has been subject to many delays, partly due to opposition from environmentalists. The backers of the initiative say it will help address Kenya’s frequent blackouts and secure energy needs by increasing energy output by nearly a third and generating power that would cost half of what consumers currently pay. But last month, a US thinktank said electricity will cost 10 times more than currently planned. Amu Power has said electricity from the plant will cost $0.072 a kW. However, the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in an independent study – the most comprehensive on the station’s cost so far – that the cost projections of the project are “unrealistically low”. It said the project would cost consumers more than $9bn, even if the station never generates any power, and recommended it be cancelled. The station could still be revived if a new environmental assessment addresses the concerns laid out in the June decision. Those defending the plan were given 30 days to appeal."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Salzburg Austria ORF site here writes: “Despite climate change, winters in the Salzburg mountains over the past 30 years have not gotten warmer, rather they have gotten colder.”
0.9°C drop since 1984
The ORF site writes that this is based on a study commissioned by the Schmittenhöhe Bahnen. The ORF site adds: “Independent meteorologists confirmed the trend“. The study elaborates further:
The mean temperature over the winter months at Schmittenhöhe has fallen  0.9°C since 1984. That is from minus 3.8 to minus 4,7 percent.”
Obviously the ORF writer was sloppy here and likely meant “degrees Celsius”, and not “percent”.
“Surprising result”
The ORF also writes that the Schmittenhöhe Bahnen – who commissioned the study – reacted by saying it is “a surprising result”. Board Chairman Erich Egger says he is relieved that winters have not gotten warmer and that the future of the ski industry is intact.

However the ORF quotes meteorologist Bernd Niedermoser of the Salzburg Weather Service, who reminds that there has been “a significant warming” over the last 130 years and that it occurs in cycles, and that there will always be “periods where it will be colder for a short time.”
Tell it to the modelers.
More snow thanks to “global warming” 
Meanwhile Austrian site www.nachrichte.at writes that precipitation at the Pyhrn-Priel and Dachstein regions during the winter season has increased – in the form of snow. On the precipitation, it writes:
And because it is transported over to us by cold air masses from the North Sea, it comes down 90% as snow already at 1100 meters elevation.”
Yet, the Austrian alarmists refuse to let go of their climate change horror scenarios, insisting that by 2050 the “skiing fun will end” because of runaway global warming”.  The site sought out the opinion of Jürgen Schmude, Economics Geographer at the University of Munich:

Austria’s ski resorts could lose up to 30 days per year by then, should the average temperature indeed increase by 2°C.

By Ed Caryl
This is my comment on the Vienna Climate Waltz article Pierre just posted. I found the Vienna temperature data from GISS. It is listed under Wien/Hohe War, whatever that is.
My map application drops the pin nearly in the center of downtown from the GISS latitude and longitude numbers (which are notoriously inaccurate). The data file is complete from 1880 to the present, which is unusual. There are only two files in the GISS database, GHCN data before and after GISS homogenization. Here is a plot of those two files.

Figure 1 is a plot of Vienna annual temperature data before and after GISS homogenization, with the difference (the green trace). The difference scale is on the right, all scales in °C.
The homogenization has warmed the past and left the last 10 years unadjusted. This is unusual, as GISS usually cools the past and warms the present with their adjustments. The adjustment is probably for urban heat island effects, though they should be cooling the present and leaving the past alone.

Figure 2 is a plot of the last 16 years with trend lines.
There is a tenth of a degree adjustment for homogenization in the years 1998, 1999, and 2000. These adjustments change the cooling trend by more than 50%.

Curious George requested a 10-year average plot. Here is a centered 9-year average plot on the annual data. (It preserves the time accuracy better.)

Figure 3 is the annual homogenized temperatures with a 9-year centered average.


Figure 4 is a plot of seasonal temperatures (homogenized data).
While all seasons have gotten warmer in the last century, winter has the largest variation, but not much of a trend. I didn’t add the trends to Figure 4, but the numbers are: spring 1.29°/century, summer 1.41°/century, fall 0.73°/century, and winter 1.14°/century.

Figure 5 is a plot of the seasonal trends over the last 16 years.
The cooling in the last 16 years is all from the winters getting colder, at -0.382°C per decade.

"Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, may have described the G20 summit as a success on Saturday afternoon, but the two days that the leaders of the world’s 20 richest economies spent in the rainy-season humidity of Osaka also magnified deep and potentially unbridgeable divides on everything from climate change to the future of western liberalism. The G20 nations, Abe said, “have a responsibility to squarely face global problems and to come up with solutions through frank dialogue”. Their communique, which had looked in doubt 24 hours earlier as the EU and the US sparred over how to describe the climate crisis, went some way towards meeting his demands.  Their compromise enabled 19 of the 20 leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the Paris agreement, but left enough room for Washington to attempt to justify its increasing isolation from the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a reference to the harm it would inflict on “American workers and taxpayers”. The “frank dialogue” Abe craved proved more problematic, however. The opening day of the summit was overshadowed by the China-US trade war, the presence of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman, and for British audiences at least, Theresa May’s confrontation with Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury novichok poisonings. Putin had already angered Donald Tusk, among others, by declaring in a Financial Times interview published at the start of the summit that liberalism was obsolete. It was a theme he returned to on Saturday evening, when he claimed that immigration had infringed on other people’s rights, and attributed Trump’s 2016 election victory to disenchantment with mainstream liberal ideals. “The liberal idea has started eating itself,” Putin told reporters in Osaka. “Millions of people live their lives, and those who propagate those ideas are separate from them. People live in their own country, according to their own traditions, why should it happen to them?” But as the G20 leaders headed home, there was also cause for cautious optimism. Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, stepped back from the trade war precipice – at least for now – during their highly anticipated meeting, while all but one of the G20 leaders decided not to cross French president Emmanuel Macron’s “red line” on the climate crisis and included a reference to their “irreversible” obligations under the Paris agreement. There was also a commitment to stop adding to plastic waste pollution of the world’s oceans by 2050. Inevitably, it was left to Donald Trump to take some of the sheen off Japan’s first G20 summit with a Saturday morning tweet that set off speculation he was about to meet North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, along the heavily armed peninsula that has divided the Korean peninsula for 55 years. Trump proposed that he and Kim leader meet at the demilitarised zone [DMZ] to shake hands and “say hello” during his visit to South Korea on Sunday. After some very important meetings, including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea (with President Moon). While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?)! North Korea described the offer as very interesting, but said it had yet to receive an official invitation. “I am of the view that if the [North Korea-US] meetings take place on the division line, as is intended by President Trump, it would serve as another meaningful occasion in further deepening the personal relations between the two leaders and advancing the bilateral relations,” North Korea’s KCNA news agency quoted the country’s first vice foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, as saying. Trump told reporters: “We’ll be there and I just put out a feeler because I don’t know where he is right now. He may not be in North Korea. If he’s there, we’ll see each other for two minutes, that’s all we can, but that will be fine.” He said he would have no problem stepping into North Korea if he met Kim for a handshake and to “say hello”. Trump stepping over the line of demarcation separating North and South Korea would be hugely symbolic, echoing a similar gesture made by the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in – with Kim’s encouragement – when they met at the DMZ last year. “Sure I would, I would. I’d feel very comfortable doing that. I’d have no problem,” Trump said, adding that he believed Kim followed his Twitter account. “I guess he does because we got a call very quickly,” he said. If Kim accepts the invitation it will be the leaders’ first meeting since their denuclearisation summit in Hanoi in February ended without an agreement. Some North Korea watchers interpreted Choe’s comments as a sign that the meeting will go ahead. Commenting on the KCNA reports, John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, tweeted: “Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is North Korean for ‘yes’”. The South’s presidential Blue House said nothing had been confirmed at this point and added: “Our position, which hopes for a dialogue between the US and North Korea to take place, remains unchanged.” Trump and Kim have met twice, first in Singapore last June and again in Hanoi in February. Neither summit has produced a comprehensive agreement that would see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief. But a photo opportunity on the DMZ, no matter how symbolic, is unlikely to go far in resolving their differences on denuclearisation, according to Scott Seaman, director of Eurasia Group Asia. “For talks to have real legs, either Kim must credibly commit to denuclearisation or Trump must credibly agree to allow Kim to keep some of his nuclear weapons,” Seaman said. “Without a shared end goal, creating a viable roadmap to reaching it will remain impossible.” Hours after making his impromptu overture to Kim – and months after their denuclearisation summit in Hanoi ended in failure – Trump emerged from a meeting with Xi to declare that US trade negotiations with China were “right back on track”. He said the US would not impose further tariffs in an ongoing trade war that other world leaders had said could threaten the global economy, and added that the world’s two biggest economies would restart negotiations on a trade deal. The US president told a press conference that he and his Chinese counterpart had had a “great meeting”. “We will continue to negotiate, and I promise that at least for the time being we won’t be adding additional [tariffs] … We’re going to work with China to see if we can make a deal. China will consult with us and will be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural products, and they’re going to start doing that almost immediately.” Trump had said at the start of the meeting that he was open to a “historic fair trade deal” with China. “We are totally open to it,” he told Xi, who called for “cooperation and dialogue” instead of confrontation. Trump added: “We want to do some things that will even it up with respect to trade. We were very close but something happened where it slipped up a little bit,” in a reference to the failure of previous talks. In their declaration, the G20 leaders avoided criticism of Trump-style protectionism but committed themselves to realising “free, fair and non-discriminatory” trade and to “keep our markets open”."
"Two of Britain’s biggest energy suppliers are accelerating the drive towards greener vehicles by pledging to replace their existing fleet of vans with all-electric models by 2030. British Gas owner Centrica and SSE have committed to switch to electric cars and vans a decade ahead of the government’s ban on the sale of new combustion engine vehicles. British Gas will electrify its 12,500 vans, the third largest fleet of vehicles in the UK, to transport its 15,000 engineers across the country to customer homes. SSE said it would switch its 3,500 vehicles, the UK’s seventh biggest fleet of cars, to electric models, and install charging points for its 21,000 employees. The two companies – among the UK’s big six energy providers – will sign up to the pledge, organised by the Climate Group, alongside facilities management firm Mitie, which has signed up to a softer target. Mitie plans to switch 20% of its 3,500-strong car and van fleet to electric by 2020 and will install 800 charging points.  The Climate Group said the latest pledges mean 49 companies have agreed to remove more than 2m petrol and diesel vehicles from the world’s roads by 2030. Helen Clarkson, the pressure group’s chief executive, said: “These companies are sending a clear message that the direction of travel for transport is electric, inspiring their staff and customers to follow. Every major business must do the same.” The group is also calling on companies to double their energy productivity by 2030, by increasing energy efficiency and reducing energy waste. SSE has signed up to the energy efficiency pledge and said it has already reduced the energy use at its data centres by more than a fifth since 2016. Brian McLaren, a director at SSE, said the pledges were part of the company’s ambition to “deliver low carbon infrastructure in a sustainable way”. “Decarbonisation is at the heart of what we do and low-carbon emissions from transport is critical if the UK is to meet its net zero targets,” he said. Mitie has promised to keep replacing its cars and vans with electric options between 2020 to 2030, but said its progress would depend on the availability and affordability of vehicle charging infrastructure. Simon King, Mitie’s fleet director, said the interim 2020 target was still “an important step in the effort to combat climate change”. “It is challenging, but we all need to take responsibility for actions and commit to change,” he said. “We want to ensure our sizeable fleet is as green and sustainable as possible and show other companies that making the switch to electric vehicles is the right thing for their people, the planet and their pockets,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online India Today here reports that India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday:
Climate has not changed. We have changed. Our habits have changed. Our habits have got spoiled. Due to that, we have destroyed our entire environment,” he said while addressing students and replying to their questions through video conferencing in the first-ever initiative.”
Hat-Tip Tom Nelson at Twitter.
Alarmist climatologist Stefan Rahmstorf of the end-of-world-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) responded angrily at Twitter, as the German-government-funded scientist called the statement “very depressing” and accused the Prime Minister of “denial about reality”:

When considering climate on larger timescales, Prime Minister Modi is actually very correct in claiming that climate has not really changed when viewed on a millennial or centennial scale, as the Earth’s temperature is well within the Holocene temperature range. Over the short term climate is always changing, and many scientists attribute much of the change over the last 100 years to natural factors. There are hundreds of peer-reviewed papers supporting this. Unfortunately, these papers were mostly ignored by the UN IPCC.
The big climate change that Rahmstorf is talking about is what one finds in the climate model projections. Rahmstorf seems to be confusing the model world with reality and observations.
The models have come under increasingly massive criticism as 97% have over-projected global temperature increase for the last 15 years.
Concerning whether the planet is warming, the online India Today adds that it is an “issue that is being debated at various multilateral fora”.

"The challenge the Morrison government faces in meeting future climate targets without new policies is underlined by an analysis that breaks down how significantly greenhouse gas emissions are increasing from transport, natural gas and coalmining. Since 2005, the year against which the government has chosen to benchmark its Paris target, Australia’s emissions from transport are up 23%. Pollution from burning fossil fuels – mainly natural gas, but also coal – in manufacturing, construction and domestic heating has risen 30%. “Fugitive” emissions released during liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing and coalmining have jumped 55%. Other parts of the economy are getting cleaner – emissions from electricity generation, which is still the biggest chunk of national emissions at about a third, are down 10%. There have been smaller cuts from agriculture, waste and industrial processes. But the analysis of government data by Hugh Saddler, an energy consultant and ANU honorary associate professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy, suggests Australia cannot meet the target it set at the Paris climate summit without policies to address where emissions are rising substantially. He said at the moment the government does not have any. “They absolutely don’t have any policy to stop emissions rising from transport and in the other areas such as LNG and coal exports the policy is to actually encourage them to grow – the government would like to think they would keep going up and up,” Saddler said. The data is contained in Saddler’s latest national emissions audit, which is published by progressive research group the Australia Institute. Australia’s total emissions are now estimated to be 12.7% less than they were in 2005. They have increased each year since 2015, when they were 14.5% below the benchmark year. The Coalition’s target is a 26-28% cut by 2030. Saddler said it showed why the Morrison government was pushing hard to use what are known as carryover credits to meet its Paris target. The credits represent the amount Australia expects to finish ahead of its 2020 target under the previous climate deal, the Kyoto Protocol. Several countries – notably members of the Association of Small Island States such as Tuvalu – challenged Australia at United Nations climate talks in Bonn, Germany last week over its plan to use carryover credits. The European Union and New Zealand are among others opposed to their use. Opponents say using carryover credits would effectively reduce Australia’s 2030 target to a 16% cut. They say carryover credits are merely a reflection that Australia set easy-to-meet targets under the Kyoto Protocol – a pollution increase between 1990 and 2010, then a 5% cut between 2000 and 2020 – and that all countries will need to drop accounting tricks and make much deeper cuts if the world is to limit global heating to as close to 1.5C as possible. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said using carryover credits was the most egregious example of the Coalition government’s contempt for the international climate system. “Australia is isolated as the only OECD country pushing to exploit this loophole,” he said. A recent policy brief by the Investor Group on Climate Change says carryover credits were included in the initial Kyoto deal as an incentive for ambitious countries to go beyond their formal targets. In reality, it has just rewarded countries that set weak targets, such as Australia and Russia. It is still unclear how carryover credits will be treated under the Paris deal. Countries are expected to explain how they will meet their targets and – unless there is a unanimous agreement to ban carryover credits – they could technically just include them. But they would be likely to face increasing criticism. The Paris agreement also says countries will become more ambitious over time and that their commitments will reflect their “highest possible ambition”. Opponents say carryover credits do not fit this definition as they transparently weaken a target. When asked about carryover credits, the government says Australia has made “responsible, achievable and balanced commitments” to reduce emissions and has a strong track record in meeting and beating its targets. The minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, has also argued that the growth in emissions from Australia’s rapidly expanding LNG industry should be seen as a positive as the gas would be reducing the amount of coal burned in Asia. The Saddler report suggests this makes little sense given the government is also supporting a significant expansion of coalmining in Queensland. Saddler said there was a possibility that emissions could be reduced where they are currently growing through state government and city-based policies and changes in technology and on international markets. He gives the example of electric vehicles, which are expected to be cost competitive with petrol cars by 2025. “One of the things we can hope for is that technological change comes along in the absence of any government policy,” he said. A government policy document released before the election estimated by 2030 about 100m tonnes of emissions reduction would come from unspecified “technology improvements and other sources of abatement”. Other trends in the report include: Queensland has the highest emissions in the country. Emissions grew in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory between 2014 and 2017 while falling everywhere else. National emissions would have been expected to increase even more this year were it not for the devastating drought and floods in eastern Australia that killed huge numbers of sheep and cattle. Diesel fuel emissions surged 50% between 2011 and 2018, increasing significantly both on the road and in power generation at mining sites. But diesel use has fallen each month since December despite no obvious change in policy. If that continues for the rest of the year, it will be the first time it has happened since 1990-91 – the low point of Australia’s last economic recession."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe dispute over windpark development on some of Germany’s most idyllic landscapes is heating up rapidly and massively. And should the dispute continue on its current trajectory, it won’t be long before the ugly contraptions get stopped for good.
The dispute reached a boiling point recently with windpark opponents suspecting green energy activists of poisoning birdlife in order clear the way for an unobstructed windpark permitting.
According to south Germany’s online Stuttgarter Nachrichten, a number protected red kites have been found poisoned by the E 605 herbicide – in rural areas that just happen to be sited for the installation of large-scale industrial windparks.
Under Germany’s wildlife protection laws, wherever the predatory red kites are found to be nesting, green energy developers are promptly denied permits to install their turbines. But if red kites are nowhere to be seen, then wind-park developers stand a far better chance of getting the go-ahead. Angry windpark opponents are now pointing the finger at the windpark proponents for the poisoning. The Stuttgarter Nachrichten writes, however, that there’s no proof.
The Stuttgarter Nachrichten writes that a number of poisoned red kites were found at several locations in southwest Germany.
‘Systematically’ rare predatory birds are being killed wherever they find themselves in the way of large windparks, some wind-power critics are now surmising. That in the recent days in Pfalzgrafenweiler in the district of Freudenstadt also a dead peregrine falcon has been found, which according to police died from chloralose, just makes the situation more explosive.”
But windpark proponents are calling the accusations unfounded, and claim that poisoning the birds would even have the opposite effect: The bird would be put higher up on the endangered list, and thus make permitting of wind turbines even more unlikely. Other “green” activists call the accusations “speculation”.
The Stuttgarter Nachrichten ends its article writing that one fact is certainly beyond speculation: “The gloves have come off when it comes to the dispute over the transition to green energies.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere’s no doubt Europe’s 2014/15 winter was a mild one, which was welcome as the continent had reeled from a string of 5 consecutive colder than normal winters in a row, from 2008 to 2013.
Unfortunately we cannot say the same for spring this year, at least so far. A blast of cold air is now gripping much of the continent and people in many areas this morning are waking up to snow (see here).
This is no April Fool’s prank
Worse, the cold snap is expected to continue through Easter. This morning the online Pforzheimer Zeitung (Pforzheim Newspaper) writes that Good Friday will see “snowfall down to the flatlands” as cold polar air refrigerates Europe. “At 5 kilometers elevation in the atmosphere, -40°C will prevail…”. (Obviously the extra CO2 won’t be trapping a whole lot of heat up there.)
At Twitter Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann this morning reminded followers and mocked how just two weeks ago a number of weather experts had predicted a warm spring for March, April, May”. Kachelmann is a noted harsh skeptic on long-term seasonal forecasts, claiming they are hardly worth the paper they are printed on.
On the other hand Joe Bastardi in an earlier Saturday Summary predicted weeks ago that cold would grip Europe at the end of March, early April. Dead on!
German WDR public broadcasting this morning reported “numerous car accidents” due to “snow and ice” on streets and motorways in the state of North Rhine Westphalia. The Schwäbische.de here reports of snowfall causing problems in Bavaria, southern Germany. The online Stuttgarter Nachrichten writes that the month of April has started with snow for Germany’s southwestern state of Baden Wurttemberg.
Wetter.de has posted an animation of the air flow across Europe over the next five days. A large high off the coast in the Atlantic in combination with a powerful low over eastern Scandinavia will be pumping masses of polar air through Europe. By Sunday, one sees that a white Easter is a real possibility – an event that rarely occurs in Central Europe. German DWD Weather Service forecasts snow at higher elevations over Easter, with nighttime temperatures falling to as low as -4°C, reports web.de.
The snow and cold fly in the face of global warming alarmists predictions of springtime arriving earlier and earlier. Climate alarmist Potsdam Institute scientist Friedrich-Wilhelm Gerstengarbe told German ZDF television two years ago that spring would be arriving earlier and earlier – because of global warming.
Of course the cold is due to the prevailing weather patterns, just as was the case for the mild winter. It has nothing to do with climate change, as global warming alarmists often would have us believe.

"‘We need to reduce our capacity and urge to consume’  Month after month, there is research showing that climate change is happening faster than we thought. We’re in a car hurtling towards the edge of a cliff, we’ve got our foot on the accelerator, and we’re just talking to each other, faffing about. If anything, some of us are even putting the foot further down. What we need to do is stop the car and get out. That has become increasingly clear to me in the last couple of years, which is why I’ve made changes to my own lifestyle. These all come from the research we’ve been doing at my work, and it’s all based on climate science. The first – and the hardest for many people – is flying. The evidence is clear that, as far as the climate is concerned, we should keep to one return short-haul flight every two to three years. So it’s not that I can’t see the world – I could still go abroad at least another 10 times in my life – it’s just that I can’t go to Istanbul for the weekend. I’ve been vegetarian since I was about 15, and pretty much vegan for a year. It’s important that everybody goes close to vegetarian, and ideally vegan. Not just that: it’s also important that we stop eating so much. The average European eats 3,500 calories a day, which is too much. The planet has had to provide all those unnecessary calories. It’s not just about climate change: if you look at land use change, biodiversity loss, fertilisers in the ocean creating dead zones, the massive extinction and loss of insects due to pesticides – these problems are all driven by food. I’ve also reduced the volume of new clothing that I buy. The average European buys 24 new items every year. That needs to come down – based on my team’s research, I’m aiming for three. I can still keep my wardrobe alive through secondhand, recycled, upgraded, swapped or rented clothes. C40 is a network bringing together the world’s biggest cities, helping them do the best they can on climate. About a year ago, we conducted some research looking at the impact of consumption. Our ever-growing economy in turn requires never-ending growth in consumption. One of the best things you can do to address climate change is go down to a four-day working week. This would take some of the heat out of our ever-expanding economies, reduce our capacity and urge to consume, and create space to live a more balanced life. I plan to do this in the near future. If it means I’m earning a bit less and spending a bit less, but I’ve got a bit more time on my hands, then that’s great. The massive caveat is that many people in Britain and around the world don’t have enough; but those of us with high consumption lifestyles need to balance it out. The main responsibility will always be with large business and governments to fix the mess we’re in, but we’re now at a point where it’s so late that we need action from everyone. You’re not disempowered just because you’re small, and politicians won’t move until we do. Each person can make change happen, so why not do it? • Tom Bailey, head of sustainable consumption at C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group ‘It would be hypocritical for me to carry on flying to conferences’ I’ve worked on climate change for nearly 25 years. My first degree was in marine biology and I went on to study warming in the Southern (Antarctic) Ocean, simulating future climates. Now my specialism is land use, agriculture and climate change – not just in terms of emissions from the food that’s produced, but also the impact of climate change on our food system, and the uptake of carbon from the atmosphere by soils, trees and vegetation. But it was when I started doing a lot of research on household emissions and individual action that I began to make changes on a personal level. I gave up flying in 2004. I’d just published a paper looking at the carbon emissions that come from climate scientists like me attending conferences, which academics do a lot. It would have been hypocritical for me to flag up flying as the major part of my carbon footprint, and then carry on doing it. I have two children. Our holidays now tend to be in Scotland and northern England. We went to Amsterdam the year before last, travelling by train and ferry, and the kids have enjoyed those longer trips. Maybe they’ll gripe at me when I’m in my rocking chair, saying, “Dad, you never took us to Disney World, Florida and I’m in counselling for it now”, but I suspect they won’t. My youngest, Molly, who is 12, has been involved in the school climate strikes. She was proud to go on the march. For a lot of kids these days, you stand out if you’re not taking action. As a family, we’ve been vegetarian for about six months. We’d already been cutting down on meat, but Molly was the one who pushed it further – she’s pretty much vegan. Of course, some vegetarian food has high food miles, but as a rule of thumb, a vegetarian meal is going to have a substantially lower carbon footprint than a meat one. I’ve never said “never” to flying. If I get an email from Donald Trump’s office saying that if I fly over and talk to him, he’ll be convinced to take action against climate change, then I’ll be straight on that flight. So it’s always about weighing up the cost-benefit. For me, nothing in the last 15 years has justified flying. • Prof Dave Reay, chair in carbon management  and education at the University of Edinburgh ‘Societal collapse could happen quite quickly’ I was a cognitive psychologist, an academic happily ascending the career ladder. I knew about climate change, and I knew that things were looking a bit gloomy, but I hadn’t really acquainted myself with the facts. The alarm bells weren’t ringing. People tend to have faith that those in high places know what they’re doing when it comes to climate change. It’s a trap I fell into myself. I moved into academic management and got what was effectively my dream job: pro-vice chancellor at Arden University, a campus and distance-learning university based in Coventry. In July 2018, I came across Prof Jem Bendell’s Deep Adaptation paper, which was going viral online. Here was someone with credibility and a good track record who, having studied the science, was saying that we’re no longer looking at mitigation, we’re looking at adaptation; that societal collapse is inevitable. People are starting to talk about the kind of spiritual awakening you get in these situations: an “ecophany”. I concluded that banging on about climate change on social media was not enough, and became involved with grassroots activism. Being a vice-chancellor no longer meant anything to me. I gave up my career, and I’m so much happier as a result. Now I talk at conferences and events about the need for urgent action and I have taken part in direct actions with Extinction Rebellion, including the closing of five London bridges last November and speaking in Parliament Square during the April rebellion. The science shows that societal collapse could be triggered by any one of a number of things, and once triggered, it could happen quite quickly. I suppose I’m being protective towards my four children, aged between 16 and 24, but in the event, I feel I need to be somewhere where I’m growing my own food, living in an eco-house, trying to live off-grid. It would give me some security; I don’t feel secure where I live in Cambridge at the moment – I’m concerned by thoughts like, “What would happen if I turned the tap on and there was no water?”. On our current trajectory, cities will not necessarily be safe places in the future – possibly within my own lifetime, certainly within my children’s. I am putting my house on the market. My aim is to move to north Wales or Scotland and get a smallholding. I’ve had to think differently when house-hunting: is it energy-efficient? Does it have access to water? Is it above sea level by a certain amount? Where’s the slope facing, so I can grow food. I need to get solar panels up, and a friend has offered some help with a wind turbine. It’s a way of life that’s always appealed to me; now it seems really urgent. I’m very aware that I’m privileged in being able to do this. It’s frightening to think about homeless people, people who are in rented accommodation. Who will look out for them? • Dr Alison Green, national director (UK) at awareness charity Scientists Warning and former pro vice-chancellor, Arden University ‘All those shampoo bottles can’t be recycled’ I am the carbon specialist on the HS2-enabling works from Euston to the M25, looking at ways to reduce the carbon impact of the project, but I used to work for Unilever in Dubai. I looked after environment and sustainability, and set the blueprint for waste reduction strategies for Unilever across the Middle East. I’d studied sustainability and carbon management, but it was only when we were setting up a second factory, looking into the waste output that would come from the manufacturing process, that it hit home: all those shampoo bottles can’t actually be recycled. And then you think about how long you’ve been on this planet, how many bottles you’ve used – it makes you step back and reflect. Your average soap bottle has about five different types of plastic, and unless each bit is dismantled, it’s not completely recyclable. The little pump is made from one type of plastic, the pipe is made from another, and then you’ve got the spring. We’ve got so used to going into the supermarket, putting something into our baskets and coming home, but we haven’t considered what happens at the end of its life. At the start of this year, I decided to go plastic-free in the bathroom. I switched to a bamboo toothbrush, which turned out to be a lot better and more durable than my plastic one. The handle is made from bamboo, and the bristles on the replaceable head are biodegradable. And, at the end of its life, I can use the handle as a garden marker. Growing up in India, from a very early age we were taught not to waste – it has always been part of how I was brought up. I bought some blocks of handmade eco-friendly soaps, and a chemical-free toothpaste in a glass jar that I can reuse when it’s empty. There is an additional cost to many eco choices, which makes it an elitist thing. You’re doing it because you can afford to. In an ideal world, I would like to see it being mainstream, rather than thinking, “If I buy this, do I have to compromise on something else on my shopping list?”. I’m a vegetarian, and I don’t drive – I can frequently be seen walking the streets of Maidenhead carrying bags of recycling – but I do still fly. It weighs on my conscience; can you imagine studying carbon management and flying home to Dubai for Christmas? I can remember coming back in January and feeling 30 pairs of eyes turn on me when they found out. But I was like, “I miss my mum!”. I’ve been recording all of my flights, and am saving up to offset the carbon footprint, through organisations like My Climate or WWF. Again, it just goes back to the financial cost of trying to do the right thing by the environment. We’re on track for a global warming of three to four degrees. We’re seeing whales being washed up with 40kg of plastic in their bellies. It’s tempting to think, what difference is my plastic-free bathroom going to make? But several billion people thinking that way is what got us to where we are. • Siobhán Pereira, carbon specialist at construction and engineering firm Costain Group  ‘It’s all about the big three: flying, driving and eating meat’ I grew up in the countryside and loved spending time outside, first in California and later Alaska. I now study ways to keep carbon out of the atmosphere; how to reduce our climate pollution quickly and fairly. Individual choices matter: 72% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from household decisions, including mobility (especially using cars and planes), diet (especially meat and dairy consumption), and housing (heating and cooling, and electricity consumption). The largest share of climate pollution comes from the 10% of the global population lucky enough to live on $23 (£18) per day or more, a group that includes most people in rich countries like the UK. (The poor cause very little climate pollution, so there’s not a lot of room for them to reduce their emissions.) To limit warming to 1.5C, our generation must stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The next decade is critical; emissions need to start plummeting towards zero today. We can get started by very quickly cutting today’s emissions in half. I’ve already cut mine in half, based on how excessively I was polluting the climate before, by focusing on high-impact personal climate actions. When I was in graduate school in California, I had two cars. I was driving up to four hours a day. I now live a 15-minute walk from work and no longer own a car. I stopped flying within Europe in 2012, and cut my flying back by 80% – the only flights I take are back to North America, to see my family. I stopped eating meat and milk several years ago. The climate impact of bringing a child into the world is something my husband and I have talked about. Essentially, burning fossil fuels and eating meat are the things that are driving climate change – the more people we have doing those things, the higher those emissions are. That is one factor among many that will inform our decision over whether we start a family. A different but related question is: what kind of world would a child born today grow up in? What matters for climate change is how much greenhouse gases we emit to the atmosphere. A lot of people have started to use keep-cups and reusable water bottles. These choices reduce waste, but are not high-impact climate actions – they have a much smaller effect compared with the big three: flying, driving and eating meat. For example, eating a plant-based diet for one year saves over 150 times more greenhouse gases compared with a year of using a reusable shopping bag. And you would have to recycle everything in your household comprehensively for almost eight years to equal the greenhouse gas emissions saved by skipping just one round-trip flight from London to New York. Those of us who happen to be alive today are determining the future of humanity. We have to be serious about our responsibility. Individual actions reinforce and support politicians in making the bold choices necessary to tackle the problem on the scale that’s needed. We’ve got to act fast. • Dr Kimberly Nicholas, associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University, Sweden You can check your own carbon footprint using carbon calculators such as Berkeley’s peer-reviewed CoolClimate and the WWF’s tool.

"Planting billions of trees across the world is one of the biggest and cheapest ways of taking CO2 out of the atmosphere to tackle the climate crisis, according to scientists, who have made the first calculation of how many more trees could be planted without encroaching on crop land or urban areas. As trees grow, they absorb and store the carbon dioxide emissions that are driving global heating. New research estimates that a worldwide planting programme could remove two-thirds of all the emissions from human activities that remain in the atmosphere today, a figure the scientists describe as “mind-blowing”. The analysis found there are 1.7bn hectares of treeless land on which 1.2tn native tree saplings would naturally grow. That area is about 11% of all land and equivalent to the size of the US and China combined. Tropical areas could have 100% tree cover, while others would be more sparsely covered, meaning that on average about half the area would be under tree canopy. The scientists specifically excluded all fields used to grow crops and urban areas from their analysis. But they did include grazing land, on which the researchers say a few trees can also benefit sheep and cattle. “This new quantitative evaluation shows [forest] restoration isn’t just one of our climate change solutions, it is overwhelmingly the top one,” said Prof Tom Crowther at the Swiss university ETH Zürich, who led the research. “What blows my mind is the scale. I thought restoration would be in the top 10, but it is overwhelmingly more powerful than all of the other climate change solutions proposed.” Crowther emphasised that it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero. He said this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take 50-100 years to have its full effect of removing 200bn tonnes of carbon. But tree planting is “a climate change solution that doesn’t require President Trump to immediately start believing in climate change, or scientists to come up with technological solutions to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere”, Crowther said. “It is available now, it is the cheapest one possible and every one of us can get involved.” Individuals could make a tangible impact by growing trees themselves, donating to forest restoration organisations and avoiding irresponsible companies, he added. Other scientists agree that carbon will need to be removed from the atmosphere to avoid catastrophic climate impacts and have warned that technological solutions will not work on the vast scale needed. Jean-François Bastin, also at ETH Zürich, said action was urgently required: “Governments must now factor [tree restoration] into their national strategies.”  There are about 3tn trees on the planet and they play a significant role in producing the oxygen we all breathe. But twice as many existed before the start of human civilisation.  Today, 10bn more trees are cut down than are planted every year. This destruction is a significant contributor to the carbon dioxide emissions that are driving the climate crisis. rees draw carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere as they grow, and planting trees will need to play an important part in ending the climate emergency.  Forests are also a vital and rich habitat for wildlife. Earth is at the start of a sixth mass extinction event of species and the razing of forests and other ecosystems is the biggest contributor to the losses. Tropical rainforests are especially important, hosting 50% of known terrestrial species on only 6% of the world’s land. Trees are also important in controlling regional rainfall, as they evaporate water from their leaves. In urban areas, the shade from trees has been shown to both cool city streets and reduce levels of air pollution. They can also boost people’s wellbeing as part of green spaces, with research showing a two-hour “dose” of nature a week significantly improving health. Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief and founder of the Global Optimism group, said: “Finally we have an authoritative assessment of how much land we can and should cover with trees without impinging on food production or living areas. This is hugely important blueprint for governments and private sector.” René Castro, assistant-director general at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, said: “We now have definitive evidence of the potential land area for re-growing forests, where they could exist and how much carbon they could store.” The study, published in the journal Science, determines the potential for tree planting but does not address how a global tree planting programme would be paid for and delivered. Crowther said: “The most effective projects are doing restoration for 30 US cents a tree. That means we could restore the 1tn trees for $300bn [£240bn], though obviously that means immense efficiency and effectiveness. But it is by far the cheapest solution that has ever been proposed.” He said financial incentives to land owners for tree planting are the only way he sees it happening, but he thinks $300bn would be within reach of a coalition of billionaire philanthropists and the public. Effective tree-planting could take place across the world, Crowther said: “The potential is literally everywhere – the entire globe. In terms of carbon capture, you get by far your biggest bang for your buck in the tropics [where canopy cover is 100%] but every one of us can get involved.” The world’s six biggest nations, Russia, Canada, China, the US, Brazil and Australia, contain half the potential restoration sites. Tree planting initiatives already exist, including the Bonn Challenge, backed by 48 nations, aimed at restoring 350m hectares of forest by 2030. But the study shows that many of these countries have committed to restore less than half the area that could support new forests. “This is a new opportunity for those countries to get it right,” said Crowther. “Personally, Brazil would be my dream hotspot to get it right – that would be spectacular.” The research is based on the measurement of the tree cover by hundreds of people in 80,000 high-resolution satellite images from Google Earth. Artificial intelligence computing then combined this data with 10 key soil, topography and climate factors to create a global map of where trees could grow. This showed that about two-thirds of all land – 8.7bn ha – could support forest, and that 5.5bn ha already has trees. Of the 3.2bn ha of treeless land, 1.5bn ha is used for growing food, leaving 1.7bn of potential forest land in areas that were previously degraded or sparsely vegetated. “This research is excellent,” said Joseph Poore, an environmental researcher at the Queen’s College, University of Oxford. “It presents an ambitious but essential vision for climate and biodiversity.” But he said many of the reforestation areas identified are currently grazed by livestock including, for example, large parts of Ireland. “Without freeing up the billions of hectares we use to produce meat and milk, this ambition is not realisable,” he said. Crowther said his work predicted just two to three trees per field for most pasture: “Restoring trees at [low] density is not mutually exclusive with grazing. In fact many studies suggest sheep and cattle do better if there are a few trees in the field.” Crowther also said the potential to grow trees alongside crops such as coffee, cocoa and berries – called agro-forestry – had not been included in the calculation of tree restoration potential, and neither had hedgerows: “Our estimate of 0.9bn hectares [of canopy cover] is reasonably conservative.” However, some scientists said the estimated amount of carbon that mass tree planting could suck from the air was too high. Prof Simon Lewis, at University College London, said the carbon already in the land before tree planting was not accounted for and that it takes hundreds of years to achieve maximum storage. He pointed to a scenario from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 1.5C report of 57bn tonnes of carbon sequestered by new forests this century. Other scientists said avoiding monoculture plantation forests and respecting local and indigenous people were crucial to ensuring reforestation succeeds in cutting carbon and boosting wildlife. Earlier research by Crowther’s team calculated that there are currently about 3tn trees in the world, which is about half the number that existed before the rise of human civilisation. “We still have a net loss of about 10bn trees a year,” Crowther said. Visit the Crowther Lab website for a tool that enables users to look at particular places and identify the areas for restoration and which tree species are native there. • This article was amended on 18 October 2019 to reflect a revision made to the original research paper, and a clarification in a letter by the authors of the study in the journal Science, that responds to criticism of their work. They clarify that one comparison made did not take into account that 55% of the CO2 produced by human activity is absorbed by land and oceans. The text of the first and second paragraph of this article have been edited to reflect this and the paper revision."

EPA chief Gina McCarthy also says she doesn’t even know whose models policy is being based on.

She says that the models diverging from actual observations “on the whole makes no difference to the validity in the robustness of climate science that is telling us that we are facing an absolute challenge that we must address …blah blah blah…”
Sorry, but it makes all the difference in science. McCarthy thus confirms observational data mean nothing and that climate science is a religion at the EPA.
“Whose models? What projections?” she asks – as if she has no idea what’s going on at all. This is as incompetent as you will ever see.

=======================================
More fun with climate models: Nowhere do they fit reality
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In March 2013 journalist Joachim Müller-Jung put it aptly in an article in the FAZ:
Whoever simulates the world, has not understood the truth
How much reality is in the models? Fact is: The complexities increase, but so do the uncertainties. How can science remain credible here?”
Read more at the faz.net.
Today once again we wish to take a cruise through the world of modeling. The field currently finds itself deep in crisis. Earlier they had energetically produced a number of models but the numerous misses are now taking a heavy toll. A first wave of self-criticism is sweeping across the field. by far not everything is as rosy as what the state funders once claimed.
On February 21, 2013 the University Göteborg issued a press release with the title: “Climate models are not good enough“. Within the framework of a promotion project, it was discovered that climate models have been unable to reproduce the observed changes in extreme rainfalls in China over the last 50 years:
Climate models are not good enough
Only a few climate models were able to reproduce the observed changes in extreme precipitation in China over the last 50 years. This is the finding of a doctoral thesis from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Climate models are the only means to predict future changes in climate and weather. “It is therefore extremely important that we investigate global climate models’ own performances in simulating extremes with respect to observations, in order to improve our opportunities to predict future weather changes,” says Tinghai Ou from the University of Gothenburg’s Department of Earth Sciences. Tinghai has analysed the model simulated extreme precipitation in China over the last 50 years. “The results show that climate models give a poor reflection of the actual changes in extreme precipitation events that took place in China between 1961 and 2000,” he says. “Only half of the 21 analysed climate models analysed were able to reproduce the changes in some regions of China. Few models can well reproduce the nationwide change.”
Problems with the rainfall modeling are found at every location. Also in the USA models have failed to reproduce the historical precipitation development, as Mishra et al. (2012) and Knappenberger and Michaels (2013) were able to show. Stratton & Stirling (2012) and Ramirez-Villegas et al. (2013) found the same at the global level. Here’s an excerpt of the latter:
Climatological means of seasonal mean temperatures depict mean errors between 1 and 18 ° C (2–130% with respect to mean), whereas seasonal precipitation and wet-day frequency depict larger errors, often offsetting observed means and variability beyond 100%. Simulated interannual climate variability in GCMs warrants particular attention, given that no single GCM matches observations in more than 30% of the areas for monthly precipitation and wet-day frequency, 50% for diurnal range and 70% for mean temperatures. We report improvements in mean climate skill of 5–15% for climatological mean temperatures, 3–5% for diurnal range and 1–2% in precipitation. At these improvement rates, we estimate that at least 5–30 years of CMIP work is required to improve regional temperature simulations and at least 30–50 years for precipitation simulations, for these to be directly input into impact models. We conclude with some recommendations for the use of CMIP5 in agricultural impact studies.”
Soncini & Bocchiola (2011) examined snowfall in the Italian Alps. Also here they found the same: the real, measured development cannot be reproduced by models. What’s even worse: the future projections of various models deviate widely from each other. Here’s an excerpt from the noteworthy paper:

General Circulation Models GCMs are widely adopted tools to achieve future climate projections. However, one needs to assess their accuracy, which is only possible by comparison of GCMs’ control runs against past observed data. Here, we investigate the accuracy of two GCMs models delivering snowfall that are included within the IPCC panel’s inventory (HadCM3, CCSM3), by comparison against a comprehensive ground data base (ca. 400 daily snow gauging stations) located in the Italian Alps, during 1990–2009. The GCMs simulations are objectively compared to snowfall volume by regionally evaluated statistical indicators. The CCSM3 model provides slightly better results than the HadCM3, possibly in view of its finer computational grid, but yet the performance of both models is rather poor. We evaluate the bias between models and observations, and we use it as a bulk correction for the GCMs’ snowfall simulations for the purpose of future snowfall projection. We carry out stationarity analysis via linear regression and Mann Kendall tests upon the observed and simulated snowfall volumes for the control run period, providing contrasting results. We then use the bias adjusted GCMs output for future snowfall projections from the IPCC-A2 scenario. The two analyzed models provide contrasting results about projected snowfall during the 21st century (until 2099). Our approach provides a first order assessment of the expected accuracy of GCM models in depicting past and future snowfall upon the (Italian) Alps. Overall, given the poor depiction of snowfall by the GCMs here tested, we suggest that care should be taken when using their outputs for predictive purposes.”

In June 2013 Axel Lauer and Kevin Hamilton in the Journal of Climate looked at cloud models. Also here nothing is different: Every model does its own thing and the real development simply refuses to play along. Next is the abstract of the paper:
Clouds are a key component of the climate system affecting radiative balances as well as the hydrological cycle. Previous studies from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) showed quite large biases in the simulated cloud climatology affecting all GCMs [global climate models] as well as a remarkable degree of variation among the models, which represented the state-of-the-art circa 2005. Here we measure the progress that has been made in recent years by comparing mean cloud properties, interannual variability, and the climatological seasonal cycle from the CMIP5 models with satellite observations and with results from comparable CMIP3 experiments. We focus on three climate-relevant cloud parameters: cloud amount, liquid water path, and cloud radiative forcing. We show that intermodel differences are still large in the CMIP5 simulations. We find some small improvements of particular cloud properties in some regions in the CMIP5 ensemble over CMIP3. In CMIP5 there is an improved agreement of the modeled interannual variability of liquid water path as well as of the modeled longwave cloud forcing over mid and high latitude oceans with observations. However, the differences in the simulated cloud climatology from CMIP3 and CMIP5 are generally small and there is very little to no improvement apparent in the tropical and subtropical regions in CMIP5. Comparisons of the results from the coupled CMIP5 models with their atmosphere-only versions run with observed SSTs show remarkably similar biases in the simulated cloud climatologies. This suggests the treatments of subgrid-scale cloud and boundary layer processes are directly implicated in the poor performance of current GCMs [global climate models or general circulation models] in simulating realistic cloud fields.”
No matter which modeling parameter one looks at, the result is off. Another example is ground moisture ground moisture, which according to an analysis by Tim Ball is not correctly given in the IPCC models. There are also problems with thunderstorms, as Anthony Watts at WUWT showed. Or take a look at atmospheric pressure. According to Przybylak et al. 2012, it has not changed much since the beginning of the 19th century. The models, on the other hand, foresaw a significant trend, which scientists sold as an “anthropogenic fingerprint”. That is now turning out to be completely wrong.
Also when looking back further into the geological past, climate models do not make a good impression at all. During the last interglacial, i.e. the warm period of 120,000 years ago, it was warmer than today. Yet, for whatever reason, climate models are unable to reproduce this, as a paper appearing in the 29 August 2014 Climate of the Past journal criticized:
We find that for annual temperatures, the overestimation is small, strongly model-dependent (global mean 0.4 ± 0.3 °C) and cannot explain the recently published 0.67 °C difference between simulated and reconstructed annual mean temperatures during the LIG thermal maximum. However, if one takes into consideration that temperature proxies are possibly biased towards summer, the overestimation of the LIG thermal maximum based on warmest month temperatures is non-negligible with a global mean of 1.1 ± 0.4 °C.”
Another paper that appeared just days before by Dolan et al. looked at the Pilocene 3 million years ago. The task for the 9 modeling groups was to calculate the ice cover over Greenland for the conditions of the Pilocene warm period. Back then it was considerably warmer than today and the sea level was higher, i.e. about the same conditions that are predicted by today’s climate models for the end of the 21st century. The study ended with a big surprise: Everything between “ice-free” and “ice somewhat like today” were given by the models. The reason for the divergence: Every model simulated the local albedo properties in Greenland differently. Yet this is decisive for the ice cover extent of the island. In summary future modeling resembles playing the lottery.
Finally we go back yet another step further, to the mid-Milocene 14 million years ago. A paper by Goldner et al. from March 2014 found that the climate models were off by a full 4°C. Among other things, the authors suspect that certain climate factors are missing in the models. An interesting thought…
What follows is an excerpt from the abstract of that paper:
The mid-Miocene climatic optimum (MMCO) is an intriguing climatic period due to its above-modern temperatures in mid-to-high latitudes in the presence of close-to-modern CO2 concentrations. We use the recently released Community Earth System Model (CESM1.0) with a slab ocean to simulate this warm period, incorporating recent Miocene CO2 reconstructions of 400 ppm (parts per million). We simulate a global mean annual temperature (MAT) of 18 °C, ~4 °C above the preindustrial value, but 4 °C colder than the global Miocene MAT we calculate from climate proxies. […] Our results illustrate that MMCO warmth is not reproducible using the CESM1.0 forced with CO2 concentrations reconstructed for the Miocene or including various proposed Earth system feedbacks; the remaining discrepancy in the MAT is comparable to that introduced by a CO2 doubling. The model’s tendency to underestimate proxy derived global MAT and overestimate the Equator to pole temperature gradient suggests a major climate problem in the MMCO akin to those in the Eocene. Our results imply that this latest model, as with previous generations of climate models, is either not sensitive enough or additional forcings remain missing that explain half of the anomalous warmth and pronounced polar amplification of the MMCO.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) has posted a video of Richard Lindzen’s presentation delivered at the 7th International Climate and Energy Conference in Mannheim, Germany in April.

Overall Lindzen slams the IPCC models, claiming they act like they have everything all figured out, when in reality they do not. On ocean cycles and their important interaction with the atmosphere, Lindzen says at the 23.00 min. mark: “No models gets those things in a reasonable manner.”
The IPCC also appears to be only guessing with aerosols, and tends to fudge around with the numbers involving aerosols. On natural variability, at the 37:40 mark, Lindzen mentions a PNAS 2013 paper by Tung and Zhou who find that at least half of the warming is likely due to natural factors.
Lindzen ridicules the UN climate view its models, the ones near the center of the range and the bad outlier ones: “In the democratic processes of the UN, all models are equal.”
On extreme weather, at the end of his presentation, Lindzen calls the science surrounding it”one of the crazier things”.
Extreme weather is pure propaganda. The IPCC itself acknowledges no relation.”
At the end he reminds the audience that many things in the IPCC actually argue against the hysteria. This naturally leads us to assume these things have gotten filtered out of the Summary for Policymakers and press releases, and thus the public has gotten the wrong picture.
Also posted at EIKE is the presentation by Donna Laframboise.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe main media often avoid reporting catastrophes involving bitter cold winter conditions, as it may cause the public to doubt global warming. So it’s little wonder that they have opted not to report on an ongoing massive blizzard pounding the Russian Orient, northern parts of China and extending to northern Japan.
However, the smaller media outlets are picking up where the mainstream media is slacking off.
The French language www.catnet.net reports here on “a very powerful snowstorm” that has hit the Russian Orient and Northern China and pumped very cold Arctic air into the region. It writes:
The storm in particular hit the Khabarovsk and dell’Amnur regions with heavy snowfalls and icy winds in the sector of North-North East that have reached speeds of 120-130 km/hr over the Okhotsk Sea.”
catnet.net writes of widespread power outages and winds of 105 km/hr and 72 cm of snow in the region of Khabarovsk. The region of d’ell’Amnur also saw 50 cm of snow with winds of over 105 km/hr. The catnet.net reports that the city of Komsomolsk has been “completely paralyzed“.
The English-language news.xinhuanet.com writes of an “ongoing blizzard” that continues “pelting the region with snow” and temperatures falling to -17°C.
China’s CCTV News presents a video of the conditions here and reports, “Strong winds with heavy snow reduced visibility in Fuyuan to less than 50 meters, affecting local traffic.”
CCTV News here also reports of a 60-hour blizzard pounding China’s Heilongjiang province and continuing even today: “Outdoor temperatures reached as low as minus 20 degree Celsius and the accumulated snow is up to 90 cm deep, leaving residents struggling to open doors.”

"The last election may have left the impression with voters that farmers and rural people in general do not accept climate science because there was no seismic shift of seats. Yet this week the agricultural thinktank, the Australian Farm Institute, gathered farmers and their advocacy groups to talk about the impacts of global warming on the already risky business of farming. Speaker after speaker described how their businesses were trying to deal with increased risk by finding new income streams, changing their cropping and stock management plans and still sometimes being blindsided. Australia’s largest and oldest continuing pastoral company, AACo, owns 7m hectares of land or roughly 1% of Australia’s land mass. After the loss of 43,000 head of cattle in record flooding in the Gulf of Carpentaria, AACo boss Hugh Killen’s message to the audience was clear. “The direct effects of climate are real for us – we come to this discussion with first hand experience and a commitment to find a way forward comes from the heart,” Killen said. “Slight changes to fire, flood and drought patterns can shift a very delicate balance. Increased flood, drought and fire can disrupt everything we do in their own right, as with risks we have seen in the gulf. “Changing patterns can also tip the balance in favour of harmful flora and fauna and it can tip the balance away from replenishment of nutrients in the soil.” He decried the tribal nature of politics and then he urged the room to act and engage on the subject, in spite of the noisy political debate. “Those who call themselves believers demand action now,” Killen said. “We need to show them we share their conviction about the dangers that we all face. “They need to know that we care, we take the science seriously and that we are taking action where we can to manage climate risks daily.” It was an unusual conference because since Tony Abbott dismantled the carbon price in 2013, the largely conservative industry has tiptoed around the issue – a point recognised by the National Farmers’ Federation president, Fiona Simson, last year when she declared climate change was making drought worse. Long-time climate campaigner and Boggabilla farmer Pete Mailler said there was a “widespread wilful ignorance” about climate change and that was creating the impasse on public policy responses. “There’s this big issue that says we can’t really admit to climate change because that means we have to change all these other things and that’s really hard, we don’t really want to shut down coal-fired power stations,” Mailler said. “The reality is I can’t stand by and let people glibly talk up agriculture if they are not prepared to start tackling the hard issues now. Because if we set the next generation up to walk off into the sunset and say ‘here you go’, it’s a great opportunity and if we don’t start to tackle these problems now we are setting them up to fail.” Yet the challenge for farmers and their representative bodies is always how to discuss global warming without scaring people out of food production. Verity Morgan-Schmidt, of Farmers for Climate Action, said no farmer wanted to be intentionally negative but there was a need to stare the challenges “in the face”. “It’s a huge step forward for the industry to have such a trusted respected research organisation actively engage on the issue and raise the challenges,” she said. “We all want the industry to have vibrant future but we don’t want to sell people up the river.” The National Farmers’ Federation chief executive, Tony Mahar, said climate change was increasing risk to the sector through more intense and severe droughts, high water prices, increased volatility of farm income, loss of productive land and relocation of industries. The NFF declared its “priority ask” was a $1bn eco-systems services fund, following on from a $30m biodiversity stewardship fund announced in the federal election that would develop a framework to pay farmers to improve landscape and capture carbon. Mahar echoed the Craik report, which also recommended the government introduce “market-based” National Biodiversity Conservation Trust fund for eco-services. “We are talking about this as the new Landcare and being a system that will recognise, reward, and put a value on some of the systems and services and land management processes that farmers undertake every day, every year, and have done for decades but haven’t been able to get an income stream from that.” The World Wildlife Fund has backed has backed the principle of paying farmers for good environment practices. The WWF’s Ian McConnel said farmer payments for eco-system work would be an important driver for positive change. “We need to reward people when they are adopting practices, especially when those practices don’t come as a win-win to production,” McConnel. “We need to prove there’s a biodiversity measurement. There’s a whole range of challenges around that, but we need to have very good models based on data that says if you do this practice, we see this improvement.” McConnel said the WWF had already designed farm practices applicable to Germany where farmers could choose from a range of works from restoring wetlands to vegetation connectivity and get paid a premium. McConnel said while planting and retaining trees was certainly “the easier way” to improve environmental outcomes, capturing soil carbon was potentially a longer term solution for farmers. The NFF’s $1bn target was “absolutely” achievable, he said, and could come from a mix of government funding and private investors. “The world needs pretty large-scale investment if we are going to turn the head on biodiversity loss and carbon so we are going to have to see some pretty big investment in that space and I think the willingness is there from both the public and private to invest,” McConnel said."

"Climate crisis disasters are happening at the rate of one a week, though most draw little international attention and work is urgently needed to prepare developing countries for the profound impacts, the UN has warned. Catastrophes such as cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique and the drought afflicting India make headlines around the world. But large numbers of “lower impact events” that are causing death, displacement and suffering are occurring much faster than predicted, said Mami Mizutori, the UN secretary-general’s special representative on disaster risk reduction. “This is not about the future, this is about today.”  This means that adapting to the climate crisis could no longer be seen as a long-term problem, but one that needed investment now, she said. “People need to talk more about adaptation and resilience.” Estimates put the cost of climate-related disasters at $520bn a year, while the additional cost of building infrastructure that is resistant to the effects of global heating is only about 3%, or $2.7tn in total over the next 20 years. Mizutori said: “This is not a lot of money [in the context of infrastructure spending], but investors have not been doing enough. Resilience needs to become a commodity that people will pay for.” That would mean normalising the standards for new infrastructure, such as housing, road and rail networks, factories, power and water supply networks, so that they were less vulnerable to the effects of floods, droughts, storms and extreme weather. Until now, most of the focus of work on the climate crisis has been on “mitigation” – jargon for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and not to be confused with mitigating the effects of the climate crisis. The question of adapting to its effects has taken a distant second place, in part because activists and scientists were concerned for years that people would gain a false complacency that we need not cut emissions as we could adapt to the effects instead, and also because while cutting emissions could be clearly measured, the question of adapting or increasing resilience was harder to pin down. Mizutori said the time for such arguments had ran out. “We talk about a climate emergency and a climate crisis, but if we cannot confront this [issue of adapting to the effects] we will not survive,” she told the Guardian. “We need to look at the risks of not investing in resilience.” Many of the lower-impact disasters would be preventable if people had early warnings of severe weather, better infrastructure such as flood defences or access to water in case of drought, and governments had more awareness of which areas were most vulnerable. Nor is this a problem confined to the developing world, she said, as the recent forest fires in the US and Europe’s latest heatwave had shown. Rich countries also face a challenge to adapt their infrastructure and ways of protecting people from disaster. “Nature-based solutions”, such as mangrove swamps, forests and wetlands which could form natural barriers to flooding should be a priority, said Mizutori. A further key problem is how to protect people in informal settlements, or slums, which are more vulnerable than planned cities. The most vulnerable people are the poor, women, children, the elderly, the disabled and displaced, and many of these people live in informal settlements without access to basic amenities. Regulations on building standards must also be updated for the climate crisis and properly enforced, she said. One of the governance issues cited by Mizutori was that while responsibility for the climate crisis and greenhouse gas emissions was usually held in one ministry, such as the economics, environment or energy department, responsibility for infrastructure and people’s protection was held elsewhere in government.  “We need to take a more holistic view of the risks,” she said."
"Much of Europe endured a searing heatwave last week, as an unprecedented plume of hot air pushed northwards from Africa. Last Friday, France recorded its highest temperature of 45.9C at Gallargues-le-Montueux, in the south-east. All-time temperature records are commonly broken by tenths of a degree, but this exceeded the previous record, set during the heatwave of August 2003, by an extraordinary 1.8C. A number of countries in central Europe also broke their June temperature records on 26 June, with 38.9C recorded in Bad Kreuznach, in western Germany, 38.2C in Radzyn, western Poland, and 38.9C in Doksany in the Czech Republic. Tropical Storm Alvin has become the eastern Pacific’s first tropical cyclone of 2019. Forming last Wednesday, it was unusually late for the season’s first named storm, in waters that often see greater activity during El Niño periods such as now. Alvin formed about 400 miles south-west of Manzanillo, Mexico and stayed away from land as it tracked westwards.  In India, the annual monsoon is finally making progress into northern parts of the country. The monsoon had a slow start, with total rainfall in June 35% below average. The monsoon reached the capital, New Delhi, this week."

Share this...FacebookTwitter “CO2 Has Never Been This High In 600,000 Years!”… FALSE!
By Ed Caryl
One item on the list of catastrophes that the CAGW climatists claim is that at nearly 400 ppm, the CO2 concentration has never been as high in hundreds of thousands of years. The number quoted is flexible, sometimes 600,000, sometimes 800,000.
It is true that in the ice core figures, CO2 measures from 180 to 200 ppm during the coldest periods and peaks at around 300 ppm during the interglacial periods. But it is well known that the ice core measurement resolution is a few hundred years for recent times and spreads to a few thousand years for the most ancient measurements. Thus the ice core measurements can’t show short periods of high atmospheric CO2.
This was demonstrated in my last article on the brief spike of CO2 in the Younger Dryas period 12,800 years ago from the paper by Steinthorsdottir et al.

Figure 1
Figure 1 above is a plot of CO2 and Greenland temperature during the Younger Dryas. The purple diamond marks the time of the nano-diamond (ND) event as seen in the Greenland ice cores. The horizontal time error bars on the peak CO2 data bring the ND-event within the time  period of the CO2 peak. The stomata index is carbon 14 dated, which has a time error of ±150 years.

Figure 2 is a plot of temperature versus CO2 concentration from the Figure 1 data. The trend line shows that the relationship is negative; a temperature rise of 1°C occurs when CO2 falls by 2.5 ppm during the 2000 year period covered by the stomata proxy data. The R2 value is very low, indicating that this trend is very likely zero. It is apparent that the brief high CO2 concentration did not cause any warming, as it occurred when the temperature was approaching the lowest recorded by the ice core data.

Figure 3 is a plot of the Dome Concordia CO2 measurement over the last 22,000 years. The ND event time is marked by the red dot.
The ice core data can be seen to get smoother as it gets older. Only the stomata data shows the 400+ ppm peak at the ND event. The ice core data cannot show a brief spike in CO2, because at Dome C, the snow (firn) to ice transition takes 100 years or more to close the tiny bubbles that sample the atmosphere.
The ND event was probably caused by a kilometer-size comet that came into the atmosphere over what is now Canada. It likely came in at a shallow angle, like the Chelyabinsk object in February 2013. It is thought to have exploded over the Laurentide ice sheet, with some pieces impacting in what is now Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and others continuing on to impact as far away as the Pacific Ocean. The intense thermal flash ignited all the forests of North America, leaving a soot layer laced with impact-generated particles and raising the CO2 level to more than 400 ppm as seen in southern Sweden in the leaves of the following year.
There is another stomata study, covering eastern Canada. The trees in eastern Canada were burned away, so the stomata data from one location, Pine Ridge Pond, shows a lower peak, and another, Splann Pond, no peak at all. The trees furnishing the leaf stomata needed to re-grow, which took 20 to 40 years or longer, depending on the number of viable seeds in the ground and local conditions. During that time, CO2 was falling back to normal levels.

 Figure 4 is from Mcelwain, J. C., Mayle, F. E. and Beerling, D. J. 2002. Stomatal evidence for a decline in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the Younger Dryas stadial: a comparison with Antarctic ice core records. J. Quaternary Sci., Vol. 17 pp. 21–29. ISSN 0267-8179.
This data is from Pine Ridge Pond in New Brunswick. The top line is a summer temperature proxy from sub-fossil chironomid remains (Midges). The numbers 1 and 2 marks the peaks of the Bölling and Allerød warm oscillations. The lower traces are the stomata proxies with upper and lower 95% bounds. The number 2 here marks the ND event CO2 peak. The CO2 data point at 1 does not appear in the Figure 1 data from Sweden. The total time for the CO2 level to fall back from 400 ppm to 200 ppm appears to be 100 years or less.
Both Figures 1 and 4 show temperature slowly rising during the Younger Dryas as CO2 concentration is slowly falling.

Figure 1 has a ±150-year error in the carbon 14 age data. The spike in CO2 does not line up with the ND event. In Figure 5, a 150-year correction is applied to line up these dates.

Figure 5 is a plot of the southern Sweden stomata data shifted 150 years to the right to align with the ND event.
Figure 6 below is the corresponding XY plot of Figure 5. In the Swedish data there is no stomata data on the temperature rise out of the YD period between 11,500 and 11,750 years ago. There appears to be no relationship between CO2 and temperature. The trend is very close to zero with extremely low R and R2 values.

There should be a CO2 increase as temperature rises and the oceans begin to out-gas dissolved CO2. We see this increase in the longer Canadian stomata data in Figure 4.

Figure 7 is an XY plot from the Figure 4 data. Here we see that CO2 rises at about 4 to 8 ppm for each degree of summer temperature rise at the Canadian latitudes. There appears to be a small delay of up to 150 years between temperature rise and CO2 rise as CO2 peaks always appear after temperature peaks by about this amount in both stomata data sets.
From these two papers we learn the following:
– A large sudden rise in CO2 decays away in 100 years or less.
– A large sudden rise in CO2 does not cause a rise in temperature.
– A large rise in temperature causes CO2 to rise, not the other way around. All the rises in CO2, including in modern times, came after temperature increases.
– The delay between temperature rise and CO2 rise is somewhere between zero and 150 years.
We can see that delay in modern times. The rise in temperature after the little ice age began in the late 19th century, accelerating after 1910. The rise in CO2 began about the time Keeling started measuring it in 1959, accelerating after that, a delay of about 50 years.
Is the rise in CO2 all due to temperature rise? No. It is a combination of temperature change and increased fossil carbon emissions. Will those emissions cause temperature to rise further? No. The large rise at the ND event caused NO temperature rise in either of the data sets above.

"Australia is responsible for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and could be contributing as much as 17% by 2030 if the pollution from its fossil fuel exports is factored in, research says. Under climate accounting rules that record carbon dioxide released within a country, Australia is responsible for about 1.4% of global emissions. The analysis by science and policy institute Climate Analytics found more than twice that, another 3.6%, are a result of Australia’s coal, oil and gas exports. If all proposed fossil fuel developments went ahead, including Adani’s Carmichael mine, other proposed coal developments in the Galilee Basin and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Western Australia, and other countries adopted policies consistent with the Paris agreement, Australia could be linked to up to 17% of carbon pollution. The Australian Conservation Foundation, which commissioned the research, said this scenario showed Australia was on a path to being one of the worst contributors to a climate emergency. “Australia is now the number one exporter of both coal and gas and we are scheduled to push that off the charts in the next 10 years. We are looking to become an emissions super-power,” the foundation’s Gavan McFadzean said. “We are fortunate to have many of our emissions counted elsewhere but that doesn’t mean we’re not responsible for them.” There is no likelihood greenhouse accounting rules will change to reflect pollution embedded in exports but the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, has suggested Australia should get credit for the role he says the booming LNG industry is playing in lowering global emissions by displacing coal in Asia. Canada has made a similar claim and said it should be allowed under the Paris agreement. Taylor has not said if emissions from Australia’s coal exports should also be considered under this approach. Energy analysts say there is little evidence Australian LNG is displacing coal. A report last week by the government’s chief economist found in Japan, Australia’s biggest LNG market, gas was expected to face increasing competition from emissions-free nuclear and renewable energy. The Climate Analytics report says Australia’s support for new fossil fuel developments is at odds with its commitment to the 2015 Paris agreement goals of keeping global heating well below 2C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5C. Scientists say meeting the Paris goals will require fossil fuel emissions to peak soon, then decline rapidly. Average global temperatures are already about 1C hotter than pre-industrial levels. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australia provides nearly 30% of coal and more than 20% of gas traded on global markets. Export earnings from the industries topped $117bn last financial year. In the wake of the Coalition’s election victory, both the government and opposition are supporting the opening of the Galilee coal basin in central Queensland, starting with the long-stalled Adani Carmichael mine. Coalition and Labor senators last week voted for a motion to this effect. Six mining proposals in the Galilee have been approved, but none has begun construction. Analysts have questioned whether these projects are viable given the lack of existing infrastructure, the cost of transporting the commodity hundreds of kilometres to an export port and uncertainty about coal’s future as the world moves to cleaner energy sources. While Australia’s emissions have risen each year since 2015, government greenhouse reports emphasise that per capita carbon pollution has fallen to its lowest level in 29 years. Climate Analytics says Australia remains one of the world’s highest emitters under this measure and if exported emissions were included the per head figure would leap from about 20 tonnes to nearly 70 tonnes a year each. Other countries that would have an increased responsibility for global emissions if fossil fuel exports were counted against the nation of origin would include Russia, the US, several countries in the Middle East and Indonesia."
" The UK is “sleepwalking into a crisis of childhood” with youngsters struggling to cope with the pressure to achieve at school, fit in with their peers and cope with wider anxieties over issues such as Brexit, poverty and the climate crisis. A survey of 5,000 children, parents and grandparents by the charity Action for Children found a strong shared perception that modern childhoods were getting worse amid what the charity called unprecedented social pressures.  Two-thirds of parents and grandparents felt childhood was getting worse, and a third of children agreed. All agreed bullying – both online and offline – was the main problem, followed by pressure to fit in socially, which had become more intense as a result of social media. Children from low-income families were significantly more likely than their wealthier counterparts to report worries about a range of issues from bullying to mental health, although children from all backgrounds were vulnerable to these anxieties. Nine out of 10 children – some as young as 11 – said they worried about “adult” issues. Roughly half said they were anxious about poverty and homelessness, terrorism, inequality and the environment, while about four in 10 worried about Brexit, sexism and racism. Julie Bentley, the Action for Children chief executive, said: “The country is sleepwalking into a crisis in childhood and, far from being carefree, our children are buckling under the weight of unprecedented social pressures, global turmoil and a void in government policy which should keep them well and safe. “Our research shows children worry about poverty, homelessness and terrorism, and the vulnerable children we work with every day are facing traumas like domestic abuse or neglect, going hungry or struggling with their mental health, without the support they desperately need.” Bentley called on the government to establish a national childhood strategy and reinvest in council children’s services, whose funding was  cut by a third between 2010 and 2017. “For the past decade the government has been asleep on the job when it comes to investing in our children,” Bentley said. The education secretary, Damian Hinds, said: “Although in many ways this is the best time yet to be young, I certainly recognise the pressures and worries young people feel. Growing up has never been easy, but technology and social media can exacerbate the need to fit in and the perception of others’ perfect lives, as well as make it harder to leave being bullied behind at the school gates. “But we are equipping young people for adulthood in a changing world, by identifying mental health problems and providing support in schools, encouraging young people to gain resilience and skills through activities such as sport and music, and teaching young people in school how to navigate the online world safely and constructively.” Children from low income families were strikingly more pessimistic about their childhoods: 39% thought childhood was getting worse, compared to 25% from higher income backgrounds. Poorer children were significantly more likely to worry about not having enough money (44% to 18%). By the same token, the poorest children had greater concerns about their mental health (31% compared to 20% of those from higher income families), and were also more likely to be worried about the mental and physical health of family and friends (34% to 24%). Louise Baroy, 43, a single parent from Newcastle, said she felt her children worried more, and about more things, than she had when she was young. “They ask me things like: ‘Will the world still be here when I’m older?’ or: ‘Are we poor?’ I have to sit down and talk to them to put things in perspective. I say we’ll always be OK, because you have got me. We are poor but so are a lot of people, and it doesn’t matter.” Steve Reed MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Children, commenting on the report, said:  “Tory and Lib Dem cuts to children’s services and help for struggling families have contributed to a national crisis facing our children, with one in three councils warning they no longer have the funding they need to safeguard the most vulnerable.   “No society that loves its children can treat them like this. The Government must learn the lessons of this hard-hitting report and make Britain’s children their priority rather than giveaways for the super-rich.” • This article was amended on 9 July 2019 to add a comment from the Labour party."

By Fred F. Mueller
German politicians see themselves as the saviors of our climate. In the early 1990s German politicians started the policies that ultimately culminated in the “Energiewende”, which aims to eliminate nuclear power generation and some 76% of the fossil fuel power generation. By 2050 some 80% of power generation should come from “renewable” green sources such as wind, solar, biomass, waste incineration and hydro. Since the volatile sources of wind and solar power will have to contribute the lion’s share, politicians reluctantly concede 20% of the energy coming from reliable fossil power sources.
Germany’s endeavor is indeed breathtaking. A look at Figure 1 shows in detail how massively Germany had once relied upon fossil and nuclear power sources to secure a highly reliable power supply. These sources were controllable and highly reliable. And because Germany’s topology offers only limited possibilities for hydropower, that renewable source is minimal.

Figure 1: In 1990 the German grid was able to count on conventional power sources which were controllable and highly reliable. Renewable hydropower accounted for only 3.6 %
Today, after some two decades of massive green energy policy, the situation has changed dramatically. Wind, solar, biomass and waste incineration plants have been promoted to such an extent that together with hydropower, the share of “green energy” today has reached 25.8 % of the country’s total electric power production. This resulted from Germany’s EEG renewable energy feed-in act which guarantees producers fixed rates for 20 years and forces power companies to buy up all the renewable power produced, regardless of the market conditions. The result has been a massive oversupply which has led to steep price drops on power trading floors, which in turn have pushed fossil fuel utilities to and beyond their profitability limits. Surplus production has been repeatedly dumped onto neighboring markets and resulted in massive disturbances for the respective national power grids. Readers interested in a more detailed description of the policy might have a look at the article of Marita Noon [NOON].
Capacity without control
The problem with the “renewable” power sources of wind and solar is their intrinsic volatility coupled with their poor capacity utilization rates of only 17.4% for wind and 8.3% for solar (average values for Germany).
That poor utilization rate means one has to build up huge overcapacities in order to achieve a certain amount of power production. Worse, the power source fluctuates wildly according to weather conditions. As a consequence, Germany has to maintain a dual power generation infrastructure that comprises a grossly overinflated capacity of “renewable” wind and solar power plants shadowed by a full scale backup set of conventional plants. These conventional power sources must always be on standby, ready to take over when weather conditions aren’t favorable. The production-fluctuation range of the “renewables” wind and solar is incredibly wide and volatile. For example in Germany there is an installed nameplate capacity of nearly 73,000 MW. Yet the minimum power output in Germany in 2014 from both sources was a meager 29 MW (only 0.04% of installed capacity) while the maximum value was 38,000 MW (48%).
The massive buildup in wind and solar power has already resulted in a considerable nominal overcapacity of “renewable” power sources.
The combined rated capacity of all “renewable” power sources already reaches about 87,000 MW, which is the maximum power consumption the grid has been designed to secure. Additionally, a minimum conventional power station capacity of some 28,000 MW has to be constantly connected to the grid in order to secure supply stability. As a result the risk of the grid reaching an oversupply situation if weather conditions are favorable for both wind and solar power plants is growing with every additional “renewable” plant that comes online. Currently 5,000 – 6,000 MW are getting added each year. That situation is aggravated by the fact that there exists no technology to absorb and store any noticeable quantities of oversupply. Neighboring countries are already taking measures to fend off surplus-power-dumping that could destabilize their grids.
Power cannibalism has already started
The result is a grid which at times is so oversupplied with power that something will have to give. Fossil fuel power plants have been throttled to the point where they are no longer profitable and many power companies have started mothballing them, so quickly in fact that Germany had to pass legislation forcing producers to keep their fossil plants on stand-by, and to do so even if they lost money. Even the reliable “classic” renewable power sources – e.g. hydropower – are starting to suffer because most are not supported by government schemes.
As the build-up in renewable capacity continues, even the subsidized “renewable” power sources will sooner rather than later be forced into fierce competition for access to the grid whenever the weather conditions turn favorable. One can speculate that within just a couple of years, the first “renewable” energy sources will slowly be driven out of the market because of oversupply. Eventually the renewable power producers will be forced to cannibalize each other in an increasingly fierce competition for privileged access to the power grid as the unwanted events of over-supply become increasingly more frequent.

Things are set to get much worse
Normally, one would think that a government confronted with such a situation would stop at this point and wait for a technically and commercially viable solution for storing the increasing amounts of produced surplus electric energy – for use during times when weather conditions are less favorable. Unfortunately no such storage solution is currently available at the required scale, and anything being proposed so far is either much too expensive or has efficiency factors that are not worth discussing.
Yet Germany has a unique peculiarity: its leaders sometimes exhibit a stunning inability to recognize when the time has come to abandon a lost cause. So far €500 billion has already been invested in the “Energiewende”, which is clearly emerging as a failure. Yet all political parties continue to throw their full weight behind the policy rather than admitting it is a failure (which would be tantamount to political suicide). Instead, the current government coalition has even decided to shift into an even higher gear on the path to achieving its objective of generating 80% of German electric power from “renewable” sources by 2050. If the situation is practically unmanageable now with 25% renewable energy, it’ll be an uncontrollable disaster when (if) it reaches 80%.
If the government sticks to its targets, the share of the different power sources will probably appear as in Figure 2. Currently just 26% has been achieved so far, and the existing biomass share of some 7% is more or less doomed and thus will also have to be replaced by wind and solar. One can easily see how daunting the task that still lies ahead really is.

Figure 2. The official goal of achieving 80% power supply from “renewable” sources by 2050 requires further massive investments in wind and solar power technologies. Imagine the huge power supply fluctuations one can expect to see from wind and sun. 
Waiting for the grand finale
The real risks that lie ahead for the German power generating infrastructure become more recognizable if one looks at the nameplate capacity buildup that has taken place, e.g. just over the past five years, and compares it to what will additionally be needed by 2050, see Figure 2. Keeping in mind that €500 billion have already been contracted and will have to be paid by the consumer, one gets an idea of the proportions of the task still to be tackled in the coming years.

Figure 3. The installed nameplate power production capacities for wind, solar and biomass as of 2014 has already severely burdened the German consumer with costs of about €500 billion. That will dwarfed by what lies ahead, if politicians don’t change course. Note how 376,000 MW of wind and sun capacity may be installed to ensure meeting the country’s roughly 70,000 MW of demand.
Apart from the sheer dimensions of the costs that lie ahead, the additional cannibalism aspect will grow to enormous proportions. Since an installed wind and solar capacity of some 73,000 MW in 2014 yielded a combined maximum power output of 38,000 MW, the 376,000 MW that are to be installed by 2050 will generate a peak output of 196,000 MW to a grid that might just be able to take up between 40,000 and 90,000 MW. That means, depending on the weather, between 106,000 and 156,000 MW will have to be dumped somewhere else.
In the fight to get power into an often times severely overloaded grid, that’s when cannibalism amongst “renewable” power sources will really become intense. Will wind farmers sabotage solar plantations? Will solar owners sabotage wind turbines? Time will tell, maybe much sooner than we think.

"Indoor levels of carbon dioxide could be clouding our thinking and may even pose a wider danger to human health, researchers say. While air pollutants such as tiny particles and nitrogen oxides have been the subject of much research, there have been far fewer studies looking into the health impact of CO2.  However, the authors of the latest study – which reviews current evidence on the issue – say there is a growing body of research suggesting levels of CO2 that can be found in bedrooms, classrooms and offices might have harmful effects on the body, including affecting cognitive performance. “There is enough evidence to be concerned, not enough to be alarmed. But there is no time to waste,” said Dr Michael Hernke, a co-author of the study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, stressing further research was needed. Writing in the journal Nature Sustainability, Hernke and colleagues report that they considered 18 studies of the levels of CO2 humans are exposed to, as well as its health impacts on both humans and animals. Traditionally, the team say, it had been thought that CO2 levels would need to reach a very high concentration of at least 5,000 parts per million (ppm) before they would affect human health. But a growing body of research suggests CO2 levels as low as 1,000ppm could cause health problems, even if exposure only lasts for a few hours. The team say crowded or poorly ventilated classrooms, office environments and bedrooms have all been found to have levels of CO2 that exceed 1,000ppm, and are spaces that people often remain in for many hours at a time. Air-conditioned trains and planes have also been found to exceed 1,000ppm. “Indoor environments are of much more concern presently and for many people that is where they spend 60-80% of their time,” said Hernke, although projections suggest by 2100 some large cities might reach outdoor CO2 levels of 1,000ppm for parts of the year. The team found a number of studies have looked at the impact of such levels on human cognitive performance and productivity. In one study of 24 employees, cognitive scores were 50% lower when the participants were exposed to 1,400ppm of CO2 compared with 550ppm during a working day.  The team additionally looked at the impact of CO2 levels on animals, finding that a few hours’ exposure to 2,000 ppm was linked to inflammatory responses that could lead to damage to blood vessels. There is also tentative evidence suggesting that prolonged exposure to levels between 2,000 and 3,000ppm is linked to effects including stress, kidney calcification and bone demineralisation. The team add that rising outdoor levels of CO2 will mean rising indoor levels – a situation that could be exacerbated by greater use of certain air-conditioning units, people spending more time inside, energy-saving building techniques, and increasing urbanisation. Any health impacts, they add, might be particularly problematic for children or those with health conditions that might exacerbate the effects. And even if the impacts are reversible, said Hernke, it would depend on people being able to access air with low levels of CO2. “The question is what happens over the very long term when you are unable to go outside and, as it were, have that carbon sucked back out of you?” Dr Gary Fuller, an air pollution scientist at King’s College London, said his team had been measuring CO2 levels in London for the past decade. While levels rarely reached 1,000ppm, he said, they often exceeded 750ppm along busy roads. “Unless we decarbonise heating and transport then these peaks will worsen as the global background increases,” he said.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany readers will recall the climate bet for charity this site and its readers (the coolists) entered into against the climate alarmists, principally climate loudmouth Dana Nuccitelli and Rob Honeycutt, back in January 2011.
The coolists maintain that the 2011 – 2020 decade will be the same or cooler than the 2001 – 2010 decade. The alarmists of course are absolutely convinced that the current decade will be warmer.
Listening to the media lately, one might think that the coolists are getting trounced. Nothing could be further from the truth. The bet is based on the RSS and UAH satellite data, and they tell us a different story. Nuccitelli and his buddies can cite NOAA, GISS or NCDC all they want, but those datasets are not going to matter come 12/31/2020.
Robin Pittwood of the Kiwithinker has been so kind to tabulate the race so far as it develops. The first four years of the decade are now behind us, and Robin tells the coolists are maintaining a slight lead. Yes, this decade so far is running COOLER than the previous one! Hardly a good development for the Nuccitelli & Co. The dang oceans must have eaten up all the heat.

Chart shows this decade continues to be cooler than the previous one. Source: Robin Pittwood of the Kiwthinker. 
With the current CO2 emissions trajectory running at the IPCC’s worst case scenario, this decade so far theoretically should have been at least a good 0.2°C warmer, and certainly not cooler. Something must have gone terribly wrong for the cocky climate boy-wonder in California.
Robin writes:
We are now 40% through the race … and clearly it is still close with the coolists in the lead by half a nose.

Now back to the hype we’re hearing about the ‘hot’ 2014. Notice that during 2014 (months 37 to 48) the green line just keeps trucking along at the same basic slope as it has for the past few years and much of the previous decade too. There was even a small El Nino in 2014, whose effect is conspicuous by its absence. Maybe the heat that is missing in the observed atmospheric temperature trend is hiding in the ocean?  ;-)”
So we’ve got another 6 years to go and now is a good time to speculate how those might go. Personally I expect 2015 to be a warm one as well, because of the current Tiny Tim El Nino. But then we all know what happens after an El Nino. Right, global temperatures tend to drop due to La Nina that follows.
Also boding ill for Nuccitelli and Co. is the projection that the current solar cycle will soon be winding down and so it is quite possible we will be seeing a cool period around 2018, similar to what we saw back around 2008. Indeed it’s too early to call it for the coolists, but I must say I’m quite comfortable with our current position.
Let’s assume that the coolists do win the bet and thus deliver the major upset. How will the warmists react? Are they going to cry foul? Or are they going to be relieved and a bit happy because the planet is not warming like they thought. That would be the rational reaction.
I doubt very much Dana is sweating about this at all. He’s a master rationalizer and will creatively concoct a way to deny it.
Awhile back at this site William “Winston” Connelly demanded that the terms of the bet be modified. Sorry, it is a bit late for that, and it’s not his bet anyway.
Should the coolists win, the warmists are going to have a lot explaining to do. But they are well prepared, as already there is a huge supply of excuses out there for them to choose from.
And even if the warmists should somehow eke out a victory, it’ll be quite a hollow one because they all claimed it would be min. 0.2° warmer. A few hundredths warmer would also take the air out of the alarmism.
Fun blogging lies ahead.

Global Temperature Record 2014?
By Michael Krueger
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
A new temperature record for Germany has been announced by the DWD German Weather Service. With 10.3°C the warmest year since 1881 has been measured. Here are the facts.
2014 was the warmest year in Germany since 1881, but the warmest 12-months occurred from July 2006 to June 2007 with a mean of 11.3°C. Therefore the annual mean for 2006/2007 as 1°C over the current annual mean.

Chart depicts Germany’s temperature since 1761. Rose line is the annual mean temperature and the dark red line depicts the 5-year smoothing. 
Moreover since 2000 Germany’s temperature has barely risen – in contradiction to atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

How does the global temperature appear?
There are different datasets available for global tempertaure. I’m selecting the most alarmist, which comes from NASA. The gray shading shows the monthly mean values and the red curve is the smoothed annual mean (over 12 months).

Since 1880 the global temperature has risen about 0.8°C, i.e. not even a full degree. Since 1998 (a powerful El-Nino-year) there’s been practically no rise. What follows is a blow-up for the recent period.

In 2007 and 2010 it was just as warm as in 2014, or even warmer. We’re talking about 1/100 °C, which is deep inside the range of uncertainty. Yet the concentrations of atmospheric CO2 continued their steady rise. Based on these data, spreading climate alarmism is complete hyperbolism.
Very likely in the days ahead NASA will be announcing a global temperature record that in reality never was.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMany of us are familiar with climate jihadist/ambassador Leonardo DiCaprio’s über-hypocritical lifestyle of cruising on billionaire mega yachts, private jets and living in huge mansions. Well, it doesn’t end there by any means.
There are times when DiCaprio actually has to slum it, and put up with travel on the road, along with the rest of the world’s lowly mortals.
To help the Hollywood superstar cope with such horrible hardships, a “rolling palace” gets used, this according to Steve Austin of WQYK here. Hat-tip Graeme No.3.
DiCaprio’s monster-size vehicle is reportedly supplied by KING KONG Production Vehicles Inc.
According to the company, it is a 53-foot “celebrity suite” that includes extra capacity air conditioning and heating systems, large hot water heating system, heated floors, fireplace, home theatre, and plasma TV. According to the KING KONG website:
No expense will be spared on the luxurious interior, with only the finest fabrics, fixtures, appliances and floor coverings hand picked by our interior designers.”

These are precisely the sorts of things the rest of the world’s citizens are to shun if there is any chance of rescuing the planet. The following YouTube video unabashedly boasts about all the features the rolling palace sports, such as a $50,000 shower!

The total price tag for the “celebrity suite” is $1.5 million and probably consumes by itself as much energy (diesel fuel) as three American homes. And even if it did use renewable power, the manufacture and transport of all the components to assemble the palace leaves a carbon footprint that is as big as a crater.
What’s really amazing is that DiCaprio expects us to take him and his planet-saving message seriously. It’s all worse than a B-rated comedy.
These people are truly spoiled phonies with a few loose screws.

Is GISS Also Cheating in the Arctic?
By Ed Caryl
Almost four years ago, I wrote A Light In Siberia, where I examined 24 Arctic weather stations. The annual temperature data for those stations was downloaded from GISStemp. In light of all the recent controversy about weather station data corruption by “adjustments”, I decided to reacquire the GISS data for 19 of those stations for which I had kept the annual figures, and check for changes. There is also the matter of divergence, especially in the Arctic latitudes, between GISS LOTI and the satellite temperature readings. I examined this issue in this article back in November.
Is all that Arctic warming real?

Figure 1 is the annual temperature anomaly plots for land and ocean north of 60°.
I won’t bore you with individual 19 plots of the changes (see Figure 3), but here is one sample that my be illustrative, from Barrow Alaska. The station is at the airport, across the runway from the terminal and hangar areas, but close to the asphalt paved runway. There may have been a move in 1989, giving an excuse for the large discontinuity at that time, but there is no excuse for the constant positive correction, in the same direction as the well-documented urban heat island temperature increase at Barrow.

Figure 2 is a plot of GISS annual temperature for Barrow, Alaska, downloaded in August of 2010 and June of 2014, and the difference between these two sets of data. This is just the adjustment that has been applied in the last 3 years and 9 months.

Figure 3 is a plot of all the adjustments for all 19 stations. 
The difference plots for most of the other stations look like noise, with occasional large steps, but the adjustments are nearly always warmer for the last half of the 20th century. The next plot is the average.

Figure 4 is a plot of all the adjustments that have been applied by GISS in the last three years and nine months for 19 Arctic stations averaged together.
Again, these are just the “adjustments”or “corrections” that GISS has applied in the last three years and nine months to the 19 Arctic stations. I have no way of knowing what they did before August of 2010.
Note the trend line in Figure 4. These recent changes to the data have resulted in more than half of all the warming that has supposedly taken place since the bottom of the Little Ice Age and a third of the difference between GISS LOTI and RSS seen in Figure 1.
We may never know what the real temperature change has been.

"Donald Trump is arguing he has made America an environmental leader, despite moving to gut dozens of rules meant to safeguard clean air and water and rescinding every major US effort to stem the climate crisis.  In remarks delivered at the White House on Monday, Trump said protecting America’s “incredible natural splendor” is a “shared obligation that brings us together today”. He claimed the environment has been a top priority since the start of his administration. “We want the cleanest air. We want crystal clean water, and that’s what we’re doing and that’s what we’re working on so hard,” he said. Although he never mentioned climate change, Trump said the US has reduced heat-trapping emissions more than any other nation. That is true, although the US remains the biggest historical emitter, contributing to the crisis. The country also increased its climate pollution last year, and a new analysis finds it is far behind on meeting the climate goals it once promised other countries. The speech could be intended to temper Americans’ concerns that his administration is ignoring the climate crisis. Polls show a majority of voters disapprove of his handling of the issue and Democrats competing for the presidential nomination have been rolling out proposals to cut pollution. The 2020 presidential candidate and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders will this week propose the declaration of a climate emergency. The US is the only nation in the world that will not back a global agreement to limit the heat-trapping pollution experts say is already linked with weekly disasters. Trump routinely claims the US has the cleanest air and water in the world, which is not true. One analysis from Yale and Columbia universities ranks the US 27th for overall environmental performance. That analysis does, however, rank the US as No 1 for drinking water. America has seen significant reductions in pollution since the 1970s but critics say the president is undercutting laws that have provided that progress. A study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that air pollution kills 200,000 Americans each year, more than those who die from auto accidents or gun violence. Joe Goffman, a senior lawyer at the Environmental Protection Agency under Barack Obama, said Trump has been stalling environmental efforts since he signed an early executive order, in March 2017, to unwind Obama policies. “From his very first weeks in office the president has made it a priority to go backwards in terms of air quality and climate protections,” Goffman said. In the last month, Trump’s agencies have rescinded an Obama administration rule to limit the heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other pollutants from coal plants and granted a pollution waiver to allow year-round sales of gasoline with more ethanol. Trump argued that the Obama administration would have let polluting countries off the hook while causing higher gasoline and electricity prices with its climate efforts. “We are doing a very tough job and not everybody knows it,” he said, touting efforts to clean up marine debris and hazardous waste sites and limit childhood lead exposure. Andrew Wheeler, the EPA administrator, claimed the US is making “tremendous” progress under Trump. And the energy secretary, Rick Perry, called the event “the chance to tell a story that often doesn’t get told”, before quickly noting that the US is the top oil producer in the world. Jill Tauber, the vice-president of climate litigation at Earthjustice, told the Guardian: “We are seeing climate progress. We do have important protections in place for clean air and clean water but it is in spite of, not because of, the efforts of his administration.” According to a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, 62% of Americans disapprove of the president’s handling of the climate crisis. “On the one hand it’s just so beyond the pale and completely absurd that he would have the gall to give a speech touting his environmental record,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, the senior vice-president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters. “He must be seeing the polls showing that when it comes to the environment in particular, his polls are really in the toilet. Obviously that’s for a very good reason.” Mustafa Ali, the vice-president of the National Wildlife Federation who was the environmental justice liaison under Obama, said: “The president lives in a billionaire bubble and is not dealing with the reality that most communities in our country are dealing with, especially our most vulnerable communities.” He said the electricity rule rollback, as well as weakened rules for pollution from cars and methane from oil and gas drilling, were particularly hurting communities of color. Trump agencies have also instituted changes to the way they consider science and seen declines in enforcement of environmental crimes."
"Robin McKie left the crucial point about population to the very end of his otherwise excellent article (“Eight billion up: we can’t go on like this”, Focus). It is the lifestyle of a small proportion of the population in the developed world that is responsible not only for the burning of fossil fuels causing global heating, but for the massive impact on the environment of agribusiness and our rapacious appetite for any resources Mother Earth can provide. As the US environmentalist Bill McKibben said: “My daughter, four at this writing, has already used more stuff and added more waste to the environment than most of the world’s residents do in a lifetime. In my 37 years I have probably outdone small Indian villages.” Eileen PeckBenfleet, Essex  It was a pleasure to see my father’s farces being recalled by Vanessa Thorpe (“Tour de farce: how the West End rediscovered joy of broad comedy”, News). Farce’s heyday was not from the 60s to the 80s, however. It was successful almost throughout the 20th century. My dad [the actor-manager Brian Rix] had a fairly successful 1950s, for example. In that decade he was in three plays at the Whitehall, totalling more than 4,000 performances. By 1961, the Whitehall farces had broken the record as London’s longest running farce team. Jonathan RixHenfield, West Sussex In this time of political turmoil, with parliament and political parties stuck in infighting, no group has done more to keep the country running than the civil service, and no group has received as little praise. It is they who handled the detail of the Brexit negotiations, despite contradictory and unrealistic demands from parliament. It is civil servants who have made sure we are as prepared as possible for no deal. And while ministers have checked out to focus on internal leadership elections, civil servants have kept the ship of state afloat. As a reward, civil servants have been subjected to sustained attacks from across the political spectrum. We have seen a malicious briefing campaign against individual civil servants involved in Brexit negotiations, attacks on Treasury officials when their forecasts warn of the dangers of no deal and the disgraceful attempt to blame civil servants for the national security leak involving Huawei. Then just a few weeks ago we learned that civil servants will once again receive some of the worst pay awards in the public sector, far below what MPs have received. The culmination has been the disgraceful and unprecedented treatment of Sir Kim Darroch. This episode is extraordinary and shameful, but it is part of a wider culture of abusing civil servants that has been allowed to develop over the last few years. Civil servants cannot respond to these attacks, and must not be a punchbag for politicians from the right or left. They are not part of a secretive deep state; they are deeply committed men and women doing their best to serve their country. If only more politicians would act in the same manner.Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect unionDave Penman, general secretary of FDA union   Over the past four years, we have watched the unchecked spread of vicious antisemitism – anti-Jewish racism – in the Labour party with bewilderment and disgust – all the more so since we respected Labour’s long previous history of fighting racism, and its many brave and decent members. As accusations of antisemitism became too insistent to ignore, the Labour leadership set out to change the narrative from hate to housekeeping. Yes, there were minor issues, the Labour leadership conceded, but those related only to the time it was taking to identify the few actual or seeming antisemites in the party and the occasionally flawed system of dealing with them. Otherwise, all suggestions that racist hate against Jews was becoming endemic to Labour were mendacious, mischievous and malign. Now, after the BBC’s Panorama programme, we can see for ourselves what is and isn’t false. The extent of Labour’s antisemitism, the degree to which it has been protected, sanctioned and propagated by the leadership faction, can brook no further denial; the labyrinthine attempts to deflect attention from the problem and discredit officials supposedly charged with identifying and rooting it out, are now laid bare. There is nowhere left for the Labour leadership to hide. It is clear this is not just about Jeremy Corbyn but the pernicious world view of a faction that has – temporarily, we hope – taken control of Labour. But yet again, rather than seize this moment to face up to the racism at its heart, the Labour leadership remains determined to go on piously protesting its innocence, rejecting the message and blaming the messenger. People prepared to bear witness have been forced to sign gagging orders; those who have dared to speak out have been bullied, defamed, and stigmatised as dishonest and disloyal. What drives them, the leadership insists, is nothing other than political or personal disaffection. We are where we were before. Whistleblowers would be heroes to any other Labour party; to this Labour party they are traitors. Regrettable double standards are therefore operating, where Labour is keen to support whistleblowers elsewhere but not in its own house. In our view, those whistleblowers and Labour members who could no longer stomach what was happening in a party they loved, and were in some cases driven to the point of nervous breakdown by it, have shown a rare moral courage and decency that belongs in a great tradition, and gives us hope. In the meantime, trust between Corbyn’s Labour and most Jews in Britain appears to be fractured beyond repair. The very fact that Labour is, like the BNP before it, being statutorily investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for racism is not a matter of housekeeping, but a taint of international, historic shame. There are procedures that could take the heat out of this – a fully independent complaints body, for example, over which Corbyn and his inner circle exert no covert influence. Not with the aim of shuffling off blame, but in order, finally, that the party will honestly own up to what can no longer be filed away in a folder. After Panorama, damage limitation should not be the first priority for Labour. Draining the antisemitism that lies like a pool of poison in the party’s soul is. Now, nothing else will do.Howard Jacobson, Simon Sebag Montefiore, Sir Simon Schama, Neil Blair, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Rabbi Julia Neuberger Far from criticising Sally Wainwright for writing Gentleman Jack through “the prism of Halifax and West Yorkshire”, Richard Brooks should praise her and the BBC for offering those of us not living metrosexual lives the chance to see life from different perspectives (Behind the scenes, New Review).

Where’s the evidence?”, Comment). Frontline clinicians, like me, regularly encounter young people who are self-harming, engaging with pro-anorexia content or are being groomed online to devastating effect. Gaming addiction and online gambling are other areas of concern, and we welcome the announcement of new NHS England-funded gambling clinics to support them. Research must not only look at the impact of screen time but should also consider the nuances of what content is being viewed by whom, how technology is being used and how it can affect mental health. We call on a levy to be paid by technology companies to fund this much-needed independent research and to invest in further studies on how technology can also be used to help young people. Przybylski and Orben’s largely retrospective data mainly focuses on the effects of screen time in the general population rather than exploring the harms of online content on more vulnerable users, or detailed analysis of how young people use technology. The death of Molly Russell is a tragic example of a young life needlessly ended after viewing harmful online content linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide. We must continue to bang the drum to ensure vulnerable users like Molly are protected against the risks of online content.

"Cattle egrets – birds once so exotic we rarely saw them north of the Mediterranean – are now nesting in a heronry near my home in Somerset. Flocks of them often gather in the nearby fields, feeding among Jerseys and Holsteins. They look as if they are quite at home on this side of the Channel – which nowadays they are. These small white herons, adorned with their orange breeding-plumes, are just one of several species of waterbird to have colonised southern Britain in the past decade or so, as a result of the climate crisis. These include the little egret, which has bred here since the mid-90s, and the great white egret, which first nested on the Avalon Marshes less than a decade ago. Egrets are hard to ignore: even people who have little or no interest in birds are beginning to notice these elegant white birds in our midst. But meanwhile, a whole suite of wild creatures is colonising Britain by stealth; sometimes passing under the radar until they have established thriving populations here. During the past decade or so, many species of insect from continental Europe have gained a grip in southern Britain. Other species, which have been here for much longer, are now rapidly extending their ranges northwards – again driven by temperature rises. The latter group includes two species of cricket: Roesel’s bush-cricket and the long-winged conehead cricket. Roesel’s bush-cricket was once a rare and sought-after species, confined to salt marshes in the south and east, but is now spreading north and west into a whole range of new habitats. Another fascinating insect on the move is the beewolf. This solitary wasp is an ambush killer – the insect equivalent of a leopard. The female lies in wait, then pounces on a passing bee, which she drags down her metre-long nest-hole to feed her hungry young. ‘If we fail to deal with the global climate emergency… only the most adaptable wild creatures will be able to survive’ Many of these insects are flourishing in those marginal, temporary habitats we tend to ignore: what naturalist Richard Mabey dubbed the “unofficial countryside”, or, to give them their official name, brownfield sites. I’m writing a book about these hidden havens for wildlife, and have spent the last couple of years travelling the country to discover what lives there, including three new damselfly species that have recently arrived in the UK. In a ditch alongside the salt marsh on Essex’s Canvey Island, I watched scarce emerald damselflies, along with a mating pair of a larger and more obvious colonist, the southern migrant (or blue-eyed) hawker. This colourful dragonfly was unknown in the UK until the first decade of the 21st century, when it began to turn up at sites in Kent and Essex. My guide, dragonfly enthusiast Neil Phillips, was one of the first people to find the southern migrant hawker here, and has followed its progress ever since. Near the Thames at East Tilbury, we took a stroll along a public footpath next to a housing estate, where he spotted another recent arrival, the willow emerald. Later, I missed out on the third of this pioneering trio of damselflies, the southern emerald, which was reported from a small pool next to a landfill site near the M40 in Buckinghamshire. Had a sharp-eyed observer not found the southern emerald here, we would still not have realised that this bright green insect is spreading westwards so rapidly; until recently it had only been recorded in Essex and Kent. Closer to home, on the Somerset Levels, I have recently seen two other dragons and damsels: the small red-eyed damselfly, and the scarce chaser dragonfly, whose females look like a giant, elongated wasp. The small red-eyed damselfly – with eyes like tiny cherry tomatoes – had not even been recorded in the UK until 1999. Yet since then, it has spread at a remarkable rate, and has reached Devon in the west and North Yorkshire in the north. Butterfly enthusiasts are also looking forward to some exciting new additions in the next few years. The strikingly attractive Queen of Spain fritillary has already bred on at least one occasion in Sussex, and may soon become a permanent addition to our butterfly fauna. Other potential colonists include the continental race of the swallowtail, our largest butterfly, and the smaller long-tailed blue, which, following a major influx in 2013, successfully bred at several sites in southern England. Many new kinds of moths are also crossing the Channel. During the past three decades, no fewer than 30 species have arrived, some managing to colonise. And one of my favourite creatures, the day-flying hummingbird hawk moth, is an increasingly regular sight in southern Britain, as it hovers by flowers to feed on nectar, just like its avian namesake. Naturalist and broadcaster Brett Westwood points out that for many species of insect the climate crisis provides a golden opportunity to expand their range northwards. “Just look at it from their point of view: if you are mobile, and quick to respond to environmental change, you’ll have the chance to do really well in the next few years.” He cites butterflies such as the brown argus, whose caterpillars have adapted to feed on annual plants such as geraniums, as well as perennials, and have expanded their range as a result. And last year’s long hot summer allowed common blue butterflies to produce a third brood in September, boosting their numbers; while the Duke of Burgundy – one of our rarest butterflies – is also managing to produce a second brood in warm summers. So ironically, the climate crisis may well benefit many insect species, at least in the short term. But we cannot afford to be complacent, for in the north of Britain, it’s a very different story. One of our most specialised butterflies, the mountain ringlet, has over time adapted to life on the high peaks, in the Lake District and Scotland. But if the climate crisis permanently alters the nature of their specialist montane habitat, they will simply have nowhere to go. The same is true of many species of Arctic-alpine plants, some of which are on the very southern edge of their range in the UK. Dwarf birch is a tundra specialist, which can be found on the high tops of the Scottish Highlands. Again, if encroaching vegetation changes its habitat, it will soon disappear, along with other montane species such as saxifrages. Some specialist creatures often associated with high altitudes may still be able to adapt. At first sight, the mountain hare appears to be a likely casualty of the climate crisis – yet in Ireland this species lives right down to sea level. However, in areas with little or no snow, such as the Peak District, mountain hares no longer turn white in winter. Could the same happen to the population in the Scottish Highlands? The irony is that, while many exciting new species of birds and insects are colonising southern Britain – where of course the majority of naturalists live – those under threat in the north are still just about managing to hang on. But unless we find ways to reduce temperature rises – and very soon – it may not be long before we reach a tipping point, when what scientist Peter Berthold called the honeymoon period will be over. If we fail to deal with the global climate emergency, and enter a world of runaway temperature rises, all bets will be off – and only the most adaptable wild creatures will be able to survive the devastating consequences.

Hat-tip: DirkH
The Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung (HAZ) reports on a regional Hanover study that found senior citizens are responsible for harming the climate because “they like driving their cars“. According to the HAZ, the study was conducted by the GGR expert assessment office based in Hamburg, on behalf of the Hanover regional government.
Seniors putting climate targets in jeopardy
The report finds that many senior citizens in the Hanover region “are driving their cars longer and more frequently than in the past” and as a result “the region’s own climate protection target in the area of transportation is in jeopardy“.
Obviously the enlightened Hanover government officials are afraid that the climate gods will be angered if old people do not start behaving properly.
One has to be concerned, if not frightened, that such ridiculous studies are being commissioned and used by governments to justify policy in the first place. The study was commissioned by Hanover’s regional government.
Apparently they feel it is their business to find out who is driving around too much. And under the guise of “climate protection”, the state now believes it has the authority to intrude into our private bathrooms, kitchens, bedrooms, our cars and every aspect of our lives and boss everyone around.
The HAZ writes:

In the city of Hanover there is a positive development among the citizenry in the direction of climate-friendly behavior. However the figures in the surrounding area are stagnating, the GGR claims.”
Despite the “positive development” in Hanover in reaching climate protection targets, mostly through the herding of people into public transportation and bikepaths, the GGR has discovered that seniors living in the surrounding areas outside of Hanover are using their cars far more than they should. The HAZ quotes the GGR report:
Today’s generation of seniors have a driver license more than ever before. In the meantime older ladies are driving with an automobile almost as often as men are.”
God forbid. The increased mobility of grandmothers, the report concludes, means that they are “as a whole producing more emissions even though the cars are more environmentally friendly.”
As policymakers fly to a climate conference for the 20th time, grandma will have to use the Rollator
The report strongly suggests that poor grandmother should use her Rollator more to get around instead of driving her car, or wait 3 hours for the next bus to come by.
The HAZ writes:
In the whole region people are walking less than they did a decade ago. However, a need for action here has not been mentioned up to now.”
Meanwhile, German politicians, NGOs, and activists are all flying (some in first class) and burning tons of jet fuel (at taxpayer expense) all the way to South America – for the 20th climate conference which is aimed at finding ways to protect the climate.

"David Attenborough has highlighted Australia as an “extraordinary” example of a country where people in power remained climate change deniers despite the country facing some of the worst effects of global heating. Appearing before the UK parliament’s business, energy and industrial strategy committee on how to tackle the climate emergency, the celebrated broadcaster and natural historian was asked about claims people were overreacting to the threat of a climate emergency. He replied: “I am sorry that there are people who are in power … notably, of course, [in] the United States but also in Australia [who are climate change deniers], which is extraordinary because Australia is already facing having to deal with some of the most extreme manifestations of climate change. “Both [in] Australia and America, those voices are clearly heard and one hopes that the electorate will actually respond to those.” Asked to recall his most vivid impressions of humans’ impact on the planet, Attenborough said it was returning to the Great Barrier Reef, where he had first dived in the 1950s. “I will never forget diving on the reef about 10 years ago and suddenly seeing that instead of this multitude of wonderful forms and life that it was stark white. It had bleached white because of the rising temperatures and the increasing acidity of the sea,” he said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Attenborough said radical action was needed to tackle the climate emergency – “we cannot be radical enough” – but also called for pragmatism in working out what was possible and how best to convince the public of the need for change. He said he did not think opposing voices should be suppressed. “It’s very, very important that voices of dissent should have a place where they’re heard and the arguments between the two sides can be worked out in public, and compared and analysed in public,” he said. He found reason for optimism among young people who were “already making themselves and their voices very, very clear”. “I’m OK, and all of us here are OK, because we don’t face the problems that are coming. But the problems in the next 30 years are really major problems that are going to cause social unrest, and great changes in the way that we live and what we eat. It’s going to happen.” Attenborough recently presented a primetime BBC documentary, Climate Change – The Facts, which was watched live by almost 3 million people in the UK. It is yet to be shown in Australia."

My understanding is the USA needs the consent of the US Senate before it can ratify any international treaty.
Of course President Obama could attempt circumventing Congress to enact a treaty, but that would merely confirm why voters punished his party in the first place: abuse of power.
Why Obama did not pass a climate treaty back in 2009 when he had the chance remains a mystery to me. Worse, in my view, President Obama squandered the chance to work together with the opposition and accept compromise on every issue, which is the way democracies are designed to work. Instead he obstinately stuck to ideological lines and, using Chocago style political tactics, tried to muscle his policy onto the entire country.
Backfired!

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate cycles and their extrapolation into the future
By Dr. Dietrich E. Koelle
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
As the reconstruction of the climate’s development in the past by proxy data shows, there’s a series of temperature cycles that appear to be unknown, or ignored by many climate scientists. Among these are the larger climate cycles of 150 million to 180 million years (see Part 1 and Part 2), but also the shorter and for us the more important following cycles:
1000 years (900-1100)    Suess cycle with +/-  0.65°C
230 years (230-250)        deVries cycle with +/-  0.30°C
65  years (60-65)              Ocean cycles with +/- 0.25°C
In principle these cycles are sinusoidal in behavior as depicted in Figure 1. Bob Tisdale has also shown how the temperature increase of the 65-year cycle from 1975 to 1998 led to the assumption that it is due CO2 emissions because they too happened to be parallel. This has been naively extended all the way to the year 2100 and forms the basis for the climate models and the invention of the so-called “climate catastrophe”.

Figure 1:  Sine wave characteristic of the 60/65-year ocean cycle (Source: Bob Tisdale at WUWT).
In this analysis we will attempt to see how the temperature development could be over the next 700 years, assuming of course that the mentioned climate cycles of the past will continue on into the future. This should not be (mis)understood as a forecast for the future climate. Up to now there is only the IPCC forecast that the global temperature will rise by 2 to 5°C by the year 2100 – based only on the expected CO2 increase. However that theory has failed to work over the last 18 ears because the various natural climate factors and cycles never got considered, or they were not allowed to be considered in the climate models. Included among these factors are the mean cloud cover (albedo) and the resulting effective solar insolation (watts per sqm) at the earth’s surface, or the sea surface, which is decisive for the temperature development.Next Figure 2 below depicts the 1000-year cycle and the 230-year cycle, which have been reconstructed from historical proxy data. They stem from a combination of results from various publications in the field of paleoclimatology over the last years. The diagram of the last 3200 years distinctly shows a 1000-year cycle; the last 2000 years of which are confirmed by historical documents. In fact this cycle goes back all the way to the end of the last ice age, i.e. some 9000 years. The reason for the cycle is still unknown today, yet its existence is undisputed.
The current warm period is no “anthropogenic product”, rather it is the natural result of a repeating 1000-year cycle that goes back far into the past. Today’s warm period does not even reach the temperatures seen in the past warm periods, which at times were 1 to 2°C higher. Moreover it is important to note that during both of the past temperature maxima of 1000 and 2000 years ago, the CO2 values were at 280 ppm while today they are at 400 ppm. This indicates that the earlier warmer periods likely were related to natural solar activity and not to a rise in CO2 because there was no CO2 rise during those warm phases.

Figure 2: Global temperature over the last 3200 years shows a distinct 1000-year cycle along with the 230-year cycle.
Of historical significance is the fact that over the course of human history warm periods were always times of economic and cultural prosperity. The cooler periods always led to serious problems that led to starvation and huge waves of human migration in Europe. Here it becomes undeniably clear that the alarmist claims that “the earth has a fever” made by politicians such as Al Gore are patentedly preposterous. 
The “ideal” 1000-year cycle is varied by the 230-year cycle, which in turn gets varied by the 65-year oceanic cycle, which is depicted in Figure 1. Added to these cycles are the various typically non-cyclical events such as the ENSO, volcanic eruptions, etc. Figure 3 shows the temperature curve for the last 165 years along with the 230-year cycle and the effect of the 65-year ocean cycle. The current temperature values fluctuate by plus/minus 0.2°C due to the effects of ENSO, sunspot activity, volcanic eruptions, etc.

Figure 3:  The 230-year cycle over the last 165 years has been superimposed by a 65-year cycle as well as by other effects like the irregular ENSO events and large volcanic eruptions.
The temperature rise of 0.6°C during the 1975-1998 period, which has triggered all the current climate hysteria, was of the same magnitude as the previous increase that occurred in the 1910 to 1940 period, which in turn had nothing to do with CO2 because back then the concentration in the atmosphere rose by only some 10 ppm (from 297 to 308 ppm). Also the temperature increase of 1.5°C over the last 150 to 250 years is also nothing “out of the ordinary” or “dangerous”, as we are often told in the media. Instead it is only the natural recovery from the Little Ice Age (LIA) that had gripped the planet from 1400 to 1750. The LIA not only led to the Thames River and Baltic Sea freezing over, but resulted in severe hunger in Europe and caused a mass migration to America.
The figures also show that all three climate cycles reached their maximum shortly after the end of the last millennium. With that in mind, we actually should have expected even higher temperatures than those seen in previous warm periods. Here perhaps the fact that the global temperature has seen a negative overall trend since the Holocene Maximum plays a role. That means that the global temperature has fallen by 2°C over the past 8000 years.

Based on historical climate fact, it is possible to extend the trend into the future to form a possible climate scenario. Figure 4 depicts the extrapolation of the 1000-year and 230-year cycle along with the generally expected trend. Added to this are the fluctuations of the 65-year ocean cycles, the impacts of the ENSO-events, sunspot cycles and volcanic eruptions, which result in additional fluctuations of a few tenths of a degree – just as they have in the past.

Figure 4:  Extrapolating the 1000-year and 230-year cycles 700 years into the future.
Figure 4 shows the real global temperature development of the past 1000 years and its theoretical continuation over the next 700 years. This is not a forecast, but rather it is the extended possible course of the over all temperature trend, which over the mid-term in the next 100 years could see a drop of approx. 0.3°C  and a 2°C drop in global temperature in 350 years – which would mean conditions just like those seen in the Little Ice Age from 1450 to 1700. In about 1000 years the 1000-year cycle will again take on its warm phase and temperatures like those of today can be expected.
In the next 50 years there would be no temperature increase, but rather a slight temperature decrease is expected. In the decades before and after the year 2300 a powerful temperature drop could occur because both the 230-year cycle and 100-year cycle would be dropping rapidly together in parallel.

Note from the Die Kalte-Sonne editors: The main point of this post is to provide any analysis of natural cycles and their logical extension into the future. Unaccounted in the projection shown in Figure 4 is the climate impact of CO2, whose role in climate today is hotly disputed. In our book “The Neglected Sun” we presented two CO2 climate sensitivity scenarios: 1.0°C and 1.5 °C warming for a CO2 doubling. Current studies have corrected the original IPCC value of 3°C strongly downwards (see our articles “Studies from 2014 provide hope: warming effect of CO2 is considerably over-estimated. Official correction is imminent“). It will be exciting to watch how research will develop with respect to climate sensitivity over the coming years.

"Ewoenam Tetteh and Faith Otasowie, both 15, Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex  You are obviously both smart and thoughtful kids, so I will be blunt and tell you that climate change is already causing big changes in our world. You can see this in the melting of the ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctica, in the rising temperatures in cities around the world, in the changes in how much rain we get, and, perhaps most importantly, in the extinction of many plants and animals that are not able to adapt. One of the most important ideas to grasp about climate change is that it is not a future event: it is happening now, in real time, and those changes will only accelerate in the coming years and decades unless we radically reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we release into the atmosphere (mostly from burning fossil fuels). That’s why we must take action now. Are the changes we are seeing irreversible? That depends on how you think about it. For example, scientists know that ice sheets have come and gone many times in our planet’s history, driven mostly by slight wobbles in the Earth’s orbit that change the amount of sunlight hitting the planet (other factors, such as the eruption of volcanoes, have also played a role). So the ice sheets we are losing today will, in all likelihood, grow back some time in the distant future. But we’re talking millions of years. On the other hand, when a particular kind of frog becomes extinct because it cannot adapt to our rapidly warming world, it is lost for ever. We humans are pretty smart and capable creatures, so I don’t worry that we’ll figure out ways to adapt. And maybe we’ll even figure out ways to make it a better world. But it will be a whole lot easier – for us and for every living thing on the planet – if we take action now to minimise those changes, both today and in the future. I really like the world we live in, and I’m sure you do, too. It is a beautiful place. Let’s fight to keep it that way. • Jeff Goodell, author of The Water Will Come: Rising Seas, Sinking Cities, And The Remaking Of The Civilized World Sasha Dutta, eight, London Scientists have published a surprising amount of work relating to animal farts and our climate. It has been hypothesised that large dinosaurs (the sauropods) may have changed the Earth’s climate with their farts. Sharks are rarely seen farting. But like sheep and goats, cows are a type of ruminant – that is, they have four stomachs. This means a lot of methane, one of the gases that causes the worst warming. One cow can produce up to 200kg of methane a year. Most of it is released as burps, but some certainly escapes out of the rear end, too! Because humans eat so much beef and milk, there are an awful lot of cows in the world, and their burping and farting causes a sizable contribution to our greenhouse gas emissions, making up nearly a third of all emissions from agriculture, by some estimates. This certainly makes them a strong contender for the animal with the farts that do the most damage to the planet (even if their burps are worse). • Dani Rabaiotti, environmental scientist and co-author of True or Poo?, Quercus, £8.99 Georgia Robinson, 15, Poole, Dorset Well, the good news is that nearly all politicians in this country accept that climate change is happening and that it’s caused by human activities; almost all political parties have now accepted that we face a climate emergency. This is an amazing change from just a few years ago, and it’s happened because of people like the climate strikers. But declaring an emergency and being prepared to take the necessary steps to address it are not the same thing, and politicians – especially those in government – don’t match their words with actions. For example, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, was championing the expansion of Heathrow airport at exactly the same time as apparently agreeing that there’s a climate crisis – in spite of the fact that air travel is one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions. One of the problems is that most politicians won’t accept that we need a very different economic model, one that recognises that continuous growth isn’t possible on a planet with limited resources. We need to change our idea of what success looks like, so that instead of being obsessed by money, we measure human wellbeing and the health of our natural environment. There are also vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Too many powerful corporations benefit from the way things are now, and many give large donations to political parties, asking politicians to resist taking action.  The good news is that ideas such as the Green New Deal are getting more support, as people recognise that investment in a green economy provides decent jobs and a better quality of life, as well as a more secure future. The role of young people in keeping up the pressure is vital – your generation is making a real difference. But we don’t have much time. • Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, was elected as the UK’s first Green MP in 2010 Olivia Liddell, 14, Hemel Hempstead, Herts People who don’t see climate change can be frustrating because the scientific facts are so clear. But, as you’ve probably discovered, facts don’t always help people see the reality. If anything, bombarding people with facts makes them more sceptical and argumentative. So, what else can you do? Here are three things. First, it’s really important to acknowledge the other person’s good nature, and to identify common ground and shared values – areas where you have agreement. Just because someone doesn’t believe in climate change, it doesn’t make them a bad person. You probably both care about things like family and other people. Affirming shared values reduces the feeling of being attacked; being argumentative rarely succeeds. Second, invite people to think about their legacy – how their grandchildren and future generations will react to their actions (or inactions). If they are willing to acknowledge even a small chance that climate change is real, don’t they want to be on the right side of the argument? Finally, be really clear that climate change matters to you, that you are personally worried about it, and that you are asking them to help address it because you are scared. Friends, family and others are much more willing to help when they realise something is important to someone they love, even when they may disagree about the facts. Daisy Furmston and Chloe Nolan, both 14,  Hemel Hempstead This is a great question. Think about your bathtub at home. Imagine the tub is the world’s atmosphere, the water is carbon dioxide, and the tap is running. If we leave it on, eventually the tub will overflow and cause great damage to the house. The same is true of emissions. If we continue to emit CO2 at the current rate, we are going to see catastrophic consequences. So, how do we solve this problem? The first and most obvious thing is to turn down the tap – ie reduce our emissions. The good news is, there are a number of great minds working on technological solutions – from renewable energy to electric vehicles – to do just that.  However, the bathtub is still full of too much water – the air is already full of CO2 at dangerous levels – and if we cannot turn the tap off completely, the tub is going to overflow. So, we are also going to need to pull the plug – and that means removing CO2 directly from the atmosphere. This may sound impossible, but it isn’t. My company has developed a technology called direct air capture that removes CO2 using large fans to pull air through a filter that has a liquid capture chemical flowing over it. That chemical binds to the CO2, removing it from the air, and then we purify and compress it. After that, we can bury it permanently, injecting CO2 into rock formations deep underground. This means we create something called “negative emissions”; by doing this, we will be able to bring our global emissions down to zero at a much faster rate. Eventually, these facilities will be key to reducing the level of CO2 in the air back to safe levels. • Steve Oldham, CEO of Carbon Engineering, a Canadian-based clean energy company Dorian Kopij, 15, Rochester, Kent Good question. We always thought that the answer is that it would take many centuries, because climate science has generally assumed that levels of CO2 will remain in the atmosphere for a very long time: that global heating is essentially locked in. We are now seeing a real awakening, by scientists, organisations and activists about how to draw carbon down from the atmosphere. We can do this by using both natural techniques, such as planting more trees, and newer technologies that can filter CO2 from the air. So then the question is: can we reduce greenhouse gas emissions to very small and manageable levels, and remove significant amounts of carbon in time to avoid runaway climate change, which could occur within 10-12 years? Whatever the answer to that is, we must do everything we possibly can sooner than we think we can, and more brilliantly and imaginatively than we think possible. “Drawdown” is the name for the point when emissions peak and then begin to go down on a year-to-year basis. But even if we achieve this aim, most people think that there would be at least a 20-year lag time before temperatures start to measurably go down. There’s always the danger that if we take too long, warming will have increased to the point where melting ice emits methane, creating yet more temperature rises. The planet is then warming itself without humans doing anything to make it happen. In that case, all bets are off. • Paul Hawken is editor of Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed To Reverse Global Warming Elizabeth Kelly, 14, Hemel Hempstead You can be very powerful when it comes to action, as -: Greta Thunberg has showned the world the power of ordinary schoolkids. This is because climate breakdown will hurt younger generations the most, and you have done the least to cause it. Most adults realise this at some level, even though they aren’t doing much to stop climate breakdown, yet. Most of us recognise our moral obligation to leave children a decent future, which obviously includes a decent planet. The main thing ordinary schoolchildren should do is find ways for your voices to be heard, loud and clear. We need everyone to wake up and realise how serious this is. Climate striking every Friday is a great start. If you get in trouble with your school, it gives you a good reason to talk to the media: your voice gets louder. Because what’s more important – staying out of detention or having a livable planet? This takes courage, it’s true, but I think we find courage in ourselves when we have a great need. And there’s no greater need than stopping climate breakdown. Other things you can do include: 1. Find groups of people who already understand the seriousness of climate breakdown, and get involved. 2. Talk about climate breakdown with your friends, parents, teachers, the news media. 3. Learn about it so you can answer questions. 4. Try out creative new ways to express the urgency, beyond school striking. 5. Reduce your own fossil fuel use. “Walking the talk” makes you authentic and empowered. • Peter Kalmus, climate scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Lab and author of Being The Change: Live Well And Spark A Climate Revolution Stanley Booth, 12, Leighton Buzzard, Beds Allow me to start with a joke: If we don’t reduce emissions, the future will be like the film Waterworld – terrible. It’s important that we learn to laugh for two reasons. First, the climate crisis is here to stay, even if we do start to fix it soon. And humour can be a coping mechanism. It can help us deal with a problem that is so overwhelming it makes us feel small, depressed or futile. You have to laugh or you’ll cry, basically. We need to find ways to survive the grief and the loss of so many things we currently take for granted. Second, and perhaps more importantly, I believe that laughter is an excellent way of reaching wider audiences and engaging people who are less interested in the topic. Comedy makes people more open to new ideas. So humour can also be used to get the message across. Laughter has a strong social function in bonding groups of people together and also helps make the message more relatable. I know this because I’m both a climate researcher and a standup comedian. I do serious science stuff during the day, but then tell jokes about the climate at night. Talking about climate change using comedy helps me think about it in a different way, and to communicate in a simpler manner. I think more scientists should try it. And, just so you know, I fully support the school strikers. I’m just annoyed that they didn’t call it the minors’ strike. • Matt Winning’s show, It’s The End Of The World As We Know, is part of the Edinburgh festival fringe. His podcast, Operation Earth, airs this summer Jemima Lett, 15, Poole There are many ways that we contribute to climate change through our daily activities, often without realising it. It can be interesting to do a personal greenhouse gas inventory. Do you eat a plant-rich diet, take short showers, walk, bike, or take public transport to school, buy used clothes, repair broken appliances, hang your clothes to dry, and avoid air travel? You can find carbon calculators on the internet that help you to work out the impact of your behaviours. However, the biggest thing that most of us do that contributes to climate change is to assume that what we do does not really matter. We underestimate our own capacity to contribute to a sustainable world. We tend, instead, to assume that things just have to be the way that they are. It’s easy to forget that you can inspire your friends, parents, school and community to try alternatives, such as providing vegetarian options, improving public transport options, investing in renewable energies, and so on. Or that you can also engage in politics, and work with others for climate justice and sustainability. The potential for each of us to contribute to a fair, sustainable and thriving world is huge. We don’t always realise it, but we matter more than we think. • Karen O’Brien, professor at the University of Oslo and co-founder of cchange.no, a website aiming to give people knowledge, skills, and tools to make ethical transformation With thanks to Poole high school, Dorset; St Bernard’s high school, Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex; John F Kennedy Catholic school, Hemel Hempstead, Herts, and the Guardian Education Centre. • If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication). • This article was amended on 19 August 2019 to clarify that Paul Hawken is the editor of Drawdown, not the author as stated in an earlier version."

In February the sun was very quiet in activity. The observed sunspot number (SSN) was only 44.8, which is only 53% of the mean value for this month into the solar cycles – calculated from the previous systematic observations of the earlier cycles.

Figure 1: Solar activity of the current Cycle No. 24 in red, the mean value for all previously observed cycles is shown in blue, and the up to now similar Cycle No. 1 in black.
It has now been 75 months since cycle No. 24 began in December, 2008. Overall this cycle has been only 53% of the mean value in activity. About 22 years ago (in November 1992) Solar Cycle No. 22 was also in its 75th month, and back then solar activity was 139% of normal value. The current drop in solar activity is certainly quite impressive. This is clear when one compares all the previous cycles:

Figure 2: Comparison of all solar cycles. The plotted values are the differences of the accumulated monthly values from mean (blue in Figure 1).
The solar polar magnetic fields have become somewhat more pronounced compared to the month earlier (see our Figure 2 “Die Sonne im Januar 2015 und atlantische Prognosen“) and thus the sunspot maximum for the current cycle is definitely history. It’s highly probable that over the next years we will see a slow tapering off in sunspot activity. Weak cycles such as the current one often follow. Thus the next minimum, which is defined by the appearance of the first sunspots in the new cycle 25, may first occur after the year 2020. The magnetic field of its sunspots will then be opposite of what we are currently observing in cycle 24.
The radiative forcing of CMIP5 models cannot be validated?
A recent paper by Marotzke/ Forster (M/F) is in strong discussion here at climateaudit.org with more than 800 comments. Nicolas Lewis pointed out the question: Is the method of M/F for evaluating the trends infected by circularity?
There is not only a discussion about the methods, but also about the main conclusion: “The claim that climate models systematically overestimate the response to radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gas concentrations therefore seems to be unfounded.”
Is the natural variability really suppressing our efforts to separate the better models of the CMIP5 ensemble from not so good ones?
Here I present a method to find an approach.
Step 1
I investigated the ability of the 42 “series” runs of “Willis model sheet” (Thanks to Willis Eschenbach for the work to bring 42 anonymous CMIP5 models in “series”!) to replicate the least square linear trends from 1900 to 2014 (annual global data, 2014 is the constant end-date of these running trends). I calculated for each year from 1900 to 1995 the differences between the HadCRUT4 (observed) trends ending in 2014 and the trends of every “series” also ending in 2014. The sum of the squared residuals for 1900 to 1995 the differences between the HadCRUT4 (observed) trends ending in 2014 and the trends of every “series” also ending in 2014.
The sum of the squared residuals for 1900 to 1995 for every “series”:

Figure 3: The sum of the squared residuals for the running trends with constant end in 2014 from 1900,1901 and so on up to 1995 for every “Series” in “Willis sheet”. On the x-axis: the series 1…42.
Step 2
We describe the same procedure described in Step 1, but this time with the trends up to 2004, only 10 years before the end of the trend series:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Figure 4: The sum of the squared residuals for the running trends with constant end in 2014 from 1900, 1901 and so on up to 1995 for every “series” in the “Willis sheet”. On the x-axis: the series 1…42. The ordinate scale is the same as in Figure 3.
Here one sees that the errors for the trends until 2004 on average are much smaller (Figure 4) than they are for the trends up to 2014 (Figure 3). That is no wonder as the parameters of most models for the time period up to 2005 were “set“. Thus the depiction of the trends of the models up to 2014 are also well in agreement with observations:

Figure 5: The trends of the model mean (Mod. Mean, red) in °C/ year since 1900, 1901 etc. up to 1985 with the constant end-year 2004 compared to observations (black).
Obviously the setting of the model parameters no longer “hold” as the errors up to the year 2014 rise rapidly.
Step 3
We calculate the quotients of the errors for the 2014 trends divided by the errors for the 2004 trends (See Figure 4) for every single series and make a 2-dimensional check:

Figure 6: The single series as plotted points. The coordinates are determined by the trend error der until 2014 (X axis) and the ratio of the error up to 2014/2004 (Y axis). The red rectangle marks the “boundaries”, the “good“ series are inside, the “bad“ are outside.
The borders are represented by the standard deviations of both series.
The y-axis in Figure 6 above is the quotient of failures in trend estimations to 2014 (see Figure 5) divided by the trend estimations to 2004 (see Figure 4) with a standard deviation of 3.08; the x-axis is the accuracy of the series in trend estimation for the running trends with the constant end year 2014 (see Figure 5) with a standard deviation of 0.0038. The big differences of many series (up to a factor of 11) between the trend errors compared of 2004 and the trend errors to 2014 is impressive, isn’t it? The stability of the series with great differences seems to be in question, that’s why they are “bad”.
Step 4
Now comes the most interesting part: From the 42 runs of different series, I selected the “good” ones which are within the borders of the red rectangle in Figure 4 and calculated their average. The same procedure was done with all the “bad” ones.

Figure 7: The selected “good” series (see step 1-3), the series mean of all 42 series, the “bad” ones and the observations for rolling trends with constant end-year 2014 in K per annum.
The “good” (blue) series produce a remarkably better approach to the observations than the model mean (red) and the “bad”( green) show the worst performance.
Up to this point we didn’t know what model was behind what “series” in the “Willis sheet”. Thanks to the help from Willis Eschenbach and Nic Lewis we just learned the assignment and the properties of the models behind the “series”, also their corresponding sensitivity with respect to forcing by GHG. The mean value of the transient climate response (TCR), which is the expression for the calculated greenhouse gas effect, is approximately 1.6 for the “good“ models, the model mean (all models) is 1.8 and the “bad” model mean is 1.96.
As one observes is Figure 7, the selection of the “good” models “improves” the convergence towards the observations. For this a TCR of approximately 1.3 is assumed, compare to our blog post “Wie empfindlich ist unser Klima gegenüber der Erwärmung durch Treibhausgase? (How sensitive is our climate with respect to warming from greenhouse gases)“.
Conclusion
The mean of the models overestimates the radiative forcings in the global temperature to 2014. The objectively better models have a lower mean of TCR. The “bad” models have a higher mean of TCR. Many models are perhaps “over tuned” for the trends to 2005. The result is a dramatic loss in forecasting quality beyond the tuning period. Are Marotzke and Forster wrong? Will we ever hear them admit it? There are reasons for doubt.

"Eventually, even the most intrepid adventurer has to come home. In the past 20 years Bruce Parry has been initiated, for our viewing pleasure, into indigenous tribes in Congo, Venezuela and Mongolia. He has had thorns forced through his nose in Papua New Guinea and has hunted crocodiles in Ethiopia. He has navigated the Amazon and sledged across the Arctic. His latest adventure in assimilation, however, is perhaps his most formidable challenge yet. In October last year the BBC ethnographer, former Royal Marines fitness instructor and determined hedonist moved from his long-time base in Ibiza to an isolated hamlet in mid-Wales. He plans to be here for many years to come. I met him for lunch in the only cafe for 10 miles around, Cwtch in Pont rhyd-y groes, which is built above a gorge of the Ystwyth river beside the old workings of a lead mine. Parry has cycled from his cottage beside a waterfall on the neighbouring Hafod estate. It’s a significant lunch for Parry in that the salad leaves – seven varieties – at the cafe are the first crop from a community garden project that he has helped to establish in the walled garden of the demolished estate manor house.  Food was one of the reasons that he ended up here. Having spent 30 years as a professional nomad, he not only wanted to put down roots, he also wanted to pull some up. He grew up in Devon, has family in Scotland and a Welsh surname, but he wasn’t sure where to settle. “I wanted somewhere wild,” he says, “and I wanted to get into wild food as a way of reconnecting with the landscape.” His first foraging outing brought him to Hafod: it felt so right that he ended up buying the old stone cottage that he stayed in. Parry has an instantly likable and high-energy presence. He has made no secret of indulging in all the delights that Ibiza can offer – as well as taking just about every hallucinogen under the sun in order to be fully accepted in different jungle communities. He turned 50 in March. How, I wonder, did he cope with his first wet Welsh winter? “I feel that was my initiation,” he says, smiling. He has a wood fire. “I spent most of the winter in a hat and scarf inside. I survived that OK, though I haven’t met the midges yet – I think that’s August.” Just in 10 minutes sitting in Cwtch – the name means both cosy corner and hug – you can see Parry’s gift for connection with people. He knows everyone who comes in like an old mate. Dom, the chef and proprietor here, and now purveyor of “walled-garden lettuce”, is greeted with genuine affection, and each delicious vegetarian dish off the specials board he brings out produces fresh rapture from Parry. “You’re on fire today, Dom!” There is more to Parry’s return than any kind of homesickness. He believed, having had an immersive understanding of the wisdom of some of the oldest human communities, that he should now try to put some of that into practice in the place he fell to earth. Parry had spent four or five years up to 2017 making a very personal film, Tawai: A Voice From the Forest. It was both a portrait of the perilous, joyful existence of one of the last hunter-gatherer societies, the Penan people of Borneo, and a meditation on the ways in which we are destroying their world – and our planet. “Tawai was the last project,” he says. “I guess I thought I had seen it all, but then I met the Penan and there was something completely different about them.” It was not only that they had a genuine pre-agricultural existence, of the kind that humans lived for 85% of the lifetime of our species. “They had no competition, no hierarchy. They were the only group I had been in that had no pecking order, no chief, no elders.” He was struck by what such an egalitarian heritage might mean. Parry’s journeys along the Amazon and across the Arctic had long since impressed on him the crisis that our planet is facing, a crisis of climate, and of consumerism, and he felt it was no longer enough to report the issues, he had to try to live what felt like possible solutions. His plan is to open up his house and create a small experiment in communal living. “I have no doubt that human beings have problems ahead,” he says. “Really big problems. And we are not doing it right.” The BBC was keen for him to carry on “gallivanting”: “Let’s go down the Mekong, we can talk about important things …!” and there was no doubt some temptation in that. “But the problem is not really how China is polluting its rivers. The problem is how we are all, mainly in the west, living our lives.” Parry talks fluently about the issues around land ownership in Britain, which has caused the majority of us to be so disconnected from the living environment. He sees the recent One Planet development scheme in Wales – which allows anyone to build on agricultural land if they follow certain self-sufficiency guidelines – as a model of a future revolution. “We are swimming so deeply in a world of competition and aggression and division that we don’t even see it,” he says. “We are being fed this information that money and stuff will make you happy but I think that the right narrative can create a massive shift. We can’t all have a Lamborghini, but maybe we could all have a bit of land and some joy and music and harmony.” In Ibiza, of course, those qualities were in generous supply. Where does he go to dance in Ceredigion? He mentions occasional late-night excursions up to the alternative communities in Machynlleth, 25 miles north. “I could have easily stayed in Ibiza,” he says. “We could have been having a long rosé and seafood lunch on the beach, rather than Dom’s fantastic salads. It wasn’t that all that fizzled out. But what I learned especially from the tribes is that there is an extra ingredient from knowing a place.” We talk about the upcoming engagements he has to discuss this thinking; one at the Port Eliot festival in the summer, another with the Canadian Stephen Jenkinson, the author of Die Wise, who has used the insights of a long career in palliative care to propose answers to our “culture failure”. “If you are part of a tribe,” says Parry, “knowing that when you die you are going to feed the tree that feeds the fruit that feeds your community and that your life will be part of the whole ecosystem is a powerful thing.” Though Parry has more bucket-list ticks than most of the rest of us put together, he hasn’t done some of the things that many men of his age have achieved. Having lived “polyamorously” for many years, he recently split from a long-term partner. He has no kids and, he says, no particular yearning for any. “Without question there is a lot of me that loves freedom,” he says. “But my driving force now is that I am madly trying to figure out what my role can be in moving this community idea forwards – though maybe what I am proposing is only valid for what comes out of the ashes of the next big financial crash.” There is no doubt he will be well placed to survive catastrophe. He is trying to live mostly from what he can forage – he loves cooking, he says, though he fears that love is not always shared by guests. “I make my own bread, grind my own wheat, soak my own pulses. I have 25kg of wheat, huge tubs of chickpeas and lentils. If I’m ever stuck for a couple of months, I’ll be fine.” I wonder if the BBC are keen to film this latest venture? He suggests they would like to, but his new Welsh friends insist it will be over their dead bodies. “I definitely think I have more to share on this, though,” he says, with a laugh. We exercise that principle in the first instance by taking two forks to Dom’s lemon drizzle cake.  Bruce Parry is at Port Eliot festival, 25-29 July, St Germans, Cornwall; porteliotfestival.com"

Highly Urgent Topic: Presentation “Gender division of labor in climate change” at the University of Bremen on 12 November 2014
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
On November 12, 2014 a colloquium by the artec research centre for sustainability is taking place at the University of Bremen at 4 pm. The colloquium focuses on a topic that has long been a pressing issue and has been the source of many sleepless nights:
Value creation and value appreciation: Gender division of labor in climate change
Speaker: Dr. Sybille Bauriedl, Bayreuth Academy of Advanced African Studies”
So what could possibly be behind this title? Is the suspected climate change going to lead men to finally getting off their lazy butts and helping out with the ironing and laundry? Or is the looming heat going to lead men to not being able to help out at all because they’ll be confined to sweating profusely on a hammock? Lots of questions, but no answers.
At the speaker’s website we happen to come across another important presentation from a year ago:

Social construction of climate change. How and what can feminist research contribute to gendered climate policy?”
This is something we have always asked ourselves. Or what about this presentation here by Bauriedl from 2012:
Climate justice and gender justice: women in the climate trap”
Women in the climate trap. The insidious climate catastrophe apparently has had the world of women in its sights. Unfortunately the site does not offer any presentation files, which we would have loved to have a look at.
It is truly interesting to observe where our tax dollars are going. For Ms Bauriedl and her occupation, it would certainly be catastrophic if it ever turned out that everyone had over-estimated climate change for years and if the dreaded catastrophe never materialized.

"European leaders have thrown the Amazon rainforest under a Volkswagen bus in a massive cows-for-cars trade deal with Brazil and three other South American nations. The EU-Mercosur agreement – the largest in Europe’s history, according to officials – will make it cheaper for Brazilian farmers to export agricultural products, particularly beef, despite growing evidence that cattle ranching is the primary driver of deforestation.   In return, European businesses get greater access to the markets of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, which will benefit producers of vehicles, chemicals, machinery, wine and cheese. Negotiations took almost two decades, which may explain why the outcome signed last week reflects the pro-industry values of the past rather than the environmental concerns of the present. Europeans know the risks. Many more people here are adopting a vegetarian diet as it becomes clear that consumption of beef – particularly from Brazil – is a cause of forest clearance, which is destabilising the climate. The clearest proof yet is contained in a new investigation by the Stockholm-based NGO Trase, which tracks supply chains and the impact of the beef on our plates, in our burgers and on our barbecues. Even before the new trade deal, the country-by-country breakdown by Trase – reported exclusively by the Guardian – reveals that meat consumers in Britain were indirectly responsible for up to 500 football pitches of land clearance in Brazil last year. Italy – the biggest Brazilian beef buyer in the EU – chewed through about four times as much. With the agreed reduction in tariffs, the volume in all European countries is likely to increase. The trade deal was celebrated by the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has put agriculture and mining at the vanguard of a strategy to open up the Amazon, the Cerrado and other forests. His government has neutered the environment ministry and pushed proposals to remove the protected status for indigenous territory and nature reserves. Last month, a record surge of deforestation prompted concerns that Bolsonaro is giving a free pass to illegal logging, farming and mining. Last year saw a 13% increase to the highest level in a decade. Not coincidentally, this comes at a time of record beef exports. Brazil is now the world’s slaughterhouse. Last year, 1.64m tonnes of steak and other cuts were sent overseas, beating the previous record in 2007, which followed the peak of forest clearance. The Trase study shows 5,800 sq km – 100 times the area of Manhattan – was cut down last year to create pastures. European leaders have downplayed the environmental impact of the deal. Despite the cheaper tariffs, they claim beef imports are unlikely to rise significantly and insist the deal locks Brazil into the Paris climate agreement. The European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told reporters the historic deal highlighted a commitment to “rules-based trade”. Yet there are countless reports of rule-breaking by Brazilian meat companies. An investigation published this week by the Guardian, in conjunction with Repórter Brasil and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, shows how the global market leader JBS is still selling meat from companies that have been fined for deforestation. This follows similar revelations two years ago, connected to a senior member of the Brazilian cabinet. The farmers involved denied the claims.  Many European politicians and environmentalists are furious about the trade deal and sceptical that it will increase leverage over Bolsonaro. They see the agreement as a form of appeasement at the behest of corporate interests. Behind this are bigger geo-strategic concerns. In recent years, China (particularly Hong Kong) has become Brazil’s biggest customer by far for beef and soy, which is used to feed livestock. According to Trase, China is responsible for 60 times more deforestation than the UK. Without support from Beijing, efforts to promote greater supply-chain transparency and sustainability in the Amazon and Cerrado will come to nothing. The US is also expected to announce that it will resume imports of fresh beef from Brazil for the first time since July 2017, which will add to pressure on the forests and give Bolsonaro further cause to abandon the battle against deforestation. Business and politics as usual cannot fix this. The world’s greatest rainforest is a globally essential source of oxygen, carbon sequestration and biodiversity, but as long as these benefits are omitted from trade balance sheets, it will continue to lose out to steakhouses and burger joints. The Amazon needs to be at the centre of a change of values, not a peripheral concern that can be bartered away for a consignment of auto parts and delicatessen fillers. This article was amended on Monday 8 July to correct the figure on China’s deforestation in comparison with the UK."
"Enthusiasts describe nuclear power as an essential tool to combat the climate emergency because, unlike renewables, it is a reliable source of base load power. This is a spurious claim because power stations are uniquely vulnerable to global heating. They need large quantities of cooling water to function, however the increasing number of heatwaves are threatening this supply.  The French energy company EDF is curbing its output from four reactors in Bugey, on the Rhône River near the Swiss border, because the water is too warm and the flow is low. Some reactors in the US are also frequently affected. This matters in both countries because the increasing use of air conditioning means electricity demand is high during summer heatwaves and intermittent nuclear power is not much help. This does not affect nuclear power stations in the UK because they draw their water supplies from the sea, which stays relatively cool. However, it may affect plans to build small reactors on a lake in Trawsfynydd, Wales. And it may also reduce some of the UK’s power supplies during the summer. As heatwaves intensify, the flow of electricity from French reactors through the growing number of cross-Channel interconnector cables cannot be relied on."
"Twelve years ago, Sheryl Crow was laughed at for suggesting that green-minded people should use only a single square of toilet paper every time they go to the loo (or two to three sheets for “pesky situations”). Well, we’re not laughing now, are we? On the day before the hottest day of the year so far (temperatures at Glastonbury hit 30C, elsewhere in the UK 35C), Crow knocks out hit after hit on the Pyramid stage under a giant globe, Glastonbury’s reminder that we’ve only got one planet, and dedicates Soak Up the Sun to Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist and school striker. Thunberg’s spirit is embedded in Worthy Farm this year. There are murals of her face with the slogan: “What would Greta do?”  But another environmental legend makes it in person. David Attenborough, a surprise addition, comes out to enormous cheers from the massive crowd in front of the Pyramid stage – possibly the loudest of the entire festival. Giving a shoutout to Glastonbury for going plastic-free, he then introduces a little treat – a trailer for his next show, One Planet: Seven Worlds. This year’s festival has been sold as Glastonbury’s greenest ever. As Attenborough mentions, there has been a much-publicised ban on single-use plastic on site (although actually this is just a ban on vendors giving out single-use plastic; punters are allowed to bring in plastic bottles, but encouraged to reuse them at 850 refill points). At the last festival, in 2017, visitors used 1.3m plastic bottles, and the clean-up operation cost almost £800,000 and took six weeks – despite perennial pleas from Emily and Michael Eavis to “Love Worthy Farm, Leave No Trace”. Festivalgoers have been informed that leaving tent pegs in the ground could result in cows eating them and dying. Despite the 15,000 colour-coded bins, the site is still a sea of detritus. But nobody I speak to admits to having discarded, say, the Calvin Klein underpants I spot on the ground while queueing for ice-cream. (The ice-cream vans, of course, idle all day long, exhaust fumes mixing with the dust kicked up by thousands of marching feet. A lot of the stewards pair their fluorescent jackets with face masks.) There is excitement around Extinction Rebellion’s appearance on the Park stage on Thursday. Friends Harry Hayward and Minnie Bartley (both 22) and Joe Holley (23) are sitting in the park eating pizza, Harry in a multi-coloured umbrella hat (“It’s quite sweaty”). It’s their first time at Glastonbury. They want to talk about environmentalism and politics (it has been noted that more people yelled: “fuck the government and fuck Boris” at Stormzy’s Saturday headline set than will actually be able to vote for Johnson to be prime minister, while Zac Goldsmith was booed at his own event). “It’s definitely good that Glastonbury is pushing the green agenda. I’ve been on the last two out of three Extinction Rebellion marches in Leeds,” says Harry. “But we need to do something about this Tory government. Some of the reaction [to the climate demonstrations, to Thunberg’s parliamentary address] has been really negative.” Minnie has noticed an increase in people caring. “Even in a year, with things like plastic straws. Every little helps.” But Joe outlines the wider problem when he says that, in preparation for Glastonbury, he bought a reusable water bottle from Amazon, “and it came in so much packaging, loads of it”. The Extinction Rebellion set features Kurukindi, a Kichwa Amazonian shaman. Many in the crowd (some dressed in bee headdresses, or holding placards painted with whales) are visibly moved by his performance. Speeches by Extinction Rebellion’s co-founder, Gail Bradbrook, and Greenpeace’s Rosie Rogers follow. A huge cheer erupts when Rogers calls the MP Mark Field, who grabbed a Greenpeace protester by the back of the neck before marching her out, a “scumbag”. “The only thing we were armed with were leaflets and peer-reviewed science.” A procession to the stone circle, ending in people forming a giant human hourglass (because time is running out), is fairly shambolic, but Extinction Rebellion’s pastel pink boat – the one that hosted Emma Thompson in Oxford Circus, and is named after Berta Cáceres, the late Honduran activist – is even prettier in the flesh.  At the Extinction Rebellion base in the Green Fields, Clarissa Carlyon, who has been volunteering with the group since October 2018 and was heavily involved in planning the April occupation, says Glastonbury has been really accommodating to the group. But is it enough, I ask. And doesn’t she think other festivals have been way ahead of the curve? Mandala festival in the Netherlands, or Shambala in Northamptonshire, for instance, which is powered by 100% renewable energy and doesn’t allow Coca-Cola and Nestlé products to be sold on site.  “I think it’s really tough when you have something the size and scale of Glastonbury,” she says. “But they have given us this space, and other spaces, and we’ve got videos playing around. It is great that the festival is embracing what we’re talking about. I do feel it is seeping into the DNA of the place.”  Glastonbury has long been conscious of its footprint. The reusable 80% recycled stainless steel cups sold on site for a fiver were originally produced in 2016 as a way to help support the besieged British steel industry. (Although I watch loads of people being served their drinks in cardboard cups even when they proffer their steel cup, and the cardboard cups do not always end up in the correct bins.) It is also customary that any tents left behind are repurposed. In 2016, a charity called Aid Box Convoy collected abandoned tents and sent them to refugee camps in Europe. (But it is estimated that 90% of tents left at festivals end up as landfill.) At a Leftfield event called How to Save Our Planet, the Labour MP Clive Lewis and Minnie Rahman, from the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, point out that climate justice intersects with social, racial and class justice. Rahman says: “White people are overwhelmingly represented in the climate movement. I’d really like to see the movement taking forward the connection that climate change doesn’t affect us all equally. We see people in the global south, for instance, dying to protect their land, or the health impacts in parts of Britain because of air pollution.” A panel by gal-dem makes similar points in their own discussions. The Leftfield tent is rammed. Although a few brims of straw hats are sliding down noses in the midday heat, the Green party’s Caroline Lucas is afforded a rock-star welcome and a huge cheer goes up when she mentions Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Lucas’s reference to the Green New Deal, a private member’s bill she has tabled with Lewis that is inspired by Ocasio-Cortez, is met with a cacophony of applause. An audience member mooting the role nuclear power might have in addition to renewables is quickly talked down. The Norwegian singer Aurora released A Different Kind of Human (Step II), an album themed around ecological disaster, earlier this month. Before performing on the John Peel stage, she tells me that she always knew the album was going to be about the climate crisis. When I ask if she will be sticking around after her set, the answer is no, because she is flying to Belgium. What does she do to lessen her own environmental impact, especially when touring? She mentions wooden toothbrushes and being vegetarian. Johannes Hogebrink, an artist from Amsterdam, has also flown to the UK for Glastonbury and is busy crafting a sand sculpture for Extinction Rebellion. The sculpture is a huge skull with a beetle crawling out of one eye and money coming out of the mouth. “You cannot eat money, oh no!” as Aurora’s song The Seed has it. Over at the Shangri-La, this year’s theme is “Junkstaposition” and it is home to the Disruption Bureau, a training centre for activists. Organisations including Amnesty International and Extinction Rebellion offer activities such as placard-making and flag-printing, but the most common interactions I observe are the handing out of leaflets and the signing of petitions. However, there is a great audio installation by Echoic Audio called Memory Tree, and the open-air art pieces are impressive, if not beautiful (that’s kind of the point), including trees that are made from assorted waste. The Gas Tower is made entirely from recovered ocean plastic. Before her panel, I ask Lucas about Glastonbury 2011, when she appeared on the Pyramid stage before Wu-Tang Clan. “It was great,” she says, “inspiring and exciting. But terrifying.” She is thrilled that young ipeople are taking up the climate cause, such as George Bond, a 16-year-old activist, also on the panel. Equally inspiring at the other end of the age spectrum is Barbara Richardson, here on behalf of the Fracking Nanas. Bond throws an important date out, 20 September, which he says will be “the largest climate demonstration this country ever has seen. It’s gonna be huge, it’s gonna be beautiful, but it’s also gonna be filled with anger and rage that nothing has been done.”  Last week, the government pledged to get net emissions down to zero by 2050. But it is simply not good enough. As Lucas puts it, it’s a bit like calling the fire brigade in an emergency and asking them to turn up in 30 years’ time. As the burning sun goes down and jumpers are pulled out from backpacks, a man tosses his chip wrapper on the ground, his mate crushing a can before hurling it into the grass. A bunch of people take cocaine in the gloaming, which in its own way is ravaging the parts of the world Kurikunda talked about protecting. Glastonbury is making a massive effort, albeit with room for improvement. And the ecstatic response to Attenborough is an indication that environmentalism is much cooler than it ever was – people genuinely care now. But we’ll know soon enough whether the festivalgoers matched the organisers’ green aspirations and took away with them not just brilliant memories, possible sunburn and multiple blisters, but all the other rubbish they were asked politely to do so."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAntarctic Sea Ice is Growing – Because of Global Warming?
By Ed Caryl
Short answer: No. Antarctic sea ice has been growing, especially in the last three years. This has been largely ignored by the AGW crowd because it opposes their narrative. They needed badly to come up with an excuse. A recent article in the Daily Caller, quoted below, was recently discussed in this blog. See here.
A quote from the article: “The primary reason for this is the nature of the circulation of the Southern Ocean —water heated in high southern latitudes is carried equatorward [sic], to be replaced by colder waters upwelling from below, which inhibits ice loss,” Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, told author Harold Ambler in an email. Read more: http://dailycaller.
It is a bit difficult for me to swallow this in light of the temperature trend in the southern ocean:

Figure 1 is the annual temperature trend in the Southern Ocean according to GISS.
It is also opposite the well understood thermohaline current flows in both the Arctic and Antarctic, where warm currents flow from the equator to the poles, is cooled, surface evaporation increases salinity, and the cold, dense, more saline water sinks, to rise again closer to the equator. The southern ocean is getting colder, not warmer, opposite to the trend stated above.

Figure 2 is the Southern Hemisphere sea ice anomaly inverted to match the temperature curve.
Note how closely these curves match, even though one is annual average data and the other is daily ice anomaly. Just how is it that this high southern latitude supposed heated water is getting colder, not warmer. I’m sorry, but my credulity doesn’t stretch this far.

"The climate crisis is such an overwhelming problem that many people understandably want to keep it separate from other issues. After all, the task seems daunting enough already. To avoid catastrophic climate disruption, global emissions of greenhouse gases must be slashed by 45% by 2030, requiring unprecedented transformations in energy, agriculture and other key economic sectors, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change declared last October. But treating the climate crisis as a stand-alone problem is a mistake. Issues of justice – economic justice, racial justice, gender justice and intergenerational justice – lie at the heart of this crisis, and these injustices must be addressed if the fight for a livable future is to succeed. We can’t simply slap solar panels everywhere and call it a day. We have to dismantle the systems of oppression that gave rise to and perpetuate the climate crisis, including colonialism, racism and patriarchy.  Many people trace the origins of today’s climate crisis to the Industrial Revolution, when humans first began to burn large amounts of coal, but the crisis’s true roots extend further back to the onset of colonialism. When European colonizers ventured to Africa, Asia, North and South America, they invariably plundered the local natural resources, damaged habitats, hunted species to extinction and often forced human inhabitants into slavery. Undergirding European colonialism was the assumption that everything on the earth was meant to be extracted, bought and sold – and to make an elite minority very rich. In the eyes of the colonizers, the “new” lands they encountered had no owners – no one had purchased them with a recognizable currency or could prove ownership with property records – so it was free pickings. Along with this attitude came the idea that nothing – not air, not water, not trees, not animals – was sacred or priceless. Colonialism’s mindset of heedless extraction, greed and human exploitation not only planted the seeds of today’s climate crisis, it remains visible in the crisis’s central injustice: although the poor are responsible for only a tiny share of humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions, they generally suffer first and worst from the heatwaves, droughts, storms, rising seas and other effects of those emissions. Most countries in Asia, Africa and South America that endured centuries of colonization remain relatively poor today, and even countries like India and China whose prosperity is increasing emit much less per capita than do the rich countries in North America and Europe. Extreme weather and other climate impacts strike all over the world, but the rich are better positioned to withstand those impacts. The rich have the money to build seawalls, for example, and to operate satellites that warn about an impending hurricane so coastal dwellers can retreat to safety. And when disaster strikes, nonwhite or non-affluent communities are often shortchanged during relief efforts. After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, black homeowners received $8,000 less per family in government resettlement aid than did white homeowners. Which helps explain why, even eight years after the storm, roughly 80% of the mostly black residents of the city’s Lower Ninth ward had not returned. That brings us to the next system of oppression driving today’s climate crisis – racism. Study after study has shown that people of color and those living in poverty are exposed to higher levels of environmental pollution and suffer commensurately greater health problems. More than half of the residents within two miles of toxic waste facilities in the United States are people of color, according to a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council. People of color are nearly twice as likely as white people to live close to an industrial facility, a report by the Center for Effective Government found. People who lived close to industrial facilities and waste sites in the Bronx borough of New York City were 66% more likely to be hospitalized for asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Why are the vast majority of fossil fuel production sites located in low income or immigrant or communities of color? Because these people have long been victimized by racism, and their perceived powerlessness makes them easy targets for the corporations that operate those facilities and the governments that permit them. By contrast, wealthy white citizens tend to have the money and power to keep such projects out of their neighborhoods. Take the Dakota Access pipeline, a project designed to transport up to half a million barrels of crude oil daily from North Dakota to Illinois. As ABC News reported, that pipeline was originally set to be built through a majority white community, Bismarck, North Dakota, but when that community rejected it, the pipeline was rerouted through indigenous land. Jesse Jackson, who joined the protests against the rerouting, called it “the ripest case of environmental racism I’ve seen in a long time”. On top of colonialism and racism, the third system of oppression shaping the climate crisis is patriarchy. Simply put, women are more affected by climate disruption than men are. The UN’s Gateway on Gender Equality and Empowerment project has documented that 80% of the people displaced by climate disasters are female. Women’s roles as primary caregivers and providers of food and fuel make us more vulnerable when flooding and drought occur. In central Africa, where up to 90% of Lake Chad has disappeared, nomadic indigenous women are particularly at risk. As the lake’s shoreline recedes, women have to walk much further to collect water. With dry seasons becoming longer, women are forced to work harder to feed and care for their families. In addition, women worldwide are more likely to be living in poverty, so it’s more difficult for them to recover after climate-related and other disasters. This is how systems of oppression intertwine with the climate crisis. People of color, women, poor people, disabled people, queer people, homeless people – pretty much everyone who is already vulnerable is disproportionately at risk from climate disruption. Which is why the climate crisis demands bigger solutions than we initially thought. We need to see the climate crisis not as a stand-alone issue floating separately from everything else, but as the grand culmination of societal injustices that have been building up for centuries. We must speak truth to power, call out these systems of oppression and put social justice at the center of our fight for a livable future. We must pressure elected leaders, corporations, the news media and others in power not only to abandon fossil fuels and other climate-destructive activities but also to address the systems of oppression that gave rise to the climate crisis in the first place. You can take action by joining Zero Hour, a youth-led climate action group that I co-founded. Zero Hour is hosting a summit 12-14 July in Miami where activists will discuss how these systems of oppression intersect with the climate crisis and what we can do about it. This Is Zero Hour: The Youth Climate Summit is open to everyone, but it will highlight the voices of youth who are at the receiving end of these systems and fighting back. Join us! Because the only way to overcome a crisis this big is with a climate action revolution. Jamie Margolin, 17, is a Colombian American student, author, activist and a founder of the youth climate action organization Zero Hour"

"The climate emergency is wreaking havoc across the world, and it is the poorest countries that bear the brunt of the crisis. In Somalia, where I am acting country director for the aid agency Islamic Relief, the population is currently experiencing a drought that could threatenthe lives or livelihoods of more than two million people by the end of the summer, according to the UN.  The climate has been wreaking havoc on Somalia’s seasons. Ordinarily there are four: the main rainy season between April and June (gu), the second rainy season between October and December (deyr), and the dry seasons that follow each of them. Two-thirds of the country’s population live in rural areas and are completely dependent on the rains for their crops and livestock. Last year, these people were set back when the deyr season produced less rain than usual. And again this year the gu rains almost failed, eventually arriving in tiny pockets of the country too little, too late. This has led to widespread crop failure, and a decline in livestock production, rapidly pushing communities in the worst-affected areas into food insecurity. In recent years, the frequency and duration of these dry spells has increased. As it does so, the capacity of people to resist these shocks decreases. Every drought depletes their assets: their animals will die, their crops will fail, they will have nothing to sell and next season they won’t have money to buy seeds to plant again. In desperation, pastoralists sell their animals at a giveaway price, leaving them even more vulnerable. Doing so significantly reduces their number of cattle to below the minimum threshold required to continue raising livestock. At this point they begin to flee and become displaced, often in informal camps near urban settlements. I recently saw how extreme weather can throw the delicate lives of the most vulnerable off-kilter. Our staff met Geelo Ahmed Osman, a mother of five from Ainabo district, Somaliland, in an informal camp for internally displaced people (IDPs), where she now lives. She has been entrusted with a great deal of responsibility. Four of her five children are disabled with conditions so severe they cannot move without assistance – and her fifth is completely emaciated with malnourishment. Because her husband had a stroke last year, she is now the breadwinner for the entire household. Two years ago, another drought hit Osman and her family hard. Her household, who were pastoralists, lost all their animals. In the two years since, they have been entirely reliant on handouts from their relatives, and when their relatives could no longer offer to support them, they moved to the outskirts of Ainabo district and joined an informal IDP settlement in the hope that they will get assistance from aid organisations. The current drought has led to more and more people like Geelo Ahmed Osman, displaced from their homes and reliant on support from the international community. About half of the country’s population is in need of emergency assistance. If they don’t receive this, we are very likely to see a full-scale famine before the end of the year. Lack of water does not just have nutritional implications: it spreads disease. If people don’t have water to wash at critical times, they can’t stem the spread of disease, which becomes inevitable in crowded IDP camps. Things such as diarrhoea, if untreated, can be fatal to children. Aid agencies need more funding, and not just for immediate assistance. With the climate crisis increasing these kinds of events in frequency and intensity, we could be in this exact same situation next year, the year after, and on and on. So while the first phase of intervention should be emergency response, we then need to build resilience so people are better prepared for the future and not reliant on handouts from the international community. The sad thing is that around the world emergencies are on the increase: from the ongoing wars in Syria and Yemen to devastating natural disasters such as Cyclone Idai in south-east Africa. The climate crisis will only bring more disaster. But at the moment, the attention, funding and support from the international community is not there. It is crucial that, in our turbulent and increasingly unstable world, Somalia is not left behind. • Mustapha Tahir is acting country director for Islamic Relief in Somalia"

According to Science Daily, NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory has rediscovered the aerosol factor in climate (yet again). Those familiar with climate science know that aerosols are the preferred wild card used by embarrassed climate scientists whenever their models fail to properly account for unexpected cooling periods…which incidentally is more than 97% of the time.
The cooling clouds
Today Science Daily here reports that NASA’s jet Propulsion Laboratory in California has a paper out that examines the major role aerosols play on climate, especially cooling-effect cloud formation: Well, maybe we got it all wrong after all…and forget what the IPCC has said up to now.
The not-so-surprising statement:
…they found that the total impact from the influence of aerosols on this type of cloud is almost double that estimated in the latest report of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.”
Doubling! I thought this was all settled. How could they have been off by 100%?
What other factors were they 99% sure about, but now will soon revise 100% in one direction or the other? I think it’s safe to say that as observations continue diverging glaringly from the models, many climate factors will have to undergo similar profound adjustments, and some even introduced for the first time.

Rather than narrowing it down in the models, scientists clearly appear to really have meandered way off into the woods and swamps with their models. The big repair work still lies ahead.
Clouds have the biggest impact on the albedo, cool our planet
According to Science Daily, a “new, comprehensive global analysis of satellite data” led by Yi-Chun Chen of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a joint team of researchers from JPL and the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena “have quantified how changes in aerosol levels affect low-level clouds over the ocean, ‘which cover about one-third of the ocean’s surface, have the biggest impact on the albedo, or reflectivity, of Earth’s surface, reflecting solar energy back to space and cooling our planet’.”
To me this is a back door that opens the way to admitting that water vapor has a negative feedback after all. Never mind the aerosols, which are always in ample supply. More water vapor from higher global temps means more cloud formation, which cool the earth. Now if they’ve underestimated this so much that they now have to double it, then the models can be scrapped – and policymakers should be fuming. Taxpayers too!
According to John Seinfeld, professor of chemical engineering at Caltech:
These results offer unique guidance on how warm cloud processes should be incorporated in climate models with changing aerosol levels.”
That would be just a start. How about incorporating other major well-known factors into the models: like cosmic radiation regulated by the sun’s magnetic field, ocean cycles, and expanding global sea ice?

"In the turquoise waters off the Kimberley, where sheer cliffs peer down on isolated beaches, researchers are studying an underwater world – in the hope of saving it. Formed millions of years ago, the waters off Western Australia’s rugged 12,000km northern-most coastline have remained a scientific mystery. But for the past five years, researchers guided by Indigenous Australians have tackled rutted dirt tracks to study an oceanic highway lying off the Kimberley’s shores. It was the biggest study of its kind, involving more than 200 scientists who uncovered new humpback whale calving sites, exploding crocodile numbers, dozens of new turtle hatcheries and a possible lifeline for coral reefs. The WA Marine Science Institute (Wamsi) program coordinator, Dr Kelly Waples, says the $30m project yielded important discoveries that will help safeguard the Kimberley’s marine system from climate change, tourism and increasing development. “This was a once in a lifetime opportunity to run a really large study that really helps us understand the marine environment and how it operates in a world experiencing change from human pressure and climate change,” Waples says. “Without this type of scientific evidence, you know what is there but you don’t know what is happening to it, and we need that information to know when to step in and try to mitigate or do things differently.” The region – touted as one of the last remaining pristine wildernesses in the world – is almost entirely covered by native title rulings or applications. Compulsory legal research agreements paved the way for hundreds of Indigenous Australians from eight tribes to take part in the project, providing invaluable hunter-gatherer knowledge about a saltwater country they have maintained for centuries. Kimberley Indigenous Saltwater Science co-leader Daniel Oades says traditional input played a vital role in helping scientists locate species and read tidal movements, with some Indigenous rangers able to tell the sex of a turtle simply by the way it swims. “It was a bit of an afterthought but it was quickly realised that traditional owners had such a depth of knowledge and that they were managing country already,” Oades says. Now science is catching up and filling in the gaps. A key part of the study focused on efforts to save Kimberley’s struggling reefs which, despite being some of the toughest in the world, are living “precariously close” to their limits. “It’s clear that global ocean warming is catching up with Kimberley coral reefs,” Waples says. The possibility that the ocean off the Kimberley will warm by more than 1C in the next 50 years was a major focus of the study. The region’s shallow corals naturally thrive despite massive 12m tidal movements that expose them to 40C temperatures for hours at a time. But between November 2015 and April 2016, 80% of the Kimberley’s super-strong inshore coral was bleached after El Niño weather conditions sent the sea surface temperatures soaring by between 4.5C and 9.3C. University of WA marine biologist and project scientist Dr Verena Schoepf says her team found that 70% of sub-tidal coral had perished from the devastating 2016 marine heatwave that also cooked reefs around the nation. A bleached reef can re-establish if the tiny algae that gives coral its colour return when the water cools. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Schoepf says while she doesn’t know if the sub-tidal coral will ever re-grow, they found its hardy inshore neighbour had made a near-full recovery. She has teamed up with Californian reef experts at Stanford University to discover the biological tricks Kimberley’s intertidal corals use to survive in extreme heat. “Some of our work points to these intertidal corals most likely having genetically adapted to these more extreme temperatures but we haven’t been about to do the genetic analysis to prove that,” she says. Genetically adapted corals have the ability to pass their hardy traits on to offspring, installing hope that “super corals” could be relocated and used to help save reef systems. The idea is already being trialled on the Great Barrier Reef, where corals bred to be resilient to higher temperatures and acidity are growing in test sites. Coral reefs support not just fish but also attract tourists, with an estimated 400,000 people visiting WA’s “final frontier” each year, contributing to the state’s $11.8bn tourism industry. But, Schoepf warns that the Kimberley’s heat-resistant corals are no match for climate change. Beyond the reef, in the clear waters of the Dampier peninsula, researchers say humpback whale populations are booming, 40 years after a hunting ban brought the ocean giants back from the brink. Now, from June to July each year, the whales treat the WA coast like a humpback highway. The whales travel north from feeding in the Antarctic to birth and rest in the tropical waters of the Kimberley, before turning back down the coast in September. While scientists know that the Camden Sound body of water is critical for calving and nursing whales, the new research found other parts of the coast, further south, are equally important. Waples says a growing 30,000 population is pushing the whales down the coast and they were found resting and breeding along the peninsula too – a popular tourist spot. “They found that the area of Pender Bay [on the peninsula] is an important area throughout the whole migration season,” Waples says. “The whales will migrate north through Pender Bay and mothers and calves were found spending time there. “Camden Sound seems to be more like an end-point [and] while it’s important at parts of the season, it’s not as important throughout the whole season.” She says understanding this will help better protect the whales from the impacts of tourism and ships. Further north and despite a cane toad invasion, crocodile numbers are exploding, pushing the prehistoric beasts closer to humans. At the home of the Worora people, where six creeks flow into the Prince Regent river hundreds of kilometres north of Broome, parks and wildlife researcher Dr Andrew Halford says non-hatchling crocodile numbers have risen by 259% in 30 years. “Numbers [of saltwater crocodiles] are up in the range of a 100 to 300% increase since 1997 – when their numbers were estimated to be as low as 2,500,” Halford says on the Wamsi website. “It’s been 30 years, so it’s a very clear example of what happens when you take human predators out of the equation.” Halford says the bulging population is pushing younger male crocodiles south. In January, a 3.7 metre crocodile was killed at a popular Broome beach after a close-call with swimmers. “What we do know is that there will be increased interactions between crocodiles and humans, and in order to provide advice on managing this, we need to learn more about the amount of available nesting habitat throughout the region,” Halford says. While crocodiles and whales are thriving, fish diversity and dolphin populations were found to be surprisingly low. Despite being endemic to Australia, snubfin and humpback dolphins are some of the more poorly understood dolphin species. As part of this project, research teams from Murdoch and Curtin Universities used new acoustic technology to track the animals by their whistles and clicks. They found that both species, who are slow to reproduce, survive in small numbers of between 50 and 200 animals – leaving them vulnerable to human pressure. Murdoch University marine biologist Joshua Smith says the dolphins live in small, fragmented populations that stick to their own patch for breeding.  “These guys are particularly vulnerable, even at the species level, given the small sample sizes and small genetic connectivity that occurs because their distribution is heavily overlapping with coastal areas, which means they are predominantly interacting with human activity on a day-to-day basis.” Officials say they are unable to properly assess their conservation status because of a lack of information about the animal’s population size and movements. Smith says Roebuck Bay was found to be a stronghold for one of Australia’s biggest populations of snubfin dolphins, with 200 plus of the animals spotted there. Waples says that fish diversity overall was found to be surprisingly low and well below expectations considering the region’s proximity to the equator – a global centre of fish diversity. Scientists will now be able to investigate further what’s happening to the region’s fish. Despite an ever-growing mining industry and mammal extinctions from years of land-clearing, WA’s northern frontier has become a safe haven for endangered and protected species such as turtles. Six of the world’s seven turtles species call the region home and project scientists have called for a tagging program to monitor a turtle nesting hotspot at the Lacepede Islands, near Broome, among dozens of report recommendations. Turtles are especially vulnerable to climate change. Embryos can’t survive when temperatures exceed 35C and incubation temperatures above 29C produce female hatchlings. Problems with turtle colonies becoming feminised is well known in other parts of the world including Australia, with one study on the Great Barrier Reef finding 99% of hatchlings were female. For the first time, researchers have uncovered what they say are all the turtle nesting beaches throughout the Kimberley. They also recorded beach temperatures so conservationists can intervene if the going gets hot. “Being able to identify all the rookery beaches was pretty exciting and important,” Walpole says. “Understanding temperatures at the nesting beaches gives us baseline information so we can think about what type of impact climate change might have and mitigate for impacts in the future.” Waples says the report highlights that the region is likely to be impacted by climate change, regional development and increased human access and use. “While Aboriginal people have lived in the Kimberley for millennia and retain strong cultural connections to their saltwater country, this coastal and marine environment increasingly supports other activities such as tourism, commercial and recreational fishing, pearling, aquaculture and major port facilities associated with resource industries. “By understanding how the environment has changed and the ecosystem has adapted over the past 100 years to what it is today, we can better predict the likely response to current and future pressures and how we might mitigate any impacts.”"

In the July 2014 edition of top agrar, a commentary by Fritz Vahrenholt on Germany’s renewable energy feed-in act (EEG) appeared:
From Die kalte Sonne
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Prof. Vahrenholt: The EEG feed-in subsidy is an obsolete model!
By Fritz Vahrenholt
Berlin has slammed the brakes on biogas. That is overdue. Biogas has distorted the farmland leasing prices, led to ecological damage and put a burden on private households and companies through high electricity prices. The EEG surcharge is at 24 billion euros. That’s 250 euros for every household. That’s why citizens are now looking at green energies far more critically.
And support will decrease when the costs rise further, when industry moves to regions where energy prices are more affordable, and when grid stability is no longer controllable due to the unstable supply from wind and sun.
No wonder economics minister Sigmar Gabriel sees the transition to renewable energy as on being on the brink of failure. Why are we installing in a country that gets as much sunshine as Alaska a photovoltaic capacity of 52,000 MW? Many systems are working only 800 full hours per year. But one year has 8760 hours! In the meantime we are producing at times so much green power that we have to pay money Austria, Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic to get rid of it for us. Our neighbors aren’t even happy about it because the surplus unwanted German green energy is making their own power production unprofitable.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) writes of the German reaction to the “announcement” made by a prominent Chinese figure, He Jiankun, who yesterday stated that CO2 in his country would be capped. The announcement sent waves of euphoria throughout the global media and top climate officials. It appeared to be the long-awaited breakthrough. But the euphoria was short-lived. Jiankuntook it all back, claiming: “That was my personal opinion.” […] “What I said does not represent the position of the Chinese government or organization.”

At first the announcement was viewed as a major policy shift, all coming on the heels of President Obama’s announcement to take action against CO2 emissions. But the euphoria turned to disappointment just hours later.
There is more on the farce in New York Times: Behind the Mask – A Reality Check on China’s Plans for a Carbon Cap.
The media and activists greeted the “announcement” as covetously as a craving junkie welcomes his next long-overdue fix, EIKE describes. This is shown by the reactions from German top officials and activists.
Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research was ecstatic and spoke of a boost for climate policy worldwide:
It is remarkable that both China and the USA appear to be ready to take over once again the leadership role. Also for Europe it could now be the time to wake up from its climate fatigue.”
The PIK press release with Schellnhuber’s comments has since been taken down from the PIK website.

Spiegel Online wrote:

‘Should China indeed introduce an absolute upper limit for its emissions of greenhouse gases, it would be a boost for climate policy worldwide,’ commented Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. ‘Science shows that the planet is approaching more and more tipping points in the climate system.’ The big question is: How strict will China’s emissions level be?”

German activist group Germanwatch wrote:

Today’s announcement of China introducing an absolute emissions upper limit is viewed by Germanwatch as a possible turning point in international climate negotiations. ‘The USA and China are providing dynamism in international climate policy.  The EU must follow this example by adding on really ambitious climate and energy targets for 2030,’ demands Christoph Bals, policy director of Germanwatch. ‘Europe risks going from once being the most important forerunner, to being the biggest climate brake.’

Even though the Chinese announcement has since turned out to be a farce, Germanwatch has no qualms about leaving its false comments up and continuing to fool the press.
End-of-world theorist and activist website Klimaretter also gleefully welcome the “announcement”. It writes:

With the plans from the USA and China, observers anticipate there will be movement in the climate negotiations.

But of course then came the bitter disappointment. For the activists it was a very late April Fools’ prank.

"Barely a week after Madrid’s rightwing council began rolling back the city’s low emissions zone, a judge has ruled that the traffic restrictions must be maintained. As of Monday, drivers of non-exempt vehicles will once again be fined €90 if they enter the 1.8 sq mile zone in the centre of the Spanish capital.  The zone, known as Madrid Central, was introduced in November by the city’s then mayor, Manuela Carmena, a leftist. In April nitrogen dioxide levels in the city centre were down by 48% year on year, according to the environmental group Ecologists in Action. Madrid’s new city council, which is led by the conservative People’s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party and backed by the far-right Vox, announced moves to begin rolling back the Madrid Central zone days after taking office in June. Greenpeace, Ecologists in Action and other environmental groups appealed against the decision to abandon the scheme, and a judge in an administrative court ruled in their favour on Monday, saying pollution in Madrid could not be allowed to rise uncontrollably. “The judge’s ruling not only accepts our plea but also suspends the agreement the council reached on June 27 to abandon the scheme,” said Paco Segura, a coordinator of Ecologists in Action. “Madrid Central is now operating just as it was before.” The city council tweeted: “The moratorium on sanctions in Madrid Central decreed by the city council has been temporarily suspended on the order of the court of administration.” The council, led by José Luis Martínez-Almeida, said it would appeal against the decision, claiming the moratorium was perfectly legal. The council has three days in which to present its case. The perimeter of Madrid Central is monitored by 115 cameras. The cameras read the licence plate numbers of cars entering and leaving the zone, as well as those that park in the area. This data is then cross-referenced with data on who is a resident and who has or hasn’t got permission to enter the restricted zone."

Share this...FacebookTwitterCanadian philosophical researcher Shawn Alli has posted a highly critical series titled: The CO2 Climate Change Cult Series.

Philosophy researcher, book author, Shawn Alli thinks global warming science has “cult-like status”. Photo source here.
Though he does not appear to be some famous academic professor, his series does poignantly bring up a number of inconvenient points that have leading climate scientists confounded.
Ideologies underpinning IPCC science
Alli sent me an e-mail asking if I’d look over Chapter 7 and 8, which I did. Today’s post focusses on Chapter 7, which starts off powerfully:
Many objective and impartial scientists believe that they have no ideologies and never work to prove what they want to prove. This is a nonsensical belief. Under the ideologies of racism and eugenics, Western-European scientists in the past intentionally prove what they want to prove. The same concept is true in the present. The ideologies of man-made CO2 climate change are underpinning the science behind the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). One example of this ideological science is the IPCC’s claim of the Himalayan glaciers disappearing in 2035. [1] It’s only because of climate skeptics and deniers that the IPCC retracts their nonsensical claim three years later. [2] But despite the admission of error the Chair of the IPCC Dr. Rajendra Pachauri refuses to apologize. [3] The fact that the public outrage surprises him and damages the IPCC’s credibility, [4] demonstrates that the IPCC is 100% out of touch with the global general public about climate change.
The reason why the error is such a large problem is because of two reasons: science and socio-economic-political implications. The CO2 cult holds the IPCC to the level of god-like status, forever defending their cause. This pushes CO2 cult believers to claim that the IPCC reports are the highest form of climate knowledge on the planet.”
If you don’t believe that leading climate journalists have been taken over by the cult, Alli presents a number of quotes from the Guardian’s George Monbiot, and from the Newsweek staff, who maintain that the science is rigorous like no other, and thus beyond dispute.
Hockey stick: Distortion of reality…”junk environmental ideological science at its best”
Alli also thinks Michael Mann’s hockey stick chart, in its attempt to remove the Medieval Warm Period, was “intentionally manipulating the global general public and distorting reality.” He adds:
But even if you dismiss the hockey stick graph argument and the fraudulent data from climate scientists, you have to face the reality that global warming ends in 1998. After years of voracious denials […] the IPCC finally admits the stall of global temperatures in kind terms in Working Group 1 of their fifth assessment.”
“junk…ideological science at its best”

//-->




On the claim by the IPCC that man caused the warming from 1800 to 1998 and that the recent pause is due to natural variability, Alli calls this selective logic: “junk environmental ideological science at its best.”
Alli then writes how he posed three questions to leading (alarmist) climate scientists, such as Kevin Trenberth, Richard Somerville, Tom Wigley, on whether they are surprised by the recent pause. In general they answer that they are not, and that the models continue to be right for the most part. Alli responds, focusing on Wigley’s response:
Professor Wigley points out that there’s nothing surprising about the temperature lag. I would correct him and claim that there’s nothing surprising about the temperature lag now, due to the passage of time; but in 1998 it would be very surprising.”
Indeed one only needs to look at the course of the 100+ models to see that the pause had never been expected.
Models “all guesswork”…”no way” they can be accurate
Alli also comments on the tweeking of models so that they better match the reality, i.e. “scientists are starting with a result and creating a model that proves it.” Alli gives this practice the deserved grade of “F”.
This is ideological science at its best. And this is what a lot of Western-European science is about, explaining past events through particular ideologies. “
Even more shocking is that Alli feels that the scientists “don’t understand chaos theory at all“, and sums up the models: “…there is absolutely no way that any current climate model can be accurate. It’s all guesswork based on past trends“.
Cult science
So why are scientists and activists so convinced by the science when it is so faulty? Alli thinks it gets down to the human need for a religion and purpose: “The issue of man-made CO2 climate change gives individuals an opportunity to justify their existence fighting a ‘righteous cause’ in the face of corrupt and greedy private interest energy groups.”
In the end, reacting to the fact that only 3 of 31 leading scientists and activists were willing to dismiss the claim that climate change leads to more violence, Alli sees this as evidence of a “cult-like status” in climate science.
Shawn Alli was educated at York University of Toronto and is the author of two books: Oil, the 4th Renewable Resource and Whistleblowers: True Patriots of Humanity.

"Let’s talk about the dream, not just the nightmare. Imagine the cities and towns of the future: clean, green, with decent air quality, hospitable to walking and cycling, powered by renewables, with green space, not concrete jungles, and rewarding jobs in green industries. That isn’t just a conceit for the imagination but a tangible vision of the future produced today by Common Wealth, the thinktank of which I am a board member. Tackling the climate and ecological crisis requires urgently reimagining how we live and work. A Green New Deal – conceived of in the UK, popularised by US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and now powered by social movements here – should not just decarbonise today’s economy but build the sustainable and just economy of tomorrow. That’s why imagining a town transformed by a just transition to a low-carbon future isn’t just a nice piece of design, it is an essential symbol of where the climate movement now needs to take its case. That movement has an unprecedented chance to be heard as a result of the spectacular success of Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes in refocusing public attention on the urgency of action. But now, with people listening once again, our duty is to offer a compelling and attractive vision of the future.  The way we do this is by connecting the two great long-term crises that confront us today: the climate emergency and inequality. This is how we construct a broad and durable coalition that can sustain this unprecedented transformation. As well as truth-telling about the disaster that will confront us if we do not act, with the costs falling on those least responsible, ours must be a story of how we build a more equal, prosperous, democratic society. The lesson of history is that successful political movements that have confronted grave injustice have driven people forward through a sense of how we can surmount crisis and offer better lives on the other side. As Nicky Hawkins argued in the Guardian last week, Martin Luther King is remembered for proclaiming at the March on Washington “I have a dream” not “I have a nightmare”. We need to collectively outline that dream and decide what our society will look like. For far too long, progressives – myself included – have talked about the climate emergency and economic justice separately. Tackling economic injustice has too often been discussed as if the climate crisis were not racing towards us like a runaway train, rooted in wider economic and political inequalities, notably the vested interests of the fossil fuel companies. On the other hand, the climate disaster has often been seen as a technocratic problem to be solved, ignoring the immediate and urgent needs that people face in their daily lives. If we carry on with this approach, we will not succeed. Disaster avoidance in the coming decades is a moral obligation of the highest order. But if we simply offer sacrifice without hope, we are destined for carbon reduction to be seen as a luxury for those who can afford it and to send the message that economic injustice has to wait its turn. The truth is the opposite: those who can afford it will be able to avoid its worst impacts while the poorest and most vulnerable will pay the price. Despite the poorest half of the world’s population being responsible for just 10% of CO2 emissions, developing countries will bear an estimated 75% of the costs of climate crisis on current trends. Tackling the climate crisis offers a profound opportunity to create better lives for people. We need to change the way we heat 27m homes and power our industries, take 40m petrol and diesel cars off the road and plant tens of thousands of hectares of trees every year. In other words, we need the biggest peacetime mobilisation of labour, land and investment we have ever seen. From an economy that doesn’t work for the many, a green industrial revolution can provide meaningful, decently paid work, and we can pay for it in a way that is fair and confronts the big vested interests that would stand in the way. This represents just the start of what we can achieve. Think of the quality of life improvements we can make if we take on air pollution, the silent killer of thousands of people every year. And once we begin to confront the way our economy is configured, how we measure and produce value, the hours we work, the way we consume, a truly different world is possible. Net-zero emissions by 2050 should be the start of our ambition, not the summit. The Committee on Climate Change says the scale of private and public resources required for the long transition to 2050 is just 1-2% of GDP. Moving farther and faster will require greater focus, mobilisation and resources, but there are clear economic and environmental gains from doing so. If this is the vision, the “how we get there” question becomes essential. That is the purpose of the cross-party Institute for Public Policy Research’s Environmental Justice Commission that I co-chair with Caroline Lucas and Laura Sandys. We are determined to provide a route map to the new economy, including a just transition for those who will be affected by the end of the fossil fuel economy. David Bowie said that “tomorrow belongs to those who can hear it coming”. The risk is that the climate emergency overwhelms us and our children and grandchildren, and we will be remembered ignominiously. The opportunity is here to seize the chance to remake the country for the better. That is not only our moral obligation, it is the best hope of success. • Ed Miliband is Labour MP for Doncaster North and a former leader of the Labour party"
"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez enters a boardroom at her constituency office in Queens, New York, after a short delay which, a political aide hopes, hasn’t been caused by a constituent waylaying her in the corridor. (“They can get really excited to meet her.”) Greta Thunberg is in her home in Sweden, her father testing the technology for the video link while the teenager waits in the background. The activists have never met nor spoken but, as two of the most visible climate campaigners in the world, they are keenly aware of each other. Thunberg, now 16, catapulted to fame last year for skipping school every Friday to stand outside the Swedish parliament, protesting against political inaction over the climate crisis and sparking an international movement, the school strike for climate, in which millions of other children followed suit. Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic Representative for New York’s 14th congressional district is, at 29, the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, whose election over a well-funded incumbent in 2018 was a huge upset to politics-as-usual. She has been in office for less than a year, which seems extraordinary given the amount of coverage she has generated. In February, Ocasio-Cortez submitted the Green New Deal to the US House of Representatives, calling for, among other things, the achievement of “net-zero” greenhouse gases within a decade and “a full transition off fossil fuels”, as well as retrofitting all buildings in the US to meet new energy efficient standards.  The Green New Deal, while garnering support from Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, was mocked by speaker Nancy Pelosi (“the green dream or whatever they call it”), and defeated in the Senate by Republicans. Like Thunberg, however, Ocasio-Cortez gives every appearance of being galvanised by opposition, and has the kind of energy that has won her 4.41 million Twitter followers and makes establishment politicians in her path very nervous. In the course of their conversation, Ocasio-Cortez and Thunberg discuss what it is like to be dismissed for their age, how depressed we should be about the future, and what tactics, as an activist, really work. Ocasio-Cortez speaks with her customary snap and brilliance that, held up against the general waffle of political discourse, seems startlingly direct. Thunberg, meanwhile, is phenomenally articulate, well-informed and self-assured, holding her own in conversation with an elected official nearly twice her age and speaking in deliberate, thoughtful English. They are, in some ways, as different as two campaigners can get – the politician working the system with Washington polish, and the teenager in her socks and leggings, working from her bedroom to reach the rest of the world. There is something very moving about the conversation between these young women, a sense of generational rise that, as we know from every precedent from the Renaissance onwards, has the power to ignite movements and change history. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez It’s such an honour to meet you! Greta Thunberg You, too! AOC Thank you. I’m so excited to be having this conversation. I remember first hearing your speech a few months ago – I was hanging out with a friend in Harlem, who said, “Have you listened to this young woman?” And I heard your speech and was thrilled, because here in the United States, even when I was running, people were saying there’s no need to convey this kind of urgency [about the climate], and it’s radical, and it’s unnecessary. To hear you articulate the belief that I’ve had as well is so exciting and validating. So I wanted to thank you for your work and your advocacy. GT Thank you so much for standing up and offering hope to so many people, even here in Sweden. AOC One of the things I’m interested in hearing from you is that often people say, “Don’t politicise young people.” It’s almost a taboo. That to have someone as young as you coming out in favour of political positions is manipulative or wrong. I find it very condescending, as though, especially in this day and age with the access to information we have, you can’t form your own opinions and advocate for yourself. I’m interested in how you approach that – if anyone brings that up with you? GT That happens all the time. That’s basically all I hear. The most common criticism I get is that I’m being manipulated and you shouldn’t use children in political ways, because that is abuse, and I can’t think for myself and so on. And I think that is so annoying! I’m also allowed to have a say – why shouldn’t I be able to form my own opinion and try to change people’s minds? But I’m sure you hear that a lot, too; that you’re too young and too inexperienced. When I see all the hate you receive for that, I honestly can’t believe how you manage to stay so strong. AOC I think the thing that people sometimes don’t realise is that here in the United States, because of the gap between the rich and the poor, people really identify Wall Street as a very potent political force. With our rules, politicians are allowed to accept campaign contributions on a level that is probably beyond what happens in other parts of the world. But what people don’t recognise is how strong the fossil fuel lobby is. The Koch brothers in the US have essentially purchased the entire Republican party, but people forget they made their money off oil and gas. That is where their fortune comes from. And I think that’s what we’re up against. So the severity of the pushback indicates the power that we are challenging. You can look at that with despair, or you can look at it with hope. That’s how strong we are: we’re so strong that we’re able to take this on credibly and actually build a movement against it. GT Yes, I mean, the oil lobby is huge in the US, and we also have that kind of lobby in Sweden. Not as much, but... AOC What is the most effective tactic in gaining attention for the environmental movement? What have you done, or what have been the practices that have been most galvanising? GT I think this whole movement in which I just sat down in front of the parliament, alone – I think that had a huge impact, because people saw it and were moved, and became emotional. Millions of children around the world, striking and saying, “Why should we study for a future that may not exist any more?” This is not only me, but everyone in the movement. AOC Another question I have for you is that a lot of people talk about Sweden and other Nordic countries as an inspiration. People say that [advanced thinking around the climate crisis] could never happen in the US, because we’re a multiracial democracy – the fact that Sweden and other places are more homogenous means they’re able to get along better. That because of the racial diversity here, and issues with immigration and so on, there’s no way we can come together in order to combat this. I’m interested in what you say in response to that. GT Many people, especially in the US, see countries like Sweden or Norway or Finland as role models – we have such a clean energy sector, and so on. That may be true, but we are not role models. Sweden is one of the top 10 countries in the world when it comes to the highest ecological footprints, according to the WWF – if you count the consumer index, then we are among the worst per capita. In Sweden, the most common argument that we shouldn’t act is that we are such a small country with only 10 million inhabitants – we should focus more on helping other countries. That is so incredibly frustrating, because why should we argue about who or what needs to change first? Why not take the leading role? AOC We hear the same exact argument here. And this is the United States of America! People say, “Well, we should wait for China to do something.” There’s this political culture of people trying to say America First – that the US is the best nation in the world, yet at the same time they’re saying, “Well, China’s not doing it, why should we?” And I think it’s the same argument: are we going to choose to lead, or are we going to sit on our hands? It seems as if they take pride in leading on fracking, on being the number one in oil, in consumption, in single-use plastics. But they don’t seem to want to take pride in leading on the environment and leading for our children. GT Yes. I mean, countries like Sweden or the US, since we are rich countries, need to go first. Because people in poor countries need to be able to raise their standard of living. We have a duty to lead when we already have, basically, everything. AOC Yes. People think of leadership as this glamorous, powerful thing. To be a leader is to come first, to set the agenda. But what people don’t realise is that leadership is also enormously difficult. Leadership is a responsibility. Leadership is not fun. Leadership is about doing things before anybody else does them. Leadership is about taking risks. Leadership is about taking decisions when you don’t know 100% what the outcome is going to be. It’s enormously easy to follow – it’s the easiest thing in the world. And there are detriments to following. You are too late. You do not control your destiny. You are not in control, period. You are often under the thumb of someone else. But it is enormously easy because you don’t have to determine the future. It seems as if, really, it’s a decision on whether we’re going to lead or not. I wonder what, to you, is encouraging, and what keeps you going? There’s a school of thought – I personally disagree with it – that says if you educate people too much [about the climate] they’re going to think it’s too late and they’re going to wallow in despair and not act at all. So I’m curious, given how daunting the issue is, why aren’t you so filled with despair that you’re staying on your couch every day, and just waiting for the apocalypse? [Laughs] GT Before I started school striking, I was like that. I was so depressed and I didn’t want to do anything, basically. But what I find encouraging is having all these people who are fighting on different sides in different ways, to create a better future and to make us avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. The school-striking children, when I see them – that is very hopeful. And also the fact that people are very unaware of the climate crisis. I mean, people aren’t continuing like this and not doing anything because they are evil, or because they don’t want to. We aren’t destroying the biosphere because we are selfish. We are doing it simply because we are unaware. I think that is very hopeful, because once we know, once we realise, then we change, then we act. AOC I had a similar tipping point, although it had more to do with income inequality. Many people know that several years ago I was working in a restaurant, and I had gone to college, and I had worked on so many things, but my family had fallen in to a lot of misfortune – my father had gotten sick and so on. And I was working in this restaurant and I would go, day in and day out, and I was so depressed. I felt so powerless, and as though there was nothing I could do that could effectively counter the enormous number of societal structures that are designed in the US to keep the working class poor, and to keep the rich, richer.  I was really wallowing in despair for a while: what do I do? Is this my life? Just showing up, working, knowing that things are so difficult, then going home and doing it again. And I think what was profoundly liberating was engaging in my first action – when I went to Standing Rock, in the Dakotas, to fight against a fracking pipeline. It seemed impossible at the time. It was just normal people, showing up, just standing on the land to prevent this pipeline from going through. And it made me feel extremely powerful, even though we had nothing, materially – just the act of standing up to some of the most powerful corporations in the world. From there I learned that hope is not something that you have. Hope is something that you create, with your actions. Hope is something you have to manifest into the world, and once one person has hope, it can be contagious. Other people start acting in a way that has more hope. GT Yeah. I know so many people who feel hopeless, and they ask me, “What should I do?” And I say: “Act. Do something.” Because that is the best medicine against sadness and depression. I remember the first day I was school-striking outside the Swedish parliament, I felt so alone, because everyone went straight past, no one even looked at me. But at the same time I was hopeful. AOC It’s true that people don’t know when those small actions can manifest into something. I’ve seen it even in office. There’s so much cynicism about, how powerful can this be? Just me showing up? I think sometimes we’re so obsessed with measurement. What does me standing outside of parliament with a sign do? It doesn’t lower any carbon emissions immediately. It doesn’t change any laws directly. But what it does is make powerful people feel something, and people underestimate the power of that. It is becoming harder and harder for elected officials to look people in the eye. Just this morning I was sent a picture of an older gentleman from the midwest, which has just seen some catastrophic flooding – we’re starting to see flooding in the US where there was never flooding before. In the midwest there’s a disaster package that’s not getting passed, and he was just there with a sign saying, “Do you care about me?” He stood outside the congressional building, knowing that members are going to have to pass him by, and it’s very much inspired, I would say, by the actions that you’ve taken. The biggest weapon people have is to try to make you think that you don’t matter. It is to say, “This doesn’t change anything.” Because if you can convince people that it doesn’t matter, then they won’t do it and people can go on as though it’s business as usual. We are no longer at the point of preventing [climate disaster] from happening entirely – we are now at the point of minimising the damage. And as these floods and storms are here, I think more and more people are going to be willing to stand up for themselves. GT I have a question. I have heard about how bad the situation is in the US with climate denialism, but I find it very hard to believe. It’s bad here in Sweden – but I have seen reports of how little the US media mentions the climate crisis and how it is treated. How bad is it really? AOC I would say that it has historically been very, very bad. But it’s actually getting much better. In the 1970s, ExxonMobil had internal science that not only definitively proved that climate change was real, but they themselves, the oil company, invested in modelling to see how bad it was going to be. Some of their models were so sophisticated that, back in the 70s, they were predicting our weather patterns as far out as 2012 – and many of them were accurate. They knew exactly what was happening. So what they did, starting the year I was born, around 1989, was to start funding a lot of media and lobbying campaigns. They knew they couldn’t fund campaigns outright saying climate change is not real. But they could fund campaigns sowing confusion. So they would run campaigns saying we need to see more science, to sow doubt around the consensus. For a very long time it worked, and it got very bad. We came very close to acting on the climate in 1989, but the lobbying was so powerful that they effectively prevented action – we had almost 40% of Republican voters not believing that climate change was settled fact. But I think because of our advocacy and our movement, those numbers have been dropping precipitously in just the last few years. And in the last year especially, with our push for a Green New Deal, connecting everything that is happening to climate change. People who cover increasingly worse hurricanes as though they are accidents, or just things that happen – now, every time a storm comes, we talk about climate change. The other piece of it is not just acknowledging that it’s real, but prioritising it as a top issue. We just received some very encouraging numbers yesterday – a year or two years ago, only 20% of Democratic voters, the more liberal voters in the country, saw climate change as a top issue. With our action, and the youth organising that’s going on now, it has surged. We’ve seen in very early voting states, something like 70% of Democratic voters think that a Green New Deal should be a top issue, and that they would support candidates who support it, and not supporting it is a red flag for many voters. I think we’re moving, but it takes this radical action to move it. We have historically had an issue with media coverage of the climate crisis – I think they don’t realise that not covering it is just as bad as denying it. We have issues because much of our media is profit-driven, and if it doesn’t drive ratings they will not cover it as much. But we simply don’t have a choice. We have to do this. GT I saw very recent numbers, I think it was yesterday, that suggested about 2% of Sweden’s population don’t believe in the climate crisis. Here it’s not as acceptable to not believe in it. Everyone accepts that it’s a fact. But still we aren’t talking about it, and it’s not a priority. We are just treating it like any other issue. AOC Why do you think young people have been more powerful and persuasive on this issue, in particular? GT Many reasons, but I think the main one is that it is our future that is at risk. Most of us know that this is going to affect us in our lifetimes – it’s not just something that might happen in the future. It’s already here and it’s going to get worse, and many of us understand that this is going to make our lives much worse. And also that as young people, we aren’t as used to the system. We don’t say, “It’s always been like this, we can’t change anything.” AOC I’ve always said to people that youth is a mindset. And young people, we tend to come in and almost take that mindset for granted because as you said, we haven’t seen the world before, this is our first path, and so we have a tendency to question all of the nonsensical things that have just gone on for reasons of outdated logic. I have three- and four-year-old nieces and nephews, and they’re always asking, “Why, why, why, why?” For a lot of people it can be somewhat irritating. But I think sometimes it’s irritating because they don’t have the answers. You can be much older and still part of a youth movement, if you refuse to do things just because that’s the way they’ve always been done. I believe that young people just have a natural distillation of the world that is so pure. I’ve always felt that social movements, and youth movements in particular, should continue to be the moral compass that guides our vision. GT Yes, it always reminds me a lot of the Emperor’s New Clothes. Everyone believes in this lie, that only a child dares to question. AOC Right. When I was first running [for office], people often mocked me as a child. I’m much older than you! But I was still very young for someone who was running for such a powerful seat. People would say, “But don’t you know this is how it’s always been done? He has so much money, and power. There’s no reason you should challenge someone in your own party – we should challenge people in other parties.” And so on and so forth. And they were all veiled ways of saying I was too inexperienced, too naive, too young, and too powerless. I think the mere refusal to accept that can change our world. That’s exactly what you’ve done. GT I think we’ve both done that. Thunberg says that she is planning to travel to the US in August, so she can attend the UN Climate Action summit on 23 September. GT I don’t fly for climate reasons so it’s not 100% yet, but we are figuring it out. It’s very hard, but I think it should be possible. AOC That’s incredible. I’m so excited to follow that. Let us know how we can help from over here. I think one of the things that we need to start communicating is that this a global struggle, and it’s not about what is Sweden doing, and what is the US doing – it’s about what are all of us doing, as one movement? I think the power of that is very real. I wish you well, and I know many members of Congress who would be thrilled to meet you. GT Thank you so much. AOC Thank you so much, Greta. Be sure to let us know when you have an arrival date. If you land in New York, we will give you a Queens’ welcome! • This conversation appears in the Guardian’s Weekend magazine and has been abridged for length.

"A fleet of 35m electric vehicles could help the UK reach its net-zero carbon target by forming large battery hubs to store renewable energy, according to the country’s energy system operator. National Grid predicts that by 2050 millions of electric cars will use wind and solar power to charge up within minutes to act as battery packs for when the grid needs more energy.  The grid operator’s long-range energy forecasts predict that smart charging systems will use algorithms to help cars balance demand and supply on the grid, while making the most of renewable energy and saving customers money. It found that the plug-in car fleet could hold a fifth of the electricity produced by the UK’s solar panels, which it predicts will quadruple over the same period. This scenario would make the UK’s ambitious target to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 achievable because it helps cut carbon from the energy and transport sectors, according to the report. Kayte O’Neill, National Grid’s head of strategy, added that electric vehicles will make the energy system more flexible and help bring down costs for consumers too. The forecast is one of five future scenarios envisaged by National Grid to help policymakers and the energy industry shape the future energy mix. In all scenarios the operator predicts electric vehicles will become the most popular form of transport between 2030 and the early 2040s. It also predicts that many more homes and communities will generate their own electricity through solar panels or micro windpower projects. There are fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles on UK roads, meaning the ambitious plug-in car forecast would require a major acceleration of plans for car charging and a step change in customer behaviour. The report said immediate action is required across the electricity, gas, heat and transport sectors “at a significantly greater scale than assumed in any of our core scenarios” if the UK hopes to meet its net-zero target. National Grid’s report also predicts that a net-zero target will require that homes use at least a third less energy for heating than at present and shift away from using natural gas in boilers and radiators. By 2050 at least 7m hybrid heat pumps, which partly rely on renewable energy, should be installed. The UK’s gas system should also be run on hydrogen, rather than typical methane-rich gas to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The warning comes in the same week that the government’s official climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, criticised ministers for delivering only one of the 25 emissions-cutting policies it had considered vital for 2018."
"The desert outside Tennant Creek, deep in the Northern Territory, is not the most obvious place to build and transmit Singapore’s future electricity supply. Though few in the southern states are yet to take notice, a group of Australian developers are betting that will change. If they are right, it could have far-reaching consequences for Australia’s energy industry and what the country sells to the world. Known as Sun Cable, it is promised to be the world’s largest solar farm. If developed as planned, a 10-gigawatt-capacity array of panels will be spread across 15,000 hectares and be backed by battery storage to ensure it can supply power around the clock. Overhead transmission lines will send electricity to Darwin and plug into the NT grid. But the bulk would be exported via a high-voltage direct-current submarine cable snaking through the Indonesian archipelago to Singapore. The developers say it will be able to provide one-fifth of the island city-state’s electricity needs, replacing its increasingly expensive gas-fired power. This will be the channel through which Australian energy production will greatly reduce [global] emissions After 18 months in development, the $20bn Sun Cable development had a quiet coming out party in the Top End three weeks ago at a series of events held to highlight the NT’s solar potential. The idea has been embraced by the NT government and attracted the attention of the software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, who is considering involvement through his Grok Ventures private investment firm. The NT plan follows a similarly ambitious proposal for the Pilbara, where another group of developers are working on an even bigger wind and solar hybrid plant to power local industry and develop a green hydrogen manufacturing hub. On Friday, project developer Andrew Dickson announced the scale of the proposed Asian Renewable Energy Hub had grown by more than a third, from 11GW to 15GW. “To our knowledge, it’s the largest wind-solar hybrid in the world,” he says. These developments are still at relatively early stages of planning. Both teams say it will be four years before they lock in finance, with production scheduled to start mid-to-late next decade. But renewable energy watchers are cautiously optimistic they could help spark a new way of thinking about Australia’s energy exports – one that better aligns with the country’s commitment to the Paris climate agreement, rather than broadening a fossil fuel trade at odds with it. Opponents to Australia taking significant action on the climate crisis often point out the country is responsible for about 1.4% of greenhouse gas emissions, placing it about 15th on a table of carbon-polluting nations. A recent report by science and policy institute Climate Analytics makes the case that this underplays Australia’s contribution, which increases by 5% if fossil fuel exports are included. The latter figure is expected to increase over the next decade. Australia is the world’s biggest exporter of coal and rivals Qatar as the leader in selling liquified natural gas (LNG). There is bipartisan support for a significant expansion of both industries, though government economists anticipate export earnings from coal will fall. Ross Garnaut, former advisor to Labor governments who is now professor of economics at the University of Melbourne and chairman of the Australian-German Energy Transition Hub, makes the case that there is another way ahead. In a recent lecture series that is being turned into a book, he lays out his analysis of how Australia, with the best renewable energy resource in the developed world, could expand its energy production while significantly reducing global emissions. Garnaut points to the transformative reduction in the capital cost of renewable energy and energy storage over the past two decades. As most of the cost of clean energy developments is capital (the fuel is free), he says the transformation has radically changed the ability of clean projects to compete with fossil fuels. Given capital costs are lower in developed countries, Garnaut says it means Australia can, if properly managed, be the centre of low-cost energy in a future zero-carbon world. It would make it the natural home for growth in minerals processing for a world that increasingly values production powered by solar, wind and other clean sources. Industries that would flourish under Garnaut’s vision include familiar energy-intensive operations such as aluminium, iron ore and steel, and new opportunities in silica, lithium, vanadium, nickel, cobalt and copper. “This will be the channel through which production of energy in Australia will greatly reduce emissions in the rest of the world. It will also be a foundation for a new era of economic expansion and prosperity,” he says. Garnaut believes exporting electricity through high-voltage cable and green hydrogen will be a part of this clean energy future, though they would mostly be expected to come later. Sun Cable’s chief executive, David Griffin, is bullish about the possibility of his company helping power Singapore from the outback in less than a decade. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He says the project will use prefabricated solar cells to capture “one of the best solar radiance reserves on the planet”. But he says the major transformation that makes the farm possible is the advent of high-voltage, direct-current submarine cable, which he describes as the “greatest unsung technology development”. Sun Cable’s underwater link to Singapore will run 3,800km. “It is extraordinary technology that is going to change the flow of energy between countries. It is going to have profound implications and the extent of those implications hasn’t been widely identified,” Griffin says. “If you have the transmission of electricity over very large distances between countries, then the flow of energy changes from liquid fuels – oil and LNG – to electrons. Ultimately, that’s a vastly more efficient way to transport energy. The incumbents just won’t be able to compete.” Sun Cable’s backers believe Singapore, as a well-regulated electricity market that runs mostly on gas piped from Malaysia and Indonesia and shipped as LNG, is ripe for competition. Across in the Pilbara, the Asian Renewable Energy Hub proposal has taken another tack. The developers – a consortium of InterContinental Energy, CWP Energy Asia, wind energy company Vestas and financiers at the Macquarie Group – began with a plan to send energy to Indonesia via sub-sea cable. That has been dropped in favour of green hydrogen – a shift driven, Andrew Dickson says, by falling costs and growing international and local interest that suggests a much bigger market. An expanded hub proposal released this week says it will be spread across a vast area – 6,500 sq km, or about half the size of greater Sydney – and create 3,000 construction and 400 operational jobs. About two-thirds of the 15GW capacity will be met with giant wind turbines and one-third solar panels. The developers say up to a fifth of the total capacity is expected to go to large industrial energy users in the Pilbara, potentially including new and expanded mines and mineral processing. But most of the electricity generated will be used to run a hydrogen manufacturing hub. The hydrogen would be sold domestically and exported, most likely to Japan and South Korea, which have expressed a desire to shift energy consumption in that direction. Dickson says producing green hydrogen at large volumes could open up possibilities such as using it to replace coking coal in steel production. It could allow an expanded version of the “green steel” model adopted in Whyalla by British industrialist Sanjeev Gupta. Dickson points to recent appraisals by the Australian chief scientist, Alan Finkel, and the International Energy Agency as evidence of hydrogen’s potential. “People are realising, after several decades of promise, that now could be the time for it to be a thing,” he says. Griffin and Dickson both decline to comment on the role the federal government could or should play in developing green exports, although they volunteer that some local MPs and state governments are supportive. Both note the fact their proposals are off-grid has helped insulate them from politically loaded debates that pit renewable energy against fossil fuels. Roger Dargaville, a senior lecturer in renewable energy at Monash University and member of the Energy Transition Hub, underlines the amount of work that is going into examining what a future of clean exports will look like. A recent project he was involved in suggested a 40-gigawatt sub-sea electricity cable into Indonesia – much larger than that initially proposed by the Asian Renewable Energy Hub – would be viable by 2035 if that country adopts a low emissions target. Dargaville believes future exports will almost certainly be a mix of hydrogen, cabled electricity and minerals refined before shipment. He says no one should underestimate the scale of what would be necessary to replace Australia’s existing fossil fuel industries (coal and LNG industries are worth more than $100bn a year and employ tens of thousands) and that the political and technological challenges will be significant. But he stresses no one should mistake where international markets are taking us. The only question is whether it is in the timeframe climate scientists says is necessary. “It’s not really yes or no, it’s just when.”"

Based on GISS data
========================================
Even though IPCC climate models and expected climate trends have proven themselves to be completely false and useless, see here and here, parts of the Austrian media and state sector have no qualms using them, and in doing so they are misleading the public.
A recent example is the climate-alarmist Vienna-based Der Standard online daily in a recent piece titled: Climate in Vienna: More heat days, new plants.
The whole premise of the story is based on the climate models being right, which in fact today we know they have been universally wrong.
Palm trees in Vienna in a few decades!
In the article written by Christa Minkin and Julia Schilly, it is claimed that palm trees are to be expected in “a few decades in the Viennese forest – thanks to climate change,” citing ecologist Franz Essl of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Environment.
Minkin and Schilly also warn that Vienna is going to be hot in the future, all exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, citing “a new Austrian expert report on climate change“.
In 1910 there were only two heat days – i.e. temperatures over 30°C. In 2000 already 17 were measured.”
Der Standard also looks very deeply into the climate crystal ball…all the way to the year 2070 to 2100. Minkin and Schilly write:

For the period of 2070 to 2100 researchers anticipate a rise to more than 35 heat days per year on average. At the same time nights in Vienna will cool down less.”
Moreover, foreign plants will begin their invasion and displace domestic ones, the experts warn.
Slight cooling over the last 16 years
So with all the warnings of more unbearable heat days in the future, one might assume that temperatures in Austria must be currently on the rise. I searched the Internet for the temperature data series for Vienna, but unfortunately I wasn’t successful finding it. So I contacted the European Institute for Climate and Energy to see if they might be able to help out. They answered promptly by e-mail (slightly paraphrased):
Unfortunately we do not have the more recent data because the Austrian Weather Service does not make them public, only up to 2003. That’s why it’s not possible to show the last 15 years graphically, and so climatologists in Austria can claim whatever they want.”
Fortunately, EIKE was able to provide the recent data for Graz city center. Here we see despite the urban location there’s been a slight cooling.

Mean annual temperature for Graz city center over the last 16 years.
The trend in Graz matches the overall trend of a slight cooling over central Europe over the last two decades.
So with the IPCC models having performed so horrendously, and in view of the fact there has been no warming trend in Austria for 16 years, it is truly a mystery how anyone could claim that summer heat days will just keep on rising linearly until the end of the century.
When the models are failures, then the future projections based on them are worthless.

"In 1931, a trawler fishing in the North Sea off Norfolk hauled up a lump of peat containing a prehistoric spear or harpoon made from an antler dating back 9,000 years, to the end of the last ice age. This was the first evidence that prehistoric people had lived in a land now submerged under the sea.  Now the Europe’s Lost Frontiers project, using seismic data from oil and gas exploration, has built up a 3D picture of this long-lost landscape, with rivers, lakes, hills and valleys, stretching from present-day eastern England to north-west Europe. In the last ice age this was permafrost tundra like northern Siberia today and Britain was a peninsula of north-west Europe. But as the climate warmed, the land thawed and was colonised by plants, trees and people.This was Doggerland, believed to be densely populated by stone age standards, with thousands of people, some of them living in settlements. These ancient people were probably flexible enough to move on as sea levels rose and flooded coasts and valleys. But Doggerland completely vanished under the sea about 7,500 years ago, and the fate of the people living there remains a mystery. Now the fate of Doggerland serves as a warning of rising sea levels in present times, driven on by man-made climate change."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooks as if Europe’s thing of the past, wintertime snow, has once again become a thing of summertime in Switzerland…at least down to 6000 feet in elevation. Cool weather swept across parts of Central Europe this week bringing snow in the Swiss Alps.
Although summertime snowfall high up in the Alps is not an unusual occurrence, snowfall down to 6000 feet elevation IN JULY is something that wasn’t supposed to happen nowadays – especially with increased concentrations of “heat-trapping” greenhouse gas CO2.
20 inches of snow
Last Tuesday, July 8, the Swiss online Blick here reported meteorologists were predicting snowfall down to 1800 meters elevation (6000 ft.), warning that up to 50 cm (20 inches) of snow in the Canton of Valais. Blick writes that the snowfall presented a problem for grazing cattle, which would either have to be brought down to lower elevations or housed in mountain shelters stocked with feed.
Passes closed, avalanche warnings
By evening, the online Südostschweiz.ch reported that the Furkapass had been closed.

By evening the passes over Susten and the Furka were closed, the TCS Traffic Information reported. The Matterhorn Gotthard railway (MGB) allowed additional car wagons to travel through the Furka Tunnel due to snowfall Tuesday evening at the Furka.
Snowfall fell to elevations of approximately 2000 meters, according to the Swiss Met. At elevations of 2000 meters there was a blanket of snow by evening. There was more snow in the high mountain elevations over 2500 meters.”
By Wednesday, July 9th, the online Blick here reported Swiss authorities had issued elevated avalanche warnings for elevations near 3000 meters. At Germany’s Zugspitze, the country’s highest peak, 15 cm of fresh snow fell. German meteorologists point out that snow at such elevations at this time of year are not unusual. Well, if the “usual” is happening, then the climate can’t be changing that much.
“Snowed in”
Today, public SRF Swiss Radio reports here that mountain excursions and tours are being cancelled due to the cold and snowy weather, thus delaying the start of the season.
In Switzerland there are an estimated 1500 mountains guides. Many of them have jobs on the side, and so when tours are cancelled they have other work. But the guides are also hit by the bad weather. A part of the 150 mountain shelters of the Swiss Alps Club SAC are even snowed in.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe polar-vortex-inducing “warming Arctic” seems to be doing strange things to the Arctic itself – defying the very laws of physics: The “warmth” there is causing the sea ice extent to explode. Compare 2012 versus 2014:

Arctic images for September 3. Source: www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/htm. 
Depending on which dataset you use, the Arctic sea ice extent this year is about 1.8 million sq km more than it was at the same time in 2012. That’s equivalent to over 20,000 Manhattans.
Applying in reverse the theory that a warm ice-less Arctic produces bitter cold northern hemispheric winters though Rossby wave perturbations, we should expect that the recently added Arctic sea ice will now lead to warmer winters.
Of course that would be in stark contradiction to what was observed in the late 1970s. Back then we saw extensive Arctic sea ice cover, yet bitter northern hemispheric winters were generally the rule. Predictions of an impending ice age were issued. Today the global warming alarmist scientists wish we would just forget all that.

The notion that a warm Arctic causes frigid winters in Florida is a half-baked Hail-Mary hypothesis at best. It’s designed to buy a little bit of time.

Switzerland sees bitter-cold, overcast August
A few days ago I wrote here how some Western European countries had seen a cold August, with mountain areas even getting the first licks of winter. Now Switzerland has just released its August data. The online 20min.ch site here writes that the Alpine country’s August was 1.5°C below the long-term mean. The 20min.ch writes:
‘In August a clear deviation with respect to the temperature value was observed,’ says meteorologist Sarina Scheidegger of Meteonews. ‘Only in Sitten did the deviation stay below 1°C. In the rest of Switzerland it was at least 1.5°C too cold.'”
August was also 50% less sunny than normal, the 20min.ch site reports.

"Shortly after its re-election, the Morrison federal government confirmed it would not consider a new policy to reduce carbon emissions from Australia’s electricity sector. Meanwhile, every state government within the national electricity market has either a target to increase the share of renewable energy or substantially reduce its emissions. This includes both Labor and Liberal party-governed states.  So how are the states going in reaching their targets? Victoria at least is doing pretty well. The chart below illustrates the amount of renewable energy being generated in Victoria by fuel type and Green Energy Markets’ projections of how it will change out to 2030. This is based on a combination of large utility-scale projects either in operation, construction or contracted plus growth in rooftop solar expected by the Australian Energy Market Operator. Victorian renewable energy by year and share of total generation Victoria will achieve dramatic growth in renewable generation in just the next two years so renewables will generate a third of supply. By 2025 Victoria will have almost achieved its interim target of 40% renewables, even without any new wind or solar farms beyond those already committed or contracted. However, to get to 50% by 2030 the Victorian government needs roughly another 2,000 megawatts of projects. That shouldn’t be hard to achieve. Last year it completed a tender to contract 650 megawatts of projects which actually ended up delivering 928 megawatts of projects. During that tender it received proposals for over 3500MW of projects. So just another two tender rounds could be enough to get Victoria to 50% renewables. South Australia has also achieved pretty staggering progress in the last few years, with renewables generating greater than half the state’s electricity consumption last year. By 2030 it will have reached 73.5%. But this still leaves the state short of the Liberal government’s target for 100% net renewables by 2030 – where any fossil fuel use is offset by extra renewable energy exports. We estimate another 1,300 megawatts would lift them to 100%. South Australian renewable energy by year and share of total consumption Tasmania has already achieved its government’s target of 100% renewables by 2022, which was basically business as usual. Queensland will double the share of its demand met by renewables in just two years from 10.7% to 21.4% by 2020. After that though, progress slows. The government’s new power company, CleanCo, will help continue to drive growth but it isn’t enough to reach the state’s target of 50% renewables by 2030. CleanCo has been tasked with procuring 1,000 megawatts of renewables but the state needs far more – 5,500 megawatts – to reach 50%. Given the state managed to commit 2,700 megawatts to construction in the last three years, there’s no physical challenge to constructing 5,500 megawatts over the next 10 years. Queensland renewable energy by year and share of total consumption New South Wales is also failing to back up its target with sufficient actions. The NSW government defines its target in terms of emissions rather than renewable energy market share, but it provides for a similar result. Their target is to have zero emissions across their economy by 2050. Unless they plan on rolling out nuclear, this is, for all intents and purposes, a target for 100% renewable electricity supply. To steadily get from where they were last year at 14.4% renewables to 100% by 2050, they need to increase the share of renewable energy meeting their electricity demand by close to 2.7 percentage points each year. So, if the NSW government was genuinely serious about its target, then by 2030, renewable energy should make up close to 46% of their electricity demand. But present project commitments plus rooftop solar only deliver 28% renewables, and the state needs to stimulate another 5,000 megawatts of projects to get back on track. NSW renewable energy by year and share of total consumption There is clearly a great deal of frustration among consumer groups, the electricity industry and investors about the lack of a clear legal framework for driving emissions down in line with our international obligations. State governments appear to understand and share this frustration. This was evident in a recent speech given by NSW’s energy minister, Matt Kean, and also revealed in an interview South Australia’s energy minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan gave to the Guardian. Yet constitutional power for the power sector rests with state governments, not the federal government. They have full legal authority to implement something like the national energy guarantee or indeed some better policy to lower emissions. Continuing to point the finger at the federal government will get us no closer to a policy that supports ongoing investment in the electricity sector, reduced emissions and lower electricity prices. The states are not that far apart in what they say they want to achieve. The power is within their own hands to deliver it.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I published a piece by Fred F. Mueller on Germany’s out-of-control renewable energy transition and how it is in fact transitioning over to a disaster.
What follows below is a graphic that proponents of the offshore wind energy industry don’t want anyone to see. It tells the whole story about how (in)efficient and (un)reliable German offshore wind energy really is (Hat-tip: www.achgut.com):

Chart shows the installed nameplate offshore wind capacity (shaded green) and the actual output (blue shaded area) since 2009. Wind’s poor performance and unreliable, wildly fluctuating supply disappoint and risk sinking Germany’s “Energiewende”. Chart source: R. Schuster.
The above chart was prepared by Rolf Schuster, an industrial engineering designer, who during his free time has started a wind power databank in order to check the rosy claims being made by the wind power lobby. The results are not something any fast-talking salesman would want any potential buyer to see. The power that was input (blue) is a mere fraction of the rated capacity (green).
Schuster writes:
If you divide the power fed in (blue) by the rated capacity (green) you get the percent of the rated capacity that actually gets fed into the grid. The linear trend shows a negative tendency – towards 20 percent of the rated capacity. That means: Despite the massively increased capacity in 2014, hardly more power has ended up getting delivered compared to the start of the year. Only one fifth of the rated capacity actually gets fed in.”
Many proponents used to argue that the wind is always blowing at the North Sea, and so a steady supply was a sure thing. Now we have real results coming in. That “steady” wind is only delivering 20% of the installed rated capacity. A fiasco.

Schuster also says that offshore turbines have serious technical problems as well. Foundations are being washed out from underneath; there’s corrosion, and overloads that lead to turbine shutdowns. The harsh conditions of the North Sea a proving much tougher to handle.
There are also major problems with the high-voltage direct current systems that have yet to be solved, Schuster writes. One entire North Sea wind park has been disconnected from the grid as a result. This, Schuster says, “makes one ask if the installation of a major power transmission line from North Germany to South Germany would be a high risk gamble for the German energy supply“.
Green power goes AWOL again!
Also a look at online energy portal Agora here also tracks renewable energy that gets fed into the German power grid. A look at today’s graphic for the last 31 days tells us that once again wind and solar have gone AWOL, and so conventional fuels such as gas, nuclear and coal have to jump in to bail out.

The above chart shows German energy supply and consumption for the last 31 days. Solar power that was fed into the grid is shown in yellow. Wind power is shown in blue. Cropped from Agora. 
Yesterday, February 4, we saw very little wind power getting fed into the grid, less than a gigawatt from a nameplate capacity of some 55 gigawatts of installed capacity – less than 2%! On February 4 wind and solar together virtually fed in almost nothing into the grid. If it had not been for coal, gas and nuclear, the country would have gone dark.

Ideology-driven policy

He also reminds that coal power plants are far more efficient and cleaner today then they used to be. Morano also warned that the underlying drive behind the Obama policy is to make energy far more expensive and that it is driven by ideology, and not science.
Democrats “running very scared”
On the political front, Morano adds that the only climate that is going to change is the political climate, with many Democrats “running very scared of this“, saying it “could be devastating for them politically because the American public is not going to like an unelected bureaucracy taking over energy goals…” On the EPA, Morano warns:
Once you give them this expanded bureaucratic power, there is no limit.”
The other two guests on the show were fans of the EPA, and seemed to be saying: C’mon, give big government the chance to have unlimited, unchecked regulatory power, and you’ll see that it can do something good. History certainly has heard it before. Do we really want to repeat that?

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Ed Hoskins sent me the following temperature graphic for Central England by e-mail. I’d say the chart says it all…linear trend of more than 6°C COOLING per century. It’s worse than we thought!

Bare ground in the winter will soon be a thing of the past!
Clearly temperatures have been sinking for the last 10 years. The “missing heat” is also nowhere to be found in England. The Central European trend is similar.
In fact, many places globally are showing a cooling trend over the last decade.
So when it comes to disproving warming, what more could they want!

"London will have a similar climate in three decades’ time to that of Barcelona today, according to research – but if that seems enticing, a warning: the change could be accompanied by severe drought. Madrid will feel like present-day Marrakech by 2050, and Stockholm like Budapest, according to a report on the likely impacts of the climate crisis. Around the world, cities that are currently in temperate or cold zones in the northern hemisphere will resemble cities more than 600 miles (1,000km) closer to the equator, with damaging effects on health and infrastructure. Among other analogues, the study suggests Moscow will resemble Sofia, Seattle will feel like San Francisco and New York will be comparable to Virginia Beach. The researchers have created an interactive map showing hundreds of cities and their 2050 counterparts. Water shortages will affect scores of cities now in temperate climates as a result of the global heating, which is forecast to be by as much as 3.5C in European cities in summer and 4.7C in winter.  Nearly eight in 10 cities will experience dramatic changes, according to the study of 520 major cities published in the journal Plos One. Barcelona was affected by extreme drought just over 10 years ago, endangering many inhabitants and resulting in tens of millions of euros being spent on importing drinking water. It is becoming more likely that London and cities in similar latitudes will experience the same problems in the future, say the researchers. Among the most concerning findings is that the residents of about a fifth of cities globally – including Jakarta, Singapore, Yangon and Kuala Lumpur – will experience conditions currently not seen in any major cities in the world. This unprecedented level of change “blew my mind”, said Tom Crowther, founder of the Crowther Lab in Switzerland, which carried out the research. “These are environmental conditions that are not experienced anywhere on the planet at the moment,” he told the Guardian. “That means there will be new political challenges, new infrastructure challenges, that we have not faced before.” Rainfall will be a particular problem for such cities, with extreme flooding becoming more common alongside more frequent and severe droughts. Crowther said: “We are absolutely not prepared for this. Planning for climate change needs to start yesterday. The sooner it starts, the less the impact will be.” Richard Betts, a professor of climate impacts at Exeter University and head of the climate impacts strategic area at the Met Office Hadley Centre, who was not involved in the research, said: “Without the benefit of knowing that the new climate conditions are already liveable somewhere in the world, it is harder to know whether people will be able to adapt and stay in these cities, or whether they will eventually look to move elsewhere.” Concern about the world’s lack of preparedness for the effects of global heating is mounting among experts. Mami Mizutori, the UN secretary general’s special representative on disaster risk reduction, last week told the Guardian that climate crisis disasters were happening at the rate of one a week, but that countries were not investing in making urban infrastructure more resistant. On Wednesday, the UK’s Committee on Climate Change published a report saying the government was completely unprepared for the likely repercussions of the climate crisis. Its chairman, Lord Deben, compared preparations to the efforts of the ramshackle troops of the classic British comedy Dad’s Army. The new research took as its baseline one of the central forecasts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, which some regard as optimistic considering the current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions. Any London homeowners relishing the prospect of a Catalan climate might need to think again. Mike Lockwood, a professor of space environment physics at Reading University, who was not part of the research team, said: “Bringing Barcelona’s climate to London sounds like it could be a good thing, if you don’t suffer from asthma or have a heart condition – except London clay shrinks and is brittle if it gets too dry, then swells and expands when very wet. The greater swings in ground moisture expected in a warmer world would cause massive subsidence problems.” One of the purposes of the paper is to illustrate the huge problems the world faces as result of the climate emergency. “History has repeatedly shown that data and facts alone do not inspire humans to change their beliefs or act,” said Jean-François Bastin, the lead author of the paper. “The intangible nature of reporting on climate change fails to adequately convey the urgency. It is hard to envisage how 2C of warming, or changes in average temperature by 2100, might impact on daily life.” Friederike Otto, the deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, who was not involved in the research, cautioned that it should be regarded “as an illustration only, not a prediction”, because of the number of variables involved. “It is a useful way to start thinking outside the box, but it does not show London’s future. It could well be that rainfall in winter changes in London in the opposite way to Barcelona.” Mike Childs, the head of science at Friends of the Earth, said policymakers must take note. “What’s great about this report is that it starkly shows what living in cities will be like if the inertia of governments on climate breakdown continues,” he said. “Young people are taking to the streets to stop their futures being wrecked through inaction on the climate crisis, but this analysis demonstrates that anyone under 50 should be equally concerned that urban living could be intolerable by 2050. Governments have no excuse for further inaction.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago I wrote about how Google was researching into changing how it ranks websites during searches, claiming that the aim was to give sites that are loose with the truth a lower ranking and to favor sites deemed to be reputable.
But the possibility of abuse in such a system is worrisome.
So I asked some leading climate figures by e-mail what they thought and have gotten some responses. Here’s what they wrote (some editing):
Prof. Nir Shaviv (astrophysicist)
It is just a research project. The Fox News article says ‘A Google spokesperson told FoxNews.com that the fact-based-rankings are, at this point, just a research project.’
I can’t imagine Google will do anything like that. It is so wrong on so many levels it would be shooting themselves in the leg.”
Lubos Motl (physicist):
I don’t believe that it’s technically possible to design an algorithm that could reasonably accurately assign the truth value to all pages on the Internet (it’s just very hard to evaluate all the billions of statements that are out there – quite often, one really knows the answer) – I would be impressed if they proved me wrong; and I don’t believe that Google will impose filters that would selectively and significantly skew results in a direction that is political.
I don’t believe that Google plans to suppress or eliminate skeptical blogs about the climate from the rankings, and I don’t even think that this follows from any media reports on Fox News or elsewhere, so I view these fears as nut job conspiracy theories.
It’s my belief that they’re doing a good job. Some said that the solution to these censorship fears (which seem unjustifiable to me themselves) is to create a competition to Google, or something like that. Even if some folks in Google have politically extreme, left-wing opinions etc., they’re still primarily a technological company that has done amazing things that even some of the best people in big competing companies such as Microsoft couldn’t have matched (and I am a fan of Microsoft). Of course if Google searches turned out to be unusable due to political censorship or something like that, people like me would try to switch to a competition.
Google is an extremely important company and it is assessing its importance sensibly. Generally I am not going to join the bashing of Google based on conspiracy theories. My cooperation with the company (talking about AdSense) has been good for many years and as an ordinary user, I am impressed how many services Google has done for the users basically for free. Even if they wanted to use their search engine to push politics or the climate debate in some direction, they clearly have the right to do so, but because it would mean to throw away the value of the company which has grown into a rather standard corporation, I don’t believe that it will really take place, regardless of the opinions of some officials at various places.
Dr. Holger Thuss (President of EIKE)

Without a doubt, there are a lot of lies out there. However if Google really thinks a truth formula is the right way to promote ‘truth’, it will backfire on them because there simply is no such thing as absolute truth. Hence I believe this step would be entirely unnecessary. It will not stop promoters of ‘inconvenient truths’ such as climate realists from doing what they are doing, and it would cost Google large parts of its credibility. On the other hand, it would slow down important political and scientific debates. I also don’t see how, in the future, Google will convince organizations to pay for its advertising services if its reputation is damaged and people go away to other search engines. Nobody likes to listen to truther organizations.”
Dr. Benny Peiser (Chairman, GWPF)
I very much doubt that Google will implement the proposal to rank websites according to their “truthfulness.” Such a potentially self-destructive move would make Google look like George Orwell’s ‘Ministry of Truth’ who was responsible to falsify historical events or rewrite predictions. One only has to think about the way Google would deal with Michael Mann’s ‘Hockey Stick’ and the elimination of the Medieval Warm Period from history to realise the potential for abuse and manipulation.”
Dr. Hans H.J. Labohm (Dutch publicist)
Nobody should claim to possess the monopoly on truth. Therefore let people decide for themselves what information they deem trustworthy. And remember: ‘Du choc des opinions jaillit la vérité!’ Consequently Google should drop this initiative and bury it, covering it with a tombstone with the inscription: R.I.P.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning (Die kalte Sonne)
 Who would be the referees in this process, and how impartial could they be?
Dr Sonja A Boehmer Christiansen (Editor, Energy & Environment)
On whether Google would be able to control the Truth:
NO that would take a long time to emerge if ever…many scientific disputes took centuries to be resolved. Truth is likely to establish itself, temporarily, if combined and advertised in combination with solutions, like AGW.
There are short-term truths of course, what people act on in the hope that it is the truth, but then they usually have another motive to back up the truth like greed, personal advantage, getting research funds, pleasing ‘mates’. If they went ahead, they would be taking on a divine role. A warning!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman skeptic site Klimanotizen brings us what I view as very good news on the trend of climate science skepticism in Germany.
Readers need to keep in mind the very harsh environment skeptics face in Germany, where they are targeted and marginalized by powerful forces such as major arms of the government, leading politicians, massively funded alarmist institutes and the mainstream media as dangerous disinformers who should not be listened to, and under no circumstances ever be given a bullhorn.
But fortunately, thanks to Germany’s democratic society, that effort is failing. The latest example Klimanotizen presents is a recent annual meeting of the German Home and Property Owners Association in Hanover last week.
What was different about this annual meeting was that one of the invited speakers was Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, co-author of the skeptic book The Neglected Sun – How the Sun Precludes Climate Catastrophe – a best-seller in the German version Die kalte Sonne. The gathering was in large part a climate-skeptical event – all taking place in the Kuppelsaal at the Congress Centrum before an audience of 1200.

1200 listened attentively to Prof. Vahrenholt’s speech on why there’s no man-made climate catastrophe – followed by “sustained and thunderous applause”. Courtesy: Klimanotizen. 
In his opening remarks Chairman Rainer Beckmann pointed out that there was a time when warmer weather was welcome, and cold was dreaded. Moreover most of the last 11,000 years were warmer than today. Warm periods, even those that were warmer than today’s, were always good for human development. Beckmann also poured cold water on the notion of a consensus among the experts. “There are many scientists who would not believe in man-made climate catastrophe.”

Professor Fritz Vahrenholt: “Man-made climate catastrophe no longer the issue”. Courtesy: Klimanotizen.
Next at the podium was Prof. Vahrenholt, one of the founders of Germany’s modern-day environmental movement. Klmanotizen writes:
Prof. Vahrenholt impressively described many developments and facts about Germany’s Energiewende, which to many in the audience were entirely new. For example he described the large economic burdens and the environmentally detrimental impacts of renewable energies and Germany’s image loss abroad. He showed how gradually the talk is going around that the Energiewende is not working out. He then detailed how the sun’s role has been under-estimated by the IPCC. During the time of increasing warming in the 20th century, the sun showed the greatest activity in over 1000 years. But since then its activity has been waning and also global temperatures have not risen in 17 years. The IPCC scientists have no explanation for it. However with the sun and the ocean phenomenon it is easily explained. Therefore a man-made climate catastrophe is no longer the issue.”
How did the German audience react to Vahrenholt’s speech? Klimanotizen were present and they write of a “sustained and thunderous applause“. Hanover’s leading daily the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung (HAZ), also present at the annual meeting, confirms while paraphrasing Vahrenholt:
Sure an energy transformation is necessary in order to be independent of other countries, but we do not need any fear-driven energy policy stemming from falsely interpreted climate data. Vahrenholt received long applause from the visitors of the annual meeting.”
The result is that 1200 people, who likely had inklings of doubt about the allegedly approaching climate catastrophe, were shown data confirming that indeed it’s mostly all bogus. The good thing here is that once someone sees the Truth, they’ll never go back to believing the lie.
How many people have gone back to believing in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy?
Special thanks to Klimanotizen for covering this event and reporting.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJosef Kowatsch and Stefan Kämpfe at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) analyze the winter data from Germany’s DWD Weather Service an conclude that winters have been cooling.
The two authors present a lengthy analysis of German winter trends and what factors impact them the most. Today I will focus on the first part of their article, i.e. winter trends in Central Europe – mainly Germany. What follows is an abbreviated summary version.
Because of Western Europe’s proximity to the Atlantic, mild winters are nothing unusual and have occurred many times in the past. Two mild winters in a row occurred from 1909/10 to 1912/13, 1918/19 to 1920/21, 1934/35 to 1936/37, 1947/48 to 1949/50, 1987/88 to 1989/90. The article by Kowatsch and Kämpfe looks at if German winters are really getting warmer and less snowy, as is frequently claimed. They are not.
Now trend in snow coverage
An important indication for the character of a winter in Germany is the number of days with a snow cover on the ground that is at least 1 cm. That can be traced back thanks to the records of the Potsdam station, which goes back to 1893/94. There snow can fall already in October and well into April, and so it makes sense to look at the seasonal snow coverage days, where by the season goes from October 1 to April 30:

Figure 1: The number of snow coverage days – which fluctuates wildly – has been unchanged over the long-term. There’s no indication of reduced snow coverage days for Potsdam. The low snow year 2014/15 in the German lowlands is not included in this chart; yet it will show significantly more snow coverage days than the extremely low snow winter of 1974/75. (Source: PIK).
When one considers only the meteorological winter (DJF), no trend is detectable for snow coverage. However there are periodic fluctuations (Figure 2):

Figure 2: In the 1910s to the 1930s 1910er as well as at the end of the 20th century, there were generally fewer snow coverage days, instead the winters were wetter, milder. (Data source: PIK). 
Over a large regional scale (entire northern hemisphere) reliable data on snow cover are available since 1967. During this almost 50-year period snow coverage fluctuated strongly, yet there is no declining trend:

Figure 3: Since 1967 there has been no reduction in wintertime snow cover days over the northern hemisphere (Source: NOAA).
German winter temperatures – cooling!
Next we will look back at German winters over the past 28 and 18 years, and do so without considering the urban heat island effect despite the ongoing landscape alteration by man: Every day some 108 hectares are being built upon in Germany and thus creating growing heat islands around temperature measurement stations.
Germany’s winter of 2015 is currently pegged by the German DWD Weather Service as being 1.8°C above normal. Thus it’s the second warmer than normal winter in a row. However, the German DWD neglects to tell the public one thing: Over the long-term winter temperatures have dropped. It’s getting colder. See Figure 4. Data come from the German DWD Weather Service in Offenbach.

Figure 4: Winter temperatures have been falling in Germany for almost 30 years. The two recent mild winters have not changed that trend.
Result: Despite the alleged “global warming”, which is supposed to make itself evident especially in the winters, German winters are ignoring the forecasts made by the so-called climate scientists. It’s going to take an impressive series of mild winters just to flatten the trend.
This is proving to be terribly inconvenient for climate scientists who banked on warming. In the meantime cooling phases are being ignored, or data are even being falsified.

With the German winter temperature, the trend downwards would be even steeper if the UHI were properly accounted for. Yet, already some scientists are seizing upon the fact that the last 2 winters have been mild as “proof of warming”.
Next the single winter months (DJF) are examined individually (all data come from the DWD). Here’s December for the last 30 years:

Figure 5a: The trend is slightly downward, mainly owing to the especially cold December of 2010.
If one factored in the UHI, then the trend would be even more pronounced.
What follows is the 28-year trend for January:

Figure 5b: January has gotten markedly cooler over the years.
January also shows no warming in sight. One finds warming only in the climate models, and nowhere else. The next chart depicts the trend for February:

Figure 5c: Here the downward trend is unmistakable.
The February trend tells us one thing: Springtime is not arriving earlier. February 2015 in Germany was just a bit above normal.
Fairy tale models – truth being covered up
Kowatsch and Kämpfe summarize: “Winter in Germany is taking on a course of its own and is ignoring the forecasts made by the IPCC and the PIK. Warming? Where? In any case they are not to be found in German winters.” The two authors ask:

Where is the global warming which we are supposed to be massively combatting in Germany over the last ten years? Foremost the winter months were supposed to especially warm up. We were warned that there would be no more snow in the flatlands and that winter sports would be possible only at high elevations. […] It turns out these were forecasts from the category of Germany fairy tales. However, what’s worse is that this truth is being covered up and hidden from the German public. Not a single one of our charts is being shown by the media.”

No warming in Central England in 30 years
Kowatsch and Kämpfe also show the same is true in Central England; no temperature rise in 30 years:

Figure 6: No increase in 30 years, which is a climate-relevant period.
Tomorrow I will post on the factors that Kowtsch and Kämpfe say drive western European winters: Ocean cycles (and not Arctic sea ice).

"Rodney Adams had a job hauling luggage for airlines before bereavements and a back injury took their toll and he was convicted of drink driving in 2012. Just two days after his arrival at the Gurney unit in eastern Texas, Adams had a seizure and collapsed in the August heat. His body temperature was nearly 110F (43.3C). His daughter, Ashley Frantom, was 38 weeks pregnant and slumbering when the call came from a prison chaplain to inform her that Adams was in hospital.  Frantom drove three hours in the middle of the night to find her father shackled to a hospital bed. “We stayed in the hospital all night and then had to make the call in the morning to take him off life support,” she said. “I don’t think prisoners are treated like humans in this state. If there was air conditioning in that prison, my dad would be alive, out of jail and rebuilding his life right now.” Adams’s autopsy found he died of hyperthermia – excessive body temperature – one of at least 23 prisoners to die in Texas this way since 1998. Prisons that bake dangerously in the heat are dotted across the American south but are now found even in cooler states such as Wisconsin, with experts warning that inmates face increasingly deadly risks as global temperatures rise. “If you think about climate change the prison population probably doesn’t come to mind but things can get out of hand quickly in summertime,” said Daniel Holt, an academic at Columbia University. Holt authored a 2015 paper that found widespread risk of heat-related illnesses among the 2.2 million people imprisoned in the US, due to advanced age, mental health problems and complicating medications. “If it gets too hot I can put on the air conditioning or go to the movies. In prison you can’t take as good care of yourself other than ask for water and ice. A lot of people are in danger.” Texas’s punishing heat is only set to worsen. Prisoners in the state already have to deal with temperatures of more than 100F in the summer, with human-driven climate breakdown set to push up the average temperature by as much as 5F within 30 years. This will multiply days of scorching heat that imperils lives, with a Texas department of criminal justice spokesman confirming the prison system has no plan to cope with global heating trends. Efforts to alleviate the overheating of prisons in Texas were recently stymied by state lawmakers. A proposed bill would have set an upper temperature limit of 85F in Texas prisons, only to be gutted in favour of a study to assess the costs of keeping temperatures bearable. The watering-down of the bill was attacked by families of people who have died in overheated prisons and their advocates. Texas lawmakers simply resorted to a “cop-out”, according to Casey Phillips, president and co-founder of Texas Prisons Air-Conditioning Advocates. Currently, 75 out of 104 state-run prisons in Texas do not have air conditioning and the TDCJ has said it would need to spend $1.2bn to remedy this situation. “I was hoping we could resolve this but there is concern about cost and there’s a lack of compassion for people classified as criminals,” said Carl Sherman, a state representative who co-sponsored the bill to limit prison heat. “When you see facilities with little or no ventilation it makes me very, very concerned. We will likely face more days with temperatures over 100 degrees in the future and we have to do better. We should be administering humanity but we are lacking.” There are more than 140,000 people in Texas prisons, many of them in ageing facilities not designed for the comfort of inmates during brutally hot days. TDCJ instigates measures such as cold showers, chilled drinking water and reduced work duty when the heat index reaches 95F but many prisoners complain the conditions remain intolerable. “When it’s hot inside these institutions it’s like living inside a hot-box or oven in the middle of summer,” Elliott Williams, imprisoned over a series of robberies for the past 31 years, wrote in a letter to the Guardian. Williams is incarcerated in the Michael unit, located about 100 miles south-east of Dallas. Williams wrote that on hotter nights he will soak himself with water and sleep on the floor, although the fans in the prison do little but push around warm air. “They will place one large floor fan in your area that does nothing, when dealing with the Texas prison system, it’s all showmenship [sic],” he wrote. “My own personal belief is that some of these prison [sic] need to be torn-down, and done away with, they present a risk to inmates and officers alike, when a guard is working under poor conditions he’s going to make your life and time a living hell.” I don’t have love for these people … [but] the incarceration is their punishment, not cooking them to death. Prison guards have reported that suicide attempts among prisoners rise during the hotter summer months. “I don’t have love for these people,” said Lance Lowry, who heads the state prison guards union, in reference to inmates, “[but] the incarceration is their punishment, not cooking them to death.” In 2017, Williams launched an attempt to sue the state over medical and heat-related conditions, one of several lawsuits aimed at the Texas prison system following a spate of deaths. A total of 10 inmates died in a 2011 heatwave, with four perishing in high temperatures a year later. Last year, Robert Earl Robinson, 54, died on 19 July at the Michael unit in east Texas from “environmental hyperthermia”, commonly known as heatstroke, according to an in-custody death report. The prison system disputes this cause of death, however, stating that an autopsy didn’t back this finding. Inmates achieved a breakthrough after filing a lawsuit against the Wallace Pack prison in 2014, claiming that they routinely experienced weakness, dizziness and nausea due to extreme heat. Three years later, a federal judge ruled that these sweltering conditions were unconstitutional for medically vulnerable inmates. More than 1,000 at-risk prisoners, such as the elderly and those with heart conditions were moved to air-conditioned facilities, although some complained they were forced to agree to a measurement of core body temperature via rectal thermometer before they were allowed to go to these cooler areas. A more sweeping solution was agreed in a settlement last February, when TDCJ agreed to install air conditioning throughout the Wallace Pack prison. About 70% of Texas’s prison population remains without air conditioning, however, a situation that current and former inmates say endangers even healthier members of the incarcerated population. Jose Flores spent 14 years in Texas prisons on a variety of burglary and substance-related charges before being paroled in 2012. Flores said he would typically be made to work outside in 100F heat, picking vegetables while being berated by guards, before being given a warm shower. TDCJ has said it now has new processes to avoid situations like this. “I’d be in a cell for 23 hours a day and it was so hot in there I would put my hand to the wall and it would get burned,” said Flores, who now works for the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition. “There was no ventilation system so my cellmate and me would take turns sleeping on the floor. You’d clean the floor, throw water down so it was like a puddle and lie down on it on a sheet. Everything would be completely dry in the morning. The summers were just miserable.” Flores said the irritation of the heat caused prisoners to fight each other, with some previously healthy inmates becoming sick. “It’s sad because we are talking about human beings,” he said. “Even dogs and cats in animal shelters get air conditioning.” As the US heats up, prisoners even beyond the stifling south are increasingly finding themselves on the frontline of the climate crisis.   Increasingly powerful storms and disastrous flooding events spurred by the climate crisis are also set to disproportionally affect prisoners who are routinely left in harm’s way. Last year, a million people were evacuated from the Carolinas when Hurricane Florence crunched into the coast, leaving behind several thousand prisoners who tasked with heaping sand into bags. A year previously, as Hurricane Harvey inundated parts of Texas, prisoners were locked inside their cells with limited access to water and power. Some lost access to medication, others reported floodwater seeping into their prisons. Andrea Hasberry, the girlfriend of an inmate at the Beaumont prison, posted on Facebook a series of his messages which outlined the lack of water and sanitation in the building. “We hot and sweaty and can’t take no shower,” he wrote. “I’m dying over here man.”"
"From burials in pyramids to scattering ashes and even plastination, there has been no shortage of ideas about how to deal with human corpses. But with graveyards and crematoria almost full in Britain, the conundrum of what to do with the dead has resurfaced with new urgency. Now a leading public health expert has suggested the sides of motorways, cycle paths and even brownfield or former industrial sites could be transformed to house the dead. “We need to challenge local authorities and county councils and say as part of their greening strategy – which we must do as part of [mitigating] global warming – let’s put the burial situation into the thinking,” said John Ashton, former president of the Faculty of Public Health. The upshot, he said, would be the creation of new woodlands and green spaces that would aid greening, help the climate, improve access to the countryside and tackle the graveyard crisis in one stroke. There are many takes on green burials, but generally they involve burial in a shroud or biodegradable coffin, with no embalming, while trees are often planted as part of the process. “You have got 500,000 to 600,000 deaths a year in England and Wales so if everybody who died had a green burial – I am not saying that is going to happen – but if everybody did we could be planting half a million trees a year,” Aston said, adding that this would far outstrip Michael Gove’s recently announced plans to plant 130,000 trees in towns and cities to help tackle pollution and global heating. It is not the only solution that has been mooted: some burial sites have followed the lead of other countries in reusing graves, but others say this will only delay the crisis. While cremation might seem like an obvious solution, experts say it too has problems as many choose to bury urns, while the process contributes to air pollution and requires significant quantities of fuel. What’s more, some religions and cultures do not permit cremation. “About 70% of people are cremated, but I think that may have peaked,” said Ashton. A squeeze on space in burial grounds has previously proved problematic. In the 18th century concerns were raised that the foul-smelling air around the over-filled Holy Innocents cemetery in Paris was a human health hazard, but the situation became even more horrific when people living alongside the site discovered putrefying corpses had burst through the walls of their basements. The graveyard was destroyed after outbreaks of disease.  Writing in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, Ashton discusses new developments in disposal of the dead, including the recent move by Washington state to put an ecological option on the table. “The latest American offering is that of human composting using a process in which corpses are placed in reusable steel vessels together with wood chips, straw and alfalfa after artificial limbs, joints and pacemakers have been removed,” writes Ashton. “This creates the conditions under which it takes about 30 days for the body to decompose into a compost mulch that can be used to plant a tree or grow vegetables.” While Aston writes that tentative signs of an enthusiastic reception come “not a moment too soon”, given the world’s growing population and urbanisation, he expects the method to remain a niche approach. “I don’t think I would personally want to be composted,” he said. Nonetheless he believes the moment is ripe for a change in how we handle human corpses that could embrace the green movement, desires for less formal funerals, concerns about the cost of funerals, and worries about pollution. Julie Dunk, chief executive of the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management, said the institute had long been advocating for the re-use of graves after 75 years to ease the crisis in cemetery space, and welcomed new approaches. “As in life we have a duty to protect the planet, so we should in death and it is important that new ideas are considered that provide a respectful and appropriate form of disposal without costing the earth, in both senses,” she said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterTwo years ago at about this time of year the media were overflowing at the brim with apocalyptic stories of high-speed Arctic meltdown. Everywhere the media used words like “dramatic”, catastrophic”, “accelerated”, “tipping point” and so on.
Except for the story of an overall long-term trend claimed by one paper from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) claiming a long-term accelerated ice melt at both poles, the media have been eerily silent on news about sea ice extent in the Arctic.
Right now the media silence is so deafening that you can hear a pin drop on the Arctic ice.
This year so far has indeed been a bad year for weather catastrophes. The pickings have gotten awfully meager for the alarmists and the media, who have had to content themselves with hyper-inflating anecdotal weather events to keep the climate scare living, albeit in a coma.
Tornadoes have been well below normal, cold temperatures have prevailed over many populated areas this summer, hurricanes have been scarce (not even a tropical storm on the globe today), Antarctica is at near record high sea ice levels, global temperatures stagnant almost two decades now…and now even the Arctic has moved into the skeptic column. Nothing is going the way the alarmists had projected years ago.
That’s why we’re getting phony weather forecasts for year 2050. There’s nothing else!

Arctic may have already reached low point – 2 weeks early
Some charts are showing that the Arctic sea ice may have already reached its low point in late August…more than two weeks early:

Source: www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/seaice/png
The chart above shows this year’s late summer extent could be higher than half a dozen other years on the recent record. So it’s no wonder that the climate catastrophe-cheerleaders in the media have been dead silent on the Arctic this year. Nowhere in the German media are there  catastrophic, dramatic Arctic meltdown stories announcing the tipping of the climate system. All gone this year.
For that we will have to wait until next year, perhaps. Or maybe the year after, or maybe when the missing heat comes out of hiding – a time that no climate model is able to tell us so far.

On July 7, 2014, at the blog ‘Media Matters for America‘ appeared an article by Alexander Zaitchik on the 9th International Climate Conference in Las Vegas titled: Climate Denial Goes Vegas.
Among other things, the focus was to shine a bad light on the speakers and to portray them as paid hacks of the coal industry. But this flopped. Just take a look at Zaitchik’s part on Sebastian Lüning:
Sebastian Luning
Day Job: Senior geologist with the oil and gas company RWE Dea in Hamburg; Co-author of Die Kalte Sonne (The Cold Sun), which argued climate change is the result of solar flares and cycles.
Industry Ties: Heartland Institute. His co-author on The Cold Sun was Fritz Vahrenholt, CEO of his energy firm.
Climate Expertise: None

(1) Lüning has been not been working for RWE Dea since 2012.
(2) In our book Die kalte Sonne / The Neglected Sun, we argue that also CO2 plays a role, but has a significantly lower climate sensitivity than what is claimed by the IPCC. This “complexity” likely was too much for Alexander Zaitchik to grasp.
(3) Lüning did not receive any speaking fee from the Heartland Institute for his presentation in Las Vegas. Moreover the speakers who came to Vegas did so because they saw deficits in the public climate discussions and wished to bring the debate back onto a scientifically sound basis. Lüning also does not receive any financial compensation for his time-consuming daily blog work. Here asserting the “paid hack” theory is absurd.
(4) Zaitchik completely left out the fact that Vahrenholt was the CEO for a RENEWABLE energy company.
(5) Lüning has no climate expertise? Dr. Lüning is a geologist, a field that is an integral component of the climate science and that unifies a number of natural sciences. Moreover, Lüning has published a number of papers that examined sea level rise, the oxygen content of the oceans, and biological productivity, among other topics.
With such a sloppily researched essay, Alexander Zaitchik would not have received a grade at a University. The personal veil hiding that he is an IPCC spear carrier is so thin that obviously untalented activists from the very back rows are leading the cause.

"The UK baked in another record-breaking heatwave last weekend, which was made at least five times more likely by climate change (Report, 3 July). Weather bulletins are naturally the first point of information for events like these. They provide us with the information we need to act, whether that’s keeping our children indoors on extremely hot days or taking our umbrella to work when it’s expected to rain. As climate change gathers pace, dangerous weather is expected to rise in frequency. We once chose only how to respond to the weather. We now face profound choices that will define how the weather responds to us. Given that, and what is at stake, it surely makes sense that broadcasters communicate the best understanding of how climate change is disrupting our weather – and is expected to disrupt it further still if left unchecked. With that understanding we can make the collective choices needed to preserve the fragile ecological balance that sustains us.  It’s time for the regular weather bulletins to start including climate science communication. Broadcasters must use the tools, expertise and trust they enjoy to provide the information we need to protect ourselves from harm.Max Wakefield10:10 Climate ActionAdam CornerClimate Outreach • In her conversation with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Greta Thunberg says: “We aren’t destroying the biosphere because we are selfish. We are doing it simply because we are unaware. I think that is very hopeful, because once we know, once we realise, then we change, then we act” (Show up. Stand up. Act., Weekend, 29 June). Oh dear. Who’s going to tell her? Most of us do know – and care – but we don’t act. We’re deterred by the enduring success of powerful and corrupt global short-termism. Ocasio-Cortez was keen to tell Thunberg about the immense lobbying power of vested interests. Perhaps Thunberg should set her formidable sights on those corporate obstructionists.Chris HughesLeicester • Your article on tourism (The briefing, Journal, 1 July) quotes Claudio Milano from Ostelea School of Tourism saying “we need new indicators and a new set of measures of tourism”. Perhaps we could start with the effect that flying has on climate catastrophe. The CO2 is emitted above the trophosphere, and stays in the atmosphere longer than CO2 emitted at ground level because it takes longer to percolate down to the level of vegetation which will consume some of it. So perhaps we could tax the airlines for the oil consumed, which at present is untaxed. As your map indicated, it is the rich minority world that goes touring the poorer majority world where the ecological damage is done. The new indicators and set of measures of tourism should make this clear to make people aware of the atmospheric damage flying causes.Ann BlissLondon • Re the letters on flying (Aviation industry must get real about emissions, 2 July). We planned a camping trip to Sweden this summer but changed our minds when we realised that all car ferries crossing from the UK to Scandinavia have recently been discontinued and transporting the camping gear in our car to a port in Holland or Belgium would have necessitated driving hundreds of extra miles through Holland, Germany and Denmark. But we decided to persevere with our trip, and to go by train. We spent at least two bad-tempered days planning the train journeys from London to Stockholm and estimated they would take two-and-a-half-days and cost, one way, including overnight stops in cheap hotels in Hamburg and Copenhagen, at least £350 per person. Compare that with about £50 for a two-and-a-half-hour flight from London to Stockholm, as advertised on the net. Does this perverse incentive to fly exist in the whole world? Can anyone explain the disconnect between the worldwide scientific consensus about the climate emergency and our political paralysis?Jackie FarleyAylesbury, Buckinghamshire • The first letter above was amended on 5 July 2019.

"Ireland is ramping up its response to the climate crisis by planting forests – lots of forests. East, west, north, south, the plan is to plant forests, the more the better. With enough trees, goes the hope, Ireland can compensate for many of the cows, vehicles and fossil-burning power plants that make it one of Europe’s worst climate offenders.  From having just 1% forest cover in 1900, Ireland now has 11%, covering 770,000 hectares. It has just committed to planting 8,000 more hectares each year to reach 18% coverage. Research published last week said planting billions of trees across the world was the biggest and cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis. But some in Ireland have a problem with the great green vision. They say Ireland is planting the wrong sort of forests – dark, dank abominations that kill wildlife, block sunlight and isolate communities.  “It’s like a wall around you, dead, darkness. It’s suffocating. We’re losing the landscape,” said Edwina Guckian, a member of Save Leitrim, a group that is resisting plantations. “You couldn’t live in the middle of this thing unless you were Grizzly Adams,” said Jim McCaffrey, another member, crouching in a gloomy, tangled copse. “It’s absolute misfortune when you see the plantations coming.” The group, named after county Leitrim in Ireland’s north-west, has delayed some plantations with a blitz of planning objections and hopes to galvanise resistance in other counties. Last month a protester used a digger to block workers from felling trees and planting new ones. The offending species is Sitka spruce, a coniferous evergreen that dominates Ireland’s afforestation programme. Originally from North America, it grows quickly and tall – up to 100 metres – and flourishes in Ireland’s damp, temperate climate. About half of Ireland’s trees are Sitka spruces, many in packed phalanxes that blanket hills and valleys. They supply wood for pulp, plywood, pallets, fencing, garden furniture and building materials, much of it exported to Britain. And they absorb carbon, an increasingly valuable function as Ireland tries to avert fines of hundreds of millions of euros for missing targets on emissions and renewable energy. The government recently unveiled a plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions and set a path for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. With emissions from agriculture set to rise, not fall, success hinges partly on planting 8,000 hectares of new forest each year, auguring a lot more Sitka spruces. Save Leitrim activists say their county has been a laboratory for such plantations – “a national sacrifice zone” – and that the results are a warning to the rest of the country. “We’re not anti-trees, we’re anti-this,” said Willie Stewart, tramping through a gloomy pine-filled grove near his home in the townland of Drumnadober. “It’s industrial monoculture – a green barrier all around us. It’s horrible.” The activists, who include artists, farmers and business owners, say plantations inflict ecological and social damage and capture less carbon than proponents claim. The companies behind the plantations reject this and say Sitka forests play vital economic and environmental roles. Leitrim is bucolic and sparsely populated – just 32,000 people. Sitka thrives in the waterlogged soil with high clay content. Coillte, a state-owned commercial forestry business, started buying land and planting here in the 1960s. Private companies, encouraged by tax breaks, followed. Farm land vanished as Sitkas multiplied. They now number an estimated 34.5m – more than 1,000 for each inhabitant. The trees mature in about 30 years – exponentially faster than oak – and are then felled, making way for a fresh plantation. “The forest closed in bit by bit,” said McCaffrey, a farmer, who now feels surrounded. The trees eclipse sunlight, exude mist and block wifi and phone networks, inducing isolation, he said. “It’s a death sentence for the townlands.” These non-native trees carpet the soil with acidic needles and smother wildlife, said Natalia Beylis, an artist. “A lot of people find them spooky because they don’t have life in them. They’re silent except on the edges.” When machines chop down swathes of forest, a controversial process known as clear-felling, the landscape is devastated, said Stewart. “It looks like Hiroshima.” Brian Smyth, another member of Save Leitrim who runs a rural development non-profit, questioned the plantations’ climate credentials, saying carbon-soaking bogs were damaged and diesel-emitting machines often felled trees prematurely. “It’s all about money,” he said. Campaigners filed multiple planning objections to delay fellings and fresh plantations, said Smyth. “It clogs the system. We’ve stalled their work.” Forestry companies concede some plantations were too thick and sited too close to homes but that the system is now improved, affording greater space and biodiversity, with at least 15% of trees that are not Sitka spruce. “We’re in a different age now, we do things differently,” said Paul Jordan, a Leitrim-based manager for Coillte, the state-owned company. He cited sparrow hawk nests and badgers as evidence that Sitka forests foster wildlife. “It’s not the dead zone that the protestors would claim it is.” John O’Reilly, the CEO of Green Belt, Ireland’s biggest private forestry company, said Sitka grew three times faster in Ireland than Scandinavia, driving a sustainable sector that generated jobs, created essential building materials and benefited the environment. “The faster it grows, the greater the quantity of carbon it will sequester from the atmosphere.” The government’s target of 8,000 new hectares per year does not identify species but Sitka’s dominance is expected to gradually wane. Last week Coillte announced it would convert nine commercial timber forests in the Dublin mountains to primarily recreational and biodiversity use to create different type of forest that people could enjoy from a “landscape and aesthetic point of view”.

"David Attenborough made a surprise appearance on the final day of Glastonbury festival, thanking the crowds for helping to reduce the use of plastic at the event. The broadcaster and naturalist said his series Blue Planet 2, which detailed the effect of plastics on the ocean, had had an extraordinary effect. “Now this great festival has gone plastic-free,” he said. “That is more than a million bottles of water have not been drunk by you in plastic. Thank you! Thank you! “The ocean covers two-thirds of this planet of ours … the land only covers one third of the globe. There are seven great continents on which we human beings live. Each of them has its own marvellous creatures – birds and mammals, animals of all kinds. Each of them has its own glory, each of them has its own problems.” A huge roar greeted the environmentalist and television presenter as he took to the stage in the afternoon to the sound of whale noises being played out on the speakers. He told the audience the sea creature noises were from Blue Planet 2. “There was one sequence that everyone seems to remember, that showed what plastic has done to the creatures in the ocean. It has an extraordinary effect.” Adrian Lake, a wine merchant from Henley, said Attenborough’s appearance had brought a tear to his eyes. “He’s such an iconic figure,” he said. “David Attenborough is the voice of the world’s creatures and we need to join him in being that voice also.” “He’s just a legend,” said Ian Simmons, from near Bath. “It’s just amazing to see him and all the young people taking notice of him. The way Glastonbury has done the plastic-free thing has been amazing. When you look around you hardly see any plastic, which is what we have to do, obviously.” Georgia Spence watched Attenborough’s speech with her friends Nicola Mitchinson and Dean Cousins, all in their 20s. “My friends weren’t going to come to the Pyramid stage, but when they heard Attenborough was speaking, they changed their minds,” she said. “He’s looking out for the people of the future,” added Cousins. Clouds and cool winds brought a reprieve after the 30C heat of Saturday, when the festival had to put out a statement to reassure attendees the site was not going to run out of water. Showers were shut off in order to preserve water and long queues formed at taps. The festival said 27 people had called for assistance because of heat-related problems. “There is not a water shortage at this year’s Glastonbury. Our supply is running as normal,” a statement said. “As always in hot weather, demand for water has increased, so we have put in place the usual restrictions on staff and guest showers and the limited number of public showers.” On stage, Saturday night’s headliners, the Killers, turned up the temperature with an impressive set that included appearances from Pet Shop Boys – who played Always on My Mind and duetted on Human – and Johnny Marr, who came on to the Pyramid stage to perform a version of the Smiths’ This Charming Man. The band – who first headlined the festival in 2004 – got a five-star review from the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis who said: “From the opening moment, every song arrives strafed with lasers or pyrotechnics or confetti cannons.” He said there was “something impressively relentless about their set: it never lags, there are no longueurs”. Sunday’s lineup included Kylie Minogue in the “legends” slot, followed by Miley Cyrus making her Glastonbury debut. Emily Eavis praised Friday night’s headliner, Stormzy, who played a well-received Pyramid stage set that including guest appearances from Chris Martin and fellow UK rapper Dave. “It was a huge moment for us, up there with the all-time greatest Glastonbury headline performances,” she said. “The atmosphere was incredible, but then it has been since the gates opened.” Stormzy performed in a stabproof vest adorned with a union jack, designed by the street artist Banksy and seen as a political statement on knife crime and police cuts in the UK. Earlier on Saturday, Janet Jackson played an afternoon set that saw her race through her biggest hits, including What Have You Done for Me Lately? and Control, while the Chemical Brothers – who have now headlined at the festival five times – topped the Other stage with a maximalist production that climaxed with their 1997 hit Block Rockin’ Beats. Elsewhere hip-hop icons the Wu-Tang Clan closed the West Holts stage and Liam Gallagher played an early evening set on the Pyramid stage, running through Oasis classics including Rock’n’Roll Star and (What’s the Story) Morning Glory. Eavis also commented on the festival’s plastic-free approach, which was introduced this year and meant that single-use plastics were not sold on site. “It’s incredible to think that there are 1m fewer plastic bottles for the planet to deal with because we’ve stopped selling them. I think people are really starting to understand how important it is to treat the land with respect, and to stop living a disposable lifestyle.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s formidable green/climate movement is deeply deflated over the GOP’s grand midterm election success.
Especially the many German greens and socialists are struggling to fathom what happened and are only left to conclude that Americans must be just too stupid to appreciate all that President Obama and the Democrats have done and to understand the climate risks that threaten ahead.
For the reaction of Germany’s formidable climate alarmism movement, a good one is presented by klimaretter.info, an online alarmist site on climate and energy policy run by a motley crew of activist journalists with no scientific background.
“It could not have been any worse”
For the analysis of and reaction to the US midterm election results, klimaretter.info presents an interview with Liane Schalatek, climate and energy expert at the North American Office of the Heinrich Boll Foundation. The title of the interview: “It could not have been any worse“. Klimaretter.info writes in it’s introduction:
The election debacle by the Democrats in the USA is a catastrophe for climate protection. The outlook for a global climate treaty has dropped considerably.”
Well, that is indeed good news for the many and growing number among us who equate climate protection to climate swindle.
In the interview Frau Schalatek thinks it is likely the US Congress will move to cut EPA funding.
$85 million “a drop in the bucket”
On the $85 million spent on the election campaigns by environmental and climate protection organisations, klimaretter.info asks if perhaps that money could not have been better spent. Schalatek responds:

That amount of donations is only a drop in the bucket when you look at how much money flowed into the elections in total: over 3 billion dollars. Foremost from people with an anti-environment agenda. It’s a good thing that the environmental organisations stood up. The political weighting however clearly was against the environmental organisations.”
Don’t you love the smell of the enemy’s money burning? The 85 million probably hurt them more than it helped. Nothing like putting kookiness on display for the whole country to see.
Global climate treaty “to be a lot harder”
klimaretter.info asks if the chances of a binding climate treaty have now fallen. Schalatek:
Yes. It is now going to be a lot harder for Obama to advance ambitious national obligations.”
Schalatek also believes it is going to be a lot tougher for Obama to make commitments to the green climate funds because Congress has a say on the matter. She also believes that a GOP controlled Congress at best would agree only to an “extremely watered down” climate treaty that would have “little legal power and obligation“.
“…could not have come at a worse time”
Klimaretter comments that the election result “thus could not have come at a worse time“, just one year before Paris. And for advancing real climate policy, Schalatek thinks that “it’s a very negative signal” and confirms it indeed could not have come at a worse time.
Thank you, democracy!

"Dutch airline KLM has launched a campaign asking people to fly less. The video and open letter from CEO Pieter Elbers asks: “Do you always have to meet face-to-face?” and “Could you take the train instead?” The campaign aims to encourage travellers and the aviation industry to consider the environmental impact of flying. It describes the “shared responsibility” of travellers and airlines to “fly more responsibly”, and says those in the industry need to “create a sustainable future for aviation”.  The aviation industry accounts for an estimated 2%-3% of the manmade CO2 emissions in the world – a figure that is expected to increase with growing population, trade and wealth. KLM’s message comes at a time when the flight-shaming movement is becoming more influential and there is a rise in holidays by rail. Airline passenger growth is also at its lowest in more than three years, according to a traffic report by European airport trade association Airports Council International Europe(May 2019, at +3.1%). The KLM campaign, which marks the airline’s 100th anniversary, calls on passengers to consider train travel for shorter distances and to replace face-to-face meetings with video calls. It also suggests packing lightly to reduce baggage weight so that planes uses less fuel, and to consider offsetting CO2 emissions. The airline’s carbon-offset programme (CO2zero) uses passenger contributions for reforestation projects, including a new tropical forest in Panama. However, critics have suggested that instead of asking the public to be aware of their actions, KLM, and other airlines, need to be considering solutions that lie with the industry itself. Justin Francis, founder of Responsible Travel, has called carbon-offsetting a “a dangerous distraction” from reducing emissions. “Voluntary initiatives by customers are not enough; the cost of flying must increase … Responsible Travel advocates a Green Flying Duty, with the proceeds ringfenced for research and development into decarbonised aviation,” said Francis. “Carbon offsets are no substitute for carbon reduction. At the same time as telling customers to think about flying less, KLM will be telling its investors about its future growth.” The airline acknowledges that the most impactful change would be to use sustainable fuel, which its research suggests would reduce CO2 emissions from each flight by up to 85%. The airline itself is using 57 times more biofuel than in 2011, including for commercial flights, and is working towards developing a sustainable aviation fuel plant, which would run on organic waste including cooking oil and residue from other industries in the Netherlands and Benelux region. KLM said its sustainability initiatives have, so far, led to a relative reduction of 17% in CO2-emissions per passenger in 2018, compared with 2011. But Anna Hughes, who runs Flight Free UK, sees much of the “greening” in aviation as problematic. “For aviation to become sustainable, the answer is simply not to fly,” she said. “And the simple fact is that climate change, exacerbated by our reliance on fossil fuels, will make it difficult for our children to inhabit [the] planet. While we welcome measures to make aviation more sustainable, airlines must be transparent about their contribution to the climate crisis.” The climate crisis has led France to announce the introduction of an eco-tax on tickets for all flights leaving the country. The new tax will range from €1.50 for short-haul and up to €18 for long-haul in business class. At a press conference, transport minister Élisabeth Borne, said that €180m is expected to be raised annually from 2020, which will help finance daily transport in France, notably rail. KLM has stated it is against this type of national CO2 aviation tax, because it believes Dutch passengers would travel by car to neighbouring countries, and continue to fly from there. On the company’s website, it says: “A global approach makes more sense. If the tax is implemented, we believe that it should be invested in sustainability of the aviation industry. National taxes will just go into the national coffers and won’t do anything to combat climate change.” The airline also said it would not stop promoting air travel: “We are stepping up … progress towards a sustainable future but we are a company that needs to make a profit to survive and to continue to invest in sustainable solutions. We want to still be around when we have succeeded in our efforts to make aviation sustainable.” The International Air Transport Association is backing the KLM campaign. Rafael Schvartzman, IATA’s vice-president for Europe, said: “We support it in the sense you do have a choice. In certain cases you could use the alternative.” But, he added: “The UK is an island. If you want to trade globally, you will have to count on aviation.”"
