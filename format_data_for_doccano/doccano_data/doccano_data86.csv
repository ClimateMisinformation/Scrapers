"CSIRO chief Larry Marshall said the reaction to his planned cuts to climate science in the organisation is more like religion than science, and compared climate science with the oil lobby in the 1970s.  Marshall has announced a refocusing of research inside the CSIRO, with plans to abandon its work on studying how climate changes and instead concentrate on adaptation and mitigation. The move garnered widespread criticism from climate scientists in Australia and abroad, with experts arguing it is impossible to adapt to climate change unless you know precisely how it will change. Speaking to the ABC on Thursday, Marshall said: “I must admit I feel a little bit like the early climate scientists in the 1970s fighting against the oil lobby.” He continued: “I guess I had the realisation that the climate lobby is perhaps more powerful than the energy lobby was back in the 70s. “There’s a lot of emotion in this debate – in fact it almost sounds more like religion than science to me,” he said. He said that the reaction had not shifted his opinion or made him consider reversing the decision.  “For that to happen someone’s going to have to convince me that measurement and modelling is far more important than mitigation. And at this point, none of my leadership believe that. They believe quite the contrary which is why we’re driving in this direction.” Labor’s Kim Carr, who will be questioning Marshall at Senate Estimates today, suggested to Guardian Australia Marshall’s comments resembled the language used by climate change deniers. “I’ve heard all those words before. That climate change is like a religion. And I think there’s any number of conservative politicians that have used that very same expression. There’s no doubt in my mind that this is the sort of language that appears to sections of the government.” Asked if he meant the language resembled that of a climate change denier, Carr responded: “Why would a head of a science agency be using language like that?” Carr said the government didn’t need to intervene in the operation of the CSIRO to be responsible for these changes. “The CSIRO operates within a political context,” he said. “You don’t have to tell [public servants] to do this or do that. There is a political culture that is established.” “It strikes me that this is a decision that reflects government priorities. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the minister isn’t telling the truth that the minister wasn’t telling the truth when he says we didn’t know this was what they were going to do but there’s no doubt in my mind that this reflects government priorities.” Fairfax Media has today reported Marshall released a video to staff today, where he tried to further explain the reasoning for the cuts to staff. He is quoted saying in the video: “It’s completely understandable that someone who’s spent 20 years, for example, studying climate change, measuring climate change or modelling climate change, it’s perfectly understandable that they don’t want to stop doing that and we must respect that, and we must find a place for them in the rest of the innovation system, perhaps in an university, where they can continue to pursue their passion.  “But CSIRO’s direction has changed, and in the climate area we’re shifting from measurement and modelling to mitigation, because that’s where we believe we can have the most impact and deliver the most benefit.” "
"Extreme weather, water shortages and the spread of mosquito-borne diseases like Zika are all having very real effects on everyday realities globally, and they are all linked to a fast-heating earth system. Yet we still don’t treat climate change with the reverence we reserve for something like a terrorist attack.  Maybe the blame goes deeper, into our very natures: evolution did not design our bodies to treat climate change with urgency.   Evolutionary responses favor real-time threats, not those that take place on an extended time scale. Shrinking Arctic ice cover, erratic changes in winter snow cover or rapid shifts in heat and cold don’t provide the same sense of threat as our fear of terrorist attacks or other bodily harm.  The challenge in moving more forcefully to stop the flow of greenhouse gases is that if you have to stop and think about whether a specific action or activity is threatening, that very process engages very different parts of the human brain, and not the ones that impel us to action.  The hormones that flood through our bodies to provide increased strength and speed in anticipation of fighting or running won’t kick in when the threat is one that can only be understood through research and thought. If you want to worry whether climate change will eventually make it more difficult for humans to feed themselves, for example, you need to break out the books and study science, statistics and a lot of other disciplines. Even after you study, it is hard to share that thought with your fellow humans in a way that elevates this to an Isis-like threat.  One result: we only pay attention to climate change from time to time, and usually when it hits us in the face – Hurricane Sandy or drought if you are a farmer in California. But disaster rarely hits all humanity at the exact same time. And life goes on – our memories of tragedy fade, a survival mechanism also bequeathed us by evolution.  One time when more of us paid attention was when the countries of the world met in Paris in December to map out the next steps in the battle to contain the dangerous greenhouse gas emissions that are trapped in the atmosphere and increasing planetary heating. Daily, for a few weeks, we heard stories, opinions, data and analysis. There was a “hook” – a small, international drama taking place in France.  Now that the moment has passed, we are back to our own devices, and most of us don’t consciously connect whether gradual warming might double back to cripple human life. What if the changes make it difficult for critters and insects that play roles in food production to survive and perform their jobs? The cereal aisle in western supermarkets still offers dozens of choices. What if we don’t sense in a personal way how these changes might make us more vulnerable to opportunistic illness? We can avoid the issue unless the boss directs us to travel to Brazil and we are forced to worry about Zika. Our difficulty looking longer-term encourages the thought that someone, somewhere is taking care of this problem for us, that there is really nothing the rest of us need do. We sit back and leave it to the experts. The US supreme court’s recent insistence on looking through the lens of legal process – justices voted to stay Barack Obama’s carbon emissions regulations pending a challenge to them – neatly captures the fatal time factor. The court’s decision to cease implementation of the Clean Power Plan until the case is argued and decided isn’t fatal if the rule survives legal challenge. Then states will get back to work and ways will be found to reduce emissions. But the time lost in climate terms cannot be made up.  Climate change is relentless; human habit, Daniel Kahneman tells us, is oblivious. Bridging those two extremes is the central challenge of our times."
"A senior CSIRO scientist has lambasted the chief executive, Larry Marshall, after a staff meeting confirming where some of the 350 job cuts announced yesterday would come from. But scientist are still in the dark about who will lose their jobs; no specific scientists or programs were identified.  On Thursday Marshall sent an email announcing that 350 jobs would be lost from the CSIRO as the organisation moved away from studying how climate changes, and towards ways of mitigating or adapting to climate change. A senior scientist from CSIRO who attended Friday’s meeting said Marshall had confirmed 110 full-time equivalent staff would be cut from the oceans and atmosphere flagship, which has roughly 130 full time-equivalent staff. Another 120 staff would be cut from the land and water flagship, and a few more from other areas.  In the email to staff on Thursday, Marshall said that since climate change was proven to be real, CSIRO could shift its focus. “Everybody is laughing at Marshall’s statement,” the scientist told Guardian Australia. “Who is he to declare that climate change is answered? The IPCC says so many problems are not answered yet. And unless you know how the climate is changing, how do you adapt to it?” Then, on the ABC’s program 7.30, Marshall further defended the shift saying universities were focused on the issue. “The 7.30 response is a con,” the scientist said. “There are a lot of thing that universities cannot do. “Because most university research is dependent on temporary research grants, many programs the CSIRO has built over decades would be impossible to reproduce.”  One example he gave was Cape Grim, in north-west Tasmania, where the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology run an atmospheric monitoring station, one of only three in the world to get “baseline” data from the cleanest possible air.  “We’ve been doing that for 40 years,” he said. “Universities are not doing the carbon budget or the carbon cycle. There are a lot of capabilities that are not in universities that are in CSIRO. Unless they have a new huge injection of funds this capability would be lost. This took us 40 years to build.” Tony Haymet has previously been the Policy Director at CSIRO and the director of the SCRIPPS Institution of Oceanography in the US, where he is now a professor. He likened Larry Marshall’s management of the CSIRO to “schoolboys playing at being managers”. “If you are a complete failure, what you do is take one of your best divisions, shut it down, and invest in your pet project,” Haymet said.  “That’s the coward’s way out ... The job is to raise more resources. It’s like shutting down the Australian cricket team, saying we need a lacrosse team, and spending three decades investing in that.” He said several key capabilities will be lost from the country and the world.  “If this was a whole of government approach, and they said we want to take this capability from the CSIRO and park it at the Bureau of Meteorology or a university, that’s fine but I’ve been told they didn’t consult with stakeholders at all,” he said. Haymet said the cuts are “a kick in the guts” to farmers, the fishing industry, the navy and people who live on the coast and is worried about sea level rise.  “We’ve only seen the beginning of climate change. We don’t know what the heck is waiting for us,” he said."
"The amount of sea level rise that comes from the oceans warming and expanding has been underestimated, and could be about twice as much as previously calculated, German researchers have said. The findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a peer-reviewed US journal, suggest that increasingly severe storm surges could be anticipated as a result.  Sea level can mount due to two factors – melting ice and the thermal expansion of water as it warms. Until now, researchers have believed the oceans rose between 0.7 to 1mm per year due to thermal expansion. But a fresh look at the latest satellite data from 2002 to 2014 shows the seas are expanding about 1.4mm a year, said the study.  “To date, we have underestimated how much the heat-related expansion of the water mass in the oceans contributes to a global rise in sea level,” said co-author Jurgen Kusche, a professor at the University of Bonn. The overall sea level rise rate is about 2.74mm per year, combining both thermal expansion and melting ice. Sea level rise was also found to vary substantially from place to place, with the rate around the Philippines “five times the global rate.” Meanwhile, sea level on the US west coast is largely stable because there is hardly any ocean warming in that area, said the findings.

"Pension and investment fund managers who ignore the risks of climate change face the prospect of legal action, according to financial and legal experts. Global warming poses a systemic risk to the world economy and could significantly cut the value of investments, the experts argue, so those with fiduciary responsibility have a duty to act to reduce that risk, or be taken to court.  “Clients of investment firms and beneficiaries of pension funds might have a legal case to bring if those who manage money for them stand idly by as emissions erode the value of their stock,” said Howard Covington, the former CEO of a £20bn asset management company and a trustee of environmental law organisation, ClientEarth. “We are currently exploring such a possibility.” James Thornton, CEO of ClientEarth, said: “To produce a wholesale change in attitude, a court ruling on the obligations of fiduciary investors to control systemic climate risk will probably be needed. Because of the uncertainties in estimating future climate damage, this will not be an easy case to bring. But we anticipate that such a case will ultimately succeed.” ClientEarth successfully sued the UK government in 2015 over illegal levels of air pollution. It has also helped investors file shareholder resolutions at the annual meetings of major mining companies demanding more transparency on the risks of climate change to their businesses. But Covington said: “It would be fair to say that not a lot of progress has been made with this kind of engagement. It requires investors to put their heads above the parapet, but most investors like a quiet life.” In an article published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, Covington, Thornton and Oxford University professor of energy economics, Cameron Hepburn, say that investors will be crucial in ensuring the largely voluntary climate change deal sealed in Paris in December is implemented.  “Investors will play a major part, either voluntarily or because they will be forced by the courts to meet their legal obligations to manage climate risk,” they argue. The authors say that dangerous climate change could damage the global economy by, for example, droughts and heatwaves that lead to famines which in turn lead to migrations of millions of people. They estimate there is a 5% chance of global investment portfolios being reduced by 10% - $7tn - in coming decades, a level of risk and exposure that is routinely declared and acted on by big companies today. Prof Hepburn said: “The risk exceeds the legal test of materiality and should be too large to ignore. In practice most investors neglect it entirely.” The team estimate publicly listed companies - largely owned by investment and pension funds - account for about a quarter of global emissions. The investors can reduce the risk of climate change by demanding action to cut carbon emissions from the companies they have stakes in and shifting investment from fossil fuel companies to green companies, the authors say. The Guardian has revealed previously the high exposure of many pension funds to coal, oil and gas companies, whose value could plummet if most fossil fuel reserves are left in the ground, as is needed to tackle global warming. But Covington said the financial risks of climate change are systemic. “There has rightly been a lot of attention on fossil fuel companies, but that is just the supply side,” he said. “There is also the demand side - all the users of fossil fuels - and there is plenty they could do to employ more efficient processes to limit emissions, so it goes right across the full spectrum of companies.” “This expert view from ClientEarth is a wake up call to trustees and investment professionals,” said Mark Campanale, founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a thinktank that has highlighted the risks that action to cut emissions poses to fossil fuel companies, a view backed by the Bank of England and World Bank. “If investors cannot demonstrate that they’ve considered the key risks, ClientEarth have laid out the basis for a legal challenge. Campanale said the legal risk for fund managers is particularly high for those investing in fossil fuels. “If investors throw the hard-earned cash of pension fund members at the fossil fuel industry right now - knowing it is in steady but clear decline - then no one should be surprised that they face the possibility of being sued.”"
"The world’s leading body for the certification of sustainable palm oil has created new standards to tackle deforestation, human rights violations and greenhouse gas emissions on certified plantations. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) published the RSPO Next standards on 9 February following rising pressure from industry and campaigners who claim that certified firms are still participating in deforestation, land-grabbing and the destruction of biodiversity, such as the loss of habitat for orangutans.  Created in 2004, the RSPO has led the push to create an accredited sustainable palm oil industry. Today it brings together 2,500 companies, from producers and traders to investors and retailers. Around 20% of the world’s palm oil is certified by the non-profit.   Palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the world, according to WWF, and is found in an estimated 50% of supermarket products, from breakfast cereals to shampoo. The spread of plantations used to produce palm oil, pulp and timber has largely been blamed for last year’s forest fires that engulfed vast areas of Indonesia. The resultant haze also affected Malaysia and Singapore, forcing schools to close and grounding flights. It is also thought to be behind up to half a million reported respiratory infections. As global climate change targets become increasingly ambitious, pressure to preserve carbon-rich forests and soils is set to rise. Major companies using palm oil are clamouring to demonstrate they are taking action, with some promoting initiatives they claim go beyond the standards originally established by the RSPO. Last year the Palm Oil Innovation Group – a small group of companies (including Danone and Ferrero) and NGOs that aim to build on the RSPO’s standards – published its charter calling for stronger action to tackle deforestation and human rights violations within the industry. The Sustainable Palm Manifesto, launched by a separate group, has focused on protecting high carbon forests.  The RSPO has now responded with new, voluntary standards that ban planting on peatland and other carbon-rich soils, and require companies to implement fire prevention policies, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, pay employees a living wage and commit to zero deforestation. Its pre-existing standards only ban the cutting of primary forests or those considered to be of high conservation value. They also ban the use of fire to clear land but, unlike RSPO Next, do not require companies to have procedures in place to prevent fire on land they manage. Furthermore, under the original RSPO requirements only extensive planting on peatland is discouraged and the reduction requirements for greenhouse gases are less comprehensive. RSPO Next is, however, voluntary for members. The RSPO believes it would be impossible for some firms to implement the standards if they were compulsory.  While CEO Darrel Webber admits that there is likely to be some initial confusion, he is confident that if RSPO Next is successfully implemented by enough companies early on, it will be only a matter of time before it becomes the industry norm. Andrew Jenkins, sustainability manager at Boots, part of the Retailers’ Palm Oil Group represented at the RSPO, fears RSPO Next will create a two-tier system that is inaccessible to smaller companies. “You don’t want to make it so complicated that only companies like ours that can afford to pay people like me to look at it can understand the system … If you’re going to change the market you’ve got to get everybody on the market, not just the big companies.” Jenkins admits, however, that the RSPO has little alternative. “They are stuck between a rock and a hard place on this one. If they tried to rebuild the entire system it would take years and nothing would happen.”   Others believe that the RSPO should concentrate on improving adherence to existing standards. In November, a report from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) claimed that companies auditing RSPO certified plantations were failing to identify violations and in some cases colluding with plantations to deliberately disguise them, leading to deforestation, human trafficking and intimidation of environmentalists. “If the system doesn’t work it doesn’t matter how good or bad the standards are … It could be mitigating the impact of the industry quite significantly if it was implemented, but what we see is that it’s not being implemented by a lot of companies,” says Tomasz Johnson, former EIA forests campaigner and author of the November report.  The RSPO says it has thrown out two companies accused of malpractice in the report, is working with an independent regulator to review the claims and will introduce a register of auditors later in the year. Despite serious complaints that the RSPO is not moving fast enough, few seem able to imagine a viable alternative. “RSPO doesn’t work right now, it doesn’t go far enough, but if it wasn’t around we’d probably have to reinvent it,” says Johnson."

"Congressman Lamar Smith (R-TX) has embarked upon a witch-hunt against climate scientists at NOAA, accusing them of conspiring to fudge global temperature data. However, a new study has found that the adjustments NOAA makes to the raw temperature data bring them closer to measurements from a reference network of pristinely-located temperature stations.  Before delving into the new study, it’s worthwhile to revisit the temperature adjustments that Lamar Smith disputes. Volunteers have been logging measurements from weather stations around the world for over 150 years, and climate scientists use that data to estimate the Earth’s average surface temperature. But over a 150-year period, things change, as the authors of this study explain. Stations have moved to different locations over the past 150 years, most more than once. They have changed instruments from mercury thermometers to electronic sensors, and have changed the time they take temperature measurements from afternoon to morning. Cities have grown up around stations, and some weather stations are not ideally located. All of these issues introduce inconsistencies into the temperature record. To find out how much actual temperatures have changed, scientists have to filter out these changes in the way the measurements were taken. Those are the adjustments under attack from Lamar Smith. They’re important, scientifically justified, and documented in the peer-reviewed literature. Scientists make adjustments to account for changes in the way both land and ocean temperature measurements have been made over the past 150 years. The ocean adjustments make the biggest difference, and in fact they actually reduce the measured amount of global surface warming over the past century, as compared to the raw data. Thus you would think contrarians like Lamar Smith would appreciate these adjustments; however, over the past couple of decades, they act to very slightly increase the overall global surface warming trend. Climate contrarians who oppose taking action to slow global warming have focused their arguments on the past 18 years, during which time the warming of surface temperatures temporarily slowed down (it’s now speeding back up). The latest version of the NOAA method to adjust the temperatures made the slowdown a little smaller, and that didn’t sit well with those contrarians.  Lamar Smith soon began making conspiratorial accusations and demanding NOAA scientists’ emails. Last week, he convened a hearing in the House Science Committee and claimed, with no supporting evidence or basis in reality, An example of how this administration promotes its suspect climate agenda can be seen at the National Oceanographic [sic] and Atmospheric Administration. Its employees altered historical climate data to get politically correct results in an attempt to disprove the eighteen year lack of global temperature increases. NOAA conveniently issued its news release that promotes this report just as the administration announced its extensive climate change regulations. The new study published in Geophysical Research Letters by Zeke Hausfather of Berkeley Earth, Kevin Cowtan at the University of York, and Matthew Menne and Claude Williams Jr. at NOAA, set out to test how well the adjustments are working. Contrarians’ biggest complaints focus on urban heat sources near land temperature stations, and scientists’ adjustments to remove that urban heat contamination. To check how well those particular adjustments work, NOAA set up a network of pristinely located temperature stations across the USA that they could use as a reference. The authors of the study explain: To help resolve uncertainties caused by reliance on the historical network, NOAA began setting up a U.S. Climate Reference Network starting in 2001. The Climate Reference Network includes 114 stations spaced throughout the U.S. that are well sited and away from cities. They have three temperature sensors that measure every two seconds and automatically send in data via satellite uplink. The reference network is intended to give us a good sense of changes in temperatures going forward, largely free from the issues that plagued the historical network. With more than a decade’s worth of this pristine reference data available, the study authors were able to compare it to the raw and adjusted data. The US land temperature adjustments have the biggest impact on the trend from the 1950s to 1990s, because that’s when there were changes in the time of day at which the measurements were recorded, and in the technology used to take the temperatures.  The authors found the adjustments don’t have any significant effect on the average temperature or warming trend since 2004. Lead author Zeke Hausfather explained, Over the last decade there are plenty of issues with the raw data, but they tend to roughly cancel out in their trend effects. The study showed that the averaged raw and adjusted US land temperature data are both very close to the pristine reference data during that period of 2004–2015.  However, while they don’t have much effect on the average US land temperature trend since 2004, the authors found that the adjustments bring the data from individual stations closer to their nearby pristine reference measurements. In short, NOAA’s adjustments are doing what they’re supposed to do – removing biases in the raw data to make it more accurately reflect the true temperature changes at each measurement station. As lead author Zeke Hausfather told me, NOAA’s necessary corrections to biases in temperature data have come under a lot of poorly informed criticism in the past few months. Our new study as well as a great deal of prior research shows that adjustments to temperature stations are effective at removing biases introduced by station moves, instrument changes, and other factors. The fact that adjustments make the old historical network more similar to the new Climate Reference Network strongly suggests that they are getting it right. Conspiracy theories are strongly linked to science denial, but as is usually the case, this particular conspiracy theory has no basis in reality. "
"From London’s Walthamstow marshes to Thirsk in North Yorkshire, the mayflower has been in unprecedented early bloom. A survey by the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) found that just over 600 wildflower species have begun to bloom across Britain and Ireland, far more than the 20-30 that are usually expected at this time of year.  Kevin Walker, head of science at the BSBI, said the trend was down to the mild winter and a lack of frost. Last year’s December was the warmest since records began in 1910. “Certainly last year there were an awful lot of things in flower, but this year it’s been more pronounced,” he said. “When we looked at the normal flowering times for the species, around three-quarters were probably continuing to flower late because we didn’t have any significant cold weather before Christmas that allowed them to carry on.” A fifth of the species spotted were early bloomers, according to Walker, who said reports of blooming hawthorns – named the mayflower after its month for flowering – were the most surprising. “The fact that some of the shrubs that would normally flower in May were spotted was very unusual.” More than 850 volunteers surveyed their local area for wild plants in flower between 1 and 4 January, spotting 612 species flowering. Other spring-flowering plants already in bloom were lesser celandine, cow parsley and sweet violet. Average global readings show that 2015 was the hottest year recorded, with temperatures reaching 1C higher than that recorded between 1850 and 1900. Grahame Madge, senior press officer at the Met Office, said that December and January had been especially mild: “With weather you’ve always got natural variability, but if you add one degree warming in the mix it means extremes can be a little bit more extreme.” But he added that the mild weather might not last. “Meteorologically we are only just past the midpoint of winter, we still have a month of winter left and we know that we could have very cold conditions into March.”"
"For the youngest to the oldest gardener, the novice to the expert, one captivating, enduring and miraculous activity shines out: growing plants from seed. When you stop to ponder how those piles of pumpkins, heavy bunches of carrots, or basketfuls of ripe tomatoes all start out as seeds, the realisation is humbling. When we sow seeds, the worst we can expect if things go wrong and the seeds fail to germinate is disappointment. We can try again and hope for better luck, but life goes on. In some parts of the world, if seeds fail to germinate, or crops fail to establish, those that sowed them could face death. If their seeds don’t come up, they don’t nip to the garden centre for another packet – they start living on food aid. The prospect of having to rely on what your own garden or allotment produces, for your very survival, ought to send a shudder down the spine of even the expertly “self-sufficient” gardener. Can you begin to imagine watching your seedlings wither and die, in the sure knowledge that sometime soon you will be relying on food handouts? And will you entertain the thought that, in order to give your own seeds the best start in life, you might actually be condemning fellow “gardeners” in other parts of the world to a life of grim dependency – or worse? Hence the terrible irony writ large across the front cover of a magazine here on my desk: “Greenhouse heating: What is the true cost of protecting your crops?” The actual title of the article is equally ironic: “Heating: A high price to pay?” Predictably, the article is actually a consideration of the different fuels available for running propagators and heating greenhouses – electricity, gas and paraffin, all of which release carbon dioxide, either through their generation or when they are burnt, as gas and paraffin are, at the point of use. The main focus of the article is on the costs of using different fuels and the types of heater available. A few brief paragraphs at the end do discuss being “environmentally friendly”, with the admission that to be completely “green” you shouldn’t heat a greenhouse at all. The carbon dioxide produced by a gas- or paraffin-fired heater is a “greenhouse gas” in every sense. It respects no international boundaries; heating your greenhouse contributes directly to the global “greenhouse effect”. We can no longer afford to count just the economic cost of nurturing our seeds or cuttings – we need to turn the price tag over and look at the environmental and human costs. I haven’t used a heated propagator, or heated a greenhouse other than to give minimal frost protection in extremis, for years. Nor does it worry me that I may never do so again. It’s bad news, I know, for the manufacturers of greenhouse gardening equipment, but business as usual, even in the multimillion-pound gardening industry, cannot continue. It would be good news for the planet, and it might just help ease the burden on those who depend on their ‘gardening’ to stay alive. If you really can’t resist the urge to twiddle the thermostat dial in the coming months, at least keep it at minimum, turn it off when possible, and switch, if you’re using electricity, to a renewable supplier. This will at least help us, here in the “energy-obese” developed world, to tighten our belts. Better still, forget energy-intense artificial heating and make better use of what warm places you already have, or cut to the chase and tap directly into the sun. One of the most effective “propagators” I’ve used, powered entirely by natural and renewable energy, is an empty compost bag turned inside out, so the heat-absorbing black side faces out. I simply slip trays or pots of seeds inside it and stand them on the sunny bench of an unheated greenhouse, polytunnel or lean-to, or in a sunny porch. Failing that, commandeer a sunny window-sill, or use a sheltered south- or west-facing wall or window-ledge. The sun will do the rest, even on cloudy but otherwise bright spring days. Simpler still, slit the bag open and lay it over your sown containers, black side up. Go put your hand into an empty inside-out bag on a sunny day and feel what I mean. Don’t expect the same results you would get from using a heated propagator, or by heating a greenhouse to maintain a constant temperature. It will generally take longer for the seeds to come up, but come up they will. On colder nights it might be necessary to take them indoors, or to be creative with layers of fleece, cardboard and old curtains. If you’re using a lean-to greenhouse, even a modest one, think about painting the area of wall it covers black. This will absorb the sun’s energy during the day, then act as even more of a “radiator” at night, especially if it’s draped in warm layers on cold nights. Switching on to sunshine, while it might not be as constant as the power flowing through a three-pin plug, or hissing from a gas bottle, costs nothing. Not even lives. As we consider switching off our propagators and heaters, as we think long and hard about “powering down” our garden energy use in general, we need to throw another important switch to “on”, and that’s a switch in our thinking. We need to stop trying to beat or “extend” the seasons (global warming already promises us plenty of seasonal hiccups). We need, instead, to move closer to the seasons, to become more intuitive, to plan better, and be more realistic about just what we can or can’t grow without the subsidy afforded by fossil fuels. With only a little experience we can “stretch” the growing season by using cloches, polytunnels and unheated greenhouses – any structure that catches the sun’s energy.Can we really afford, financially, ecologically, or morally, to be sowing tomato seeds in early February, just so we can pick fruits in June? Waiting another month won’t bring us to our knees, and they’ll probably taste better to boot. But our impatience to have our seeds sprinting into action, at the flick of a switch or the strike of a match, is helping to fuel the destruction of crops, in distant lands, on which life itself depends.

"In the 2016 Republican presidential candidate debates, climate change has rarely been discussed. In last Thursday’s debate, the last before tonight’s Iowa caucus votes, on Fox News of all networks, there was one brief climate question directed at Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL). Unfortunately it was framed as a ‘gotcha, flip-flop’ question, with Rubio asked about his apparent support 8 years ago for a carbon cap and trade system in Florida, versus his current opposition to the concept. Rubio responded: I have never supported cap and trade and I never thought it was a good idea. And I was clear about that at the time. And I do not believe it’s a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment. And especially what these programs are asking us to pass that will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy.  When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any cap-and-trade in the United States.  In another debate 4 months ago on CNN, Rubio made similar comments, adding: America’s a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, but America is not a planet. And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, China is, and they are drilling a hole anywhere in the world that they can get ahold of. Politifact ruled it “mostly true” that Rubio never supported cap and trade. However, the rest of his comments are mostly false.  First, “blame China” is no longer a viable option. Despite having much lower cumulative historical carbon emissions than the USA, China has agreed to take serious action to curb its coal consumption and carbon pollution, and has announced that it will launch the world’s largest carbon cap and trade system. Using China to oppose an American carbon cap and trade system simply doesn’t make sense. Second, the “our pollution is too small to matter” argument is known as the Tragedy of the Commons fallacy. If the USA can make that argument, then so can every country. If every country uses this excuse, then none cut their carbon pollution, and climate destabilization becomes inevitable. The good news is that the opposite is already happening. Virtually every country in the world agreed to cut carbon pollution as a result of the Paris climate negotiations, including the United States and China. Third, there are already cap and trade systems in place in the United States. The George H.W. Bush administration invented the concept of cap and trade to tackle the problem of acid rain with an economically optimal, free market approach. Under that cap and trade system, emissions of the pollutants that were causing acid rain were cut more quickly and cheaply than expected, and the estimated economic benefits have outweighed the costs of the system 40-to-1.  California and a collaboration of nine northeastern states also already have successful carbon cap and trade systems in place. In order to comply with proposed EPA carbon regulations, many more states are likely to implement carbon cap and trade systems, or join these existing networks. Fourth, as these successful existing cap and trade systems demonstrate, the concept hasn’t been devastating for the economy. Quite the opposite – the economies of the nine northeastern states, which implemented their regional cap and trade system in 2008, and of California, where it was introduced in 2013, have fared better than the national average. There is also a consensus among economic experts that we should cut carbon pollution, with most favoring a cap and trade system or carbon tax. In fact, in a March 2007 speech, Rubio wisely argued that Florida should take advantage of the economic opportunities created by this type of free market solution. This nation, and ultimately the world, is headed towards emission caps and energy diversification. Those changes will require technological advances that make those measures cost effective. The demand toward such advances will create an industry to meet it—Florida should become the Silicon Valley of that industry. Unfortunately there was no more debate about optimal climate policies last Thursday. Rubio rejected the possibility of a carbon cap and trade system, and the moderators moved on to another topic. However, the other Republican presidential candidates would likely have answered in a similar fashion. Governor Chris Christie pulled New Jersey out of the northeastern states carbon cap and trade system, Ted Cruz denies that the Earth is even warming, many of the candidates are science deniers, and the only Republican candidates who think we should take action to curb global warming (Lindsey Graham and George Pataki) have dropped out of the race. Climate change has sadly turned into an ideological litmus test. Republican candidates fear that if they admit human-caused global warming is a problem that we need to solve, they won’t be able to win their party’s nomination. As Graham and Pataki’s candidacies showed, that may be true.  However, a growing number of Republican thought leaders and even a majority of Republican voters support a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The problem is that while they represent a majority of the party, the conservative right wing of the party that imposes ideological purity tests dominates the primary election voting. This may be a flaw in the American political system, since the Republican Party now stands alone as the only climate-denying major political party in the world, and a candidate who can pass the right wing ideological purity test is unlikely to win a nationwide general election. It’s a problem that the Republican Party must solve, because we need them to participate in the climate policy debate. Their candidates’ current strategy of denying the consensus of climate science and economics experts just won’t cut it when the entire world is moving forward with efforts to solve the problem, taking advantage of the resulting economic opportunities that Rubio recognized eight years ago."
"When Barnaby Joyce made international headlines by telling Johnny Depp his Yorkshire terriers would have to “bugger off” back to America or be put down it was no accidental 15 minutes of global fame.  The outspoken Joyce – who to the trepidation of many colleagues has been elected leader of the rural-based Nationals party and therefore also becomes deputy prime minister in Malcolm Turnbull’s Coalition government – just got a little more publicity than he was banking on. Frustrated that a campaign to draw attention to Australia’s veterinary quarantine laws was not getting much attention, Joyce later explained that he asked his advisers for any specific cases that might get some attention. Someone mentioned the terriers – Pistol and Boo – allegedly brought into the country by private plane and rumbled because they had been taken to a poodle parlour on the Gold Coast. “Bingo”, Joyce said, immediately spotting the publicity opportunity, although perhaps not anticipating the infamy of a take-down skit on John Oliver’s show. Since he entered politics in 2005 Joyce, now 48, has always said what he thinks, in the vernacular of the bloke on the street, although only in more recent years has it been apparent that he has entirely thought through the consequences. And his relationship with the man he now serves as deputy will be fascinating to watch, because on so many things his views could not be more different from Turnbull’s. Turnbull lost the Liberal leadership in 2009 because he was not prepared to “lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am.” Joyce led the internal fight against his backing for the Labor’s carbon tax, which caused his overthrow. During that campaign Joyce made famously outlandish claims that the tax could see the cost of lamb roasts soar to $100. When the carbon tax was eventually repealed, Joyce urged journalists to observe the weather that day. “No one thinks it is too hot,” he said. Just last year he continued to question the link between climate change, human activity and the weather, this time because it was cold. “Look … I just – I’m always sceptical of the idea that the way that anybody’s going to change the climate – and I’m driving in this morning and we’re driving through a frost – is with bureaucrats and taxes. All that does is … it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. I make you feel guilty so I can get your money and put it in my pocket and send reports backwards and forth to one another,” he told conservative commentator Andrew Bolt. His National party supporters have also backed the push that forced the Coalition to appoint a special wind commissioner to investigate health complaints against wind farms and have argued for a crackdown on tax concessions for green groups.  Turnbull is a self-made millionaire and proponent of free markets. Joyce is a self declared agrarian socialist. He has campaigned against investments by foreign state-owned enterprises in Australian farms and resource projects and in favour of stronger competition laws to protect small businesses. Turnbull wrested the Liberal leadership from Tony Abbott last year promising a calm and rational economic debate. When Joyce was the Coalition’s finance spokesman in opposition, he claimed Australia could default on its foreign debt. “We’re going into hock to our eyeballs to people overseas. And you’ve got to ask the question how far in debt do you want to go? We are getting to a point where we can’t repay it,” he said, a warning dismissed by leading economists as both irresponsible and a nonsense. The governor of the Reserve Bank Glenn Stevens said at the time there were “few things less likely than Australia defaulting on its sovereign debt”. Turnbull is a strong supporter of marriage equality. Joyce is opposed and has claimed legalising marriage equality was like “passing a piece of legislation that said that a diamond is a square” and could mean Australia was seen as “decadent” in parts of south-east Asia. In his maiden speech to parliament Joyce said abortion was “the slavery debate of our time.” The Liberals’ main economic aim is to boost economic growth, including by encouraging non-working parents to return to their jobs, or work more hours. Joyce and the Nationals champion the rights and needs of stay-at-home mothers. But his the earthy, plain-speaking style also creates Joyce’s appeal. He cuts through. He makes people listen. And he knows how to win his party’s rural constituency. As the Guardian’s Gabrielle Chan reported he used a recent speech on his plans as agriculture minister to laud the family farm. “I hear from some quarters, the day of the family farm is over, possibly walking out the door with the family business and the family house. Like journalism without grammar, the land without the family farm is meaningless, soulless, it goes to the core fabric of our nation,” he said. The country accountant grew up in the bush, entered politics as a Queensland senator and then moved to New South Wales for the lower house seat in the federal parliament, New England, that could allow him to pursue his leadership ambitions. In his early years in parliament he regularly voted against his own party, or held out for extra concessions for country areas. But he always agonised over his dissent - during a particularly fraught debate about selling the government-owned telecommunications company Telstra in 2009 – where he wielded a decisive vote, he took himself to hospital with chest pains. Since 2013 when he became a cabinet minister, he has learned to – for the most part and in his own way – work within the party strictures. He has curbed his excesses of language and restricted his wanderings off the approved party script. But the Depp dog furore is a perfect example of the different approach Joyce will take to leading the Nationals – the rural-based minor party in the governing Coalition that has in recent years had a series of gentlemanly leaders who, wherever possible, have settled differences with their Coalition parties quietly, created public fusses only rarely, and international incidents never. With the Greens making common cause with farmers battling coalmines and coal seam gas and rural-based independents nipping at their heels, there have been strongly divided views in the Nationals about whether they can survive without being quite a lot louder. The old school Nationals have argued Joyce has not got the character or discipline to be leader. They formed an “anyone but Barnaby” faction and tried desperately to stall and stymie his determined rise to the leadership. They were deeply angered by what they thought was unseemly public pressure by Joyce for the well-respected previous leader, Warren Truss, to step aside. But younger Nationals MPs and Senators have supported Joyce and backed his cause because they think that once the election has been run, and won, it is time for the Nationals to making a noise. “We have to differentiate if we are to survive as a party. When we disagree we have to be prepared to say so publicly,” one said as the party prepared for the Thursday night meeting where Joyce was elected unopposed. The government is talking up the idea that the urbane Turnbull and blunt-speaking Joyce will make a complementary team.  While that might be the case in public style, it seems unlikely it will always be the case in policy substance. Just how far he pushes the Nationals’ desire for political “differentiation” is Joyce’s critical judgement as leader. As for Johnny Depp’s dogs, after the international fracas died down, Joyce was awarded the Froggatt award for principled decision making by the Invasive Species Council for “acting quickly and decisively” against actor Depp and his wife, Amber Heard, for allegedly bringing their Yorkshire terriers into Australia in breach of quarantine laws.  The chief executive of the Invasive Species Council, Andrew Cox, said Joyce was right to resist public pressure and stand up to the film star. “It might have seemed like a bit of a joke at the time but Barnaby Joyce did the right thing by enforcing Australia’s strict quarantine laws,” Cox said."

"Over the past year the price of oil has collapsed and taken ExxonMobil’s share price with it. As the oil giant prepares to release its latest set of results this week, the company continues to show little genuine interest in preparing for a less carbon-intensive future. Even as world leaders gathered in Paris for the recent climate summit, where hundreds of nations and corporations stepped forward to underscore their commitment to action, ExxonMobil followed an odd course that has been lost in all the fanfare surrounding the international gathering.  Here’s what was missed: while appearing to pay lip service to the need for climate action, ExxonMobil suggested that the supposedly high cost of a low-carbon future would make any such action prohibitively expensive. The company claimed that limiting global warming to 1.6C, just above the goal set out in the Paris climate pact, would raise carbon costs to $2,000 per ton by the end of the century. Think $20-plus for a gallon of gasoline and you will have a sense of the scare and paralysis Exxon was hoping to inspire, even as it appeared to concede the need for action on the climate.. Despite its disingenuous head fake in Paris, Exxon’s narrative of preferring, and even encouraging, inaction in the face of climate change is the oil giant’s well-established modus operandi. As recent news accounts have shown, Exxon funded organizations for decades that denied the risks of climate change, despite the company’s own internal research confirming those very risks. Reducing carbon emissions is a direct threat to Exxon’s current carbon-oriented business planning. But Exxon’s risky path also poses a very real threat to the pension funds, institutional investors, and individuals who could very well end up paying through the nose for the oil giant’s desire to sweep climate concerns under the rug. And that is why ExxonMobil’s day of reckoning is fast approaching. New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman has launched an investigation into whether ExxonMobil misrepresented the risks of climate change and the costs of addressing them.  Specifically, the attorney general points to a recent report to investors, where Exxon employed a set of wildly exaggerated assumptions about the costs of a low-carbon future to make the startling claim that its hydrocarbon reserves were immune from climate risk. High costs, it argued, would prevent society from taking climate action. The Exxon report, a linchpin of the investigation, was written in response to a shareholder proposal filed with the company in 2014 by Arjuna Capital, an investment firm. The proposal asked the company to report on how it was managing its “carbon asset risk”. Or, more specifically, the risk that up to two-thirds of all fossil fuel reserves currently valued on the balance sheets of energy companies might end up “stranded” – too costly to extract when carbon emissions are appropriately priced and therefore non-monetizable. The best climate science tells us that leaving these reserves unburned, indeed, must occur if we are to avoid the risk of catastrophic climate change. Exxon’s 30-page report, Managing the Risks, failed to address one key thing: the risks referred to in its title. Instead, the report dodged a hard look at the risks by employing questionable math. Specifically, Exxon said that the government intervention required to force a low-carbon future (which could evidently strand much of the firm’s carbon assets) would eventually cost consumers up to 44% of their total income. Governments, Exxon argued, would never impose such a burden. Therefore, Exxon concluded its reserves would not be adversely affected. The problem with this tortured analysis is that independent economists consistently estimate the cost to consumers of a low carbon future would be far less — more like 2% of income if we act today. Not 44 percent. The management experts at McKinsey peg this at just 0.4-1.6% of GDP in 2030. Economist William Nordhaus recently estimated the transition to a low-carbon economy would require a carbon price of only $25 per metric ton, far below the $2,000 scare projection from ExxonMobil.  The ExxonMobil report also made the dubious assumption that carbon emissions would stay constant over time, rather than decline in response to a price on carbon. This contradicts the very MIT study Exxon relied upon, which assumes emissions fall over time, making carbon abatement cheaper. Furthermore, whatever increased cost to consumers from higher energy prices does occur might be offset elsewhere. For example, if the revenues from a carbon tax were rebated to consumers or used to reduce corporate income taxes, the net impact on the economy might be a boost, rather than a drag. Indeed, oil giant Statoil projects that achieving a low-carbon scenario will lead to the highest estimated GDP growth from 2030 onward, providing a sharp contrast with the high costs of inaction in less proactive scenarios.  The good news is that, contrary to Exxon’s claims, a low-carbon future need not be costly to society. But it would be a huge shock to the bottom lines of Exxon’s shareholders if they are left holding the bag with high-cost stranded carbon assets.  Exxon is pushing up against a shifting tide. A defensive approach to climate change does not bode well for companies whose very survival is dependent on adapting to a low-carbon future. As investors, we are obliged to tell ExxonMobil that denial is no longer a credible business plan.  Natasha Lamb is director of equity research and shareholder engagement and a portfolio manager at Arjuna Capital. Dr Bob Litterman is a former head of risk management at Goldman Sachs. Dr Litterman has synthetically hedged out stranded asset exposure in his personal portfolio, including a short in Exxon. "
"I’ve spent much of my life chronicling the ongoing tragedies stemming from global warming: the floods and droughts and storms, the failed harvests and forced migrations. But no single item on the list seems any more horrible than the emerging news from South America about the newly prominent Zika disease.  Spread by mosquitoes whose range inexorably expands as the climate warms, Zika causes mild flu-like symptoms. But pregnant women bitten by the wrong mosquito are liable to give birth to babies with shrunken heads. Brazil last year recorded 4,000 cases of this “microcephaly”. As of today, authorities in Brazil, Colombia, Jamaica, El Salvador and Venezuela were urging women to avoid getting pregnant.   Think about that. Women should avoid the most essential and beautiful of human tasks. It is unthinkable. Or rather, it is something out of a science fiction story, the absolute core of a dystopian future. “It is recommended that women postpone – to the extent possible – the decision to become pregnant until the country can move out of the epidemic phase of the Zika virus,” the Colombian health authorities said, adding that those living in low altitude areas should move higher if possible, out of the easy range of mosquitoes. Now think about the women who are already pregnant, and who will spend the next months in a quiet panic about whether their lives will be turned upside down. Try to imagine what that feels like – the anger, the guilt, the pervasive anxiety at the moment when you most want to be calm and serene.  And now think about the larger, less intimate consequences: this is one more step in the division of the world into relative safe and dangerous zones, an emerging epidemiological apartheid. The CDC has already told those Americans thinking of becoming pregnant to avoid travel to 20 Latin American and Caribbean nations.  Eventually, of course, the disease will reach these shores – at least 10 Americans have come back from overseas with the infection, and one microcephalic baby has already been born in Hawaii to a mother exposed in Brazil early in her pregnancy. But America is rich enough to avoid the worst of the mess its fossil fuel habits have helped create.  As usual, it’s the most poor and most vulnerable who bear the brunt. In Brazil army troops are going door to door draining puddles and flowerpots of stagnant water where mosquitoes might breed; in Jamaica the minister of health said plaintively “I’m going to be very frank, we don’t have enough fogging machines to fog every single community in Jamaica” with the pesticides that might help control the outbreak.  And so the residents of the rich world will, inevitably, travel less frequently to the places just beginning to emerge from poverty. The links that speed development will start to wither; even the Olympics, theoretically our showcase of international solidarity, is likely to be a fearful fortnight in Rio this August.  Zika’s not the only force tending in that direction, of course. It’s hard to imagine who’s going to visit Burkina Faso or Mali any time soon, after al-Qaida and Isis have blown up the major western hotels. Expats are starting to desert Beijing and New Delhi because who wants to raise their kids in smog so bad that a facemask is a fashion accessory. Obviously we need to extend every possible aid to people across the Americas – we need to make sure they have fogging machines and testing equipment and teams of doctors who can help. But even more obviously we need to face up to the fact that pushing the limits of the planet’s ecology has become dangerous in novel ways. The Paris climate accords already seem dated and timid in the face of this news. We’re in an emergency, one whose face morphs each week into some new and hideous calamity. A civilization where one can’t safely have a baby is barely a civilization. "
"Last week, surprise news shocked the world’s scientific community. One of the most prestigious and productive scientific organizations is slashing hundreds of jobs, many related to climate change research. The organization, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO for short) is simply put, one of the best in the world. It rivals well-known groups like NASA, NOAA, and the Hadley Centre for its contributions to climate science. What does CSIRO do that is so special? Many things. For instance, they are world leaders in measuring what is happening to the planet. Their research includes ocean-going vessels and other instrumentation that measure the chemistry and temperature of the ocean; they help track where human-emitted carbon dioxide is going, how heat is building up in the oceans, and what is happening with the general health of the ocean biosystem.  CSIRO is also a modeling superpower. Their climate models form the backbone of our understanding of what changes have happened and what changes will happen because of human greenhouse gases. But they also have deepened our knowledge about extreme weather. They’ve provided insights regarding how droughts, heat waves, and floods will change in the future. All of these contributions are important not only for the understanding that they provide but also because this knowledge helps us plan for the future. If you want to know what we can do to mitigate or adapt to climate change, you need this information. But according to CSIRO chief executive, Larry Marshall, CSIRO should shift focus. Here is the key statement he made last week: Our climate models are among the best in the world and our measurements honed those models to prove global climate change. That question has been answered, and the new question is what do we do about it, and how can we find solutions for the climate we will be living with? Are you kidding me? What kind of backward logic is this? From the reports I’ve read, something like 350 positions will be cut from CSIRO with the heaviest cuts (over 100) coming from the climate research groups. How can you predict how to adapt if you don’t know what you are going to adapt to? This doesn’t make sense.  Sure, I have colleagues at CSIRO (who I also consider friends). Sure I don’t want them to lose their jobs. But, the real reason this foolish move upsets me is that it forces decision-makers to fly with blinders on as they make decisions for our future. How fast will the planet warm? What will the impacts be? How will it change weather patterns? How will those weather patterns affect the Earth’s biological systems? All of these questions and more will be harder to answer after these cuts.  Australia is a small country (by population). Yet, it has punched far above its weight class in research. To think that this treasure of a research organization will be gutted is just shocking.  This story has gotten a lot of press in Australia such as here and here. It is also covered in international venues such as here and petitions such as here and here. Let’s hope this move is reversed before it is too late."
"Earlier this week Tim Sanderson, a former executive of the fossil fuel giant BP, wrote about the pride he felt for his daughter after her involvement in a climate change protest at Heathrow airport. With 12 others from climate activist group Plane Stupid, Rebecca Sanderson had occupied a runway to highlight the conflict between airport expansion and escalating carbon emissions. Having spent most of his working life in oil exploration, Sanderson said he was an “unlikely apologist” for his daughter’s actions. However, climate change had become a galvanising issue for his family. When his daughter and her colleagues were convicted for aggravated trespass – and face a likely jail term – the former oil executive stood with other protesters loudly chanting: “No ifs, no buts, no new runways”. As with a growing number of business people, Sanderson’s story demonstrates how climate change has become an increasingly personal business.  In our book, Climate Change, Capitalism and Corporations, Daniel Nyberg and I explore how businesses and the managers who run them are responding to the climate crisis. A key finding of our research is that climate change poses a fundamental challenge to business as usual. While corporations frame climate change through the optimistic prism of innovation, technology and “green” products and services, the unpleasant reality is that our existing economic system fundamentally undermines a habitable climate. For a number of managers, awareness of the environmental destruction that our economic system is exacting poses deep moral and emotional questions. Some chief executives have spoken candidly about their concerns for the future of humanity and their desire to change our trajectory. Often such epiphanies are cast from the personal and emotional realisation of the world they are leaving to their children. As the Californian venture capitalist John Doerr confided in a tearful TED talk about climate change and his teenage daughter: “I’m scared. I don’t think we’re going to make it.” The emotional engagement with climate change is particularly relevant for those whose task is to make their companies more “sustainable”. Here, personal concerns about the environment run directly up against the competing logic of short-term profitability and shareholder value. This was highlighted with stark candour early on in our research by a sustainability adviser in a large Australian consulting firm who told us:  “I would say that most businesses’ efforts, probably with a genuine intent, are more about appearing to be environmental and reducing impact where possible where there’s a business case for doing so ... because the best thing a business could do for the environment would be to shut down … But that’s clearly not a viable option.” Many environmentally concerned managers thus operate in a conflicted space: they can advocate for greater corporate environmental sustainability but this must not threaten business growth.  Responding to the inevitable gap between corporate rhetoric and action requires significant emotional labour, although ironically the outcome may be that emotions need to be deliberately left aside. For example, a sustainability manager at a major Australian property developer explained how he often downplayed his environmental concerns and framed his appeals for renewable energy to the company’s chief financial officer around cost improvements: “There’s nothing [in the discussion] about climate change. You can’t talk about drought and floods. We looked at this stuff, but they can’t get hold of it.”  Many of those we spoke to also often compartmentalised their feelings about climate change between work and home. They might voice strong environmental values at home or among like-minded colleagues, but would moderate their views in the presence of more senior colleagues. As the sustainability manager at a national insurer admitted: “That’s the other challenge: how do you have passion without being seen as too passionate?” Essentially, fervour for the environment often needed to be tempered in the corporate space by fervour for the market. However, many managers noted the need to sometimes stand strong and challenge business assumptions. Here the personal became the political by stepping outside convention and opposing proposals entailing environmental harm. As a manager in a major global food company told us: “We have to be the voice of the environment ... so sometimes decisions are made and those considerations aren’t there, and we’ve got to be the ones who stand up and say no.” For some of the managers we interviewed, these were pivotal events for them that involved putting their jobs on the line, or even leaving their companies to pursue alternative careers. Of course personal responses are not sufficient to change an economic system hard-wired for environmental destruction. However, they demonstrate the potential for an individual’s emotional engagement to begin the process of corporate and political change.  Future visions of a climate-shocked world prompt strong emotional responses, whether our concerns focus on the extinction of animal species, humanitarian disasters, or the wellbeing of our society or our children. Rather than denying our emotional responses to the climate crisis, we need to use them to champion alternative narratives to business as usual.  Christopher Wright and Daniel Nyberg’s book, Climate Change, Capitalism and Corporations: Processes of Creative Self-Destruction, explores the role of business in the climate crisis  "
"No, this isn’t another article about how damn hot 2015 was. Although just between us, I may have lost a bet to climate seer Joe Romm because he correctly predicted 2015 would blow 2014 out of the water. Instead, this is a post about the probability that temperature records keep getting broken if climate change is natural.  A paper just published in Nature Scientific Reports by Michael Mann and Stefan Rahmstorf and their colleagues considered this question. In particular, they wanted to know how likely recent temperature records and the string of records would be if the climate was completely driven by natural variations. Not even including the crazy-hot 2015, what did the authors find?  Well it depended on the “record” they looked at. For instance, the likelihood that 13 of the hottest 15 years would be in the past 15 years is 1 in 10,000. The likelihood that 9 of the 10 hottest years occur in the past decade is 1 in 770. The results are similar regardless of whose temperature dataset is used. Some media stories reported that the temperature records were even more unlikely. The reason this study arrived at different results is that they took into consideration the fact that temperature records are not like coin-flips. Each year is not independent of another year or the prevailing situation.  For instance, there are natural events that alter the temperature such as volcanoes, variations in the solar output, or even internal variability such as the La Niña/El Niño cycle. If climate change were all natural, you could get these natural events to align just by chance, and this could give a naturally-occurring record. So, while it’s very unlikely that this could occur, it is much more likely than if we just treated each year as a coin flip. The authors then asked how likely it would be to have a string of records given the reality of human-caused warming. They found that it’s 83% likely that 9 of the last 10 years would be the hottest on record and 76% likely that 13 of the past 15 years were hottest on record. They also found that the odds of 2014 being the hottest year on record was 40%. Without human influences, that chances 2014 would have been the hottest year is approximately 1 in a million. Mann said: The press reports last year about the unlikely nature of recent global temperature records raised some very interesting questions, but the scientists quoted hadn’t done a rigorous calculation. As a result, the probabilities reported for observing the recent runs of record temperature by chance alone were far lower than what we suspected the true probabilities are. Although the new odds of producing recent runs of record temperatures by chance are greater than the odds previously reported in the news (between 1 in 27 million and 1 in 650 million), they’re still incredibly slim at between 1 in 5,000 and 1 in 170,000. Including the data for 2015, which came in after the study was completed, makes the odds even slimmer.  In calculating the odds, the previous reports did not take into account that the data did not end simply because December 31 occurred, but that trends overlap into previous and subsequent years. This needs to be taken into account to determine the real probabilities of chance causing the warming events. As Mann noted, We provided a method for doing this based on combining information from state-of-the-art climate model simulations with the observational temperature record, and we used this method to estimate the probabilities correctly.  Rahmstorf added: 2015 is again the warmest year on record, which adds even more weight to our findings. What is more, the anomalous warmth has led to unprecedented local heat waves across the world - sadly resulting in loss of life and aggravating droughts and wildfires. The risk of heat extremes has been multiplied due to human greenhouse-gas emissions, as our data analysis shows."
"President Obama’s special envoy for climate change has warned Republican presidential hopefuls including Donald Trump and Ted Cruz that any attempt to scrap the Paris climate agreement would lead to a “diplomatic black eye” for the US. Speaking to journalists in Brussels, Todd Stern also said that a recent supreme court decision to block Barack Obama’s clean power plan would not affect US climate pledges, or plans to formally sign up to the Paris agreement later this year.  Republican candidates such as Trump or Cruz who query climate science on the presidential stump would in practice be “very loathe” to set off the storm that would follow any ditching of the Paris accord, Stern argued.  “Paris as an agreement has such broad acceptance and support around the world from countries of every stripe and region and Paris itself was seen as such a landmark - hard-fought, hard-won - deal that for the US to turn around and say ‘we are withdrawing from Paris’ would inevitably give the country a diplomatic black eye,” he said.  “When President Bush took the US out of Kyoto – which in retrospect was in fact a quite flawed document - he took lots and lots of diplomatic flak and that, I think, would pale in comparison to what would happen if a president took us out of Paris, which is seen as a strong viable structure that all countries have now bought into.” Trump, the current frontrunner in the Republican race, described President Obama’s speech to the Paris climate summit last December as “one of the dumbest statements I’ve ever heard.” And Cruz, who won the Iowa caucus, has promised to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, describing Obama’s focus on securing a global accord as “nutty”.    EU sources say that there is “significant concern” in Brussels about the possibility of either candidate winning the election in November.  “I think everyone is a bit worried about what might happen next,” one official told the Guardian. “Everyone wants to make sure that we aren’t left alone in a deal we all negotiated together.”  The EU is anxious to avoid a Kyoto protocol-type situation where it was the only significant global player obliged to make emissions cuts, after the US and others failed to join in.  “There’s a sense that if the US did not join [Paris] it might discourage other major economies like China and possibly India and Brazil from joining,” the source said.  International attention has been focused on the recent US court’s blocking decision which, if sustained, could cast doubt on at least a third of the emissions cuts promised by the US government in Paris.  Diplomats in China and India have even questioned whether the deal could survive the reassessment of US commitments that this would entail.  Stern pointed out though that the death of the supreme court justice Antonin Scalia earlier this week created the possibility of a “more than slight change to procedural posture” in the supreme court. There is currently a 4-4 balance between liberal and republican judges on the court benches, with President Obama expected to try to appoint a ninth judge in the spring.  “It is hard to tell how this is going to play out, but the supreme court is in a different place right now,” Stern said.  He maintained though that the US government had anticipated litigation over its power plant emission cuts - if not the legislative stay granted - and was confident in the underlying strength of its position.   “We think we are going to prevail in the court but we are going to go ahead and sign the agreement this year. Period. And we are not in any way going to back away from our 2025 targets,” he said.  References to a capping of global warming a 1.5C in the Paris text were “not a requirement, but a kind of urging,” Stern stated.  The US state department has begun an internal conversation about the domestic measures needed by 2050 if the US is to play its part in making this happen. A formal review may begin later this year. "
"One of the parts of the world being hit the hardest by climate change says it cannot afford to submit to the new Paris agreement to cut emissions and is likely to dramatically increase its contribution to global warming. Greenland, which is almost the size of Europe but with a population of less than 60,000 people, is a self-governing territory of Denmark. However, it is seeking full independence from Denmark and will only be able to survive on its own by exploiting its proven oil, gas and mineral reserves, which could take its emissions to some of the highest per capita on Earth. “The economic situation gives us no choice but to develop mining and oil. We would most likely [seek] a territorial reservation. It would be very costly if we were to submit to a binding agreement,” the administration’s foreign minister, Vittus Qujaukitsoq, told the Guardian at a meeting of Arctic countries in Tromsø, Norway. The deputy foreign minister, Kai Holst Andersen, said Greenland would likely seek a territorial opt-out from the Paris deal, agreed by nearly 200 countries last month. “If we sign it will cost us hundreds of millions of dollars and we would never be independent,” he said. While Greenland is not a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which shepherded the Paris deal, Denmark is. Greenland receives a block grant of nearly $1bn a year from Denmark, around half its income. If it chose independence this would be lost, said Andersen. New emissions restrictions on Greenland would be almost impossible to honour, said Andersen. “If we want to make a living we cannot afford to make an agreement that will bind us [to cutting emissions]. We are not an independent state. Independence is cancelled if we sign [Paris].” Under the previous Kyoto climate agreement, which applied to Denmark and other rich countries, Greenland had an emission quota of 650,000 tonnes of CO2 a year - less than is emitted by a single coal-fired power station. The Paris deal covers emissions curbs post-2020. Greenland’s position will not affect the ratification of the Paris agreement, which will come into force when signed by 55 countries that produce at least 55% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. This is due to take place at a ceremony in New York in April. But it gives a clear signal to rich countries that they will have to urgently find ways to help poorer countries and regions to finance emission cuts. Many developing countries have said that they will be unable to fulfil their pledges without considerable help. How this money is raised has not been decided, but is likely to be with a mix of carbon trading, taxes and development assistance.  Climate change in the Arctic is believed to be taking place faster than anywhere else with Greenland seeing rapid changes in farming, fishing and development. Mining has become easier as ice retreats and new species of fish enter Greenland waters, but the traditional way of life has been severely disrupted and the melting of the Greenland ice cap is taking place faster than anticipated, giving rise to fears of sea level rise.  “We are seeing the effect of climate change much more clearly now. We must address it in any way we can to make the rest of the world understand how it is affecting all life and livelihoods,” said Qujaukitsok. “It is is a blessing and a curse for us. We must address it in any way we can. It is affecting our life and ecosystems. It is posing threats but also offering new opportunities,” he said. Climate change in Greenland was highlighted in the Paris talks when tonnes of ice from one of its fjords were placed in front of the Pantheon to show rapid melting and to inspire negotiators to come up with an ambitious global deal.

"Leap day is coming up at the end of the month – remember this one? “Thirty days hath September,April, June, and November.All the rest have thirty one,except February, on its own,which has twenty eight most times.And in a leap year, twenty nine.”  I got interested in leap years a few months ago when a group of us in Canada were trying to come up with a title for an independent political platform we had just drafted. The document – launched during our recent federal election and signed by tens of thousands of Canadians – was a roadmap to get the country completely off fossil fuels by the mid-century or sooner, in line with what many scientists are telling us we must do, and what engineers are telling us we now can do. And we wanted to go further: the plan argues that in the process of fundamentally changing our country to make it “green”, we also have a once-in-a-century opportunity to make it fairer. We could redress terrible wrongs done to indigenous peoples; radically reduce economic, racial and gender inequalities; eliminate legal double standards for immigrant workers; and create a whole lot of stable, well-paying jobs. In very un-Canadian fashion, we even dared to hope that the manifesto might become a model for similar broad-based alliances in other countries. The text we came up with was unabashedly radical, and it went on to be endorsed by more than 100 organisations. An array of Canadian celebrities also added their names: Leonard Cohen, Donald Sutherland and Ellen Page, among others. Our first challenge was what to call it. We wanted to convey the need for speed, since as Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change, said recently: “Where capital goes in the next five years will decide what kind of world we have.” One suggestion was “The Leap”. And yes, we worried about inevitable comparisons to Mao Zedong’s disastrous Great Leap Forward. But what ultimately tipped the balance in its favour was when we realised that 2016 is a leap year. It wasn’t just good timing, we thought, but a powerful analogy. After all, we periodically add an extra day to our calendars because if we didn’t, the seasons would gradually fall out of alignment and eventually the seasons would go wacky. Imaging New Yorkers doing their Christmas shopping in T-shirts (oh right, that happened). It was Julius Caesar, in 46BC, who decided to bring the 365-day solar calendar to the Romans, throwing in that extra day every four years. He wasn’t known as a humble man, but even a “dictator in perpetuity” realised that it was easier to change rules written by other humans than it is to change the laws of nature. That’s a lesson worth re-learning – and fast. Like the Romans with their failing calendar, we find ourselves trapped within multiple failing systems: economic, political, even spiritual. And all these system failures have put humanity on a collision course with the planet, which warms and writhes the more we refuse to recognise its limits. We all received a vivid reminder of this problem a couple of months ago in Paris. To much fanfare, our governments unveiled a global climate deal that pledged to keep warming levels to 2C – or better yet, 1.5C. Then many of those politicians went home to hand out new drilling leases, new pipelines, and new highways. That’s why we chose The Leap as the name for our manifesto: the gap between where we are and where we need to be is so great, and the time so short, that small steps simply will not cut it. With this in mind, the manifesto not only calls for a rapid shift to 100% renewable electricity, it insists that these new energy projects should be democratically controlled – and that “indigenous peoples should be first to receive public support for their own clean energy projects. So should communities currently dealing with heavy health impacts of polluting industrial activity.” To pay for all this, we called for dramatic changes to how public revenues are collected and spent, from an end to fossil fuel subsidies, and higher royalty rates on fossil fuel extraction, to cuts in military spending. And those are just a few of its 15 demands. The plan captured the imagination of many Canadians. Burned out by decades of fighting against what they don’t want – tar sands pipelines, exploding oil trains, draconian security bills – they seized on the chance to rally around a vision for the world they actually do want. On leap day later this month, there will be meetings, teach-ins and other events across the country, all of them pushing our new government to adopt a holistic approach to the twin crises of climate change and inequality. And as we had hoped, it is spreading beyond our borders. Platforms partly inspired by The Leap have been launched in Denmark and across the European Union, and others are in the works in England and Australia. Even one in Nunavut. Several groups in the US are looking at drafting regional leap manifestos. Two millennia ago, Julius Caesar realised that there was something even more powerful than his empire: the planet’s revolution around the sun. Today, we need a different kind of solar revolution, one that doesn’t just change how we generate our power, but also who benefits. Here’s the good news: we have the momentum to make that leap – from the recent victories against Keystone XL and Shell’s Arctic drilling, to the surprising strength of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign. So take a minute or two to think about the extra day at the end of this month. It’s a reminder that people can indeed come together to change a failing set of rules. The laws of nature, not so much. Then let’s make this 2016 the year we started to bridge the chasm between what is, and what must be. Let’s make it the year we started to leap. • The Leap Manifesto, along with a list of its original signatories, can be read in 10 languages here. To find out about leap year activities visit leapyear2016.org. On Friday 5 February, Naomi Klein is co-hosting a leap year-themed Google hangout with Bill McKibben of 350.org, Asad Rehman of Friends of the Earth and others. Register here."

"More than 600 climate scientists from around the world have signed a letter to the Australian government protesting against the cuts to climate research at the CSIRO, calling for the lost capabilities to be re-housed elsewhere. As the letter circulates building signatures, Australian scientists gathering at the country’s largest climate conference in Melbourne made a similar call.  The proposed cuts will see up to 350 jobs go at the national science agency in the next two years and are expected to affect climate change research with most of the jobs going from the CSIRO’s oceans and Antarctica climate monitoring divisions. Jean Palutikof, who is director of national climate change adaptation research facility at Griffith University, said the CSIRO strategy of focusing on how Asutralia should adapt to and mitigate climate change, without studying what those changes were, was illogical.  “Headless chickens comes to mind,” said Palutikof, who has worked with the UN on climate change adaptation. “How can you understand what you have to do if you don’t understand what you’re adapting to?” The letter signed by international scientists says the cuts will make the targets agreed to in Paris in December harder to achieve. It cites article 7.7.c of the Paris Accord, which directly calls for strengthening of scientific knowledge of climate change. “CSIRO’s decision to slash climate research capacity will severely curtail Australia’s capacity to deliver on key promises of the Paris agreement,” the letter says. It suggests the cuts will cost Australian society. “The societal benefits of climate science will far outweigh the likely high costs of reacting to future climate change instead of strategically planning for it.” It argues that cancelling CSIRO’s climate modelling work would end up costing the economy. “Without committing to the development of next generation climate modelling and climate monitoring, billions of dollars of public investment on long term infrastructure will be based on guesswork rather than on strategic and informed science-driven policy.” The letter says that if the CSIRO does proceed with the cuts, then the country urgently needs to find a new home for the capabilities that will be lost. “If these climate science research cuts at CSIRO proceed without being filled elsewhere, then Australia will not develop its capability to assess the accelerating risks associated with climate change.” Dave Schimel, chief adviser on carbon cycle science at NASA’s jet propulsion lab in California, was outraged by the cuts. “This is a national treasure for Australia,” he said. “From the perspective of an international scientist with a 30 year history of collaboration, this is a little like selling off the Library of Congress or the British Museum. “Historically, there have been two groups that have really been the heart and soul of climate science on the planet. This is one of them ... the international carbon community right now is in shock.”  As the joint conference of the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society and the Australian Research Council’s centre of excellence for climate system science began in Melbourne on Monday, scientists were meeting to register their disappointment in the cuts. “We’re hopeful that this capacity stays in Australia,” said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick from the University of New South Wales, who helped to organise the protest. “The universities can’t pick that up, the bureau [of meteorology] can’t pick that up. So if worst comes to worst ... the next case is having the capacity in a different type of organisation... I’m not sure how that could happen.” More than 200 scientists donned arm-bands the blue of the CSIRO logo on Monday and staged a protest outside the conference in Melbourne on Monday to object to the cuts. Dr Peter Stott, who leads the Climate Monitoring and Attribution team at the UK Met Office, said the cuts would have a global impact.  “It is very concerning that such a decision could be made because it shows a lack of understanding of what you need to do to get the information we need to mitigate or react to climate change,” Stott said.  Stott said the suggestion by CSIRO chief executive Larry Marshall that the science of climate change was “settled” was “totally wrong.”  “What we need to know now is how do we manage climate change,” Stott said.  Melbourne University’s Professor David Karoly, who was one of the authors of the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report in 2007 and is a Climate Change Authority board member, said the cuts “directly impact Australia’s ability to meet its obligations under the Paris Accord”. Karoly said that Australia could not fulfil those obligations without the work of the CSIRO unless there was a significant investment in other organisations, such as the Bureau of Meteorology, to allow them to take over the work. Dr John Church, a CSIRO research fellow, said that the CSIRO had shirked its duty to the Australian people in announcing these cuts and that the only option was for another research organisation to step in. “This is a decision to cease all climate change research at CSIRO,” Church said, later clarifying by saying that an 80% cut to climate change research jobs was effectively ceasing all research. “This is are where the Australian people need active and ongoing science research into the future.” Prof Roger Jones, research fellow with the Victoria Institute of Strategic Studies and another IPCC author, said that the cuts would amount to losing 2,000 years of experience from climate change research in Australia. “We know from recent events around Australia that we can experience significant shifts in climate in short periods of time,” he said. “Understanding how these shifts come about could be worth billions of dollars to Australia.”"

"Adani has secured an environmental permit from the Queensland government to build Australia’s largest coal mine. The Indian conglomerate was issued an environmental authority for its Carmichael mine, west of Bowen in north Queensland, by the department of environment and heritage on Tuesday.  It is one less hurdle for Adani’s highly contested plans, after its Australian chief complained last week that delays in government approvals were “incentivising” green activists to plot further legal challenges to stymie the company’s progress. Adani still needs to obtain significant bank funding to realise its $16.5bn mine, rail and port project. It must convince the Queensland government it has obtained “financial closure” before it will be allowed to begin dredging near Great Barrier Reef waters to expand the Abbot Point export facility. A lull in world coal demand and moves in India to rely less on imported thermal coal have cast doubt on the future of the mine. Adani still has to obtain a mining lease from the Queensland government. The state land court last year recommended resources minister Anthony Lynham approve the lease after a legal challenge by conservation group Coast and Country failed to persuade the judge that the mine would have any impact on Asian coal consumption. One of the mine site’s traditional owners has challenged native title tribunal approval of the project in the federal court, but Lynham’s office has conceded it is able to issue the mining lease before the outcome of that challenge, after earlier expressing reluctance to preempt it. Adrian Burragubba from the Wangan and Jagalingou clan has argued the tribunal denied natural justice by favouring Adani without properly investigating its claims, including that the mine would create 4,000 jobs, when the actual figure was closer to 400. The Australian Conservation Foundation has also lodged a federal court challenge to commonwealth approval of the project under the Environmental Protection and biodiversity Conservation Act. The mine, which alone would cost about $4.1bn to build, would produce up to 60m tonnes of thermal coal a year for sale in Asian electricity markets, notably to Adani’s own generators in India. The ACF alleges federal environment minister Greg Hunt failed to account for the impact of emissions from Carmichael coal, which some analysts have argued could blow the world’s “carbon budget” to keep temperature rises below the 2C limit recently agreed at the Paris climate conference. Adani still also has to reach compensation agreements with a number of remaining stakeholders, including local governments over the project’s use of their roads. It must also finalise Indigenous land use agreements with traditional owners of the sites for associated works including an airstrip and workers’ accommodation."
"On 7 February, Australia solemnly marked the anniversary of an electrical fault.  It was on this date in 2009 that Melbourne endured its hottest conditions on record – a sweltering 46.4C.   To make matters worse, hot winds blasted through the region at speeds in excess of 100km/h. In Kilmore East, just north of Melbourne, a critical failure in a 43-year-old power line caused bursts of 5000C plasma to arc out and ignite the tinder-dry vegetation in the gully below. Fanned by such extreme winds, the fast-growing inferno would by the end of the day be responsible for the majority of the 173 lives lost in the dozens of fires that engulfed Victoria on Black Saturday, Australia’s worst bushfire disaster. Several of the other blazes that day were started by felled power poles and other electrical issues. This was also the case for many other fires before and since, including Australia’s previous-worst bushfire tragedy, the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires, which claimed 75 lives. Richard Turner, director of South Australian renewable energy powerhouse Zen Energy, has a plan to stop such a thing happening again. The 51-year-old entrepreneur is on a mission to replace ageing statewide energy infrastructure with community microgrids of rooftop solar and increasingly affordable battery storage systems. Although there are significant challenges in taking people off the grid, he sees areas hit by bushfires as the best place to start. Turner argues statewide energy systems are inefficient at the best of times, but that in fire danger areas, the case for switching to localised solar-and-storage is particularly compelling in both a safety and economic sense. “Fundamentally climate change is moving us towards more and more extreme summers and more bushfires,” he says. “Utility companies have been hit with some huge class action suits over recent years over fires, and in response they are shutting down power lines [on bushfire risk days] earlier and for longer, leaving communities without power for significant periods.” In 2014 Black Saturday bushfire victims secured an Australian-record $494.7m payout from power distributor SP AusNet asset managers Utility Services Group and the Department of Sustainability and Environment, and regulators are keen to avoid a repeat. Turner notes that turning off the power during the sweltering heat of bushfire risk days isn’t just uncomfortable for those affected, but potentially dangerous given people often rely on electricity to power the devices that alert them to bushfire danger and the water pumps used to defend their home. Up against the companies invested in preserving the status quo in the energy network as well as next-generation competitors in the battery-storage area such as American giant Tesla – which has just entered the Australian market – Zen Energy is busily presenting its case around the country. Turner says his company has been in productive talks with Victorian energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio over the prospect of subsidising Zen Energy systems capable of running as a localised backup for periods when the grid needs to be switched off. “They’ve committed to act on this but being government, it will take time,” he says.  Zen Energy is also trying to get in on the action in Western Australia, where company chairman and former federal government climate advisor Ross Garnaut has, according to Turner, been in discussions with state authorities regarding distributed power systems. D’Ambrosio’s counterpart in Western Australia, energy minister Mike Nahan, has signalled that grid operator Western Power is considering going a step further than Victoria’s plans. In Australian ecosystems, bushfires have long played a crucial role in burning through established vegetation to clear the way for new growth, and Western Australia is taking the same view of the energy infrastructure wiped out by the Yarloop bushfires in January – don’t replace what was there before, but rather introduce the energy systems of the 21st century. The cost of the rebuild of the energy infrastructure network from those fires has been estimated at $26m following the destruction of 873 power poles, 77 transmission poles, 44 transformers and up to 50 kilometres of overhead power lines. In some of the affected areas, Western Power is investigating the viability of solar-and-storage not just as a backup, but as a standalone system without links to the grid. Other options being implemented by Australian state governments to fireproof their energy systems include undergrounding power lines or outfitting networks with rapid earth fault current limiters (REFCL).  Lu Aye, associate professor in the department of infrastructure engineering at the University of Melbourne, notes however that the cost of maintaining an ageing infrastructure grid will only get worse.  “Smaller distributed power systems, from a cost and safety perspective, are in many ways the better option,” he says.  That’s without even factoring in the bigger picture.  When it comes to bushfires, the most significant benefit of switching over to green energy solar-and-storage systems is not the mitigation of today’s risks, but the reduction of carbon emissions and thus the frequency and severity of such disasters in the future.  After all, as any firefighter worth their salt will attest, the best way to deal with bushfires is to take decisive action early, before things get out of control."

"Human emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are causing the Earth to warm. We know this, and we have known about the heat-trapping nature of these gases for over 100 years. But scientists want to know how fast the Earth is warming and how much extra energy is being added to the climate because of human activities.  If you want to know about global warming and its future effects, you really need to answer these questions. Whether this year was hotter than last year or whether next year breaks a new record are merely one symptom of a warming world. Sure, we expect records to be broken, but they are not the most compelling evidence.   The most compelling evidence we have that global warming is happening is that we can measure how much extra heat comes in to the Earth’s climate system each year. Think of it like a bank account. Money comes in and money goes out each month. At the end of the month, do you have more funds than at the beginning? That is the global warming analogy. Each year, do we have more or less energy in the system compared to the prior year?  The answer to this question is clear, unassailable and unequivocal: the Earth is warming because the energy is increasing. We know this because the heat shows up in our measurements, mainly in the oceans. Indeed the oceans take up more than 92% of the extra heat. The rest goes into melting Arctic sea ice, land ice, and warming the land and atmosphere. Accordingly, to measure global warming, we have to measure ocean warming. Results for 2015 were recently published by Noaa and are available here. A recent paper by Karina von Schuckmann and her colleagues appeared in Nature Climate Change, and provides an excellent summary of our knowledge of the energy balance of the Earth and recent advances that have been made. The article describes the complexity of the situation. The Earth is continuously gaining energy from greenhouse gases, but there are also natural fluctuations that cause both increases and decreases to the energy flows.  For instance, volcanic eruptions may temporarily reflect some solar energy back to space. Natural variability like the El Niño/La Niña cycle can change heat flows and how deep the heat is buried in the ocean. The energy from the sun isn’t constant either; it varies on an 11-year cycle, but by less than 0.01%. With all of this and more happening, how do we know if an energy imbalance is natural or human caused? How do we separate these effects?  The effort to separate human from natural effects is seen to be possible when one considers how the imbalance is measured in the first place. There are multiple complementary ways to make these measurements. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages and they have to be considered together. One way is through satellites that orbit the Earth. These satellites can measure the heat entering the atmosphere and the heat leaving the system. The difference between them is the imbalance. Currently, the longest operating satellite measurement for this is from Nasa and is named Ceres (Clouds and Earth’s Radiation Energy System). The difficulty is that the energy imbalance is only about 0.1% of the actual energy flows in and out, and while the changes can be tracked, their exact values are uncertain. Another way to measure the imbalance is to actually take the ocean’s temperature. Temperature tells us how much heat a system has. If the temperature is increasing, it means the energy within the system is increasing as well – the system is out of balance. Not only do we have to measure the ocean temperatures accurately, but there is a need to measure the temperatures year after year after year exceedingly accurately to much better than a 0.1°C margin. What really matters is how the temperature is changing over long periods of time.  While it may sound easy to measure the oceans, it is actually quite challenging. The oceans are huge (and deep) and difficult to access. The need is for enough measurement locations at enough depths and with enough precision to get an accurate temperature.  In recent years, we have relied upon a system of automated ocean measurement devices called the Argo fleet. These devices are scattered across the globe and they autonomously rise and sink (down to 2,000 meters) and record temperatures and salinity during their travels. Because of the Argo fleet, we know a lot more about our oceans, and this new knowledge helps us ask better questions. But the fleet could be made even better. They do not measure the bottom half of the ocean (below 2,000m depth) and they do not fully cover regions near or under ice or near shores.  Furthermore, a 10-year trend is much too short to make long-term climate conclusions. We have to stitch Argo temperatures to other instruments, which have been measuring the oceans for decades. That stitching process has to be done carefully so that a false cooling or warming trend is not introduced. Another way is through ocean levels. As the oceans warm, the water expands and sea levels rise. So, just by measuring the changing water levels, it is possible to assess how much heat the oceans are absorbing. The drawback to this method is that oceans are also rising because ice around with world is melting, particularly in Greenland and Antarctica. As this melted ice water flows into the oceans, it too causes sea levels to rise. So, it’s important to separate how much of ocean level rise is from heat-expansion and how much is from ice melting. And another way is through the use of climate models, which are computer simulations of the environment. Very powerful computers are used to calculate the state of the climate at millions of locations across the globe, in both the oceans and in the atmosphere. The calculations use basic physics and thermodynamics equations to track the thermal energy at each of the locations.  So, there are many ways to measure the Earth’s energy imbalance. While all methods are telling us the Earth has a fever, they differ in details and better synthesis of all the information is essential to improve the knowledge of what Earth’s energy imbalance is. Right now, the Earth is gaining perhaps as much as 1 Watt of heat (a Joule per second) for every square meter of surface area. Considering how large the Earth is, this is an incredible amount of heat being gained day and night year after year. This is over 1 zettaJoules (sextillion Joules) per year.  What I like about this new paper is the recommendations for the future. Perhaps the most important recommendation is that we need to continue to make accurate measurements of the Earth’s temperatures, especially in the oceans. We need to extend those temperate measurements to deeper locations (below 2,000 m) and make measurements near shores, in the Polar Regions, underneath ice, etc. This will require a sustained funding of our measurement systems and a long-term view of the Earth’s changing climate.  Fully understanding where the excess heat is going in the Earth system is a first step to making good predictions as to what its consequences are for the future climate and the oceans. It is an essential activity to enable planning for the future. Dr von Schuckmann summarized her work nicely when she told me,  Advancing our capability to monitor the Earth’s Energy Imbalance means increasing our knowledge on the status of global climate change - and the global ocean plays a crucial role. A concerted multi-disciplinary and international effort is needed to improve our ability to monitor this fundamental metric defining global warming."
"Governments proposed for the first time on Monday to reduce climate pollution from airplanes, plugging one of the biggest loopholes in last December’s landmark Paris agreement. The global initiative was a first attempt to halt carbon emissions from air travel – one of the fastest growing sources of climate pollution.  In a call with reporters, White House officials described the standards as “a huge deal”, noting that the aviation authority has also proposed an aspirational goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2020. But campaign groups, specifically the International Council on Clean Transportation, said the proposed standards were a missed opportunity and would have little real effect in curbing emissions. The standards proposed at an expert meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (Icao) in Montreal would apply to all new commercial and business aircraft delivered after 1 January 2028.  But they exclude aircraft that are already in use, and as most airlines have lifetimes of 20-30 years, it will take decades to cover the current fleet.  In addition, the standards would on average require only a 4% reduction in the cruise fuel consumption of new aircraft, compared to 2015. The proposals will be put to countries for formal adoption next year. Icao said the standard was aimed at larger aircraft, which were responsible for the vast majority of global aviation emissions. “The goal of this process is ultimately to ensure that when the next generation of aircraft types enter service, there will be guaranteed reductions in international CO2 emissions,” Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, president of the Icao council said. “We also recognize that the projected doubling of global passengers and flights by 2030 must be managed responsibly and sustainably.” The exclusion of high-polluting industries such as international aviation and shipping was seen as a major weakness of the historic agreement reached last December. Currently, air travel and shipping together account for about 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but are projected to account for about 30% by 2050. But emerging economies had balked at the idea of including shipping and aviation in the Paris agreement, and so negotiators left them out of the deal. White House officials said they were satisfied with the proposed standard – given the range of countries’ positions. The European Union and some emerging economics had been reluctant to take stronger action. “This is a really a strong result,” the officials said. “It’s the first ever CO2 standards for aircraft covering existing aircraft.” But campaign groups suggested the Icao recommendations would do very little to rein in emissions – and in some cases lagged behind technology that was already in use. According to an analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation, some of the top performing commercial aircraft were already achieving the standard – with room to spare. By 2020, eight years before the proposed standards were even due to come into effect, the average aircraft would already be 10% more efficient than the Icao standard. “Given the substantial lead time for the standards, along with anticipated fuel efficiency gains for new aircraft types already in development by manufacturers, the standards will serve primarily to prevent backsliding in emissions,” ICCT said in a statement. “Additional action would be required for the standard to reduce emissions below business as usual.” Vera Pardee, an attorney for the Centre for Biological Diversity, said the proposed standard put an additional burden on the Obama administration to make good on earlier promises to cut aviation emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency had been waiting for Icao to bring in its standards before moving to cut emissions from the domestic airline industry.  However, the White House would not say whether the EPA would propose those new domestic standards before Barack Obama leaves the White House."
"The scrapping of government support for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has put at risk the UK’s international commitments on tackling climate change, an influential group of MPs has found. The energy and climate change committee said that, without such technology, it would be much more expensive to meet national and internationally agreed targets on reducing greenhouse gases. The extra cost could run to billions, outstripping the £1bn of public funds that had been promised for CCS.  Angus MacNeil, the Scottish National party MP who chairs the committee, said: “The manner in which the government pulled the plug on the CCS commercialisation competition was hugely disappointing. UK companies had been working towards this for years and were only weeks away from final proposals. This is the latest in a series of snap decisions that have damaged confidence in the government’s energy policy.” Ministers agreed to long-term carbon targets at the landmark Paris climate summit in December, to much fanfare, but it came shortly after the chancellor, George Osborne, announced that mooted CCS plants would not receive government help. That decision, buried in the spending review in late November, days before the Paris conference started, was a severe blow to the UK’s fledgling CCS industry. CCS is seen as a way of extending the life of coal and gas-fired power stations, as it removes the emissions from burning fossil fuels from the atmosphere. Without it, much more investment would be required into low-carbon alternatives such as renewables and nuclear power. The government’s statutory advisers on meeting emissions targets, the Committee on Climate Change, have also warned that without CCS the UK will find it much more expensive to meet its carbon-cutting goals. Government support for the technology had been promised since 2005, when the idea was first mooted of a publicly funded competition among companies to find the best proposals. After years of wrangling by various governments, by last autumn the competition was in its final stages, with a prize settled at £1bn and two bidders remaining, both consortia that had spent several years and millions of pounds on their plans. These projects, in Yorkshire and Scotland, have now been halted. The MPs also warned that the government was missing the opportunity to use existing North Sea oil and gas infrastructure, much of which may be lost as those fields are depleted, as a cornerstone of a new CCS industry. They called for the government to put forward new CCS plans. Luke Warren, chief executive of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said the government’s withdrawal had “an extremely negative impact on the industry”, and that although it might appear to be saving money in the short term, it would leave the UK with much greater costs in the next two decades.  “[A new government strategy for CCS] needs to clearly set out the government’s ambitions in the near term and address the challenge of providing storage infrastructure [and] a sustainable future for vital energy-intensive industries, and maximise our North Sea oil and gas assets,” he said.  Energy experts also warned of the potential consequences of a failure to pursue CCS technology. Jim Watson, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said: “The decision to cancel the £1bn CCS demonstration programme carries large risks. In the absence of a new plan for CCS, the UK is effectively outsourcing demonstration and commercialisation to other countries. This was the only significant large-scale demonstration programme in the EU, and one of a handful worldwide.” While CCS is currently expensive, he added, investing in CCS would be a way to bring down costs. “Given that the government wishes to replace coal with gas, significant CCS deployment will be essential - otherwise, gas demand is likely to have to fall sharply from the mid-2020s.”  A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: “We haven’t closed the door to CCS technology in the UK, but as part of our ongoing work to get Britain’s finances back on track, we have had to take difficult decisions to control government spending.  “CCS should come down in cost and we are considering the role that it could play in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK. We are committed to meeting our climate change targets in a way that is affordable and provides secure energy to our families and businesses.”"
"The world’s run of record-breaking hottest years is extremely unlikely to have happened without the global warming caused by human activities, according to new calculations. Thirteen of the 15 hottest years in the 150-year-long record occurred between 2000-14 and the researchers found there is a just a 0.01% chance that this happened due to natural variations in the planet’s climate. 2015 was revealed to have smashed all earlier records on Wednesday, after the new study had been completed, meaning the odds that the record run of heat is a fluke are now even lower. “Natural climate variations just can’t explain the observed recent global heat records, but manmade global warming can,” said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the research team. He said the record heat brought substantial impacts: “It has led to unprecedented local heatwaves across the world, sadly resulting in loss of life and aggravating droughts and wildfires. The risk of heat extremes has been multiplied due to our interference with the Earth system, as our analysis shows.” The UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed on Monday that the global average surface temperature in 2015 shattered all previous records and said 15 of the 16 hottest years on record have all occurred since 2000. “We have reached for the first time the threshold of 1C above pre-industrial temperatures. It is a sobering moment in the history of our planet,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas.  The new research by Rahmstorf and colleagues, published in the journal Scientific Reports, is based on a statistical analysis that combines real-world measurements with comprehensive computer simulations of the climate system. This allowed natural climate variability to be better separated from human-caused climate change. The results did not vary significantly when UK Met Office temperature data was used instead of Nasa data. The research was prompted by earlier claims that the run of record-breaking years was vanishing unlikely, a one in 650m shot, according to one report. However, the average global surface temperature of the planet each year is influenced by the warmth of the previous year, meaning that a record broken one year is not independent of the year before. The UK Met Office expects 2016 to break the record set in 2015, partly because of the continuing El Niño weather phenomenon. “Natural climate variability causes temperatures to wax and wane over a period of several years, rather than varying erratically from one year to the next,” said Prof Michael Mann at Penn State university in the US, who led the new study. “That makes it more challenging to accurately assess the likelihood of temperature records. Given the press interest, it seemed important to do this right, and address the interesting and worthwhile question of how unlikely it is that the recent run of record temperatures might have arisen by chance alone.” The study concludes: “While considerably greater than cited in some media reports, the odds are low enough to suggest that recent observed runs of record temperatures are extremely unlikely to have occurred in the absence of human-caused global warming.” In 2013, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded with 95% certainty that humans are the main cause of global warming."
"On Wednesday the United Nations urged global business leaders to double investment in wind and solar energy to $600bn (£400bn) a year by 2020. The announcement comes one month after the Paris climate agreement, where nearly 200 countries agreed to dramatically cut emissions. This week UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon urged business leaders to act decisively to hasten the transition away from the fossil fuel economy – or they would put the historic accord in jeopardy. But even if business leaders do reach this ambitious target, it only marks the start of the investment needed to meet the agreed 1.5 degree target. The International Energy Agency has estimated that to hit this taget the world will need to spend more than $16trn (£10.55trn) over the next 15 years, to cover the costs of replacing coal and gas-fired power stations with emissions-free sources of energy such as wind, solar and nuclear as well as the costs for improving existing energy efficiency in homes and businesses. So who’s going to foot the bill? What can developing countries do to help ensure we reach the 1.5 degree target? How can markets be used to promote private-sector solutions to climate change? And what can be done to create effective alliances to deliver the ambition of the Paris agreement?  Join an expert panel on Thursday 4 February, 1-3pm GMT, to discuss these questions and more.

"The supreme court hit the pause button on Barack Obama’s plans to cut climate pollution from power plants, injecting new uncertainty into the viability of Obama’s climate plan once he leaves office in 2017. But that will not bring back coal from the brink, and it may not stop some states and power companies from moving ahead on their own to clean up the US electrical grid. A day after the supreme court’s 5-4 ruling to halt the Environmental Protection Agency rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants, the White House dared to describe the decision as little more than “a bump in the road”.   Tuesday’s decision puts a temporary freeze on Obama’s signature climate policy: a plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants 32% on 2005 levels by 2030.  But the EPA will keep on working with states that decide to go ahead with their plans and “the administration will continue to take aggressive steps to make forward progress to reduce carbon emissions”, the White House said on Tuesday. The White House said the rule, though aimed at the biggest single source of US emissions, was part of a suite of climate measures. “We’re going to continue to take aggressive steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” said White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz, pointing to stricter emissions standards for cars, trucks and aircraft, as well as the long-term extension of renewable energy tax credits. Those credits, he said, will have a larger impact on emissions than the clean power plant law. More than 30 states were actively working to comply with the EPA rules, including Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia, according to the Ceres sustainable business network. A number of major utilities, including American Electric Power in Ohio, Xcel in Minnesota and DTE in Michigan were also working to cut emissions, Ceres said.  The governors of California, Colorado and New York reaffirmed they would push ahead on their climate action plans. Jerry Brown, California’s governor, accused the justices of being “tone-deaf”. “This arbitrary roadblock does incalculable damage and undermines America’s climate leadership,” Brown said. “But make no mistake, this won’t stop California from continuing to do its part under the Clean Power Plan.”  Andrew Cuomo, New York’s governor, also said his state would move forward on its climate plan. “New York State remains committed to moving forward with our own actions to protect the environment and the public health,” he said in a statement. “But this issue requires a global response – and the Clean Power Plan is crucial to ensuring a cleaner, greener, and safer future for all.” Fitch, the major credit rating service, also said that some power companies and states had already started to move funds to clean energy, in anticipation of the rules. “Fitch has assumed compliance by states in its longer-term sector outlook,” the ratings service said. “The clean power plan had already begun to influence the business strategies and capital expenditures across the US power sector, and it is unclear how the industry participants would react to the delay induced by the stay.” Fitch said there were now doubts about whether the EPA could keep to a schedule that required states to put forward plans for power plants by September. However, Vicki Arroyo, who heads the Georgetown Climate Center, noted that the judges had refrained from extending the timeline in their decision on Tuesday.  “Since the court declined to extend the actual (later) compliance deadlines, it is possible that states will still be held to a similar timeline for compliance,” she said.  But she acknowledged that any slippage in the timeline increased the risk that a Republican president could stall the regulations – if the party takes the White House in November. “Obviously that does get us close to the Presidential election and it’s possible that a future Administration might try to slow-walk any changes required or not continue to defend it – to your question on timing, though I sincerely hope that does not happen,” she said in an email.  As you know, the Supreme Court has been clear in three separate cases now that the EPA has the authority and responsibility to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act – with the AEP v CT case pointing to the 111 approach with states in particular as an alternative to that nuisance suit. We’re optimistic that much if not all of the rule will be upheld on the merits. Administration officials told reporters in a conference call they remained confident in the EPA’s strong track record of winning environmental lawsuits brought by industry. When the power plant rule gets a full review by the court later this year, the White House expects to win. “We do remain confident that we’re going to prevail on the merits when the clean power plant rule gets its full day in court,” said Schultz. Officials also noted that other air pollution rules – which have a knock-on effect on carbon emissions – remained in effect, and that states were moving ahead on policies promoting renewable energy. California, which has the most aggressive plan, has committed to obtain 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Such measures being rolled out in other states were bound to push more coal-fired power plants out of service, experts said. Other states – and utility companies – were pushing ahead to clean up their fleets of power plants, clean energy industry groups said. “This is not the end of the story,” Gregory Wetstone, chief executive officer of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said. “Public and private sector momentum behind the shift to lower carbon power generation will continue.” Meanwhile, campaign groups said a historic transition away from coal-fired power plants was already occurring – with or without the EPA rules. “The shift in the electricity from coal and natural gas towards clean power is ongoing, and it doesn’t depend on the clean power plan,” Joanne Spalding, the Sierra Club’s chief climate counsel. “It is actually following the trends in the electricity sector. It is not setting them. There is no reason for that to slow down even though the rule is stayed.” Coal made up just over a third of US electricity generation last year – the lowest on record and in line with EPA forecasts. In November alone coal use fell further, making up only 29% of the power mix, according to government data. That was well on its way to the EPA projections for 2030, the target date of the clean power plant rules. The agency has projected that coal would account for just 27% of US power generation by 2030. Even so, some leading Democrats admitted the court decision had injected an element of doubt into the future of the power plant rules once Obama leaves the White House in 2017. Some of the states and industry groups suing the EPA also said they saw the decision for a stay as an indication they would eventually succeed in overturning the rules. Paul Ryan, the US House speaker, called the ruling “a victory for the American people and our economy”. “This rule should be struck down permanently before coal country is destroyed completely, and American consumers are consigned to higher energy prices,” he said in a statement. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said the supreme court decision was “an unfortunate setback” and completely unexpected. “This was an especially stunning move by the supreme court given just weeks ago the DC circuit court of appeals categorically rejected a halt of the clean power plan.”"
"Fiji has become the first country in the world to formally approve the UN climate deal agreed by 195 nations in Paris in December. The island nation’s parliament unanimously agreed to ratify the Paris agreement on Friday, according to local news reports.  The motion was proposed by the country’s attorney general, Aiyaz Sayed Khaiyum. He told parliament that it would need to ratify the treaty ahead of a signing ceremony in April in New York, where Fiji’s prime minister, Voreqe Bainimarama, will formally sign the document on behalf of the country. He said tackling climate change was a major priority for the archipelago, which could face wide-scale flooding, fiercer tropical storms, and depleting fish stocks as a result of the world’s changing climate. The process marks the beginning of an expected wave of ratification votes as other countries prepare for their attendance at the New York ceremony. In order to formally take effect, the Paris agreement needs at least 55 countries, representing at least 55% of the world’s climate emissions, to ratify the treaty. Observers are confident the milestone can be passed in time for the New York event, given all the world’s major economies expressed full support for the Paris agreement at last year’s summit in the French capital. Under its national climate action plan, Fiji pledged to generate 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. It also promised to cut overall emissions from its energy sector by 30% by 2030 compared to business-as-usual, conditional on it receiving climate finance from industrialised nations.  "
"The supreme court agreed to block Barack Obama’s clean power plan on Tuesday, raising fears that the centrepiece of his climate change plan could be overturned. The unexpected decision creates instant uncertainty about the future of Obama’s climate plan and the historic global agreement to fight climate change reached in Paris last December.  The White House registered its immediate disapproval, and said in a statement that the administration would continue taking “aggressive steps” to reduce climate pollution. “We disagree with the supreme court’s decision,” the White House said. But officials told reporters in a conference call that they remained confident this was a “bump in the road”, and that the plan would prevail. The officials also said Obama had been briefed and would speak on the decisions soon. The surprising vote by the justices put a temporary freeze on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants until the Washington DC circuit court of appeals hears challenges from 29, mainly Republican-led states, and dozens of corporations and industry groups. Arguments are scheduled for 2 June.  The 5-4 decision for a stay  came as a shock to the EPA and environmental campaign groups, and was widely seen as a sign that opponents of the power plant rules have made a strong argument against the plan. “We’re disappointed the rule has been stayed, but you can’t stay climate change and you can’t stay climate action,” said Melissa Harrison, an EPA spokeswoman. “We believe strongly in this rule and we will continue working with our partners to address carbon pollution.” Margie Alt, the director of Environment America, said in a statement: “This decision is a huge loss for our kids’ future and for all Americans who care about the health of our planet, and a huge win for the polluters and the deniers.” She added that she hoped it would only be a temporary setback. “It is not what we had hoped for,” Joanne Spalding, senior climate counsel for the Sierra Club, said. “We are disappointed.” Opponents of the EPA rules – who had described the clean power plan as a “war on coal” – said the stay was an indication the carbon-cutting regulations would eventually be overturned. West Virginia, one of the states leading the legal challenge, said it was thrilled at the outcome. “Make no mistake – this is a great victory for West Virginia,” Patrick Morrisey, the state’s attorney general, said in a statement.  The main lobby group for the coal industry claimed the decision indicated the supreme court was leaning in their favor on the broader legal challenge. “We are pleased the supreme court took this unprecedented step to protect the states from further economic harm while the courts are deciding whether the administration’s power plan is unlawful and unconstitutional,” said Mike Duncan, president of Americans for Clean Coal Electricity. “The stay is a signal the supreme court has serious concerns with the power plan. We’re optimistic the power plan will ultimately be rejected.” Republicans in Congress claimed the stay was a rebuke to Obama’s use of his executive powers to fight climate change, in the absence of any legislative efforts. “Today’s decision by the Supreme Court is an important step toward reining in the Obama administration’s unprecedented abuse of executive power,” Deb Fischer, Republican Senator from Nebraska, said in a statement. The plan was a linchpin of Obama’s climate agenda and was critical to the administration’s efforts to persuade nearly 200 countries to rally around the Paris agreement. The rules were the first ever cutting climate pollution from power plants – the single largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the US. They called for reducing carbon emissions from power plants by about one-third by 2030. Obama and US officials have been adamant in their discussions with world leaders that the power plant rules would withstand legal challenges, and would come into force even if a Republican wins the White House next November. The United Nations had invited world leaders to a signing ceremony on 22 April to finalize the agreement, and spur further action to cut emissions. White House officials said last month that they expected to unveil further climate actions in the lead-up to the ceremony.  Campaign groups insisted that the reasons for the stay would have little to no bearing on the case itself – and expressed confidence that the EPA ultimately would prevail. “The bottom line is that they still need to look closely at the case,” Spalding said. Under the schedule set out by the EPA when it unveiled the rules last summer, states had until September to submit their plans for cutting emissions from power plants. Many of the states suing the EPA had been working on their plans.  But that schedule was now put in doubt by Tuesday’s decision – which raises the prospect that states may not finish their plans before Obama leaves the White House. What happens next is that states can call pause on that work while the lower court considers arguments about the EPA’s authority to limit carbon pollution from power plants.  White House officials said the plan had been constructed to allow for such legal delays. States do not have to submit their final plans until 2018, and the rules do not come into force until 2022. “That glide path gives states and utilities ample time to get their plans in place, and that continues to be the case notwithstanding the decision today,” the officials said in the conference call.  But the decision was nevertheless a blow to the administration’s repeated claims that the rules were at little risk from the courts. Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator, had frequently expressed confidence that the EPA could beat back any legal challenge, citing previous supreme court decisions upholding the agency’s authority to cut carbon emissions. The EPA had also chalked up a number of other legal victories against industry groups to block air pollution and other rules. But the stay had shaken some of that confidence, and injected uncertainty into the energy transformation that was already taking place on the ground – even in the absence of the power plant rules. America’s use of coal for electricity fell to an all-time low last year, and about 5% of coal-fired power plants were shut down. Most of that electricity was replaced with fracked natural gas, but wind and solar energy was also coming onto the grid. “Today’s supreme court decision is a major setback,” said Gregory Wetstone, the president of the American Council on Renewable Energy. “But this is not the end of the story ... There is every reason to anticipate that, in the end, the court will affirm that the Clean Air Act does indeed provide authority to address the greenhouse emissions that are changing the global climate.”"
"Homes and businesses should continue to be built on flood plains across the UK despite the increasing risks, according to government advisers on climate change. Lord Krebs, the government’s statutory adviser on adapting to the effects of global warming, told an influential committee of MPs on Wednesday that although recent flooding has caused houses and other buildings to be inundated, property could continue to be constructed on flood plains. He said that the attendant risks and the possible devastation would have to be made clear to households, local government and developers.  The wettest ever December in the UK at the end of last year saw 16,000 properties hit by flooding, while more than 75,000 lost electricity and most northern and western parts of the UK registered more than double the average rainfall. Some uplands registered three times their average. The committee on climate change was set up under the Climate Change Act to advise governments on meeting targets on greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the effects of global warming. Flood plains are often more attractive to developers because they tend to be flat and therefore easy to build on and close to other amenities such as transport and utilities networks. The UK is facing an acute housing crisis with hundreds of thousands of new dwellings needed each year to keep pace with the nation’s housing needs. But while previous reports by the committee have warned of the dangers of building on flood plains, Krebs said that it should be possible to do so as long as property owners were made aware of the risks. It is not known the effect such a policy would have on insurance, as most of the UK’s properties are supposed to be automatically protected from flood risk under a system known as Flood Re, an arrangement between the government and the insurance industry. This replaced a previous and unwritten agreement whereby all homes were guaranteed flood insurance by the industry. Flooding is likely to become more common in the UK, the committee said, even if efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are effective, because of the effects of climate change. The average national rainfall is no longer a good guide to the likely effects because instances of localised but more intense rainfall are becoming more common – an effect of climate change that has been predicted by researchers including the Met Office. On Wednesday MPs on the environmental audit committee also asked whether the Environment Agency’s responsibilities for overseeing flooding risk in the UK should be devolved to a new body. However, the complexities of devolving such responsibility – along with problems such as drought and the environmental protection of waterways – mean it is unlikely to be discussed in the short term. Separately, a group of former high-ranking officials from UK governmental environment bodies said that a UK exit from the EU would lead to a much worse situation in terms of environmental protection in the UK."
" Let’s call it the non-denial denial. Some Republican presidential candidates are beginning to peer out from behind the wall of climate denial that has defined the party as long as Barack Obama has been in the White House. Finally, it seems, the most open expressions of climate denial – such as dismissing long-established scientific fact – may be seen as a bit retrograde, and possibly embarrassing, even by some who are looking for votes from an increasingly rightwing Republican party. In response to a rare question about climate change in Thursday night’s Republican debate, Marco Rubio offered up an answer that was rarer still in the 2016 campaign. He did not reduce climate change to a punchline or bash the science underlying climate change, as Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have been doing throughout the primary.   Rubio spoke instead about policies for fighting climate change – in his case his opposition to cap and trade in his home state of Florida. “When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any ‘cap and trade’ in the United States,” the Florida senator said. Jeb Bush, Rubio’s fellow Floridian, also steered clear of open climate denial, telling a gathering in New Hampshire on Saturday that he opposed federal government policies to deal with global warming.  “The market will work faster. There’s someone in a garage somewhere, parochially I hope it’s in Miami, that’s going to have a clue, to have an answer to this,” Bush said. The fact that both candidates were operating under the assumption that climate change even exists might seem like progress of a sort. As Obama noted last month, the Republican party is the only major party in the advanced world that denies climate change. In many cases, they still are. In the undercard debate on Thursday night, Carly Fiorina dismissed climate change as a silly Democratic party distraction from real security threats. Rubio and Bush openly expressed doubt about the existence of manmade climate change earlier in the campaign. Bush butted heads with the pope. Rubio made his now infamous remark that “America is not a planet”. But there are signs of a shift. The Republican-dominated Congress voted by significant margins in December to extend tax credits for wind and solar power, a decision expected to lead to a boom in renewable energy. This week Republicans and Democrats joined forces on an energy reform bill, the first such bipartisan measure in more than eight years. The White House believes the combination of constant ridicule from Obama and other Democratic leaders and “facts on the ground”, in the form of the clean power plan and other policies enacted through the use of executive authority, will force the next president to deal with climate change, even if a Republican wins the November election.  “The next president will not be inclined to be able to [scrap the plan] whether he or she wants to change it,” Denis McDonough, Obama’s chief of staff, told a forum celebrating the Pulitzer Prizes at the Washington Post on Friday. But mere acknowledgement of the existence of climate change is not enough. Neither Rubio nor Bush came forward to say what they would do to fight climate change. Their response to a gathering danger acknowledged by the Pentagon, 196 world leaders at the Paris climate summit and, yes, scientists, was merely to express opposition to the Democratic policy prescriptions already out there. Do they have no policy ideas? Would they leave climate solutions entirely to the market? That’s a huge oversight. And given the abundance of evidence all around us about the dangers of climate change – extreme sea level rise in the Bush and Rubio home state of Florida, the public health emergency of the Zika virus, the climate-fuelled drought in California and super-sized blizzards in the north-east, just to name a few examples – such oversight by candidates is really just another kind of denial."
"All appointed board members of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency have had their terms expire and have not been replaced, leaving it governed by the secretary of the Department of the Environment, Guardian Australia has learned.  The same thing happened in 2014 while Tony Abbott was prime minister, and the move has now been criticised as an attempt by the Turnbull government to remove the independence of the agency. According to legislation, the board must consist of the secretary of the Department of the Environment and up to six others appointed by the minister. The agency can operate with the secretary being the only board member, since it reaches quorum when a majority of the board members are present, which now occurs with one. Parliament sits for the first time in 2016 on Tuesday, with bills abolishing both the renewable energy agency (Arena) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation still before parliament, despite having been rejected by the Senate. Signs indicate the Turnbull government intends to keep them. Arena is tasked with investing in emerging renewable energy technologies, while the CEFC invests in commercially viable renewable energy technologies. Disruption in the government’s handling of renewables has been blamed for a huge drop in clean energy investment in Australia. If Arena is not abolished before July, it is set to receive almost $57m from the commonwealth and then almost $500m the following year.   The agency would not answer any questions about the matter and instead referred Guardian Australia to the Australian government boards website, which shows all positions are vacant. The last three directors had their terms expire on 16 January. “Everyone has been assuming with the change of leader, and a Senate that wouldn’t repeal it, that they were going to hang on to Arena,” said Tom Swann from the Australia Institute. “So given that, it’s pretty strange that they’ve let the board lapse and it raises questions about the future of Arena.” The Greens environment spokeswoman, Larissa Waters, told Guardian Australia the move was an attempt to remove the agency’s independence. “The Senate won’t let the Liberals destroy this innovative, job-creating organisation, and so the Liberals are arrogantly trying to cut off its independence and expertise,” she said.  “Major proposals come to Arena’s board for decision and having only a time-poor department secretary on the board is bad due diligence and a wasted opportunity for injecting high-level, diverse expertise,” Waters said. Swann said the agency’s empty board and the bills abolishing it and the CEFC still being before parliament continue to discourage the renewable energy industry. “Given that we’ve had such a huge drop-off of renewable energy [investment] in Australia, the last thing we need is confusing signals,” he said. The chief executive of the Solar Council, John Grimes agreed the bills were bad for his industry and called on the government to remove them. “If Malcolm Turnbull doesn’t act on this then people will start to think he’s just another Tony Abbott,” Grimes said.  Waters said the bills were unlikely to be debated by parliament, but were being kept to keep peace within the Liberal party. “It’s duplicitous for the prime minister to talk up innovation, economic diversification and the achievements of Arena and CEFC, while keeping both of these cutting-edge agencies on the chopping block, presumably to placate climate-sceptic colleagues and donors,” she said. “Given the Senate’s opposition to passing either abolition bill, listing them for debate sends an unnecessary and damaging investment message to the clean energy sector,” Waters said. Labor environment spokesperson, Mark Butler told Guardian Australia: “The fact that Arena and the CEFC are still on the chopping block shows that the Liberals’ attacks on renewables hasn’t stopped under Malcolm Turnbull. Greg Hunt has confirmed that these two agencies will remain in the Turnbull Liberal government’s sites.” A spokesman for the environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the government’s policy was still to abolish the two bodies, but said “there is little prospect of support in the Senate”. He said the new Office of Climate Change and Renewables Innovation, which was being established inside the Department of the Environment, “will bring a fresh focus to the role of innovation in supporting emerging renewable and low emissions technologies that will drive down emissions”."
"Volkswagen has postponed the release of its financial results and annual meeting with shareholders because of the diesel emissions scandal. The German carmaker said it was still trying to establish the cost of the emissions affair, which could run into tens of billions of euros.  The company has admitted installing defeat devices in 11m vehicles to cheat diesel emissions tests. As a result, it faces the prospect of having to pay out fines and compensation to customers. VW had been due to post results on 10 March and hold its annual meeting on 21 April. The fallout from the scandal is also hurting sales of the company’s cars. Sales of new VW-branded vehicles fell 14% year on year in the UK last month, reducing its market share in a country that has previously been one of the carmarker’s most successful markets. Other brands owned by VW were also affected. Seat car sales fell 25%, while Skoda sales were down 2.4%. Audi sales, however, increased by 1.4%. Group sales declined despite the overall new car market enjoying its strongest performance in January since 2005. VW is yet to confirm a new date for releasing the results, but said in a statement: “Volkswagen will set a new date for the publication of the annual accounts for fiscal year 2015 due to remaining open questions and the resulting valuation calculations relating to the diesel emissions issue.  “In this regard, Volkswagen will achieve the best possible transparent and reliable outcome for its shareholders and stakeholders.”"

"If you’re like me, you’ve spent much of the past two weeks listening to David Bowie songs. (Bowie died on 10 January, in case you’re just now waking up from a very long nap. If so: good job!) In Five Years, the first song on his most famous album, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, he imagines what it would be like to learn that the world was ending.  It’s one my favorite songs of his, and I’ve listened to it often these past weeks. But I can’t relate to the sentiment, exactly, because Tuesday, the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced, using the “Doomsday Clock” as an indicator, that as far as they can tell, the world is no closer to ending than it was last year – though it’s also no farther away.  The SSBBAS was started in 1945 by scientists involved with the Manhattan Project with the express intent of gauging, and reporting, just how close mankind was to wiping itself out with nuclear weapons (and has since added “the changing energy landscape, climate change and emerging technologies,” to its list of concerns). Midnight on the Doomsday Clock, as you might have guessed, means the end of the world. We were three minutes to midnight last year and that’s where we remain. It’s not as close as we’ve ever been – the clock struck two back in 1953, when the US and Russia were both testing Hydrogen bombs – but certainly too close for comfort. There’s a big part of me, though, that says, Who cares? (Likely a reaction that many of you are having to reading this very article!) All those years after taking a first philosophy class and reading Nietzsche and having it blow your mind and then finding out that he really wasn’t so terrific after all, and all that listening to the Doors and later learning the same about them, the nihilist argument carries. So what if the world is ending? Is that really so bad?  The world disappoints us in so many ways. People are stupid and cruel and life is full of pain and misery. We kill each other and we’re killing the planet we live on. Would it really be a net negative for everything to come to a full, abrupt stop?  This week I stepped into a puddle of slush that was deeper than it looked, and I felt the icy slush-water crest the top of my boot and thought, No, that wouldn’t be bad at all. In fact, it would preferable to the alternative. As the cold, wet liquid seeped down and soaked my sock, it occurred to me that it might even be something to celebrate. But other days, I focus on how good it feels to put a nice warm new sock after peeling off a wet, cold one. Everything changes, and sometimes for the better. What else is there to do with our time except to try our best to enjoy it?  That points towards hedonism when you’re young: have a second helping of pie and a third refill of your drink. But then when you get older, when you have a kid or kids, if you do that, it becomes something different. I did that and it became different for me, at least. Now the end of the world seems a little sadder. And my attitude about it is more one of, Let me not let this life-sustaining environment end on my watch. Did you ever read Cormac McCarthy’s novel The Road? It’s really good. I often think it’s the best novel written this century. (It came out in 2006.) If you have not read it, and you still plan to do so, click this silly article off your screen now and go pick up the book instead, because I’m about to talk about the end. (Of the book, I mean. I realize we’re already talking about the end of everything else.) The Road is a post-apocalyptic novel that tells the story of a father wandering the remains of the American east coast, trying to keep his son alive while most of society has descended into rape and cannibalism and human farming. The language is extremely terse in describing an ash-blanketed black-and-white world. I don’t think there’s any mention of color at all through the first 286 pages of the book. (Someone can surely check me and correct me on that, but I’ve looked and not found any.) The dad dies in the end, but the kid is found by another family of survivors and then the story zooms backwards in time, centuries, eons, who knows how far back? And we find this: Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens were they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery. Those are the last words in the book. People often say The Road is super-depressing, but I find great joy in it. I’m flooded with a sense of peace when I read those last words. Because to me it doesn’t seem like we’re zooming backwards in time; we may well be zooming forward.  Who knows what will come as we come closer and closer to destroying ourselves and rendering our planet uninhabitable? Who knows what will happen after the clock ticks midnight? Maybe time will go on. Maybe people will have moved on to space stations by then. Or Mars. Who knows what they’ll grow there? Who knows what they’ll find. Maybe brook trout. That would be a treat."
"On December 12, the 21st annual meeting of the world’s climate negotiators closed with adoption of the Paris Agreement. The task agreed by consensus among 195 nations is clear, ambitious, and complex: re-engineer the infrastructure of the global economy to eliminate practices that destabilize Earth’s climate system, while ensuring ongoing and expanded prosperity for all people everywhere. That the task is difficult should not put us back on our heels. As we move into new territory, we will face new obstacles. This is how we learn, how we know if we are up to the challenge, how we know which adjustments to make, and how we succeed in crossing an unknown ocean.  For centuries, explorers have sought to navigate the Northwest Passage—a shortcut from Europe to Asia that wouldn’t require sailing around the southern extremes of Africa or South America. For much of that time, the idea was something between a flight of fancy and a dangerously unapproachable challenge. Many have died making the attempt. Twenty-one years ago, in the summer of 1994, a 57-foot fiberglass sailboat named Cloud Nine set sail, with captain Roger Swanson at the helm. Cloud Nine carried a crew of six, who were attempting to transit the fabled Northwest Passage from east to west. There was a tremendous amount of pack ice choking off all the routes through the Passage that summer, and the crew of Cloud Nine was forced to abandon the voyage and retreat out of the Arctic. Thirteen years later, in the summer of 2007, Cloud Nine returned to the Arctic for another east-to-west attempt. This time around, the crew of six discovered little to no ice in the Northwest Passage. To the astonishment of those on board and of those watching their transit, the nearly 7000-mile voyage took only 73 days, and Cloud Nine never touched one piece of ice. The Passage was wide open and completely ice-free. Cloud Nine was the first American vessel in history to complete the east-west transit of the Northwest Passage. Members of the crew acknowledged they got an assist from a changing Arctic, characterized by far less ice. The reliable deep cold of the polar regions is part of what gives us a stable climate system: with extreme cold at the poles, the warmer climate bands of lower latitudes are more stable and defined. That defined differentiation of climate bands keeps the Polar Vortex swirling in the Arctic. Cold reinforces cold, which keeps the climate bands steady. As the Arctic warms, the warmer air mixes more readily with the climate of lower latitudes, and the Polar Vortex “bleeds” into those other latitudes, bringing deep Arctic winter to more temperate regions. This is climate destabilization. When Cloud Nine first ventured into the Arctic in 1994, there was limited computer and GPS technology and no satellite communication. By the time the pioneering vessel returned to the Arctic in 2007, however, the technology had changed. Through the Internet, it has become possible to study records of the Arctic’s ice extent, using photos and data mapping from satellites launched in the late 1970s. A clear downward trend was beginning to emerge by 2007. In the 13 short years between those two sailing expeditions to the far north, there had been a forty-percent loss of summer sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. That is a 40% loss of our North Polar ice cap. This change is happening outside of Earth’s natural and geological cycles. Human activity is having a profound and sudden impact on our planetary climate systems and the Arctic is experiencing the most rapid and visible change. We stand at the dawn of a new age of exploration. We have sailed the oceans and photographed the Earth from space. Now, we see entire regions changing so quickly, our exploration of the physical world is becoming an exploration of how Earth’s life-support systems work, where they are vulnerable, and what our choices have to do with it. Our civilization has been designed by human beings. The design we have inherited is generating this unprecedented global challenge. How we respond requires people to work together politically. The halls of power often resemble the Arctic—a sparsely populated remote vastness full of peril, where success is almost out of the question. It requires real moral courage to stand up and to do the work of an engaged citizen. While staying on familiar shores is comfortable, the political challenge of getting all of this right means all of us are called to venture out. Some of us go and speak to our lawmakers. Others must build new civic spaces for shared decision-making. Even in nations transitioning from conflict to a new civil state, individuals can steer events by their presence, by giving voice to their conscience, by learning from others, and by staying engaged over time. We have to be willing to venture into that territory that lies beyond common practice and expertise, learn as we go and begin to play an active role in shaping how we care for what Pope Francis reminds us is “our common home”. We are all crew on a small vessel, sailing into new waters. We are climate explorers with the capacity to be spendthrifts or stewards; we can waste or rescue the natural systems that give us life as we know it. Engaged citizens working as good stewards are defenders of life. We now know that a passive response to climate disruption is far more costly than active engagement. We cannot afford to delay any longer. We cannot afford time-consuming indulgences like pessimism or cynical naysaying. Despair is not allowed on this small boat. The world gathered in Paris—defying the threat of another violent attack—in defense of life. The terms are set for those daring souls who will engage in redesigning our politics, our industry, and our economics. Safe passage will require imagination, collaboration, and perseverance. Welcome to the new age of exploration. Joseph Robertson is Global Strategy Director for the nonpartisan nonprofit organization Citizens’ Climate Lobby. David Thoreson is a documentary photographer and the first American to sail the Northwest Passage in both directions."
"The index that Greg Hunt used to defend Australia’s record on climate change has placed the country lower in its rankings, leaving only Saudi Arabia with a worse ranking among wealthy nations in some categories. Yale’s environmental performance index ranks countries’ performance in protecting human health and ecosystems, and looks at nine areas including air quality, climate and energy, forests and water resources. When Australia’s climate change policies were questioned in November, the environment minister relied on the index to defend its record. “The Yale environment performance index, the most credible, scientifically based, hard data-based analysis in the world, ranks Australia number three of 178 countries in terms of our environmental performance,” he told ABC’s 730. The index’s report, released this week, shows Australia has dropped 10 places overall, leaving it at 13 out of 180 countries examined.   It performed worst in the climate and energy category. It was ranked 150th for its trend in carbon emissions each kilowatt hour, leaving only Saudi Arabia behind among wealthy nations. Overall in the climate and energy category, Australia was ranked 82nd. While global CO2 emissions appear to have dropped in 2015 for the first time during a period of economic growth, Australia’s emissions have continued to grow.  Mark Butler, Labor’s spokesman on the environment, told Fairfax Media: “The Yale report states that over the last decade ‘nearly every country has improved it’s [index] score’ – every country, that is, except Australia … The Turnbull government is taking Australia backwards at a shocking pace.” Hunt’s office has been contacted for comment."

"The human animal knows that it is born to age and die. Together with language, this knowledge is what separates us from all other species. Yet, until the 18th century, not even Aristotle, who speculated about most things, actually considered the possibility of extinction. This is all the more surprising because “the end of the world” is an archetypal theme with a sonorous label – eschatology – that morphs in popular culture into many doomsday scenarios, from global warming to the third world war. Citizens of the 21st century now face a proliferating menu of possible future dooms. Elizabeth Kolbert’s The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History is both a highly intelligent expression of this genre and also supremely well executed and entertaining. Her book, which follows her global warming report Field Notes from a Catastrophe (2006), is already set to become a contemporary classic, and an excellent place to start this new series of landmark nonfiction titles in the English language. On the opening page of her investigation into the future of our planet, Kolbert quotes the great biologist EO Wilson: “If there is danger in the human trajectory, it is not so much in the survival of our own species as in the fulfilment of the ultimate irony of organic evolution: that in the instant of achieving self-understanding through the mind of man, life has doomed its most beautiful creations.” This warning note sets the mood for the 13 chapters that follow, an urgent contemporary report on “the sixth extinction”. Kolbert’s perspective is both awe-inspiring and fearsome, but utterly engrossing, as you’d expect from a book whose premise is “we’re all doomed”. During the past half billion years, she tells us, there have been five mass extinctions on Earth, when “the planet has undergone change so wrenching that the diversity of life has plummeted”. The history of these catastrophic events, notes Kolbert, tends to be recaptured just as humanity comes to realise that it is about to cause another one. Sure enough, in our postmillennial century, she finds that scientists around the world are now monitoring the next mass extinction, possibly the biggest devastation since an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs. With this difference: the impending cataclysm is… us. Part of Kolbert’s concern is to educate the modern reader in the history of mass extinction, a comparatively recent idea In 13 emblematic episodes, exquisitely narrated, Kolbert, a magazine journalist with the New Yorker, explores the possibility of our impending doom through the lives of, for instance, the Panamanian golden frog, the Sumatran rhino and the black-faced honeycreeper of Maui, “the most beautiful bird in the world”. Part of Kolbert’s concern is to educate the modern reader in the history of mass extinction. While the concept, as she puts it, “may be the first scientific idea that kids have to grapple with”, as they play with their toy dinosaurs, Kolbert instructs that, actually, it’s a comparatively recent idea that dates to Enlightenment France. Until this moment in the western intellectual tradition, not even Aristotle (in his 10-volume History of Animals) had so much as considered the possibility that animals had a past. Later, in Roman times, Pliny’s Natural History includes descriptions of animals that are real, or fabulous, but none that are extinct. The word “fossil” was used to describe anything dug from the ground, as in “fossil fuel”. Even Carl Linnaeus, who pioneered his system of binomial nomenclature in the mid-18th century, catalogued only one kind of animal – those that exist. It was the discovery of some American mastodon bones in what is now Ohio, during the early 18th century – an unintended consequence of French colonial exploration – that subsequently inspired Georges Cuvier, an anatomist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, to ask the essential question: “What was this primitive Earth? … And what revolution was able to wipe it out?” Revolutionary France celebrated the rights of man. Cuvier was never going to recognise the truth about some later extinctions: that Homo sapiens is the problem, not the solution. Addressing the imminent next catastrophe with a certain grim relish, Kolbert spells out the results of her investigations: “One-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater molluscs, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed towards oblivion,” she declares, during the course of her odyssey through our natural world and its human-inspired devastation. Kolbert’s indictment of humanity is remorseless, and compelling: “The losses are occurring all over: in the South Pacific, in the North Atlantic, in the Arctic and in the Sahel, in lakes and on islands, on mountaintops and in valleys.” Homo sapiens may have enjoyed brilliant success but we have done so at the expense of virtually every other species Readers of The Sixth Extinction will be unable to evade the conclusion that we do indeed find ourselves on the brink of a great catastrophe, one in which the agent involved is not an inanimate object (such as an asteroid) or a geophysical force (such as the extreme global warming disaster of 250m years ago) but a sentient creature: ourselves. Homo sapiens may have enjoyed brilliant success on Earth but we have done so at the expense of virtually every other species. We are, as the Observer’s Robin McKie has put it, “the neighbours from hell”. The Sixth Extinction ends in a windowless room at the Institute for Conservation Research in California known as the Frozen Zoo, the world’s largest collection of species on ice. This, suggests Kolbert, may be the slender thread on which life on Earth will depend in future. Who knows? She underlines her final message with a quotation from the Stanford ecologist Paul R Erhlich: “IN PUSHING OTHER SPECIES TO EXTINCTION, HUMANITY IS BUSY SAWING OFF THE LIMB ON WHICH IT PERCHES.” We have been warned. “The Sixth Extinction will continue to determine the course of life long after everything people have written and painted and built has been ground into dust and giant rats have – or have not – inherited the Earth.” EO Wilson: On Human Nature (1978)  Elizabeth Kolbert: Field Notes from a Catastrophe: A Frontline Report on Climate Change (2006) Yuval Noah Harari: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (2014)"
"The world’s largest palm oil processor and trader used the Davos gathering of business leaders as an opportunity to talk up progress on its efforts to tackle deforestation in the palm oil sector.  Singapore-headquartered Wilmar says it has made “significant progress” on a commitment it made two years ago to eliminate deforestation, exploitation and peatland development from its supply chain. This includes publishing a list of crude palm oil mill sources that supply its refineries, enabling greater transparency along the company’s supply chain.  However, campaigners and industry experts say the company is yet to prove that its suppliers are not responsible for clearing forests or abusing human rights. Glenn Hurowitz, senior fellow at the Centre for International Policy, who wrote an introductory commentary for Wilmar’s progress report, told the Guardian that being able to measure progress is key: “Among the large agribusiness companies, Wilmar is leading the way in many areas, from supplier engagement to transparency to rapidly responding to grievances filed by civil society ... But no company is providing comprehensive information about whether [its suppliers] are clearing forests or abusing human rights – the metrics that really matter.”  Even Wilmar’s chief sustainability officer Jeremy Goon points out that “much remains to be done, including the development of a clear means to measure and track the progress of sustainability commitments to assess its effectiveness in reducing actual deforestation”. The key sticking point according to NGOs such as Greenpeace and the Forest Peoples Programme is that Wilmar, which controls 45% of global palm oil trade, cannot prove that its suppliers are not responsible for ongoing deforestation. The palm oil supply chain is notoriously complex and lacking in transparency, but Greenpeace Indonesia campaigner Annisa Rahmawati believes the company should be making better progress on its commitments. “Wilmar promised that by the end of 2015 it would be able to show its palm oil suppliers were not destroying forests, developing on peatlands and were respecting human rights of communities and workers. This was the cornerstone of its policy, but now the company talks only of ‘aspirations’. That is simply not good enough,” says Rahmawati.  Wilmar’s 2013 commitment was a bold move but it didn’t happen without considerable pressure from what environment author and journalist Fred Pearce describes as “strenuous NGO campaigns” and an announcement by Unilever – one of Wilmar’s customers and the world’s largest purchaser of palm oil in 2012 – that it would be tracking its entire supply chain to ensure it met its promise to end its role in deforestation.  It’s this same pressure that environmental non-profit CDP believes will help companies realise their no deforestation pledges. In its latest report CDP points out that suppliers and buyers of key agricultural forest-risk commodities, including palm oil and soy, are coming under growing pressure to ensure their supply chains do not destroy forests. “That pressure is building from their consumers and their investors,” says CDP. In 2015, 298 investors with $19tn (£13.3tn) in assets under management requested that companies report data about forest risks through CDP, a 24% jump from the previous year. Hurowitz adds that Wilmar and other companies need to be absolutely clear to their suppliers that if they engage in deforestation or human rights abuses, they will lose access to global markets. “There’s been altogether too much ambiguity about consequences, which has only encouraged some rogue actors to think they can deforest first and apologise later,” he says. So what will help end the ongoing land grab claims and forest fires that engulfed south-east Asia towards the end of last year? Hurowitz believes that governments must step up and take deforestation seriously, although this doesn’t give companies carte blanche to carry on business as usual. “For the sake of their own commercial interests, the leading companies need to do more to make clear to governments that effective law enforcement is essential if the palm oil industry is to restore its damaged reputation. To accelerate progress and prevent another haze crisis, companies should join with civil society to support government efforts to hold anyone who destroys forests and peatlands legally accountable.” Both Hurowitz and Rahmawati cite the example of the soy moratorium in Brazil, which brought companies, government and NGOs together to prevent deforestation of the Amazon. “By working together, traders like Wilmar were able to help eradicate forest destruction for soya in the Brazilian Amazon,” says Rahmawati. "
"When the Green Climate Fund (GCF) was announced at COP16 in 2010, the intention was to give small, developing countries direct access to finance to protect themselves from climate change. Yet many of the smallest and most at-risk countries in the world now claim that they do not have the means to access these funds directly.  “It’s a paradox,” said Anote Tong, the president of Kiribati in December. “We need [the funds] the most but we don’t have the capacity to get it because we’re not accredited.” Tong added that the accreditation process involves so much bureaucracy it is a significant challenge for low-resourced governments.    Later, when told of Tong’s words by the Guardian, representatives of the governments of Tonga, the Comoros and Grenada all said they shared his concerns. The GCF, which became operational in 2015, is funded by developed countries and aims to assist developing countries with climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, such as early-warning systems for climate-related disasters.  For a country to directly access GCF finance, it must first nominate a “national designated authority” – usually an existing government department like the finance or environment ministry – which then nominates an institution for accreditation.  That institution is reviewed by the GCF’s accreditation panel, self-described as independent and technical. The nominated institutions include a variety of local, regional, public and private institutions such as Rwanda’s ministry of national resources or Namibia’s Environmental Investment Fund. The difficulty lies in demonstrating that these institutions comply with the GCF’s fiduciary and gender policy standards, and that they can apply the relevant environmental and social safeguards. These measures – to guard against corruption, among other problems – are outlined in the 52-page application form.  Institutions must prove they have: a track record of delivering mitigation and adaptation projects, a fully functional independent audit committee with plans for the past three years, various procurement committees, relevant guidelines and data on complaints handled in the past two years, examples of conflicts of interest in the past two years and how they were dealt with – and so on. Kashmala Kakakhel, a climate finance fellow at the Women’s Environment and Development Organisation, says that some of the recently accredited national entities, from India and Namibia for example, had told her that the accreditation process was “excruciatingly painful”. The pain doesn’t have to be endured alone, help is available. The World Resources Institute, for example, is working on climate-finance readiness in Kenya, the Philippines and Fiji – funded by the German government. In Kenya, it is working with the National Environment Management Agency (Nema) to help the government access and use GCF finance effectively. It has hosted workshops for Nema staff, helped clarify the agency’s decision-making process and connected it with institutions from other countries in a similar position, so they can learn from each others’ experiences. The GCF also has a special US$30m “readiness programme” to support developing countries’ institutions through the accreditation process. As of December 2015, 95 countries had expressed an interest in support from this programme and 33 have had their requests approved. This financing will be distributed in 2016 and comes from the funds donated by developed countries – the maximum a country can receive is $300,000.  According to Anoop Poonia, climate finance coordinator at the Climate Action Network, support should be more long term and on-site than it currently is. Ideally, an expert should be present in the country for months, if not years, and ensure an institution is accredited before they leave. Micronesia is one of the first examples where this long-term support is being planned, and a local consultant will be hired to work on the country’s accreditation for two years.  But as two years is a long delay, other countries are opting for the alternative route of direct access – through multilateral institutions that have the means to become accredited quickly. For example, the GCF recently gave a $31m grant for a new river water intake station, waste water treatment plant and sewer coverage in Fiji. The Fijian government was only able to access the grant through a partnership with the Asian Development Bank, one of several international banks to have become accredited already. This goes against the spirit in which the GCF was founded, says Poonia. “The purpose [of the GCF] was that any of these small nations should be able to access the fund directly,” he says. “In the past, the experiences of communities who have historically been facing injustice, whether indigenous peoples or communities in far-flung areas outside of the commercial mainstream, were always left out or their voices and concerns were never really heard.”  Simplifying the accreditation process would perhaps be the biggest help and this plea has been heard by the GCF’s executive director and secretariat. The final text of the Paris agreement also urges institutions like the GCF “to support country-driven strategies through simplified and efficient application and approval procedures”.  Despite this pressure, simplification is far from certain, according to ActionAid’s international climate policy manager, Harjeet Singh, and others. “Since accountability to donors as well as to poor people is of prime importance it is unlikely that the fiduciary standards will be relaxed for poor countries,” says Singh. “Instead of expecting the rules to be simpler, it seems that poor countries will have to learn to play the game the hard way.” Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

"It will be decades before big cargo ships link China and northern Europe by taking a shortcut through the Arctic Ocean, a report predicts. Climate change, retreating summer ice and the prospect of shorter journey times and 40% lower fuel costs has led Russia, European governments and some industries to expect a major ice-free shipping lane to open above Russia, allowing regular, year-long trade between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans within a few years. But, says the Copenhagen Business School in a new paper, low bunker fuel prices, a short sailing season and continuing treacherous ice conditions in the Arctic even in summer months means it could be 2040 at the earliest before it is commercially viable for ordinary merchant ships to pass through what is known as the northern sea route. Until then it will remain cheaper to send trade between Europe and the east via the Suez canal, it says. The conclusions of the report were backed this month by the powerful Danish Shipowners’ Association, which includes 40 major shipping companies such as Maersk, the world’s largest. Denmark has the eighth largest fleet in the world and would stand to gain the most in Europe if the northern sea route opened. “We have gone from hyper-optimism to total realism. The world economy was developed on the basis of a high oil price. The northern sea route seemed viable [a few years ago] but now it’s not the case. The route has vast potential but it will take a long time to open up,” said Anne H. Steffensen, director of the association at a meeting of Arctic country ministers and industry in Tromsø. Russia has tried to open up the Arctic to international traffic by offering icebreaker service and better port facilities. But cargo in transit along the northern sea route dropped from 1.3m tonnes in 2013 to 300,000 tonnes in 2014. Last year only 100,000 tonnes was transported between Asia and Europe on the route. However, there was a big rise in the number of vessels going to and from Russian Arctic ports. The Copenhagen Business School report, which compares the costs of building ice-reinforced ships suitable for the northern sea route, to existing costs of using the Suez canal, includes fuel prices, wait times, lengths of journey, canal fees and different sea conditions. It concludes that trade is unlikely to open up the northern route for decades. It expects the Arctic sea ice to be too thick and treacherous for many years, requiring expensive ice breakers and strengthened hulls.  “The Arctic navigation season is currently too short and ice conditions are too unpredictable for liner shipping to be feasible. Arctic liner shipping will only become a viable alternative to the contemporary shipping lanes if global warming continues to melt the ice cover along the North-west passage and the Northern sea route. “It is highly unlikely that large-scale containerised cargo transports will appear in the near future. The question then arises: when, if ever, will the ice conditions allow for continuous and economically feasible container transport along the route?” The greatest potential for the use of ice-reinforced container ships was found if the speed of global warming increased and the price of fuel is high. But even in this scenario, the cost per container was about 10% higher than going via the Suez canal route. Scientists have predicted that ordinary vessels would be able travel easily along the northern sea route, and moderately ice-strengthened ships should be able to pass over the pole itself by 2050.  Russian authorities still sees a bright future for shipping along its northern shoreline, but not as a busy international shipping route. “It is 100% sure that the northern sea route will be no alternative to the Suez Canal,” Russia’s deputy minister of transport, Viktor Olersky, told the Arctic Circle 2015 assembly. Unusually high temperatures in January led to January seeing the lowest recorded extent of sea ice in the satellite record. The ice extent averaged 13.53 million square kilometres (5.2 million square miles), which is 1.04 million sq km (402,000 sq m) below the 1981 to 2010 average, according to the US government’s National Snow and Ice Data Centre.

"I have no clue how many climate science denial myths a Republican presidential candidate can fit onto the head of a pin, but given these zingers are generally huge it’s probably not that many. But we do now have some clue how many myths one of those candidates, Senator Ted Cruz, can fit into an eight-minute diatribe. At least six.   When asked about climate change at recent hustings, Cruz has been delivering a stock set of answers from the Little Book of Climate Change Denial (not a real book). At one such event in New Hampshire, the representative from Texas delivered a diarrhea-like splurge (sorry) of talking points, myths and cherry-picked factoids. The world isn’t warming – check. This is all about government control – check. Scientists used to think an ice age was coming – check. Every pinhead contains an etching of Al Gore in a loving embrace with a dirty private jet – no check. This is not to single out Cruz who, we understand, is currently second in national polls. The Donald, currently leading in the polls for the Republican nomination, also denies the science of human-caused climate change. So does third placed Marco Rubio. It’s a hat trick. We know already that denying climate science has become part of the Republican psyche in the United States, but every once in a while it’s worth pausing to remind ourselves just how nuts this situation has become.  These are people who fancy themselves as the leader of the “free world” but think every science academy in the world together with the world’s thermometers, tide gauges and glaciers are all engaged in an elaborate hoax.  Anyway, let’s have a look at Cruz’s Climate Clangers (this phrase is hereby released under a Creative Commons licence).  Cruz has been using a story from Christmas 2013 to try and make climate scientists look like idiots. He says: … an exploration ship was sent down to Antarctica to document how the polar ice caps were melting. And the people who led this exception they believed the computer models that everything would be melted so they headed on down…. They had to go and be rescued because they got stuck in the ice. Cruz is referring to the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, but it has been abundantly clear that the scientists did not think that “everything would be melted” because, as they wrote on their expedition website and Planet Oz has pointed out before, one of their tasks was to investigate why Antarctic sea ice was growing.  I asked Professor Chris Turney, of the University of New South Wales and who led that expedition, about Cruz’s remarks. The Australasian Antarctic Expedition 2013-2014 made it clear from the start that we went pole wards to try and refine our understanding of why there is more sea ice in the south. We most certainly never ‘believed the computer models that everything would be melted’. I fear Senator Cruz has confused which way is up. As I hope Senator Cruz is all too aware from his time chairing the US Senate Science and Space Sub-Committee, the Arctic is a large ocean surrounded by continents while Antarctica is a continental ice sheet surrounded by ocean. The two respond to climate change in quite different ways.  Since satellite observations began in the 1970s, the amount of sea ice in the Arctic has suffered a long-term decline and is now at an all time low. In marked contrast, the amount of sea ice surrounding the Antarctic continent has reached an all time high. One thing we do know is as the world’s temperatures continue to climb, weather patterns around the planet are changing and some of the biggest changes are happening in the south. Stronger winds are shifting sea ice around the Southern Ocean, helping more survive the summer. But these winds are also causing a big change in ocean circulation that appear to be melting key parts of the continental ice, making surface waters less salty and therefore easier to freeze.  I’m sure Senator Cruz doesn’t need reminding that as scientists we’re trained to test ideas, not believe in them. Another to have made the same claim about Turney’s expedition is conservative commentator Mark Steyn, who is currently being sued by climate scientist Michael Mann. Steyn made the exact same claim in an article in The Spectator. Steyn was called to give evidence to a hearing of the US Senate’s science subcommittee, chaired by Cruz. Next week, Steyn begins a speaking tour of Australia, sponsored by the “thinktank” the Institute of Public Affairs – the country’s prime pusher of climate science denial. When it comes to global temperature readings, Cruz has his laser vision set on the satellite data, which is showing slightly less warming than the temperatures on the ground (where we live, and grow stuff). Cruz uses this data to claim that global warming stopped 18 years ago. But even the senior scientist who looks after the satellite data that Cruz likes to cite, says the ground-based temperature measurements are more appropriate when it comes to climate change. Cruz does not seem so keen to mention those various collections of land-based measurements, which show, for example, that 14 of the 16 hottest years on record have all happened since 2000. The hottest year on record was 2015, but 2016 will give that a run for its money. Climate science deniers don’t like land-based measurements because they go through various corrective processes. Some think scientists are doing this deliberately to fiddle the numbers and show warming. Conspiracy time. Yet Cruz and others are apparently ignorant of how scientists have to do far more fiddling around with data from satellites. For an excellent explainer on all this, watch this Yale Climate Connections video.  This one is an oldie but a goodie.  Cruz has been telling people that in the 1970s “you had Liberal politicians and scientists who were talking about global cooling” and how we were “headed to another ice age”.  While it’s true that a few scientists were writing about possible future cooling, a review of research appearing in academic journals found that between 1965 and 1979 there were more than six times as many papers saying the world was warming. Only seven academic papers in fifteen years were predicting cooling. Cruz goes on to criticise scientists because they then “repackaged their theory” when the evidence suggested they were wrong.  But to suggest that scientists should not change their mind when presented with evidence fundamentally challenging their ideas is a supremely odd idea. Another favourite of climate science deniers is to suggest that climate science is a religion. Cruz likes this line too, and seems to be suggesting that someone’s views should not be driven by a religious belief.  Seems good advice. Guess who said this? Life, liberty, and property, the fundamental natural rights of man are given to every one of us by God, and the role of government fundamentally is to protect those rights. In New Hampshire, Cruz told an audience: Anyone noticed in the last two or three years the terms magically changed? It had been global warming and then suddenly it became climate change. Ooh. Conspiracy? Not really. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (my emphasis) was formed in 1988. Was that “two or three” years ago? Cruz is trying to suggest there’s some underlying political motive to change the name because the world isn’t warming (when it is). But probably the best-known example of politically motivated interference in the language of climate change comes from Cruz’s side of politics. In 2000, the influential pollster Frank Luntz wrote a memo to Republicans saying the term “global warming” should be replaced by the “less frightening” term “climate change”. The memo was based on a report written for energy companies. Just like magic, this PR advice was adopted by the George W. Bush administration. As a sort of climax to his splurge, Cruz has been saying that climate change is the “perfect pseudoscientific theory” because it can “never, ever, ever be disproven.”  This is a little bit like saying you can’t disprove that there’s a small community of genetically modified clown people living on Uranus (I suggest a quick check with a long-handled mirror). But what would it take to “disprove” human-caused climate change? Well, here’s a few things.  You’d have to first overturn the laws of atmospheric physics, and maybe then prove the atmosphere and oceans are not heating up, that the world’s plants and animals on the move across the world are reacting to something else (like, say, messages from Uranus), that the oceans are rising just because they fancy it and that all the recent record hot years could have just come along by chance. Shouldn’t be too hard, eh?"
"The British public is far more concerned about the threat posed by population growth than it is about climate change, according to a YouGov survey published late last week. The survey, which questioned more than 18,000 people in 17 different countries, found that while climate change is seen as the third most concerning issue globally, people in Britain feel armed conflicts and population growth pose a greater threat.  The study asked people to consider the threat posed by nine different issues - including global terrorism, population growth, energy scarcity and climate change - and rank them in order of what they consider to be the most serious. It also asked participants to identify which issue they considered as the most serious threat. By taking an average of these two measures - to include both the breadth and density of concern in order to create a “share of concern” index - the research reveals that those most concerned about climate change are people in Hong Kong, Denmark and Sweden, with a 20 per cent, 16.2 per cent, and a 16 per cent share of concern for the issue respectively. In contrast, the UK, US and Saudi Arabia were the three least-concerned countries about the issue, scoring 10.8 per cent, 9.2 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively. People in Britain expressed the highest concern of any country about global population growth, while those in Saudi Arabia felt most strongly about the threat of armed conflicts. Overall, climate change achieved a 12.8 per cent share of concern, ranking behind only international terrorism and the threat of poverty as the most concerning issues globally."

"The Doomsday Clock, the symbolic countdown to humanity’s end, remained stuck on the brink of the apocalypse for a second year on Tuesday, because of the continued existential threats posed by nuclear war and climate change. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the group which created the clock in 1947, said it was keeping the clock hands set at three minutes to midnight – the closest the clock has come to destruction since the throes of the cold war in 1984. “The clock ticks now at just three minutes to midnight because international leaders are failing to perform their most important duty,” the scientists said. The ominous forecast was imposed despite two major diplomatic accomplishments last year: the Iranian nuclear deal and the historic Paris agreement to fight climate change. “The decision not to move the hands of the clock in 2016 is not good news,” Lawrence Krauss, who chairs the Bulletin’s board of sponsors, said in announcing the new clock setting. The scientists, reinforced by former US cabinet secretaries William Perry and George Shultz, based their dire symbolic forecast on challenges of a global scale such as nuclear war and climate change.  They also acknowledged the gathering threats posed to world order over the last year by Islamic State and cyberwarfare. The scientists noted that the 11.57pm setting was one of the worst since the clock’s inception. In 1991, when the threat of nuclear annihilation receded with the end of the cold war, the clock stood at 17 minutes to midnight. Barack Obama’s election was another occasion for the scientists to lower the danger setting, based on his campaign promise to abolish nuclear weapons.  With the Iranian nuclear agreement reached last year, the Obama administration made important progress in lowering tensions. But the Bulletin said US domestic political constraints had blocked Obama from doing more. In addition, the scientists said such progress was undermined by high tensions between the US and Russia that are reminiscent of the cold war. The US, India, China and Russia were spending $350bn modernising their nuclear arsenals, and North Korea remained a nuclear risk. In many ways, the world was a more dangerous place since the end of the cold war, said Shultz, who served as Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state in the 1980s during the height of the superpower rivalry between the US and former Soviet Union. “We have a world awash in change. There is nowhere you can look and say it’s a world of stable prosperity,” Shultz said in a webcast from Stanford University. “It’s a terrible mess.” Regarding the other great global challenge, climate change, the scientists and political leaders noted that 2015 was the hottest year on record – smashing through the previous record, set just one year before. The Paris climate agreement – though supported by more than 190 countries – on its own was not enough to limit warming below 2C, the goal for preventing a climate catastrophe. Leaders needed to focus on the big challenges of the age, said Jerry Brown, California’s governor.  “Climate change is moving slowly but tipping points are around the corner and you don’t know when you are going to reach one,” he said."
"Less than 2C of global warming for the Earth, the target agreed by leaders at the COP21 climate conference in Paris last November, doesn’t really sound too ambitious. In fact, many of us would welcome an extra couple of degrees warmth. So what is all the fuss about? Unfortunately the warming would not occur evenly around the world. A study published recently in Nature shows what 2C of warming – a rise, of this level, above the pre-industrial global mean surface temperature – might really feel like and which regions may be hit hardest.  Some of the regional hot spots cited are the Mediterranean countries, Brazil and the US, where 2C of global warming could translate into local temperature increases of more than 3C. But the region expected to suffer most is the Arctic, where night-time temperatures are predicted to soar by 6C. “Some countries are much more exposed than others,” says Rob Wilby, from Loughborough University. The Earth has already warmed by an average of 1C, and the uneven nature of this warming is becoming clear with Arctic regions already beyond the 2C mark. Meanwhile, climate models suggest that the Mediterranean could pass the 2C level once global temperatures have risen by 1.4C. Oceans, which cover 70% of the planet, warm much more slowly than land and are partly responsible for the uneven pattern of warming. Local factors, like loss of heat-reflecting snow in the Arctic, make a difference, too. And it isn’t just temperature: changes in rainfall are also expected to be unequally distributed, with most land areas getting more of a dousing, according to the researchers. “Recent flooding episodes in the UK give us an insight into just how vulnerable we are,” says Wilby."

"The United Nations urged global business leaders on Wednesday to double investment in wind and solar energy to $600bn (£400bn) a year by 2020. One month after the Paris climate agreement, Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, told business leaders they needed to act decisively to hasten the transition away from the fossil fuel economy – or they would put the historic accord in jeopardy.  “I call on the investor community to build on the strong momentum from Paris and seize the opportunities for clean energy growth,” Ban told a UN investors’ meeting in prepared remarks. “I challenge investors to double – at a minimum – their clean energy investments by 2020.” Global clean energy investment attracted a record $329bn last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. But Ban told the New York meeting that was still not fast enough to build the new green infrastructure that would enable countries to meet the Paris goal of limiting warming to below 2C. He said it was time for investors and fund managers to move from “aspiration to action”.  The gathering today of about 500 investors, organised by the Ceres sustainable business network, was the third stop for Ban and other UN officials this month on an itinerary designed to get business leaders firmly behind the Paris climate agreement, after meetings in Abu Dhabi and Davos. Under the agreement, 196 governments agreed on the 2C goal, an aspirational goal of 1.5C, and to build a net-zero carbon economy in the second half of the century. Rich countries committed to providing climate finance, and all countries committed to revisiting and strengthening their national climate goals, starting as early as 2018. But the commitments made at Paris would at best cap warming to 2.7C. Christiana Figueres, the UN climate chief, who will also address investors on Wednesday, and other leaders, have acknowledged that governments cannot finance the economic transformation, and that mobilising support from business leaders was a critical component of the Paris agreement. The message to those business leaders underlined at the Davos and Abu Dhabi gatherings and again in New York on Wednesday was that, left unchecked, climate change posed a dangerous risk, and that there were business opportunities in the transition to a clean energy economy.  In Davos, some 750 experts gathering for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum declared a climate catastrophe to be the single biggest threat to the global economy in 2016. A few days earlier, the annual meeting of the International Renewable Energy Agency in Abu Dhabi was told that doubling renewable energy to 36% of the global energy mix by 2030 would take countries halfway to the Paris goal of limiting warming to 2C, and increase global GDP by up to $1.3tn.  “We had this extraordinary agreement in Paris, we have got points on the horizon,” Rachel Kyte, the UN special envoy for sustainable energy, who will also address investors, said on the sidelines of the Abu Dhabi meetings. “Now we have got to get down to the nitty gritty of long term development of the low carbon economy and that is a lot less sexy in some respects than things negotiated last year.”  The International Energy Agency estimated it will cost the global energy industry $16.5tn by 2030 to make the switch from high-polluting power plants to wind and solar electricity generation, required by governments’ commitments at Paris. But a number of experts, including those of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, say the prices on new wind and solar projects are coming down - and could come down even further if there is a dramatic increase in investment.  Ceres said business leaders needed to start moving now to take advantage of those new greener markets.  “Ultimately, global investment portfolios need to shift far more capital to low-carbon business activity and away from risky high-carbon sectors that may perform poorly in the years ahead,” Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, said in prepared remarks."
"Copenhagen’s mayor has announced plans to divest the city’s 6.9bn kroner (£700m) investment fund of all holdings in coal, oil and gas. If his proposal is approved at a finance committee meeting next Tuesday, as expected, the Danish capital will become the country’s first investment fund to sell its stocks and bonds in fossil fuels.  “Copenhagen is at the forefront of world cities in the green transition, and we are working hard to become the world’s first CO2 neutral capital in 2025. Therefore it seems totally wrong for the municipality to still be investing in oil, coal and gas. We must change that,” the city’s mayor, Frank Jensen, told the Danish newspaper, Information, which first reported the story. “I think this move sits well with Copenhagen’s desire for a green profile for their city,” he added. It is unclear exactly how much of the city’s money pot is currently tied up in equities and bonds in the dirty energy sector.  A council spokesperson told the Guardian that no decision had yet been taken as to where exactly the withdrawn monies would be reinvested.  The divestment initiative began with a small leftwing party on the Copenhagen council, before being taken up by Jensen, a social democrat. Last year, Oslo became the first capital city to divest from fossil fuels, when it ditched $7m of coal investments, to join a growing movement of cities that have pledged to combat climate change. The world’s largest coal port, Newcastle in Australia, has also made a divestment commitment. In a possible sign of Scandinavian rivalry, Jensen suggested that Copenhagen’s move might be more significant. “I am not aware of any other capitals, which have made decisions as clear as the one, we are making,” he said. “But I believe more will follow in the wake of the climate agreement in Paris. The development will be fast.” Around 80% of the world’s known coal, 50% of its oil and 30% of its gas reserves will have to stay in the ground if dangerous global warming is to be avoided, climate scientists say. "
"The risks of climate change should be assessed in the same way as risks to national security or public health, according to a policy brief to the UK Foreign Office. The advice is that, as with terrorism, we assess these risks on a worst-case scenario and then plan our actions to counter them. The brief is a follow up to a hard-hitting report Climate Change, a Risk Assessment, which described the frightening consequences to the human race of the temperature rises we can expect this century. It says we need to plan our actions now to counter these dangers.  The report was compiled by four experts, including Sir David King, formerly the UK’s chief scientific adviser, and, although commissioned by the Foreign Office, came with the disclaimer that “it should not be taken to represent the views of the UK government”. Governments of all political hues, starting with Mrs Thatcher, have a history of commissioning influential reports on climate change. They come with copper-bottomed and far-reaching recommendations about action that will safeguard the British public (and the rest of the planet) from the dangers of overheating, and then they are almost totally ignored by the politicians that paid for them. The Stern Report on the economics of climate change, ordered by Gordon Brown, when he was chancellor, being the best-known example. These dangers to Britain are no longer all long-term. Flooding and mass migration are already happening. Food shortages and sea level rise only require extreme weather events to take them from the list of probable events to stories that will dominate the news; but yet another report is probably destined to gather dust."

"Seth Burgess has, literally, travelled to the ends of the Earth to find a date. Along the way he has endured attacks of giant flesh-eating bee-flies, paddled a raft 60 miles in driving Siberian rain, braved volcanoes in Alaska, and inhaled polluted air in China for weeks on end, all the while hauling pounds of rocks. And all in the name of Science. The date he seeks plays extremely hard to get.  In Siberia, Seth and his colleagues whacked off rocks from cliffs in dozens of mosquito-infested riverbanks scattered across over a thousand miles of Siberia, and hauled them back to MIT in Massachusetts. He pulverized his rocks to free tiny zircon crystals and then baked them before bathing them in ultra-pure hydrofluoric acid (an acid so powerful that it dissolves glass) for two days. He then took his cleaned-up gems to the University of Arizona, where he inspected each and every tiny grain under a microscope and then zapped it with a laser and sucked the vapor into a machine called a “LaserChron.” Sadly, not a single gem was worthy. “So all that work really for naught!” Seth told me when I met him in the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco in December. The date Seth was pursuing was the age of the most cataclysmic event to hit the Earth since animals evolved. No, not the end-Cretaceous when the dinosaurs were annihilated, a much bigger catastrophe even than that: the end-Permian mass extinction, when more than 90% of species ceased to exist. It was a time when severe global warming made oceans as hot as the legal limit of a hot tub, and gasses from Siberian volcanic eruptions were the suspected culprit. To convict the eruptions, Seth needed to see if they occurred just before the mass extinction, at a precision never before achieved. Obviously it makes sense if you want to date the onset of the eruption and tie that time in Earth history to when the mass extinction occurred, you want to date the first stuff to erupt.  But that stuff formed so explosively that it’s now a jumble of volcanic ash and shattered sediments, and unfortunately for Seth it turns out that those sediments brought with them all those unworthy zircons. Seth told me, There were zircons that ranged in age from about 260 million years old to 2.5 billion. It’s just a hodge-podge of stuff. Undeterred, Seth moved on to find a date for the 2 ½-mile-thick, thousand-mile-wide layer cake of the Siberian lavas. But the lavas had no zircons, so he had to settle for perovskite crystals instead. So we had to go to kind of like the ugly stepsister. But in the absence of the cute sister maybe the ugly sister is not so bad! You’re hard up, so that’s where you’ve got to go! To cut a long story short, Seth did get his date – several in fact. Some of them were actually from zircons extracted from volcanic ash he found sandwiched between layers of lava. And what those dates proved was that an unconscionable quantity of lava erupted in what geologists call a ridiculously short period of time – about 300,000 years or less - and yes, right before the mass extinction. The eruptions delivered a huge slug of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, far more than humans could even if we were to burn all our fossil fuels, which explains the hot tub ocean temperatures. The eruptions were so relentless that there wasn’t any time for soil to develop between lava flows. It’s a similar story in Antarctica, where lavas of the “Ferrar Large Igneous Province” have been tied to a minor (but still global) mass extinction known as the Toarcian Extinction. Every single rock I dated from the Ferrar, and we’re talking up the mountain, down in the ravine, from one side of the continent to the other, along the Transantarctic Mountains - they’re all 182.6 million years old! It’s every single rock the same! And we’ve already talked about how much work it is to date one frigging rock! And when I date 22 of them and they’re the same age, and they’re from all over the place in the Transantarctic Mountains it gives me a great sense of: it’s all in one shot! It’s not a big slow prolonged event. Seth’s dating quest, and similar travails by other geochronologists, have now proven the close link in time between several mass extinctions in Earth’s past and huge eruptions, including for the end-Cretaceous extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs. In that example geochronologists have tied the famous Chicxulub asteroid impact date to the same time as gargantuan eruptions in India, suggesting that the impact may have aggravated the eruptions. So it seems the dinosaurs were extinguished by the original “double whammy.” The worrying thing for us today is that almost all these mass extinctions seem to have involved global warming. To understand them better, and to be able to compare their greenhouse gas emission rates to ours, we’re going to need a lot more dates. Everything is rate-dependent in Earth history. We could date them all, but it’s time consuming and expensive to do it to the utmost precision. It takes a hell of a lot of time, it’s hard work, and it doesn’t always work! But Seth, and geochronologists like him, continue their quest undaunted. Howard Lee is a geologist and science writer who focuses on past climate changes."
"A national inquiry into the fires devastating world heritage forests in Tasmania is urgently needed, say conservationists and academics. The call comes as experts say fires like those could be the new normal. The Australian Conservation Foundation has called for the public inquiry as dozens of fires continue to ravage the world heritage forests and look set to burn for days or weeks to come.  “We need to ask whether or not Parks and Wildlife have adequate resources to implement a policy of actively fighting … remote area fires, especially in sensitive alpine areas,” said Jess Abrahams, an ACF campaigner. He said fire services did an exceptional job but an inquiry was needed to look into the policies that should exist around fighting fires in remote areas and the resources that would be needed to implement them. David Bowman from the University of Tasmania agreed an inquiry was required.  “It’s critical,” he told Guardian Australia. He said it was important that it not seek to lay blame on anyone because the current situation was “unprecedented” and could not have been predicted. When asked whether there would be an inquiry the Tasmanian premier, Will Hodgman, told reporters yesterday there would be “an assessment” with peer reviews done by experts from interstate. Dozens of fires were still burning inside the world heritage forests in Tasmania, according to the Tasmanian Fire Service. Bowman said they could continue to burn for 10 or 20 more days and were likely to be made worse by dry and warm conditions that are forecast as a high-pressure system moves through Tasmania. Bowman said without investing in research, it was impossible to know what might have been done to avoid the devastation occurring now. “These fires are really interesting,” he said. “They’re basically unfought and free-flowing over a landscape. Trying to reconstruct them would ... reveal clues about what sort of management would work.” Bowman said an inquiry should examine whether controlled burning, fire breaks or roading might help. “And getting the expert firefighters to reflect on whether they could do more if they had a bigger budget.” But right now there was almost nothing that firefighters could do, Bowman said. Many of the fires were burning in peat, which happens underground, making backburning impossible.  “You’d have to bulldoze strips in the soil but it’s a world heritage area,” Bowman said. “If there was something simple that could be done, it would be done.” The Australian Conservation Foundation said the inquiry should look not just into fire-fighting strategies, but also into the role of climate change in the fires, which experts say was likely to be a cause. These fires were started by an unusual number of lightning strikes, something that could increase as a result of climate change. And the dry conditions that led to the fires were also expected to be made more likely as a result of climate change, said Michael Grose from the CSIRO, who conducted a major study into the future climate of Tasmania. “Hotter temperatures, reduced rainfall in key seasons [and] worse fire weather, are all consistent with what is projected with climate change, particularly under a high-emission scenario,” he told Guardian Australia.  “I’m almost certain this is the new normal,” Bowman said."
"Florida’s leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, have both criticized federal action to combat climate change, with Rubio warning it would “destroy” the US economy and Bush predicting “someone in a garage somewhere” will solve the problem instead.  Responding to a rare question about climate change in Thursday’s Republican debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Rubio denied that he ever supported a “cap and trade” system to lower emissions, despite his having called it “inevitable” in 2008.  “I have never supported cap-and-trade and I never thought it was a good idea,” the Florida senator said. “And I do not believe it’s a good idea now. I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.  “And especially what these programs are asking us to pass … will do nothing to help the environment, but will be devastating for our economy. When I am president of the United States of America, there will never be any ‘cap and trade’ in the United States.” On the campaign trail in Iowa this week, Rubio said policies being implemented by Barack Obama will harm the economy and cost “hundreds of thousands of jobs”. Obama’s initial cap and trade plan was blocked by Congress. Instead, the Environmental Protection Agency will impose greenhouse gas limits on power plants, allowing a form of emissions trading between the states.  Obama’s administration has pledged to cut US greenhouse emissions from all sectors by up to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. Research released this week by scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and the University of Colorado Boulder found that the US could slash emissions much further, cutting them by up to 78% below 1990 levels within 15 years, while meeting increased demand. These cuts, the Nature Climate Change study states, could be achieved “without an increase in the levelized cost of electricity”. It would be undertaken via a shift to a national energy system using existing renewable sources such as solar and wind and deploying the latest electricity storage technology. Bush, once governor of Florida, has said he supports federal government support for “basic research” into low-carbon energy but, like Rubio, places his faith in the free market to deal with rising temperatures and the extreme weather events, drought and sea level rise they bring. “What we shouldn’t try to do is pick winners and losers through the federal government,” he said at a gathering in New Hampshire on Saturday, in a newly emerged video.  “The market will work faster. There’s someone in a garage somewhere, parochially I hope it’s in Miami, that’s going to have a clue, to have an answer to this.  “There are people well-intended on climate change but they need to be careful to not paint the apocalypse. Because we are not there. But we should be adapting.” Bush said he doubted sea level predictions for south Florida but, if they did come true, he has told his wife that they should move house.  Last week, a group of 15 mayors in Florida, including Tomas Regalado, the mayor of Miami, wrote to Rubio to call upon him to “acknowledge the reality and urgency of climate change and to address the upcoming crisis it presents our communities”. The letter states that sea levels rose by around 8in off the coast of south Florida during the 20th century and that a further rise of 1ft by 2050 will wipe out about $4bn of Florida real estate. Florida is considered particularly vulnerable to sea level rises as it is low-lying and sits in parts on a base of limestone, which causes excess water to seep underground and inundate areas. Salt water intrusion is also a concern for the Everglades and the many species that rely upon the wetland ecosystem. The League of Conservation Voters, which is backing Hillary Clinton, said Rubio had a “weak relationship with the facts” on the economic impact of tackling climate change. “In 2016, the American people are making it increasingly clear they have little tolerance for candidates who willfully ignore the facts of climate change,” said Seth Stein, a spokesman for the lobby group.  “The other news networks should follow Fox News’ lead, and finally ask the Republican candidates a question on climate change.” Adam Beitman, a spokesman for environment group the Sierra Club, said: “Rubio’s views on climate action have gotten more dangerous as the threat to his home town has gotten more severe and the Koch brothers’ influence on his positions has gotten more pronounced.”Beitman said Bush’s comments showed that Republicans were paying “lip service” to action on climate change while opposing serious solutions to it.“When your plan is to wait around and hope that someone in their garage fixes the climate crisis, it’s clear you’re not taking the issue seriously at all – especially while seas are rising around your home state.” Last year was the hottest year on record, according to Noaa and Nasa, beating the record set in 2014 by a “wide margin”. Of the 15 hottest years in the 150-year-old temperature record, 13 have occurred since 2000."

"On a winter morning in one of the world’s driest and most water-stressed countries, meteorologist Sufian Khaled Farrah watched on the Doppler radar screen as a cold, wet front scudded across the Gulf – and quickly called air traffic controllers.  Over the next 15 hours, six twin-engine planes took off from an airfield in Al Ain, on the eastern edge of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and flew repeatedly into the clouds, firing off 162 flares loaded with tiny particles of potassium chloride and sodium chloride – table salt. By the end of Farrah’s shift at the National Centre of Meteorology and Seismology, a light drizzle was falling across much of the UAE. Farrah had made it rain.  With the Gulf region confronting an even hotter, drier future under climate change – potentially testing the limits of human endurance – the UAE’s leadership is hoping to secure the country’s water supply by wringing more moisture out of the clouds.   The UAE this month launched an international research prize for weather modification, awarding a first tranche of $5m to researchers from Germany, Japan and the UAE.   “There are many techniques to secure water resources,” said Masataka Murakami, of Nagoya University’s Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, who will lead one of the research teams. “But only precipitation enhancement can produce a lot of water for industrial use, irrigation etc cheaply.” Such claims hold a lot of promise for the UAE. The country receives less than 100mm rainfall a year, and much of that is lost to evaporation because of extreme heat. Winter rains, like the one Farrah was involved with, are especially rare. But the country – despite having such natural scarcity – is also one of the world’s biggest per capita consumers of water. Farmers still rely on flood irrigation, pumping out so much water the ground is sinking in some parts of the country. An expanding urban population with a taste for water parks, golf courses, and lush green landscaping is also rapidly draining groundwater reserves.  Over the next three years, Murakami’s team will deploy sensors and algorithms to identify the most promising clouds. A German team, led by Professor Volker Wulfmeyer of the University of Hohenheim, will study how winds and topography affect cloud formation and movement. Linda Zou will lead a team of researchers from the UAE’s Masdar Institute of Science and Technology using nanotechnology to increase water condensation within the cloud. Other options under consideration by a water-strapped government include boosting the efficiency of the desalination plants that produce fresh water from the sea, importing icebergs and water trading. But weather modification historically has been the favoured course. Since the 1990s, the UAE has invested heavily in weather modification operations, working with Nasa and private US companies to try to boost rainfall and replenish dwindling groundwater supplies.  On good days, the cloud-busting operations manage to squeeze an extra 15% of rainfall out of the clouds, Farrah said. The country’s record was 35% above the expected rainfall, he said.  “It is expensive but compared to desalination plants it is very, very cheap,” Farrah said. However, those numbers could not be independently verified and are much higher than those recorded by scientists engaged in weather modification operations elsewhere. Murakami said that with additional research such operations could prove even more productive. “The work we do today isn’t like the old cloud seeding. This is more advanced, and more involved in finding solutions in the way that nature works,” he said. But water experts remain unconvinced. In the 60 years governments and private companies around the world have been trying to alter the weather, it is still impossible to conjure clouds from a clear blue sky. And there is no reliable way to gauge the effectiveness of their operations – since those clouds might have produced rain anyway, scientists said. “Weather modification is a pretty sketchy option anywhere but it is really hard to wring moisture out of the atmosphere when it isn’t even there,” said Peter Gleick, a US water scientist and founder of Pacific Institute in California, who was invited by the royal family to deliver a lecture in Abu Dhabi in 2011.  The UAE poses its own particular challenges, said Roelof Bruintjes, a weather modification expert at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado. Bruintjes spent four years trying to increase the rain potential of the UAE in the early 1990s, using radar and aircraft. But researchers found that the clouds were to some extent already being artificially stimulated by dust from the surrounding desert, and pollution from the oil industry. As the researchers soon discovered, there was little more moisture to be wrung from the clouds. “One of the things that we found was that, in general, it’s hard to modify those clouds,” he said. “It’s already being seeded naturally.” Bruintjes said he was “doubtful” that a new generation of researchers would be able to crack open the clouds. But he added: “let the science take its course. Maybe they will find something we didn’t.” And he went on, the UAE does not have a lot of options.  By mid-century, the country will be desperately short of water, and the costs of running the desalination plants to secure its supply are already prohibitively expensive.  The plants, powered by fossil fuels, suck up huge amounts of sea water and energy, accounting for about 20% of the country’s entire electricity supply. With oil prices below $30 a barrel, and the UAE reduced to a net importer of gas because of rising domestic use, the authorities acknowledge dependence on desalination plants is a luxury even oil-rich Gulf countries can no longer afford.   “Our arid climate makes us dependent on energy-intensive desalination,” Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, the UAE special envoy for energy and climate change, said in announcing the award. “This is not sustainable nor is it desirable.” The country is building six desalination plants including a pilot project at Ghantoot that will seek to cut electricity use by 25%. Masdar, the state-owned renewable energy company that owns the Ghantoot project, is looking at powering the plant with solar energy, instead of oil and gas.  Such energy-saving moves are critical to an increasingly water-stressed future, said Dr Nawal Al-Hosany, Masdar’s director of sustainability. “When it comes to desalination it is a very expensive exercise,” she said. “We are trying to work with our partners to find innovative ways to improve the efficiency of our desalination plants.” The UAE is also moving – slowly – towards conservation. Abu Dhabi this month for the first time began charging Emirati households for water use, and raised fees on expatriates. A number of hotels have began reusing water for flushing toilets and landscaping. There are plans to expand water reuse. But it would take a lot more than some some fat rain clouds and the sporadic embrace of water conservation to guarantee the UAE’s water security, Gleick said.  “They have very little water. They can make as much as they want from the Gulf – but that’s at a high cost,” he said.  It was time, he said, for the UAE to have a “serious conversation” about what they were really using their limited water for. “They are in a really tough spot.”"
"CSIRO chief Larry Marshall has provided more details on cuts to climate monitoring and modelling at the CSIRO – confirming that the number of researchers employed in two research programs would be halved. In Senate estimates on Thursday, under questioning from Labor’s Kim Carr, Marshall said 100 jobs would be cut from the oceans and atmosphere program . He said they would hire another 35 people, leaving an overall loss of 65 people.    As a result of the cuts, Marshall confirmed that the number of people working on monitoring and modelling climate change would be cut in half.  The news comes one week after Marshall announced, in an email to staff, that there would be a shift in research priorities, away from understanding the nature of climate change, and towards adaptation and mitigation. The announcement was quickly condemned by scientists around the world, and, unusually, by the World Meteorological Organisation, which is part of the UN. Asked about the international criticism, Marshall said he was surprised, particularly by the criticism from the US, which he said had already led a similar shift in research priorities. “It’s a matter of fact that the United States invests 75% of its dollar investment into the environmental area into mitigation and only 25% into modelling and monitoring,” he said. “Over the last decade, the investment in the US in modelling and measuring has changed hardly at all – roughly 4% a year, while in contrast, the investment in mitigation technologies has changed 40% a year.” “Given the US is playing a lead in a major shift in research priorities, this was a big part of our thinking of following that leading trend. So it surprised me to be criticised by someone who had led that trend.” Tony Haymet from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the US said any suggestion the US was scaling back its research into measurement and observation was wrong. He said there were some large-scale investment in mitigation technologies like carbon capture and storage, but they often weren’t successful. “I certainly think we need to invest more in mitigation but it’s not either or,” Haymet said. “We don’t know perfectly what we need to mitigate against so we need to do both.”   Marshall also apologised for his statements made on the ABC on Thursday morning, when he compared the criticisms of the cuts to the lobbying by the fossil fuel industry against climate researchers in the 1970s.  “There’s a lot of emotion in this debate – in fact it almost sounds more like religion than science to me,” he said earlier on the ABC.  Senator Carr had asked Marshall if he was aware the comparison was used by climate change deniers and was uttered by former prime minister John Howard. “I apologise for any offence I made to anyone with my reference to religion,” he said. “It was a poor way of expressing the passion with which people feel about this,” Marshall said.

"Why would two book-lovers want to encourage authors and illustrators not to appear at a book festival? I love books and I love going to book festivals, both as an author and a reader. So it might come as a surprise to learn that I’ve got together with book blogger Zoe Toft to organise the Think Twice Campaign that encourages authors and illustrators to think twice about appearing at a book festival.  Before you think we’ve lost our minds, I should say that we’re only asking authors and illustrators to think twice about going to a particular festival – the Emirates Airline Festival of Literature that is held every year in Dubai. Lots of authors and illustrators we admire and respect attend the festival each year and it seems to be well organised and very enjoyable for everyone involved. So why are we kicking up a fuss about it? Our objection is to the festival’s sponsor, Emirates Airline, part of an environmentally irresponsible industry and owned by a very oppressive government. Generally speaking, we are in favour of companies sponsoring book festivals to help them cover their costs. However it’s important to recognise that both sides benefit from a sponsorship deal. By associating themselves with high-profile, respectable authors and illustrators, Emirates Airline are able to raise their own profile and make themselves appear more respectable. Zoe and I don’t think that a company like Emirates Airline should be regarded as respectable. We think they are quite the opposite. And we’ve given authors and illustrators three good reasons to think that too. One reason is climate change. While governments are making other industries reduce their CO2 emissions, the aviation industry’s carbon footprint gets bigger and bigger every year. It looked like aviation was finally going to be brought under control at last year’s Climate Change summit in Paris, but at the last minute, they were let off the hook again. Environmental groups have said that the absence of both aviation and shipping from the Paris agreement will make it “close to impossible” to keep global warming beneath the 2ºC level needed to avert climate catastrophe. As the airline that flies the highest number of international kilometres, Emirates Airline’s international flights already generate more CO2 than any other airline and instead of reducing their emissions they have just announced plans to double in size. Does that sound respectable? A second reason is free speech. The airline is owned by the family of Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and the book festival’s patron. Dubai is part of a country called the United Arab Emirates or the UAE. Sheikh Mohammed is also the UAE’s Vice President and Prime Minister. The UAE government is very different from the UK’s and the Sheikh is more like a king than a UK prime minister. The UAE is not a democratic country, so the Sheikh cannot be voted out in an election, no matter how unpopular he is with his people. Many UAE citizens are very unhappy with the way the country is run. Unfortunately, citizens that dare to criticise the country’s government are arrested and imprisoned for doing so (find out more in this link from Amnesty International). There are currently 67 prisoners serving long sentences just for speaking out in favour of democracy. Does that sound respectable? The third reason is human rights. If you’re not a rich heterosexual man, you may be treated as a second class citizen – or, worse still, a criminal – by Sheikh Mohammed’s government. Attacks against women are not taken as seriously as they are in the UK and often the victim, rather than the man attacking her, ends up being arrested and imprisoned. Homosexuality is illegal and people can be imprisoned for up to 10 years simply for being gay. People of both sexes working in low paid jobs are not protected by the law in the same way that rich people are. Low paid women are especially badly treated, with many being forced to work long hours with little to eat and no days off. Does that sound respectable? Zoe and I do have a lot of sympathy for children that might miss out on meeting an author or illustrator as a result of this campaign. However we have more sympathy for the people – children and adults – in the groups whose interests the Think Twice campaign are trying to champion: the women, migrant workers and gay UAE citizens whose human rights are being abused, or the future generations who will have to contend with the life-threatening consequences of climate change.  If authors and illustrators are thinking of cancelling, but are worried about disappointing a young audience, they could offer to Skype with UAE schools. There are lots of tips for authors and illustrators who are new to Skype at virtualauthors.co.uk.  Emirates Airline is an extremely rich company. They use their money to sponsor many other high-profile events and organisations, from football clubs to symphony orchestras. This all helps to create a smokescreen of respectability around a company and a government that is anything but respectable. I hope that the Think Twice Campaign will help many authors and illustrators to see through that smokescreen and think twice about going to this particular book festival.

"Huge sea-level rises caused by climate change will last far longer than the entire history of human civilisation to date, according to new research, unless the brief window of opportunity of the next few decades is used to cut carbon emissions drastically. Even if global warming is capped at governments’ target of 2C - which is already seen as difficult - 20% of the world’s population will eventually have to migrate away from coasts swamped by rising oceans. Cities including New York, London, Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Calcutta, Jakarta and Shanghai would all be submerged. “Much of the carbon we are putting in the air from burning fossil fuels will stay there for thousands of years,” said Prof Peter Clark, at Oregon State University in the US and who led the new work. “People need to understand that the effects of climate change won’t go away, at least not for thousands of generations.” “The long-term view sends the chilling message of what the real risks and consequences are of the fossil fuel era,” said Prof Thomas Stocker, at the University of Bern, Switzerland and also part of the research team. “It will commit us to massive adaptation efforts so that for many, dislocation and migration becomes the only option.” The report, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, notes most research looks at the impacts of global warming by 2100 and so misses one of the biggest consequences for civilisation - the long-term melting of polar ice caps and sea-level rise.  This is because the great ice sheets take thousand of years to react fully to higher temperatures. The researchers say this long-term view raises moral questions about the kind of environment being passed down to future generations. The research shows that even with climate change limited to 2C by tough emissions cuts, sea level would rise by 25 metres over the next 2,000 years or so and remain there for at least 10,000 years - twice as long as human history. If today’s burning of coal, oil and gas is not curbed, the sea would rise by 50m, completely changing the map of the world. “We can’t keep building seawalls that are 25m high,” said Clark. “Entire populations of cities will eventually have to move.” By far the greatest contributor to the sea level rise - about 80% - would be the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet. Another new study in Nature Climate Change published on Monday reveals that some large Antarctic ice sheets are dangerously close to losing the sea ice shelves that hold back their flow into the ocean. Huge floating sea ice shelves around Antarctica provide buttresses for the glaciers and ice sheets on the continent. But when they are lost to melting, as happened the with Larsen B shelf in 2002, the speed of flow into the ocean can increase eightfold. Johannes Fürst, at the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany and colleagues, calculated that just 5% of the ice shelf in the Bellingshausen Sea and 7% in the Amundsen Sea can be lost before their buttressing effect vanishes. “This is worrying because it is in these regions that we have observed the highest rates of ice-shelf thinning over the past two decades,” he said. Avoiding the long-term swamping of many of the world’s greatest cities is already difficult, given the amount carbon dioxide already released into the atmosphere. “Sea-level rise is already baked into the system,” said Prof Stocker, one of the world’s leading climate scientists. However, the rise could be reduced and delayed if carbon is removed from the atmosphere in the future, he said: “If you are very optimistic and think we will be in the position by 2050 or 2070 to have a global scale carbon removal scheme - which sounds very science fiction - you could pump down CO2 levels. But there is no indication that this is technically possible.” A further difficulty is the large amount of heat and CO2 already stored in the oceans. Prof Stocker said: “The actions of the next 30 years are absolutely crucial for putting us on a path that avoids the [worst] outcomes and ensuring, at least in the next 200 years, the impacts are limited and give us time to adapt.” The researchers argue that a new industrial revolution is required to deliver a global energy system that emits no carbon at all. They conclude: “The success of the [UN climate summit in] Paris meeting, and of every future meeting, must be evaluated not only by levels of national commitments, but also by looking at how they will lead ultimately to the point when zero-carbon energy systems become the obvious choice for everyone.” “We are making choices that will affect our grandchildren’s grandchildren and beyond,” said Prof Daniel Schrag, at Harvard University in the US. “We need to think carefully about the long timescales of what we are unleashing.”"

"This is midwinter day, the halfway point between the winter solstice and spring equinox. The days are rapidly getting longer, by about four minutes, and it is marked as a significant day in many cultures. February 2 is celebrated by Christians as Candlemas, when the church candles are blessed, and by pagans as the Festival of Light. In America it is Groundhog Day, when this animal’s behaviour is said to foretell whether spring is coming.  In parts of Europe this folktale involves the hedgehog. On either continent if the animal emerges from the ground and can see his shadow he returns immediately to hibernation knowing that winter is set to continue. A British folklore rhyme about Candlemas “being sunny and bright, winter will have another flight, and if Candlemas be cloudy with rain, winter is gone and won’t come again”, makes roughly the same prophesy. This midwinter day, after the wild, wet and mild weather of the last two months, many would welcome animals seeing their shadows and hope it heralded a spell of frosty dry weather to bring the seasons back towards a normal pattern. But judging by the latest science published on Friday, looking at European weather over the last 30 years, we have already irrevocably changed our climate. Meteorologists are still reluctant to give weather forecasts for more than six days in advance, and hedgehogs being in short supply in Britain, it is hard to tell what the rest of the winter has in store. But looking at computer predictions for the direction and speed of the jet stream, more warm, wet weather is on the way."

"In orbit around the Earth on board the International Space Station, Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly captured this blue water image and tweeted it out with this message: “ A splash of #EarthArt over the #Bahamas! #YearInSpace.”  Part of Sierra Leone in west Africa. The country’s capital, Freetown, sits on a peninsula at the bottom of the image. North of Freetown and across the river, we can see the runways of the Lungi airport. The area in the central-right portion of the image is the Sierra Leone river estuary. The estuary is dominated by mangroves and lowland coastal plains and is an important breeding habitat for multiple waterbird species. Diverse socioeconomic activities are supported by the estuary, such as fishing, tourism and sea transport. But the estuary is being threatened by a growing population. Unauthorised housing development has caused the removal of about 20 hectares of mangrove vegetation over the past five years alone. Poor waste disposal, unsustainable fishing and many other factors are also taking their toll on the ecosystem.  While a large snowstorm in January 2016 blanketed the eastern United States, winter weather was also whitening areas across Asia. Jeju Island — just south of the mainland of the South Korea peninsula (obscured in this view by clouds) — received more snow than has been measured there since 1984, according to news reports. Accumulation of 12 centimetres (4.7 inches) of snow closed the island’s airport for a few days and stranded about 86,000 travellers. The wintery weather was not limited to South Korea. Snow also fell in areas of Taiwan, western and central Japan, and mainland China. After battles in Libya on 4–6 January, several fires were observed at oil production and storage facilities near Sidra, on the coast between Sirte and Benghazi. Smoke plumes from several oil tanks and facilities spread a pall of black smoke across the nation’s Mediterranean coast. The oil refinery fires continued throughout the month. The stream of black smoke that emanated from the refinery grew tremendously as the fires caused by the initial shelling spread to giant storage tanks.  Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record-keeping began in 1880, according to independent analyses by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Globally averaged temperatures in 2015 shattered the previous mark set in 2014 by 0.23F (0.13C).  The 2015 temperatures continue a long-term warming trend, according to analyses by scientists. The planet’s average surface temperature has risen about 1.8F (1C) since the late-19th century, a change largely driven by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 15 of the 16 warmest years on record occurring since 2001.  Phenomena such as El Niño or La Niña, which warm or cool the tropical Pacific Ocean, can contribute to short-term variations in global average temperature. A warming El Niño was in effect for most of 2015. London at midnight on Saturday 30 January, taken by British astronaut Tim Peake from the International Space Station.  Since August 2015, heavy rains have caused rivers to overflow and forced tens of thousands from their homes in Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil. Rosario, Argentina is north of Buenos Aires, on the western shore of the Parana River. The entire Parana River floodplain for hundreds of kilometres is still underwater or wet, as seen in this image from Nasa’s Terra spacecraft. Lake Poopó — once Bolivia’s second-largest lake and an important fishing resource for local communities — has essentially dried up. News reports blame recurrent drought and the diversion of the lake’s water sources for mining and agriculture. The right image was acquired in April 2013 when it still held water. The left image in January 2016, by which time the lake had dried up.  This is not the first time that Poopó has evaporated; the lake last dried up in 1994. In that case, it took several years for water to return, and even longer for ecosystems to recover. Morocco gets plenty of sun — about 3,000 hours per year, according to the Solar GCC Alliance. A new solar plant in the desert country is poised to take advantage of the ample Saharan sunlight. The image above shows the first phase of the solar complex, Noor 1, located on the edge of the Saharan desert in the south-central Moroccan town of Ouarzazate. The power station will be the size of the country’s capital city by the time it is finished in 2018, and provide electricity for 1.1 million people. Noor 1 will provide 160 megawatts (MW) of the ultimate 580MW capacity, helping Morocco to save hundreds of thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions per year. A massive winter storm system pummelled the eastern United States in late January 2016, with two low-pressure systems merging into a potent nor’easter that dropped heavy snow from Virginia to New England. By late afternoon on 23 January, snowfall totals were approaching records in several states, and hurricane-force winds were battering the coastlines and leading to serious flooding.  This image of the storm system was composed through the use of the VIIRS “day-night band,” which detects faint light signals such as city lights, moonlight, airglow, and auroras. In the image, the clouds are lit from above by the nearly full moon and from below by the lights of the heavily populated east coast. The city lights are blurred in places by cloud cover. This image of Virginia, Maryland, and Washington DC in the early afternoon on 24 January shows most neighbourhoods received at least 18-24in (46-61cm) of snowfall. This beautiful, natural-colour image features the small nation of Bahrain and parts of eastern Saudi Arabia. Located on the south-western coast of the Persian Gulf, Bahrain is a small Arab state, made up of an archipelago consisting of Bahrain Island and some 30 smaller islands. In the middle of the image, on the Persian Gulf, the King Fahd Causeway is clearly visible. On the right of the image is the island of Bahrain, home to some 1.5 million people, with its modern capital Manama featured at the top. The greys represent the densely built city centre and surrounding towns. On the top right part of the island, on a smaller island about 7 km north-east of the capital, Bahrain airport is visible. Towards the central left part of the island, Bahrain University and the Al Areen wildlife reservation. On the bottom-right tip of the island a series of horseshoe-shaped artificial atolls are clearly visible. On the left side of the image, in Saudi Arabia, part of the Rub’ al-Khali, the world’s largest sand desert, is also visible. Distinct throughout the entire image, the striking variations of blue represent the shallow versus deep waters, with the presence of coral reefs. Part of the astronaut experience is observing many different landscapes and geological patterns, especially in deserts where vegetation is rare. A crew member aboard the International Space Station took this photograph of a circular hill in the Kavir Desert in central Iran.  Numerous, multi-coloured lines on the sides of the hill show that it consists of many thin layers of sedimentary rock. The neighbouring dry lake has a white salt-covered surface. By contrast, the darkest areas are shrubby desert vegetation on the lowest slopes of the hill — the only zone where enough water concentrates to allow vegetation to grow. The astronaut might even be able to tell the difference between the long curved lines on the left of the image. One is an ancient shoreline formed when the lake contained permanent water and had waves strong enough to shape sediments into a smooth beach. The other curved, slightly irregular line is a harder rock layer protruding from the desert floor. It’s wintertime in the northern hemisphere, which means spectacular phytoplankton blooms return to the Arabian Sea, seen here off Oman (left), Pakistan (centre), and India (right).  Blooms show up this time of year in the Arabian Sea because of the winter monsoon. Winds shift from south-westerly to north-easterly, stirring up currents that bring nutrients up from the depths and out from coastal tributaries. The change in wind direction also picks up dust from the arid lands of south-western Asia, carrying it out over the sea. This dust contains mineral nutrients that phytoplankton need to fuel their growth. Dust storms help fertilise the ocean. They move nitrate, phosphate, and iron from the land into ocean surface waters around the world.  Out-of-control bushfires are still raging in Tasmania’s north-west, Australia. The Australian Conservation Foundation has called for the public inquiry as dozens of fires continue to ravage the world heritage forests and look set to burn for days or weeks to come. The world heritage area was home to a range of unique alpine flora including pencil pines, king billy pines and cushion plants, some more than 1,000 years old. Now more than 10,000 hectares of land has been incinerated, and ecologist say that, unlike eucalyptus trees, the ancient flora will not recover. In December 2015, torrential rains in parts of Missouri and Illinois led to severe flooding along the Mississippi river. The pulse of water that began in the river’s northern reaches eventually flowed all the way to Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico. The area between those two areas also saw river levels rise; the images above show flooding that occurred at the confluence of the Arkansas and Mississippi rivers. The image shows the rivers on 12 January 2016, when the Mississippi river had crested in the area of Arkansas City, Arkansas. As is often the case in winter, a thick river of haze hovered over the Indo-Gangetic Plain in January 2016, darkening skies over northern India and Bangladesh.  The haze likely resulted from a combination of urban and industrial pollution, agricultural and cooking fires, and a meteorological phenomenon known as a temperature inversion. Usually the air higher in the atmosphere is cooler than the air near the surface, a situation that allows warm air to rise and disperse pollutants. However, cold air often settles over northern India in the winter, trapping pollution near the surface, where it has the greatest effect on human health. Air pollution has emerged as a significant issue in India. Satellite observations show that levels of both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are rising. A recent World Health Organisation analysis of particulate pollution concluded that many of the world’s most polluted cities were in India. Meanwhile, New Delhi, India’s capital city, began an experiment to keep half of vehicles off the road for the first two weeks of January in an attempt to curb air pollution. Fires burning throughout Cambodia. Most of the fires burn in grass or cropland, which appears as a tan colour in this image showing heat signatures from fires in red. Scientists are beginning a new project that will use aircraft to monitor entire reef systems in Florida, Hawaii, Palau, the Mariana Islands, and Australia. The COral Reef Airborne Laboratory will use an airborne instrument called the Portable Remote Imaging Spectrometer to gather the data.  The team plans to visit the Republic of Palau, a chain of islands at the far western end of Micronesia. The island chain is comprised of 458 sq km of dry land, and approximately 525 sq km of reefs spread through the ocean. This image highlights portions of Ngerbard and Kossel reefs, which are located to the north of Palau’s largest island, Babeldaob. This image offers a wider view of the reefs surrounding Babeldaob. About half of Palau’s reefs are barrier reefs. These appear in long stretches along island coastlines, separated from the shoreline by a lagoon. The western side of Babeldaob has a well-developed barrier reef system that extends about 150km; the eastern side has some barrier reefs near the southern part of the island, but they are less developed and have gaps."

"Barack Obama called on Congress to double funding for clean energy research on Saturday, using his final budget request – and one of the last high-profile moments of his presidency – to push for action against climate change. The president said his final budget on Tuesday would propose doubling clean energy research spending from $6.4bn to $12.8bn by 2020.  “Rather than subsidise the past, we should invest in the future,” Obama said in his weekly address. “That’s why the budget I will send to Congress this Tuesday will double funding for clean energy research and development by 2020.” It was the third time in as many days that the White House has tried to use the budget to promote Obama’s climate change agenda. On Thursday, the White House told reporters Obama would ask Congress for an oil tax of $10 a barrel to help pay for high-speed rail, electric cars, and driverless vehicles. The move was immediately dismissed by Paul Ryan, the House speaker, as “dead on arrival”. But Obama indicated on Saturday that he expected Congress to at least give a hearing to his proposals for doubling down on clean energy research. “While Republicans in Congress are still considering their position on climate change, many of them realise that clean energy is an incredible source of good-paying jobs for their constituents,” Obama said in his address.  Republicans and Democrats have been working together in recent days to pass the first bipartisan energy bill in a decade - although progress has stalled over the response to the Flint water crisis. However, Obama said he believed there was still common ground on energy. “That’s why we were able to boost clean energy research and development in last year’s budget agreement. And I hope they support my plan to double that kind of investment,” the president said. The research initiative grew out of promises Obama made on the eve of the Paris climate summit when the US and other big economies pledged to ramp up $20bn in funding for clean energy research. A parallel initiative, led by a constellation of billionaires including Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, was launched to leverage more research funding from the private sector. The White House said in a conference call with reporters on Friday afternoon that Obama would seek more funds for research into battery storage, electric cars, and cleaner fuels. The budget will also seek substantial funding for research into nuclear reactors and carbon capture and storage technology – both technologies favoured by Republicans.  Tuesday’s budget is one of the last remaining opportunities left to Obama to shape the environmental agenda. In the coming months, the White House expects the Republican-controlled Congress to try to cut the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency, and so undermine its ability to enforce his signature achievements such as new rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants.  The White House also expects skirmishes over the Green Climate Fund, which was set up under the UN talks to try to help poor countries switch to cleaner fuels and protect their people against climate change."
"Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, said he was not told about cuts to CSIRO’s climate change research prior to it being publicly announced, and said continuing the organisation’s work would not be simple. At Senate estimates on Wednesday, Finkel was asked by Labor senator Kim Carr when he found out the CSIRO would be cutting 350 staff over two years from climate change research programs. “When they were publicly announced,” Finkel responded.   Finkel said since the announcement he had been discussing with leaders of other research bodies, including universities and the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), as to how the CSIRO’s research could be maintained.  Director of the BoM, Rob Vertessy, told Senate estimates on Monday he was only told of the cuts 24 hours before they were publicly announced. Vertessy said if the CSIRO were to drop its climate modelling work “it would leave a hole in the national development capability”. Prior to being questioned, Finkel delivered a statement addressing the CSIRO cuts. “There is no question that Australia needs a continuous and highly effective commitment to climate science, both to meet our national needs and to fulfil our international commitments,” he said.  “Our most immediate national concern must be to ensure that long-term data collections will be funded and staffed, and that the climate modelling capabilities developed by the CSIRO will continue to be made available for scientists to use and refine. “I am pleased that the CSIRO has this week committed to working with stakeholders to develop a transition plan to maintain this capacity.” Finkel said other research institutions potentially had the capacity to take on some of the CSIRO cuts, but it would not be simple. “I’m not saying it’s a simple case of absorbing the changes that have happened. But I am saying that those changes are happening in the context of a lot of capacity ... I’m not in any way dismissing the significance of the changes at the CSIRO,” he said. Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of NSW, told Guardian Australia on Tuesday there was no way a university could take on that responsibility. “I mean I run a centre of excellence which is the best-funded university capability in the country and we do not remotely have the capability to be the custodians for the climate modelling systems,” Pitman said. “We live and breathe on a three-year funding cycle with an 80% failure rate. You cannot run a national capability in that environment.” Last week chief executive of the CSIRO, Larry Marshall,  told staff  that 350 positions would be cut as the organisation moved away from researching climate change. Scientists around the world have since spoken out against the move.  On Monday, the World Climate Research Program, part of the World Meteorological Organisation, put out a statement criticising the cuts. “We read that these cuts occur in the name of innovation,” it said. “One can hardly imagine a worse and more backward step toward any of those laudable goals than ignoring climate and discarding climate research.” Paul Durack of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US has been collecting signatures from international climate scientists for an open letter to the Australian government calling for the CSIRO capabilities threatened by the cuts to be saved. More than 2,100 signatures have been collected so far. The CSIRO Staff Association has lodged a formal dispute with management over the job losses, claiming CSIRO management breached their enterprise agreement by failing to consult with staff over changes that could impact on their jobs.  A spokesman for the association said a meeting of members next week would consider industrial action."

"The death of Antonin Scalia on Saturday, at the age of 79, created an opening on the US supreme court.   Paying tribute to Scalia, President Obama said he would nominate a successor. In the Senate and on the campaign trail, however, Republicans said they would not cooperate, even to the extent of scheduling a nomination hearing in the upper house they control, at any point in the president’s final year in office. We could be in for a year or more with only eight justices on the supreme court, balanced four-four between conservatives and liberals. What will this – and the political identity of Scalia’s eventual successor – mean for the key issues that divide America today? It is the most significant abortion case in 23 years, and the supreme court will have to make its decision without the man who has defined its conservative voice for decades. The high court is preparing to hear a challenges to Texas’s harsh anti-abortion law – perhaps the toughest in the nation. In the immediate wake of Scalia’s passing, it was clear what the loss could mean. At Saturday night’s Republican presidential debate in South Carolina, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas warned: “We are one justice away from a supreme court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states.” Whoever replaces Scalia, however, may join the court only after the eight remaining justices strike a decisive blow to the anti-abortion movement. The Texas case concerns a 2013 law that required all abortion providers to have a physician with hospital admitting privileges and to follow the hospital-like regulations governing ambulatory surgical centers. Only the first provision of the bill is in effect, and it has closed more than half of Texas’s 41 abortion clinics. What makes the Texas case so consequential is that it asks the justices to clarify how far a state can go in restricting abortion before a law becomes unconstitutional. In 1992, in Planned Parenthood v Casey, the court gave states the right to restrict abortion in the interest of the woman’s health as long as the restriction was not an “undue burden” on abortion access. Lower courts have been using different standards of evidence to decide what makes a law a health measure as opposed to an “undue burden”. In the case of the Texas law, the fifth circuit court of appeals ruled that courts did not need to scrutinize the evidence for the law as long as Texas lawmakers felt that they were passing a necessary health measure. (Major medical associations have argued that there is no evidence the Texas law will make abortion safer than it already is.) Other federal courts have ruled the opposite, and struck down similar anti-abortion measures. For those hoping that the court will halt the spread of harsh anti-abortion laws, the basic arithmetic hasn’t changed. Anthony Kennedy, the court’s moderate, would still need to side with the four liberal justices for a 5-3 ruling against Texas’s law and setting broad limits on other laws like it. The broadest possible ruling would invalidate similar measures that have been challenged in Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wisconsin, laws that together threaten more than 20 clinics. Such a ruling would make it far more difficult to pass new restrictions. For abortion foes, Scalia’s death has sharply narrowed the range of good outcomes. The best they can hope for is probably a 4-4 split, with Kennedy joining the conservative minority. In the event of a tie, the decision that is being appealed takes effect. The Texas law would go fully into effect, and all but nine or 10 clinics in the state would have to shut down. But a tie does not set a nationwide precedent, meaning the question of how far states can go in regulating abortion will be left unanswered. Moreover, those laws that would have shut down more than 20 clinics across the south and midwest will remain blocked: a 5-4 conservative ruling for would have allowed those laws to take effect. Abortion foes, in other words, are missing out on a chance to drastically remap abortion access in America. In Louisiana and Alabama, the number of abortion clinics would have dropped from five to one. Mississippi, which has one clinic today, would have become the first state without any abortion providers despite Roe v Wade, the 1973 case that established a right to abortion. There is a similar test case available to the court, concerning an admitting privileges law in Mississippi. The court could vote to hear that case in its new term beginning in October, when the bench may be full again. The court could also postpone the Texas case until then. Abortion is sure to come up as the Senate considers whoever President Obama nominates to take Scalia’s place. In modern nominations, the potential justice’s leanings on abortion have always been hugely contentious. But whoever is the next justice to join the court might not see an abortion case this big for decades. Molly Redden When the supreme court ruled in 2008 that the second amendment gives Americans an individual right to own a firearm, it was Antonin Scalia who wrote the historic and controversial majority opinion. The decision in District of Columbia v Heller, which struck down a local handgun ban, was 5-4. It was also Scalia who last month joined Clarence Thomas’s strongly worded dissent when the supreme court chose not to reconsider a seventh circuit court of appeals decision that an Illinois city’s assault weapon ban was constitutional. “If a broad ban on firearms can be upheld based on conjecture that the public might feel safer (while being no safer at all), then the second amendment guarantees nothing,” the dissent argued.  Scalia’s death throws the supreme court’s divided stance on the second amendment into question. Dave Kopel, an attorney and gun rights advocate, was part of the legal team that won a historic victory in the Heller case. “President Obama has said he believes the second amendment is an individual right, but in terms of what he thinks it protects, it’s a vanishingly small right,” he said. “The politics of what happens in a confirmation process is unclear, but based on the past, we can expect that he will appoint someone who will pay lip service to the second amendment and then vote to overturn Heller.” Kopel said he testified in the Senate confirmation hearings of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Sotomayor, he said, “told the Senate that she considered Heller settled precedent”, but then voted against it “at the first opportunity”, when she joined the dissent in the 2010 McDonald v Chicago case, which clarified that the second amendment individual right established in the Heller case also applied to the states. Since the Heller and McDonald cases, the supreme court has dodged several opportunities to further clarify the scope of the second amendment, prompting questions among legal observers about whether the court has become gun-shy. While the supreme court does not have any cases immediately on deck that involve the second amendment, Kopel said, there are gun rights cases in the pipeline, including the appeal of a second circuit decision upholding assault weapon bans in New York and Connecticut. Scalia’s loss has shifted his perspective on the security of gun rights in the US, he said. “Of course it’s concerning,” he said. “It was only a 5-4 decision.” Lois Beckett In April, the supreme court is expected to hear arguments on the White House’s plan to defer deportation for millions of illegal immigrants. In theory, Scalia’s death might not have a big impact on the issue.  Only five votes are required to uphold Obama’s decision to use executive power to allow up to 5 million more immigrants to apply for quasi-legal status and work permits.  Obama can count on the four liberal members of the court to back his move. If the administration can win the support of Anthony Kennedy or John Roberts, the chief justice, the president will be able to move forward. Otherwise, the plan will be blocked.  Either way, the decision could redefine the balance of power between the executive and legislature. Obama’s critics accuse him of consistently overstepping his authority. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, for example, has urged the court to make it clear that no president can “unilaterally rewrite congressional laws and circumvent the people’s representatives”. Obama’s program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or Dapa, would allow as many as five million undocumented migrants to apply for work permits.  In 2014, Obama told millions of undocumented migrants: “You can come out of the shadows.” But the plan was almost immediately challenged. Obama asked the court to move quickly on the issue – to which the court agreed – but it also added in the question of the constitutionality of Obama’s effort to force the programme into law. Democratic presidential candidates have said they would continue the programme if it is upheld by the court. Most of the Republicans in the race have vowed to dismantle it and redouble immigration enforcement.  In the event that a decision is not taken, Scalia’s absence could also the block the executive from introducing similar moves. Edward Helmore One of Scalia’s last acts on the bench was to issue a stay ruling that could send Obama’s clean power plan, which regulates carbon emissions from power plants, back to a lower court. The court’s stay order came in 5-4 vote, reflecting a split between the liberal and conservative wings, with no explanation given. It left the administration without a back-up plan. Obama referred to the decision as “unusual”, but sought to comfort supporters that the administration remains confident the legislation will ultimately succeed.  Still, the stay has left supporters of the clean power regulations in a difficult situation. The supreme court issued stay after a lower court refused to do so – the first time court justices have issued a stay before any court heard arguments.  While the Clean Power Plan registers broad public support, the legislation has been opposed by 26 states and the energy industry and 15 attorneys general are in support of efforts to limit electricity sector responsibility for nearly a third of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. The clean power plan is the centrepiece of the administration’s efforts to address climate change – and Obama’s environmental legacy.  If the decision is kicked back to the lower DC circuit court of appeals, it could favour the administration. The DC panel is made up of mostly Democratic appointees, and is likely to dismiss the states’ argument that the clean power plan is illegal and represents federal government overreach. In that event, though, the supreme court would still have to overturn its stay – which would be problematic if Scalia’s seat remains empty. But the supreme court’s stay has also rendered the Environmental Protection Agency unable to enforce any part of the bill until the litigation is over – marking a significant victory for opponents of regulation to restrict greenhouse gas emissions.

"Confusion surrounds the selection process for the “best minister in the world” award bestowed upon Greg Hunt at the World Government Summit in Dubai for his efforts to reduce carbon emissions. According to the summit’s website in the United Arab Emirates, the “best minister in the world” award was “thoroughly and independently managed by Thomson Reuters where the search for the nominees is conducted according to the established criteria”.  According to a radio interview by the “humbled” Hunt, the award was also initiated by Reuters. “Reuters news agency said to the UAE government that they’d like to create the award and present it at the World Government Summit,” the federal environment minister said. “They then commissioned the World Bank, the OECD, Ernst & Young and an international strategic firm called Strategy and Co to draw up a list of 100 – they then winnowed it down to 10. They used a series of criteria, they had a voting program – and we didn’t know about it, and I got a call just over a week ago.” But Thomson Reuters said it was “not correct” to say that the company initiated the award or were responsible for designing the selection process. “Thomson Reuters was solely responsible for assisting in the administration of the award, to a set of criteria approved by the World Government Summit organisers,” said Tarek Fleihan, head of corporate communications for the financial information company in the Middle East, Africa and Russia. Thomson Reuters promised a full clarifying statement, but has not yet issued one. Reuters news said it had no involvement in the process. Accepting the award at the summit, Hunt said that “on a personal level I am genuinely humbled to receive this award. I am, however, deeply proud that this inaugural award is being presented to an environment minister.”  In an interview with Fairfax Media, Hunt described his win as “really an award for Australia” and reassured readers that his wife had insisted he “still had to put the bins out”. The website says there were nominations from 80 countries, which were assessed based on four criteria: “The aim of this award is to recognise innovation in global government work and highlight ministerial initiatives that have resulted in positive changes in their communities,” the UAE minister of cabinet affairs, Mohammed Al Gergawi, told the summit as he gave Hunt the award. “Our world today needs ministers to serve as role models of thought and action, which bring about progress and welfare and improve general societal wellbeing.” Official statistics released in December revealed Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions increased in the year to the end of June 2015 by 0.8% and by 1.3% when land use and deforestation were taken into account. On Wednesday the Greens deputy leader, Scott Ludlam, attacked Hunt’s “brazen audacity” over accepting the “best minister in the world” award.  In a satirical address to the nation, Ludlam said while the award “might sound like something his mum made up ... on behalf of the Australian Greens I am asking you to join me in calling on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to declare February the 10th a public holiday to mark this unique occasion”.

"They have bloviated about carpet bombing, bickered about walls, and waxed anti-Muslim and -migrant, but over more than 16 hours of debate, the Republican candidates for president have almost entirely ignored what most of the world fears most: the rising tides and temperatures of climate change.  Last week, Fox News moderators asked only one question relevant to climate change, about whether Florida senator Marco Rubio would support regulation to lower emissions. Rubio said he would not: “I do not believe that we have to destroy our economy in order to protect our environment.” On the trail, former Florida governor Jeb Bush interjected to say the free market would resolve climate change before government could. “There’s someone in a garage somewhere,” he said, “parochially I hope it’s in Miami, that’s going to have a clue, to have an answer to this.” Miami will settle for anyone doing something – so long as it’s before environmental changes driven by humans destroy the city’s economy. Late last week, Mayor Tomás Regalado joined 14 other south Florida mayors in signing an open letter to Rubio, asking him to give up his opposition to climate change action. The low-lying city and its nearby resorts and islands suffer near annual floods from rising sea levels, costing the city hundreds of millions. The mayors warned that a 1ft increase in sea level could “wipe out as much as $4bn” in real estate, and 3ft could cost $31bn and swallow large sections of the Florida Keys and greater Miami area. “We need a realistic national plan to slow global warming emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change,” the mayors wrote. “The science is well established: protecting the long-term future of our cities must include preventing global temperatures from rising.” One of the signatories, South Miami mayor Philip Stoddard, was more blunt a few years before Rubio’s presidential bid.  “Rubio is an idiot,” he told the Guardian at the time. “He says he is not a scientist so he doesn’t have a view about climate change and sea-level rise and so won’t do anything about it.” Rubio’s professed ignorance has shifted to skepticism – a sign that many Republicans have reluctantly accepted that the issue exists for voters, if not that the issue matters. Last year, Rubio and two of his rivals, senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, agreed in a symbolic vote that climate change is “is real and not a hoax”. Of the three, only Paul voted to agree that human activity causes global warming. None have agreed that climate change exacerbates threats to national security and the economy, although the point is agreed on by Pentagon officials, Nasa scientists, foreign policy experts, dozens of Republican and Democratic leaders, international researchers and the pope.  The candidates might be playing simple politics – no one wants to be seen agreeing with Barack Obama or Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, who called climate denial a “charade” on Sunday night – but they have also tried out several arguments to discredit the dangers and science of climate change. That not all data indicates constant warming is one of the preferred arguments of Ted Cruz, who held a Senate hearing last month titled Data or Dogma.  To testify, Cruz called a retired Princeton physicist who believes the planet needs more carbon dioxide; a controversial climate scientist convinced of corruption in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); a climate scientist who insists basic models need reinvention; and a Canadian jazz vocalist who frequents the Rush Limbaugh Show and recorded an album about cats. With the help of his witnesses and RSS satellite data since 1998, Cruz argued: “There has been no significant global warming for the past 18 years.” But the senator chose a very specific set of data: an extraordinary El Niño set record temperatures in 1998, and by the RSS metric global warming has slowed in the 18 years since. The result was a chart that began with a peak and spanned not quite two decades of slow warming.  Carl Mears, the senior research scientist whose data Cruz used, told the Guardian that Cruz was guilty of the crime with which he charges scientists: presenting a very partial argument.  “He ignores other time periods, and other types of data,” said Mears, stressing surface temperatures “that do not support his hypothesis. He asserts that the satellite temperatures are more accurate than the surface temperature without providing any supporting evidence.” Despite his own work with satellite data sets, Mears said he suspects surface data sets are more accurate. “I agree with Mr Cruz that policy should follow science and data,” he said. “But it is important to follow all the data, not just the part that supports one side of the argument.” Rubio has also spoken of the “hiatus”, which Mears and others are studying and which remains only part of the picture. Last year was the hottest on record by far, smashing a record set only a year earlier. A witness called by Democrats to Cruz’s Senate hearing, David Titley, a Penn State meteorologist and former navy admiral, rebuffed Cruz. Titley noted that science by definition contains error and revision – demonstrated, for instance, by the corrections made to satellite data produced by his fellow witnesses.  He also showed a clear curve of rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels since 1880.  “There are plenty of other signs that are far less equivocal, and perhaps even more relevant to those of us who live on the Earth’s surface,” he said. “Land and ocean surface temperatures are increasing, sea ice is declining, glaciers are shrinking, oceans are rising, the list goes on.” Cruz mentioned a ship that got stuck in ice around Antarctica, arguing that the polar ice caps are not melting.  Charles Bentley, an expert on Antarctica at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told the Guardian that sea ice floats.  “If someone says sea ice in the same sentence as related to sea level change, a red flag goes up.” Bentley called the argument “a little bit misleading”, because sea ice, although an indirect sign of change around the poles, “doesn’t directly indicate anything”. Cruz’s argument also ignores the clear melting of ice and glaciers on and around the north pole, where Russia, Canada and the US are competing over newly open ocean. Rubio and Cruz have both said they would pull the US out of the historic Paris climate accords, and with Bush and New Jersey governor Chris Christie said they oppose any measures that would “destroy” the economy or stifle business. Donald Trump, Bush and John Kasich have mocked the Paris summit as an unnecessary diversion. If the US withdrew from the Paris deal, it would join North Korea, Syria, Libya and Venezuela among the handful of nations who refuse to sign. The aversion to all regulation is a major departure from the policies of Republicans past. Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency, Ronald Reagan’s staff invented the cap and trade system, George HW Bush signed the Clean Air Act and Teddy Roosevelt protected 230m acres of land.  But the candidates have largely agreed with Rubio, who in a debate said: “We are not going to destroy our economy, make America a harder place to create jobs, in order to pursue a policy that will do nothing, nothing to change our climate.” How climate change action might affect the economy depends on the measures involved; most of those proposed affect the worst emissions producers, such as coal – an industry in decline in the US for decades.  In 2014, about 67% of electricity generated in the US was from fossil fuels, according to the EIA, though oil only accounted for 1%. The US natural gas industry faces more pressure from cheap Opec oil than investment in renewable energy.  But in 2011, before the industry was rocked by low oil prices, the five main fossil fuel industries still accounted for less than 2% of all US non-agricultural employment. Doing nothing also has its consequences, as south Florida businesses have tried to remind Republicans. By exacerbating flooding, water and energy crises and mass migration, climate change threatens to devastate the world economy – US gas industry included – according to a survey of 750 economists, conducted last year.  Economists at Stanford and UC Berkeley also published a study last year that found rising temperatures will likely exacerbate inequality."

"Up to 350 positions at Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation will be made redundant, with its climate research divisions to bear the brunt of the job losses. The chief executive of the national science agency, Larry Marshall, said the redundancies were in line with CSIRO’s 2020 strategy to increase collaboration with industry and boost commercialisation of science.  The former Silicon Valley entrepreneur told staff in an email obtained by Guardian Australia the agency’s research had pioneered climate models and honed their measurements “to prove climate change”. “That question has been answered, and the new question is what do we do about it, and how can we find solutions for the climate we will be living with?” He said job losses were in line with the agency’s 2020 strategy to transform Australian businesses, particularly the resource industry, so they could compete in “a new and uncertain future”. “Digital technology will disrupt every Australian industry and each part of our business must reinvent itself to help Australia respond to this global challenge,” he said. “As our business unit leaders work through the process of realigning their teams for the new strategy it is inevitable that there will be job losses.” The worst-affected areas would be the agency’s units on manufacturing, land and water, oceans and atmosphere, and its new “data innovation hub”, Data61, he said. “Our headcount is projected to be unchanged at the end of a two year period, but it is anticipated there could be up to 175 less CSIRO people per year during this two year transition.” A CSIRO spokesman, Huw Morgan, confirmed that staff were being told of the changes on Thursday. He said the changes were part of a strategic shift in the organisation towards climate change “mitigation and adaptation [and] data collection and analysis, how we can use data in science and innovation”. Andy Pitman, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales, questioned whether the nature of climate change had been fully understood.  “[Questions about climate change have] been answered in the same way that Galileo answered the structure of the universe when he used the first telescope,” he said. “We have considerable confidence in how average climate will change globally and to a degree over Australia. What we don’t know is how extremes will change, how cyclones will change in intensity, how much heat waves will intensify, which are exactly what you need to know in order to adapt.” He said the cuts would diminish Australia’s understanding of its climate. “It will lead to Australia adapting to things that won’t happen, and not adapting to things that will happen, with a much higher probability,” he said. Pitman said that over time, a partnership between Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO and the university sector had built a collaboration that had the capacity to guide adaptation to climate change. “That partnership is breaking up and I think that is going to be to the deep regret of governments in the future.” CSIRO’s oceans and atmosphere flagship is a world leader on many aspects of climate science. Its staff include scientists such as Pep Cannedel, who leads the global carbon project, a major international project that tracks the carbon cycle, identifying out where carbon is produced and where it goes. It also includes scientists such as Wenju Cai, who is among the world’s leading experts on the interaction between oceans and the atmosphere. His work has uncovered, among other things, the nature of El Niño, a climate phenomenon that redistributes rainfall around the globe. The head of the CSIRO staff association, Sam Popovski, said he was “bewildered” by job losses “in these fundamental landmark areas of science that CSIRO’s had a world-leading reputation in”. “The new CEO has obviously come in and developed a new strategy, which is moving the organisation towards a more commercial and digital technology focus,” he said. “On its own, that’s not an issue, but to do that while also throwing away a lot of research that’s in the public interest seems a retrograde step.” He said staff were sceptical that “any assurances about job numbers two years out will come to fruition”, he said. Successive federal funding cuts, including a $115m reduction in the 2014 federal budget, have seen the agency’s staffing levels shrink by 20% in the past years, equal to around 1,400 jobs. Guardian Australia revealed in November 2014 that science and research roles were hit hardest by the cuts. A senior climate researcher at CSIRO told Guardian Australia that staff were “completely in the dark” about the cuts and have been getting their information from the media."
"Nearly two-thirds of schoolchildren in the US are taught lessons on climate change that do not rise to the level of a sound science education, according to new research on Thursday. The finding provide new evidence on the source of the confusion and denial surrounding global warming in American public life. In the first national survey of classroom science teachers, researchers found there was short shrift given to the teaching of climate change in public middle and high schools in all 50 states.  The survey of 1,500 teachers, published in Science on Thursday, found most pupils spend only an hour or two in the course of an academic year learning about climate change in middle and high school – and much of what they are taught is confusing or simply wrong.  Only 38% of American schoolchildren were taught lessons that adhere to the scientific consensus that climate change is largely the result of the burning of fossil fuels, the researchers from Pennsylvania State University and the National Centre for Science Education found.  Some 30% of teachers spent less than an hour on climate change during the last academic year, the researchers found. In higher grades, much of that time was spent going over old material without introducing more advanced material. Some 7% attributed recent warming to natural causes – which is simply wrong – while 4% of teachers avoided talking about the cause of climate change. Another 22% said their lessons mentioned the scientific consensus – but also that there was significant disagreement among scientists, which is also incorrect.  The findings suggest that younger generations – those most likely to experience the havoc and stress of climate change in their lifetimes – are not getting the education to best serve their needs. Eric Plutzer, a political scientist at Penn State, and a co-author of the study, said: “We don’t think that is good preparation for citizens to be effective in advocating for policies that are going to be critical to their own generation and their children and grandchildren.” The lack of teaching and the mixed messages about climate change leave schoolchildren more susceptible to disinformation about climate change spread by political or corporate interests once they enter adulthood, the researchers said. The energy industry has spent millions funding climate denial and supporting Republicans in Congress who deny global warming is occurring. Indeed, the researchers found that many of the teachers themselves were confused about the causes of climate change. Only 30% of middle school teachers and 45% of high school teachers said that human activity was the main driver of climate change, the researchers found. Their findings are in line with other studies which have found systemic failings in the teaching of climate change. A Stanford University study of science textbooks used in California public schools last year found misleading material.  Unlike other, more informal surveys, the researchers did not give much weight to the idea that the teachers faced political and parental pressure to avoid teaching the science. But politics remained a factor in how teachers decided to teach the material, Plutzer said.  “Politics intrude in the same form it takes in the public debate, with teachers whether consciously or not aligning in much the same way as political groups do outside the classroom.” However, the researchers said it would be unfair to heap the blame on teachers. Climate science was not yet part of the testable curriculum for many schools – which means there were fewer guidelines available to teachers. That also meant that teachers were inclined to spend more time teaching other material that students would encounter on standardized tests. Some of the teachers were also caught out by the rapid advances in climate science. Fewer than half of teachers reported receiving any training in climate science at university, said Josh Rosenau, policy director for the National Center for Science in Education and a co-author. “The scientific community has not made sure that teachers are kept up to date with those advances,” he said, adding that there should be continuing education programs on climate change for teachers."
"Hours before New Hampshire’s primary voters made Donald Trump the favorite for the Republican presidential nomination Tuesday night – I can’t really believe this even as I type it – the US supreme court reminded us of why the upcoming presidential election is so important. On a party-line vote, the court temporarily stopped Barack Obama’s clean power plan from going into effect. This decision could well portend a future one that will have devastating consequences – not only for the climate but for the state of our lawmaking process. The decision also underscores the urgency of the November elections in two ways: it will be a choice between a candidate who supports taking action against climate change and one who believes it should be ignored, and it will present a choice between a president who believes that the federal government has the authority to effectively regulate and one who believes that the supreme court should arbitrarily throw monkey wrenches into the political process.  The clean power plan is a set of regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions in the face of climate change. In addition to improved fuel economy standards for vehicles, the Environmental Protection Agency announced carbon dioxide emissions standards that would, barring major technological advancements, make coal-fired power plants nearly impossible to build. These regulations would not, in and of themselves, save the planet, but they represent an important step. But 29 states, mostly led by Republicans, took the issue to the courts. A lawsuit arguing that the regulations are illegal is currently pending at the DC circuit court of appeals, which is likely to hear the case in June. In the meantime, the supreme court’s stay Tuesday means that the regulations will not go into effect at least until the lower court issues its ruling in the fall, and most likely means that they will not go into effect before the upcoming presidential election (assuming the supreme court decides to keep the stay in effect while deciding whether to take the case itself). Because of the ruling, the court might be able to kill the clean power plan without even ruling on it. If the Republicans win the White House, the regulations would never go into effect, because the incoming president would reverse Obama’s executive order. Admittedly, a new Republican administration could rescind the regulations anyway, but it is more difficult to stop a program that is in effect than to stop one from being implemented in the first place. Either Democratic candidate would support the CPP, but there’s at least a chance that the supreme court will find that the regulations exceed the authority of the executive branch and still get rid of them. None of this means there are good arguments against the legality of the CPP. As Harvard law professors Jody Freeman and Richard Lazarus, have explained, the plan should be upheld – in particular, because the constitutional arguments against it are absurd. One of the arguments against the CPP is that the regulations constitute a “taking” without fair compensation from coal companies, which would violate the fifth amendment. If taken seriously, this argument from the libertarian fringe would render most of the contemporary regulatory state unconstitutional. As Freeman and Lazarus observe, not “even one single Justice in more than two centuries of cases [has] endorsed such a reading of the fifth amendment”. It’s probably a non-starter even with the Roberts court. Energy interests also argue that the CPP, which involves cooperation between federal and state officials, is a constitutionally impressible coercion of state officials. This is based on a couple of controversial supreme court decisions that have prohibited the federal government from “commandeering” officials of state governments. It’s a very weak argument in this context, although the high court’s conservatives have bought similarly weak federalism arguments in the past. The most likely path by which the supreme court could attack the CPP would be to argue that it exceeds the authority given to the executive branch under the Clean Air Act. In theory, this would allow Congress to change the law to permit the executive branch to enact necessary carbon regulations. While superficially more modest than a constitutional ruling, as long as Republicans control the House of Representative it would guarantee that these needed regulations would not go into effect even with a Democrat in the White House.  Even if the court ultimately upholds the regulations and the Democratic party retains the White House, the decision to stay the CPP from going into effect will delay regulation that is urgently needed. At worst, it will tie the hands of the government and prevent it from addressing one of the most urgent problems facing the country and the world, based on arguments that constitute far-right crackpottery."

"Europe has almost certainly experienced warmer summers in the last three decades than at any other time since the Roman empire, according to a study published on Friday in the Environmental Research Letters journal. Since 1986, mean summer temperatures have been about 1.3C hotter than they were two millennia ago, while heatwaves have been longer, more frequent and more persistent, the study says.  The paper was compiled by 40 prominent academics, using tree-ring analysis, climate modelling and historical documentary evidence from the notes of doctors, priests and monks. “This degree of warming is unprecedented in the last two thousand years,” Professor Jürg Luterbacher, the report’s coordinator, told the Guardian. “It is exceptionally high and cannot be explained by natural variability, tropical volcanoes or solar changes. It is because of anthropogenic [manmade] climate change.” While the paper offers new insights into the effects that volcanic eruptions, solar variability and land use change can have on climate, its range is limited to periods between June and August.  Much of the data for the period before 755 comes from analysis of tree rings and density information from three pine tree species in Finland, Austria and Sweden. These trees grow in warm weather but are dormant in the cold, meaning that their rings, density – and the outside temperatures – can only be measured in summer.  After 755, more pine trees in countries such as Switzerland, France and eventually Spain become accessible to the scientists, allowing spatial variations – or regional differences – to be more accurately recorded, and comparisons to be drawn. “The anomalous recent warmth is particularly clear in southern Europe, where variability is generally smaller, and where the signal of anthropogenic climate change is expected to emerge earlier,” the report says. The report finds evidence that past swings in summer temperatures were larger than previously thought. It says that summers were warmer between Roman times and the third century, before cooling until the 7th century. A warmer medieval interlude was then punctured by a ‘Little Ice Age’ that lasted from the 14th to the 19th centuries. As the 20th century dawned, the effects of climate change became progressively more pronounced. “Summer temperatures during the last 30 years have been anomalously high and we find no evidence of any period in the last 2,000 years that has been so warm,” the paper says.

"Dr Penny Whetton had spent 25 years working on climate change modelling for Australia’s premier science agency, but in 2014 it was time to go. “I could see the writing on the wall,” says Whetton, who put up her hand to take a redundancy package in October 2014.  This week, she has heard of the anger and sadness among her former CSIRO colleagues at the news that climate change research is being targeted for cutbacks and redundancies. Whetton still holds an Honorary Research Fellow position at the agency, where she had worked as a senior principal research scientist and one of the key people leading the CSIRO’s climate modelling work. She is one of a very small handful of Australian scientists to have been a lead author on three consecutive Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports. Her central role has been to use climate models to work out the implications for climate change on Australia. Whetton had also been a leader of the project to deliver the latest climate change projections across Australia, released last year. In short, Whetton has intimate knowledge of what Australia’s climate modelling expertise is being used for. This week’s announcement by CSIRO executive director Larry Marshall has angered many in the country’s climate science community, who have been queuing up to criticise the moves. But beyond the implications of the announcement, there has also been much bemusement about Marshall’s statements and his apparent simplistic understanding of aspects of climate science. If Whetton saw the writing on the wall in October 2014 then surely everyone else should have been able to see the letters scrawled metres high when Marshall was appointed that same month. In one of his first interviews, Marshall appeared to be intrigued by water dowsing - the ancient idea that farmers could use sticks together with a mysterious unidentified perception to find water under the soil. Former CSIRO chief of Land and Water told Science at the time that he was “appalled” by Marshall’s statements on dowsing.  Marshall has a scientific background (he studied physics), but before taking the job at CSIRO he had spent 25 years in Silicon Valley starting tech companies and working as a venture capitalist. In an email to staff this week, Marshall acknowledged Australia’s climate models were “among the best in the world”, saying “our measurements honed those models to prove global climate change”. Elsewhere, Marshall has said that we “spent probably a decade trying to answer the question ‘is the climate changing’” before then suggesting that “after Paris, that question has been answered”. There are several things wrong here. One is that the main use of CSIRO’s climate modelling work has not been to “prove” that humans are changing the climate. Another is the frankly bizarre idea that the question of human influence on the climate was answered only three months ago at the Paris climate talks. Dr Whetton told me: “At what point did we know with a high level of certainty that humans were changing the climate? Well, the IPCC in 2007 said human influence was unequivocal.” While it’s true that models have been used to measure human impacts, this has not been the focus of modelling work at CSIRO.  “The work [at CSIRO] was very much supporting climate adaptation work,” says Whetton. “Proving global climate change? I don’t know what [Marshall] means by that. That’s settled. What needs to be further pursued are the details of regional climate change. “The models are there to understand how the climate works but also to make projections for the future. That’s the information that you need to do appropriate adaptation planning and to calculate costs and benefits of mitigation actions. “None of that regional climate work is settled. We need to refine our projections.” As an example, Whetton pointed out that while there was now a lot of evidence pointing to a decline in rainfall in the south of Australia, there was “less certainty” about what would happen in the north. The north of Australia happens to be the area where the Liberal Government has fantasised about creating new food bowls, new industries and new communities.  Professor Steve Sherwood, the director of the University of New South Wales Climate Change Research Centre said: “Marshall speaks of contributing to the proposed agricultural development of the Northern Territory, but we don’t know for how much longer this region will still support agriculture or even human habitation as the Earth keeps warming, nor how much drying (if any) Australia’s existing agricultural regions will experience.  “The groups that would help provide answers are the ones he says we don’t need any more.”  In interviews this week, Marshall has said he has been inspired by the approach taken by Netflix and its high performance culture. Professor Samantha Hepburn, Director of the Centre for Energy and Natural Resources Law at Deakin Law School, pointed out that CSIRO was “not a technology startup” but was a “crucial agency for social and environmental progression”.  Whetton said the reaction among her former colleagues had been “initially shock and disbelief” because many had not seen the latest announcement coming.  “Certainly now there’s a lot of anger as well,” she said, “but we don’t know the full details yet.”  “It is not just that people feel their jobs are under personal threat,” she said. “They can’t imagine why such an important part of scientific research to support Australia’s decision making is to be shut down. It is difficult to believe that anything like our current efforts will be maintained. “New modelling work is being done right now. Who will do the job that CSIRO has always done in interpreting those models to understand the impacts for Australia. Where will that advice come from in the future?” Perhaps we could ask Netflix?"

"The UK’s carbon budget for the early 2030s does not need to be tightened despite a tougher global warming target agreed in Paris last month, the government’s climate advisers have told ministers. Campaigners said a letter published on Thursday from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to energy and climate secretary, Amber Rudd, was “desperately disappointing” for failing to increase the ambition of the so-called fifth carbon budget in light of the Paris climate deal.  Nearly 200 governments in Paris agreed to work towards keeping global temperature rises below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, a more exacting target than the 2C previously agreed on by leaders, and which the UK carbon budgets are based on. It also required a longterm reduction to net zero emissions, which is more ambitious than the UK’s Climate Change Act. The proposed fifth carbon budget’s 57% cut in emissions by 2032 was laid out before Paris by the committee, and has yet to be legislated on. In today’s letter, it said the budget’s demands were the minimum necessary to meet the UK’s international responsibilities under the Paris accord. New government policies would be needed to reach this target, the committee wrote in its letter, because current policies would not be enough.  The current Conservative government has rowed back on a variety of carbon-cutting strategies, for instance by slashing the subsidies available for onshore wind and solar power; abandoning the green deal scheme for encouraging home insulation, without a replacement policy; and scrapping the target for zero-carbon homes. Craig Bennett, Friends of the Earth’s CEO, said: “This is desperately disappointing advice from the government’s climate advisor. Last month the international community agreed to ‘pursue efforts’ to keep global temperature rises to 1.5C – the Committee on Climate Change should have provided comprehensive advice and guidance on what measures the UK needs to take to help achieve this.” Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank, said it was sensible the committee had reviewed the carbon budget after Paris but added: “The committee also pointed out that we currently have little idea how this government intends to reduce emissions, let alone ensure energy security. Having spent its first six months emptying the energy policy cupboard, it has yet to re-stock and thereby give investors the confidence they need to get us back on track.” The CCC also issued a stern warning on the future of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.  Last year, the government scrapped a long-standing competition offering at least £1bn in funding for CCS. The future of the fledgling technology in the UK is now in doubt. But the CCC said that research suggested the cost of meeting the UK’s carbon goals by 2050 would be twice as high without CCS technology. “CCS has a crucial role to play in cost-effective decarbonisation technology,” the committee wrote in the letter to Rudd. Professor Stuart Haszeldine, director of the Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage group, said: “To stay on track in the ‘high ambition coalition’ of leading nations agreed in Paris climate talks, the UK needs to do a lot more on UK electricity, and a lot more on UK low-carbon industry and low-carbon heat.  “But now this government is doing a lot less. There is no sign yet that facts, unbiased scientific evidence and rationality are regarded as more important than lobbying by corporations and colleagues wishing to take the UK back to the 1960s energy mix.”    "

"Sixty years ago, the price of solar panels was astronomical. At a cost of $1,910 (£1,350) per watt in today’s money, the only practical use for them was in space on the US Vanguard 1 satellite, which launched in 1958. But slowly and then precipitously the price of building a solar cell came down. Today it is less than $0.80 (£0.55) per watt. The subsequent proliferation of panels (especially in Europe, China, US and India) has tracked along the dizzying curve that eventually lead to the market domination of the car, the mobile phone and electricity itself.  So could solar follow these inventions and achieve their level of ubiquity? “History tells us that sudden, disruptive and largely unpredictable technology shifts do occur,” said a Deloitte report (pdf) on solar in 2015. In a study released recently in the journal Research Policy, Oxford University researchers found, in the short term, that solar’s upward swing was unstoppable. The researchers said falling manufacturing costs, which have dropped by 10% a year since the 1980s, would grow solar’s share of global electricity from roughly 1.5% today, to as much as 20% by 2027. Not everyone is as optimistic. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) most ambitious scenario for renewables puts the amount of electricity produced from solar photovoltaic cells at 16% of global production by 2050.  However, the IEA has consistently under-estimated solar. In 2000, it predicted the world’s solar capacity would quadruple over the course of the next 15 years. In reality, it took just five. The IEA then upgraded their 2015 forecast from 5 GW to 14 GW. This time it took just three years to get there. Beyond photovoltaic (PV) cells, concentrating solar power, in which the sun is used to heat water or oil and drive a traditional turbine, is also on the rise. It remains very much the little cousin, with around 1GW added around the world per year (compared with 50GW for PV). Dolf Gielen, director of the International Renewable Energy Agency’s (Irena) Innovation and Technology Centre in Bonn, Germany said he expected strong growth in desert areas, such as Morocco and South Africa, where this source of power was particularly effective. In developing countries, solar is the technology of the moment. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has thrown his hefty political weight, and some money, into the development of an international solar alliance. China, already the world’s largest solar producer, has added almost as much solar capacity in the first quarter of this year as the total solar capacity of France. It’s penchant for vast large scale farms tipped the global balance (once about 50/50) away from rooftop installations. Even in the poorest countries, solar’s flexibility is making it desirable. In Bangladesh, more than 3.5m solar home systems have been installed in rural villages. Across the world, 1.3 billion people live without electricity. Often because the power grid does not extend to their home. As their economies develop, solar power will flood into these countries as the cheapest, most independent way for people to power their lives. The future of the sun looks bright. Yan Qin, a senior modelling analyst at Thompson Reuters Point Carbon, told the Guardian a few dips still lie ahead for the solar. The main is grid infrastructure, which was built to carry fairly consistent levels of generation and will struggle to cope with the variability of solar and wind energy.  National grids are adapting, but the infrastructure investments are huge and the work slow. In Europe, a plan to build a massive solar farm in the Sahara desert that would provide 15% of Europe’s power by 2050, collapsed because the costs involved in transmission of solar power have not fallen as fast as the costs to build panels. Gielen said this variability was a limit to growth. “You have a very strong seasonality in solar production. That is a problem at higher latitudes. If you would connect all the countries around the world then always somewhere the sun would shine and problem solved. But we are still quite far from that situation,” he said. Like other renewables that rely on weather, solar is held back by its “capacity factor”, essentially how often it is producing electricity. A coal power station runs at 70-80% capacity. In northern Europe, solar panel capacity factor is just 15%. This reduces its competitiveness significantly. So instead of the continued exponential growth that is modelled by the Oxford team, Qin predicts “moderate growth in solar could continue as seen in recent years, but the growth will flatten out, turning into an S curve”. This is backed by price forecasts of the UK government Climate Change Committee and the US Energy Information Agency. Qin said the industry would require government subsidies for at least another 15 years in order to compete against established fossil fuels technologies, such as coal and gas. A further challenge to solar will be chronically low prices of fossil fuels, which could push back its ability to compete. This is despite claims from the solar industry (pdf) in the UK (where subsidies were recently slashed by 65%) that it will be able to go subsidy free by the early 2020s – a forecast Qin describes as “bullish”. Gielen believes solar will eventually be one of the cheapest forms of energy. Although just how cheap depends partly on government policies and the institution of global or regional carbon pricing – which will deflate the competition from fossil fuels. Gielen says solar could supply 10% of the world’s electricity by 2050 as technological solutions are developed to cope with its shortcomings. Batteries that store excess power for night time or cloudy days remain expensive, although costs are coming down. Tesla, among others, claim they will soon be able to provide affordable storage to private rooftop solar and large utilities alike. But a better solution, said Gielen, and one which was already proliferating across the world, was to combine solar with other available renewable technologies – hydro, wind, tidal and geothermal. These all provide either consistent power or vary on different rhythms to the sun. Costa Rica for example, uses a powerful mix of all these technologies so that it rarely turns on its diesel generation plants these days. Some countries – the UK in particular – are choosing to add nuclear to this mix, although the heavy price tag and public unease makes it a tough sell. Despite the sun flooding the earth with enough light every hour to fulfil our energy needs for a year, solar power will not solve our clean energy conundrum on its own."
"“The world is in a more challenging situation than many people perhaps realise,” Paul Polman explains. Depending on your point of view, the chief executive of Unilever, one of the biggest companies in the world, is either a gloomy pessimist or a unique figure in international business who believes his company has a duty to help the world tackle its big issues. Being a pessimist certainly has its advantages as a chief executive. If you talk down the markets you operate in then no one expects much from you. If you also promote your own social conscience then it can help boost how customers view your company, particularly important for a business such as Unilever that produces everyday consumer brands from the washing powder Persil to Magnum, the ice-cream on a stick.   Polman is a regular on the global summit circuit, visiting Davos for the World Economic Forum last week and Paris for the climate change summit in November. However, if you spend any time in his presence, it is clear the Dutchman’s views are at the heart of how he runs Unilever. With a workforce of more than 170,000 and a market value of almost £90bn, he believes Unilever has a duty to lead on key topics. “The global economy has many factors coming together at the same time that people probably struggle with, more than in previous times,” he says. “You have the geopolitical situation, we have a hard time getting economies growing in the US and Europe, and the emerging markets are clearly slowing down. “So there is pressure all around the world on an economic growth basis. Then there are the geopolitical tensions that you are well aware of – and we have added Saudi Arabia and Iran to this now. And the issues of climate change are really showing up as well – this year’s El Niño will probably be one of the more severe, we have just had the flooding [in Britain] and we have had significant flooding in Latin America.” Polman, who will turn 60 this year, believes it is important that businesses intervene in the challenges facing the world because it is not clear who will step in otherwise. “Actually, that is one of the key issues in the world right now – the lack of global governance in a world that has become far more interdependent,” he says. “Some countries have played their role historically, but seem to be falling back to their home base; others have not been able to step up to the plate, claiming developing market status. But increasingly the issues that we are facing – climate change, unemployment, social cohesion, food security – these are issues of global proportions. We are often trapped in short-termism … or other things.  “Many of the institutions that were designed have served us very well, but they were designed in 1948 at the time of Bretton Woods [the conference held in 1944]. It is not surprising that you have now got an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and other alternatives because the world has moved on.” Since Polman took charge of Unilever in January 2009 he has tried to back his words with actions. Unilever has stopped updating the stock market on its performance every quarter to encourage a long-term perspective, and it has launched a sustainable living plan that includes a commitment to cut calories in its ice-cream products. The company has pledged to eliminate coal from its energy usage within five years, and derive all of its energy solely from renewable sources by 2030. In Paris, Polman was part of a group of business leaders calling for a price on carbon. However, is a business like Unilever really committed to long-term global issues such as climate change when it must also meet the demands of shareholders and pay out hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends each year? Polman insists that the dividend is part of “balancing the choices to multiple stakeholders” and that the financial markets are increasingly coming round to his way of thinking.  “Businesses are also discovering that the costs of not doing things are becoming higher than doing things,” he says.  “The age of transparency should also not be underestimated. There are many people now that don’t want to invest in companies that create a worse future for their grandchildren. They are able to see it by going to the internet and they vote increasingly with their wallet.” He adds that investors are aware of companies that behave responsibly and those that do not, noting that nearly half of Volkswagen’s market capitalisation has been wiped out in the wake of the emissions scandal.  Polman accepts that there are also still significant numbers of investors looking for the biggest possible short-term returns who do not care too much how companies achieve their dividends. But he is optimistic that a growing number are taking a longer-term view.  “Companies in the US now spend more money on share buybacks or special dividends than they do reinvesting in their companies and protecting their futures. Many in the financial community are starting to be concerned about that,” he says. “We are fortunate in Unilever that we have about 70% of our shareholder base that has now been with us as long as I have been here. We have deliberately sought longer-term shareholders.” However, for all the long-term issues on Polman’s mind, there are also short-term challenges that must be addressed, including the referendum on whether Britain should remain part of the European Union. The Unilever boss is against Brexit, believing that the UK and the EU will be stronger together. However, Polman also believes that Europe needs reform if it wants to stay competitive. “Europe is very occupied with itself in the short-term,” he says. “The fundamental issues of how to make Europe more competitive, how to grow Europe for the longer term, are not being addressed. That is why you don’t see any growth in Europe, there is still deflation in many markets. The real issues that started the euro crisis have not been addressed, either.” As for Unilever itself, Polman wants to continue to show that its personal and homecare products, food and refreshments can remain popular no matter what shape the economy is in. Even though he is moving into his 60s and his tenure as chief executive is longer than average, Polman has no plans to retire: “I am 100% concentrated as if it is my first day. I still have that same energy.” “For us, it is very important that we can continue to show to everybody that in hell or high water, whatever the economic situation, we can continuously give competitive topline growth, improve our profitability, and do that in a responsible way. We can show that there is a different business model out there. We can hopefully start to address some of these major problems out there whilst at the same time satisfying the need of our shareholders.”"
