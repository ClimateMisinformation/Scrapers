There still remains much dispute as to whether warming causes higher greenhouse gas concentrations, or if more greenhouse gas concentrations lead to warming. We can all recall Al Gore standing near his temperature reconstruction in AIT misleading his viewers into thinking that CO2 comes first, and then the warming.
Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) released a report about two weeks ago that sheds more light on this. The complete press release can be read here in English.
40,000 years ago there was a rapid temperature increase accompanied by a rapid methane increase. What came first? Alarmists will have you believe that GHG is the driver. The Alfred Wegener Institute and others have looked into this. What have they found? Here are the main findings:
1. 40,000 years ago rapid warming led to an increase in methane concentration.
2. Climate researchers from the Universities in Bern and Copenhagen and from the Alfred Wegener Institute now conclude that the methane increase at that time was largely due to higher methane emissions from wetlands.
3. These natural methane sources produced more methane especially in high northern latitudes in response to the warming.
4. This result refutes the theory that large amounts of methane were released from the ocean sediment and led to higher atmospheric methane concentrations and thus to rapid climate warming.

You can’t get any clearer than that. But now enter German politics.
Still, contrary to their own findings,  the government-funded AWI goes on to insist their results do not imply that methane or other greenhouse gases play no role for climate change. And so they depart from science and start smacking for funding by adding the obligatory:
Our study reflects natural climate conditions during the last ice age, long before mankind affected global climate by emitting greenhouse gases. At that time climate warming caused an increase in methane concentration, generating in turn a more substantial greenhouse effect.
Of course they don’t offer proof for this last statement.
Now if this were true, you’d enter a vicious circle that would eventually spiral out of control. Yet, this has never happened in the history of the planet, let alone the last 100,000 years. Every time some other mechanism (one that many charlatan climate scientists refuse to acknowledge) always prevented the dreaded  irreversible tipping point.
Greenland temperature last 100,000 years. 
Does it really take a rocket scientist to tell you that climate conditions today, since 10,00 years, are relatively very stable? Look at the above chart. Looks awfully stable to me.  0.5°C is not unstable.
Weren’t climate conditions far more unstable during the ice age? Did the climate ever spiral out of control in one direction or another, meaning to an unbearble hothouse or a frozen solid ice ball? The answer is of course: no.
Conclusion: It takes a “climate scientist” (quack), not a rocket scientist, to tell you that today’s climate is unstable and spiralling out of control due to man.

"Liberal senator Linda Reynolds has told ABC’s Q&A program that the passage of last month’s medevac bill for critically sick refugees made her “almost physically ill” because she “lived through terrorism and … the Bali bombings”. Reynolds had been asked, in light of the Christchurch terror attack, whether Australia’s politicians and media had built a fear of migrants and “others” over the past decade.  Her answer prompted host Tony Jones to ask the Liberal minister whether she was linking refugees with terrorism. Questioner Ray Martin had asked the panel whether politicians created the Islamophobia that allegedly motivated the Christchurch attacker, who was Australian. “Isn’t it time that our political discourse is more measured, and politicians do not exploit the fear of others, as we have for many years now?” he asked. “You look back to Tampa, children overboard and issues like that. For a generation now sadly, every election time we start talking about immigration, border security … they’ve been couched, almost for a generation, around ‘others.’” Jones then asked Reynolds to respond to reports that Scott Morrison, when in opposition, urged colleagues to use the fear of Muslim refugees to win votes. “Do you agree that fear of others has been used for political purposes?” he asked. “This is a very personal issue for me,” Reynolds replied. “The circumstances that you were talking about are things I’ve lived through. Last month, I gave probably the hardest and most personal speech I’ve ever given in the Senate. And it was in response to Labor’s amendments to the medevac bill. “I was literally almost physically ill when I saw some of my Senate and House of Representatives colleagues in the chamber cheering and high-fiving the passage of these amendments. Because I was one of the few in that chamber who has lived through terrorism and the impact, up in the Bali bombings. “I was up there, I saw, I smelt and I got to understand the commodification of human beings. There are people in our own nation and there are people overseas who want to do us harm. They don’t respect our compassion. And they certainly do not respect our way of life.” Jones interrupted, asking: “Are you drawing a link between the Bali bombings and refugees coming to Australia for medical services?” Reynolds: “What I’m saying is that having my colleagues cheer for this policy that will inevitably lead to the boat trade coming again. “There are thousands of people who are up near north, who people smugglers don’t see as human beings, but as commodities to profit from. I saw that first-hand in 2001 and 2002. I saw the consequences on those who are desperate enough to come here and they drowned the most horrendous deaths. And it happened again when Labor opened the borders.” She said Morrison had not used anti-Muslim sentiment to win votes. “The prime minister has been very clear tonight it did not happen. It simply did not happen. For anybody to politicise this issue now … is inappropriate and tacky”. Earlier Reynolds also answered a similar question that asked whether politicians such as Pauline Hanson and Nationals MP George Christensen “bear some responsibility for the rise in Islamophobia”. “Now is the time for grieving,” she said. “It is the time for support … it is a time for all of us in politics to come together. It is not a time for a politician, a commentator to make cheap political points of this issue.” But she also called on her colleagues to censure independent senator Fraser Anning. Labor MP Cathy O’Toole said Christchurch had “drawn our attention to the consequences of [our]words” and told politicians and media “to be much more mindful”. The rest of the episode then discussed the impact of the Townsville floods and climate change on rural Australia – as had been initially planned before Friday’s attack occurred. Professor Stephen Williams told the audience “climate science has been predicting an increase in extreme events [for 30 years]. “We’ve had the hottest summer on record, we’ve had the hottest year on record. My son, who is 18, 17 of his 18 years have been the hottest on record for the globe.” Williams praised the actions of the climate strikers – as did Reynolds. “How many students here went on strike and did their protest?” she asked. “Can I say I love your passion and I love your commitment. It is great you are engaging in democracy and having your say about climate change.” Reynolds told the crowd she believed in climate change, but said her ministerial responsibility was “not carbon emissions”, but “how do we look at the dumb things we’ve done to make it worse”. “How do we make sure we don’t build houses in floodplains … that the roads and infrastructure we build don’t wash away every time we get flooded,” she said. O’Toole said she was a believer in “prevention rather than reaction after the event” and criticised the government for not doing enough. When asked if Labor would give support to the Adani coalmine, O’Toole she said she would represent the community of her Queensland electorate. “People in the north do not like people in the south-east telling us what we can and can’t do,” she said. But then added: “It is not a wise community that invests all its eggs in one basket.”"

"A UK-wide campaign is being launched to persuade one of the country’s biggest high street banks to stop investing billions of pounds in the fossil fuel industry. Activists from the Labour-supporting Momentum group will team up with the environmental group People and Planet to stage more than 40 “creative direct actions” at Barclays branches in town and cities across the UK later this month.  The campaign has been inspired by the school climate strikes, in which 1.4 million young people took to the streets last weekend to voice their fears about the escalating ecological crisis. The “UK Uncut-style” protests aim to put pressure on Barclays, which organisers say is one of the leading European backers of fossil fuel projects, financing 15 fossil fuel companies with more than $30bn (£22.6bn) from 2012-17, including corporations pushing ahead the plans to develop the fracking industry in the UK. John Taylor, a member of Momentum’s national coordinating group, said: “Climate change is already devastating communities around the world, and fossil fuel companies and their financiers are to blame. A decade ago the banks crashed the economy, now they’re crashing the planet.” He said it was time ordinary people came together to “face the banks that fund climate breakdown head on”. He added: “Inspired by the young people participating in the youth climate strikes around the world, we’ll be organising Labour members to take action against Barclays, who have funded fossil fuel companies to the tune of $30bn between 2012 and 2017.” Barclays highlighted investments made by the bank in environmental schemes and stated that in 2018 it had “facilitated” £27.3bn in “environmental and social financing”. A spokesperson added: “Our approach balances the need to accelerate the transition away from the most carbon intensive fossil fuel sources, with ongoing financial support for clients operating responsibly in energy sectors that are expected to contribute significantly to the world’s energy mix.” However, a report out on Wednesday from the Rainforest Action Network and the BankTrack group, which tracks and analyses the investments of banks around the world, found Barclays was “the top European banker of fracking and coal [and] leads as the worst European bank, with $85bn poured into fossil fuels and $24bn into expansion”. The campaign will start on Saturday 30 March and organisers say that more than 40 actions are already planned by members and local groups across the UK. Momentum said the campaign was using organising techniques pioneered in the US by the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in 2016, including mass conference calls to mobilise members and the use of WhatsApp groups to mobilise people locally. On Monday evening, Momentum held a conference call with more than 100 organisers around the country featuring speakers from the UK youth climate strikes. "

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to a Der Spiegel report today:
The world community is preparing a world climate treaty – but the first reactions sound pessimistic.
About 4500 participants from all over the world have gathered in Bonn in an attempt to forge a new world climate treaty in talks that will last two weeks. But so far talks have shown that no quick solutions are in sight. Der Spiegel writes:
Delegates and observers are almost unanimous on the view that a new world climate treaty won’t be achievable in time for Cancun at the end of 2010, this after the disaster in Copenhagen. At the conference in Bonn, the target is to lay at least the cornerstones for a partial success.
Government delegates have presented a new 42-page draft with options for contents of negotiation.
Der Spiegel writes: EU climate targets on ice!
Artur Runge-Metzger, Climate Protection Director of the EU Commission, emphasized that the EU’s target of reducing GHG emissions by 30% are not off the table. But the EU will go ahead with the 30% target ONLY IF other countries do their fair share in global climate protection.
Emphasis above is mine.
The EU has also pledged €2.4 billion in immediate aid to poor countries for climate protection. It was agreed in Copenhagen that industrialised nations would pay developing countries approx. $30 billion in immediate aid between 2010 and 2012. Developing countries have complained that they haven’t received anything so far.

"The New South Wales Labor party has wheeled out the former South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, to help bolster its credentials on climate change in key seats where the issue could be the decider. Climate change is the top issue in Coogee, currently held by the Liberals on a margin of 2.9%, and Balmain, which Labor hopes to reclaim from the Greens, which holds it by 4.7%.  Weatherill said the NSW Coalition had been a barrier to getting action on climate change when states tried to achieve an agreement on pricing carbon in the face of the federal Coalition’s inaction. “I think the conservative forces have completely misapprehended the community’s demand to take action on climate change and I think there will be very substantial judgments made by the electorates,” he said. “When the states were trying to search for a mechanism to put a price on carbon in the national electricity market – just about everyone in the universe thinks it’s a good idea – [the Berejiklian government] were backing the commonwealth’s compromise,” he said. As Labor premier for six years until 2018, Weatherill put South Australia at the forefront of adopting renewable power, which now provides 50% of the state’s electricity. However, a statewide blackout in 2017 during a ferocious storm, which caused windfarms to shut down and led to a chain of events that cut the interconnectors bringing electricity from interstate, prompted federal criticism of renewable energy and questions about whether intermittent power from renewables was viable. Weatherill responded by announcing a tender for a giant battery to stabilise the system, which was won by Tesla and built in under six months. He told the Guardian that the battery has almost paid for itself in a year. “It cost us $46m over 10 years; in its first year of operation it saved people in the SA region $45m. It’s largely paid for itself in 12 months, not to mention the stabilisation services its provided to the national electricity market,” Weatherill said. Famously, the then federal minister for energy Josh Frydenberg and Weatherill locked horns at a joint press conference over SA’s energy strategy. Frydenberg accused SA of trying to “go it alone” and Weatherill of “crash-tackling” his event. Weatherill hit back, claiming the Coalition was the “most anti-South Australian commonwealth government in living history”. Elly Howse, who is attempting to unseat the Greens’ Jamie Parker in Balmain, said the problem for minor parties was delivering on the promises they make. “If we don’t win, we will have four more years of a void in this policy space, and it doesn’t matter how much your local Green might be saying about this issue,” she said. Marjorie O’Neill, Labor’s candidate for Coogee, said climate change and the environment was the issue most raised with her, followed by overdevelopment and education. She said single-use plastics was a major concern in the beachside electorate. “Every other state has banned them except NSW,” she said."

"The climate crisis that is driving sea level rises and more extreme rainfall is making deadly storms like the one that hit southern Africa more severe, according to experts. Cyclone Idai, the tropical storm that ravaged Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, has been described as the worst weather-related disaster to hit the southern hemisphere, and the UN says more than 2 million people have been affected. Storm-surge floods of up to six metres have caused widespread devastation. Experts said it was too early to draw specific conclusions from Cyclone Idai, but the rapidly changing climate meant the destructive power of such storms was only going to increase in the future. Dr Friederike Otto, of Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute, said: “There are three factors with storms like this: rainfall, storm surge and wind. Rainfall levels are on the increase because of climate change, and storm surges are more severe because of sea level rises.” Otto said it was important to help communities in the worst-hit areas become more resilient to storms. “The standard of housing, the size of the population and effectiveness of the early warning systems … these are the sorts of things we need to think about as we move into a world where these events become more severe.” Paulo Ceppi, of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, agreed it was inevitable that climate change would lead to more severe storms. “There is a direct link between global warming and cyclone intensity. We need to make every effort to follow the Paris agreement target of remaining below 1.5C of global warming in order to minimise future increases in the severity of tropical storms, [and] to achieve the Paris goal we need to start reducing global carbon emissions now.” Dr Rebecca Emerton, of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science at the University of Reading, said her team was working with experts in the area hit by Cyclone Idai to try to improve forecasting and warning systems. “It has been an active cyclone season in the Indian Ocean this year with seven intense cyclones already, compared to an average usually of three.” She said Idai was the biggest storm in the area since 2000. “We are working with partners there to see how good the forecasting is now and what can be done to improve it. That will be crucial if we are to try and mitigate the damage these storms do,” Emerton said. Mel Evans, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said the storm was further proof that the people least responsible for the climate crisis were suffering the most. “The average CO2 emissions of a citizen of Mozambique, Malawi or Zimbabwe is a tiny fraction of a European’s or an American’s. The people who have done the least to cause climate change are at the front of the queue to receive its impacts and have far fewer resources to prepare for the storm, or repair the damage.” Evans said the disaster should be a wake-up call to governments everywhere to urgently deliver on their climate goals."
"Still, and in defiance of decades worth of scientific evidence, vast numbers of people around the world refuse to accept that we are in the process of drastically altering the climate. Vast numbers more lack the information they need to interpret what is going on. This is a global problem whose importance cannot be overstated. It has no single solution. But giving up on trying to halt the damage to life on our planet is not an option. And in this context, this week’s suggestion by the former BBC weather presenter Bill Giles, that forecasts should be adapted to include information about climate change as well as local weather conditions, is extremely welcome. Weather and climate are not the same thing, and to confuse them would be unhelpful. But the rapidly developing science of weather attribution means that experts are now able to analyse extreme events including floods and heatwaves to determine the contribution of manmade climate change. Last summer’s UK heatwave, for example, was made 30 times more likely by greenhouse gases. Findings such as this could feature in the remodelled broadcasts, and play a valuable role in increasing public understanding. So could information about globally important climate-related events, such as updates on melting ice sheets in Greenland or Antarctica.  Currently such items are treated as news, if they feature in current affairs schedules at all. But often they do not, and there is certainly no systematic effort on the part of such programmes to keep their audiences apprised of what climate scientists think is going on. If taken up, Mr Giles’s proposal could lead to a re-evaluation of weather broadcasting – and a consideration of whether it is appropriate, in the era of global warming, to treat weather as the cheery endnote, delivered by a friendly face, that viewers have learned to expect. Weather forecasting has not remained static since it was invented in the 1860s by Admiral Robert FitzRoy, whose initial aim was to prevent shipwrecks. Over the years the methodology has altered dramatically. Forecasts have become far more accurate, and local environmental information such as levels of pollen and air pollution has been incorporated. Now, given what we know, it makes sense to focus our attention more widely. Last year was the fourth warmest on record, after 2016, 2017 and 2015. The UN warns that we have only 12 years left in which to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – that is, just over half a degree higher than now.  With carbon emissions still rising and a temperature rise of 3C expected to submerge cities including Shanghai and Miami within a century, the scope of our collective political failure is yet to be absorbed. In order to prevent disaster, governments must commit to changes far more drastic than anything agreed at the UN so far. Past experience suggests this will not happen unless public pressure is brought to bear with unprecedented force. The school strikes movement is an encouraging sign that a mass mobilisation remains possible. By contrast, a shake-up of weather forecasts might sound tame. But they could play a vital role if they helped convince a majority of voters that climate change can no longer be ignored, and should be their top priority."

Share this...FacebookTwitterProfessor Steven Sherwood’s newest climate crystal ball foretells that unless something drastic is done, terrible things are going to happen to our climate. And like in the regular fortune-telling business, there are plenty of customers just slurping it up.
Professor Sherwood of the University of New South Wales and a team of scientists now claim that climate models have underestimated global warming. Because clouds have not been correctly taken into account, the globe will likely heat up by close to 3° instead of 1.5°C by the end of the century. Study here.
But hyped climate fortune-telling is nothing new. The media love it. Early in the 20th century scientists had also warned of melting ice caps and rapidly rising sea levels, before warning of ice ages and extreme weather in the 1970s. And every time the scientists were almost certain and insisted action was paramount. And every time they were proved wrong.
The problem lies in that Sherwood’s claims are based on computer climate models, models that are chock full with assumptions (guesses).
Why climate models are unreliable for predicting the future of a non-linear chaotic system that is as variable as the climate is succinctly illustrated by Prof. Christopher Essex (photo right) in a presentation which I commented on here.
Because of the huge uncertainties involved in climate modeling, Prof. Essex, a leading international expert in computer modeling, calls projections for decades and centuries ahead using even today’s state of the art “Welcome to Wonderland”. The climate system is just too complex and it would take even today’s most powerful computer billions of years to run through a proper algorithm.
The results that today’s models put out are based on the crude assumptions that get fed in. When a model maker guesses that the globe is going to heat up, then that’s what his model will show.
Not only do modeling experts scoff at the claimed predictive powers of climate models, but so do some advisers to decision makers. Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s top business adviser Maurice Newman, for example, once said the world “had been held hostage by climate madness.”
In the UK Telegraph here, Newman is quoted as saying:

…the climate change establishment, led by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, remained ‘intent on exploiting the masses and extracting more money’.
‘The scientific delusion, the religion behind the climate crusade, is crumbling,’ he wrote in The Australian. ‘Global temperatures have gone nowhere for 17 years… If the IPCC were your financial adviser, you would have sacked it long ago.”
Global warming activists fired back, calling Newman and Abbot flat-earthers for not having faith in climate model prophesies.

All climate models projections are diverging from reality. Chart from Prof. John Christy, U of Alabama.
Yet, when one takes a closer look, the only thing that’s been flat lately are global temperatures (see chart above). Every model, most costing millions, failed to predict that global temperature would remain stagnant for almost two decades. Now it becomes obvious why experts like Essex describe them as “Welcome to Wonderland”.
Sherwood’s latest claim is in truth a profound departure from reality. In fact datasets are now even showing a slight decline underway over the last 6 to 8 years. The exact opposite is actually occurring. One has to ask what world scientists like Sherwood are really living in.
Naturally, one cannot exclude the possibility that Sherwood’s prediction may end up being right. As everyone knows: Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany has just put out a press release in English on a new study on the role of terrestrial ecosystems in the global carbon cycle: A new balance for the global carbon balance. If anything, the report shows there remains lots of uncertainty in the science that many like to call “settled”.
In climate science the only certainty is uncertainty.
Well worth reading. Some of the main points, according to the authors:
1. In most ecosystems, the photosynthesis rate at which plants fix carbon dioxide from the atmosphere changes relatively little as the temperature varies.
2. The respiration of the ecosystems, when flora and fauna release carbon dioxide again, also increases to a lesser extent than has recently often been assumed when the temperature rises.
3. Moreover, this temperature dependence is the same all over the world – even in ecosystems as different as the tropical savannah and the Finnish needleleaf forest.
4. The climate is quite temperamental: countless factors are involved and many feedback mechanisms enhance effects such as the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. This makes it difficult to make predictions, especially as many processes in the Earth system are still not completely understood.
5. Results suggest that the availability of water, in particular, plays a decisive role for the carbon cycle in ecosystems. It is often more important than temperature.
6. Particularly alarmist scenarios for the feedback between global warming and ecosystem respiration thus prove to be unrealistic.”
7. The factor which determines the acceleration of the respiration thus obviously does not depend on the local temperature conditions and the specific characteristics of an ecosystem. “We were very surprised that different ecosystems react relatively uniformly to temperature variations.”
8. “It is still not possible to predict whether this attenuates the positive feedback between carbon dioxide concentration and temperature,” says Markus Reichstein. “The study shows very clearly that we do not yet have a good understanding of the global material cycles and their importance for long-term developments.”
9. “We were surprised to find that the primary production in the tropics is not so strongly dependent on the amount of rain,” says Markus Reichstein. “Here, too, we therefore need to critically scrutinize the forecasts of some climate models which predict the Amazon will die as the world gets drier.”

"Your editorial in defence of the humanities (13 March) is well timed and well argued. The UK needs the contribution of Stem graduates and that made by graduates with knowledge, skills and understanding gained through study of the humanities and wider social sciences. And geography, a subject that is a humanity, a social science and has part Stem designation in higher education, is well placed to make such a contribution. For example, the cabinet office’s geospatial commission estimates that UK plc can gain £11bn through the better use of the geospatial data held by organisations including the Ordnance Survey, Land Registry and the Hydrographic Office. Yet this can only be achieved if we have enough graduates trained to understand how such data can be used to benefit our communities, environments, businesses, and policy decisions – training which is provided through the study of geography.  The political tectonic plates will continue to clash and remodel our political landscapes. However, we should celebrate how study of the humanities can help us all to understand our own and other cultures, explore the connections of the wider world, and satisfy our innate curiosity about the world’s people, places and environments. Professor Joe SmithDirector, Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) • The Guardian’s view on the risks of cutting access to arts, humanities and social science courses is entirely and dismayingly correct. The decline in the number of students taking subjects including English, history and foreign languages is deeply concerning, and it could not be happening at a worse time. The UK faces many historic challenges and, whether it’s Brexit, climate change, or an ageing society, the insights of the humanities and social sciences are essential as we navigate our way through an uncertain present into what we hope will be an exciting and prosperous future. For over a century, the Academy has stood up for our disciplines, and it is greatly reassuring to know that we can rely on the Guardian’s support.Professor Sir David CannadinePresident of the British Academy • It is good to see support for the humanities at universities expressed in your leader but it does not follow as you suggest that by maintaining the current fee regime, with all that is wrong with it, universities will of their own volition protect these areas if demand slackens. A reduction of fees could be accompanied by funded initiatives such as protection for endangered subjects and reward for proven success in improving the prospects for disadvantaged students, just as support is currently provided for high-cost Stem subjects. Demand for subjects can wax and wane – some time ago mathematics and physics were in trouble but demand is now increasing. However, once a department is closed it is unlikely to be revived. It takes years to build a good department and a casual decision to close based on the “market” for it to be gone for ever. There is a national interest and responsibility to ensure a wide spectrum of disciplines is available within the system which cannot be left to the so called “market”.Professor Norman GowarLondon • Your editorial on humanities courses in UK universities is sadly correct for a perhaps less obvious reason. The major problem facing the world is climate change, which is ultimately caused by people. It is therefore notable that one of the world’s top universities, Harvard, has stated that “perspectives from across the university are required to provide leadership on how we can manage the impacts and limit the risks.” As a result, “Harvard faculty from economics, public policy, business, law, architecture, the arts and humanities all provide critical insights for how to proceed with tackling one of the greatest challenges of our time.” As your editorial concludes: the humanities matter too – the clue is in the name.Emeritus Professor Henry LeeseWindermere, Cumbria • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Michael Krüger at Readers Edition has already crunched the numbers for December 2010 in Germany. It was the third coldest on record, and the coldest since 1969. 
The average temperature in December 2010 was -3.5 °C, which is -4.3°C under the 1961-1990 average of 0.8°C.
So much for warmer winters with increasingly rare snowfalls. Speaking of snowfalls, for many locations in Germany it was also the snowiest on record. Krüger writes:
DWD [German Weather Service] experts recorded new monthly records for ‘maximum snow heights’ at many stations: for example 70 cm at Gera-Leumnitz on December 26.”
The snow and cold have been especially embarrassing for the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. It’s famous Potsdam-Telegrafenberg weather station smashed a number of December records.
On December 28, 2010 a snow depth 41 cm was measured in Potsdam. Never has there been that much snow in the month of December since records began in 1893. That’s 18 cm more than the previous record of 23 cm, which was measured on 31 December, 1913.  At -4,4°C it was also the second coldest December in Potsdam since records began in 1893.”
The following chart shows snow cover for Potsdam, home of the PIK(Source: Meteorological Station Potsdam Telegrafenberg) .

All that snow and cold fly in the face of German “climate experts” who not long ago projected warmer winters for Germany. Okay, one winter does not make a trend. Well, how about three of them in a row? Krüger writes:
 The winter before last year was -0,4°C below average and last winter was -1,5°C below the longterm average.
December 2010 is the third coldest since 1900. Colder were only December 1969 and December 1933.”
And adds:
Not only December was too cold, but also the entire year 2010 in Germany was too cold. The first time in 14 years (since 1996) that a year has been colder than the long-term average (average of the years 1961-90 is 8.2°C). In 2010 the average temperature was 7.9°C.”
And finally, as Krüger’s chart at his site shows, Germany’s annual temperature trend has been cooling over the last decade.

"Americans should not be fooled by the Stalinist tactics being used by the White House to try to discredit the findings of mainstream climate science. The Trump administration has already purged information about climate change from government websites, gagged federal experts and attempted to end funding for climate change programmes.  Now a group of hardcore climate change deniers and contrarians linked to the administration is organising a petition in support of a new panel being set up by the National Security Council to promote an alternative official explanation for climate change. The panel will consist of scientists who do not accept the overwhelming scientific evidence that rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are behind climate change and its impacts. The petition is being circulated for signature by Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a lobby group for “free market” fanatics which has become infamous for championing climate change denial. It does not disclose its sources of funding, but is known to have received money from ExxonMobil and conservative billionaires such as the Koch brothers. Mr Ebell, who has no expertise whatsoever in climate science – or any kind of science for that matter – was a member of Donald Trump’s presidential transition team and diverted the focus of the Environmental Protection Agency towards weakening and removing policies that limit pollution by companies, including President Obama’s Clean Power Plan. The creation of the new panel of climate change deniers, and the recruitment of supporters to provide it with a veneer of legitimacy, echoes the campaign by Joseph Stalin’s regime to discredit the work of geneticists who disagreed with the disastrous pseudo-scientific theories of Trofim Lysenko. Lysenko wrongly believed that acquired traits could be passed on by parents to their offspring. Stalin embraced lysenkoism as the basis for Soviet agricultural policy, while also denouncing and persecuting Lysenko’s scientific critics. The Trump administration’s “climate lysenkoism” is being led by William Happer, a retired professor from Princeton University who was hired by the National Security Council in September 2018 as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for emerging technologies. Media reports suggest that Professor Happer and his fellow propagandists will target the Fourth National Climate Assessment, which was prepared by leading researchers in the United States, and concluded last November: “The impacts of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country.” Although the report was subjected to rigorous review by America’s top experts at the National Academy of Sciences, it was rejected by President Trump, who told journalists: “I don’t believe it.” Professor Happer, who has not published any research on climate change in a reputable science journal, has been celebrated for many years by climate change contrarians and deniers around the world. He was formerly a trustee of the George C Marshall Institute, which received funding from ExxonMobil and other companies to spread doubt inside and outside the United States about the role of fossil fuels in climate change. It disappeared in 2015 and was replaced by the CO2 Coalition, which was co-founded by Professor Happer. The website for the Coalition makes many inaccurate and misleading assertions, such as: “Readily available data from both governmental and non-governmental sources confirms that extreme weather events in recent years have not happened more often or with greater intensity.” In fact, the Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published in 2013, concluded: “Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950.” A recent leak of the Coaliton’s tax filing showed that its largest donors are conservative groups, such as the Mercer Family Foundation and the Sarah Scaife Foundation, which have a long track record of funding climate change denial. Professor Happer has also collaborated with climate change deniers in other countries, such as the United Kingdom. In 2010, he joined the “Academic Advisory Committee” of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which was set up by Lord Lawson to campaign against polices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels. He stepped down from the committee when he was hired by the White House. The foundation published a pamphlet by Professor Happer in August 2011 which disputed the scientific evidence that greenhouse gases are causing climate change. In July 2014, Professor Happer caused controversy during an interview on CNBC television in the United States when he claimed that “the demonisation of carbon dioxide is just like the demonisation of the poor Jews under Hitler. Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the world, and so were the Jews.” He was also forced to defend himself after Greenpeace revealed an exchange of email messages during which Professor Happer discussed writing reports to promote climate change denial in exchange for a secret fee paid to the CO2 Coalition. Americans should not be conned by the Trump administration’s climate lysenkoism and should instead place their trust in the robust findings of climate researchers who place the public interest ahead of political ideology.

"The meat on Richard Vines’s Wild Beef stall at Borough Market in London is purple. Puce, really; a cartoonish shade that old men sometimes go when they are really angry. Meat that is an unexpected hue would typically raise an eyebrow, but for Wild Beef’s devoted customers it’s the reason they come here. “The colour comes from the protein that’s been in the ground, the deep-rooted grasses, it gives that flavour of sweetness and that bit of fat taste as well,” explains Vines, who has 40 acres of wild pasture in Devon, on which he keeps Devon cattle and Welsh Blacks. “Dartmoor is mineral-rich country, God-given for cattle farming. Washed by the Gulf Stream, grass grows most of the year and there’s a lot of freedom for the cattle once they are up on the moor.” For the carnivore, the chilled cabinet at Wild Beef is the promised land. There are all the familiar cuts (steaks, ribs), alongside parts of the cow you don’t see so often (cheeks and a giant, lolling tongue that is practically black). And, if you get there early and ask nicely, Vines will slip you a bag of bones from under the counter. “One thing that’s changed: people don’t sit down for Sunday lunch any more,” he says. “Just doesn’t happen, we don’t sell many joints. But I’m working out ways of making steaks all the time. Last year we did flat iron steaks; I didn’t know what they were but they sell. And 20 years ago, we used to waste buckets of liver and such like, which nobody wanted. Now the offal all goes before the meat.”  On this Thursday morning in early February, business is brisk – perhaps surprisingly so. There are many reasons why, right now, you might be thinking hard about how much meat you eat. That you believe eating less meat will improve your health. Or that you’ve read the increasingly ominous projections: like those in the Guardian article from December titled “Why eating less meat is the best thing you can do for the planet in 2019”. Another record-breaking Veganuary has ended with 250,000 people taking part globally, one-third more than 2018. In many ways, our consumption of meat – and especially beef – has become the food issue of our times. By 2050, it’s estimated that the world’s population will be almost 10 billion, a rise of a third from today. Meanwhile, global meat consumption steadily, relentlessly grows at about 3% a year. (Growth in Europe and the US is slowing or even declining: the US reached “peak meat” in 2004 when an average of 83 kilograms was consumed by each person in a year. In the UK, we’re eating more chicken, less lamb, and about the same amount of beef. However, demand in the likes of China and Brazil continues to rise. In China, they now eat 55kg of meat a year, compared to 14kg per head in the early 1970s.)  Chicken might be the world’s most popular meat – 65 billion birds are consumed each year – but beef is by some margin the hardest to defend. Raising livestock is notoriously inefficient: last year an article in the journal Science found that meat and dairy provides just 18% of our calories and 37% of our protein while taking up 83% of farmland. Cattle are responsible for an unholy proportion of agriculture’s greenhouse-gas emissions. The controversial “planetary health diet” published in the Lancet in January – a three-year project compiled by 37 scientists in 16 countries – advised that global consumption of red meat needs to reduce by half. The recommended changes would be particularly severe in Europe and the US: Europeans should eat 77% less red meat and 15 times more nuts and seeds to meet the guidelines, while Americans should cut back on red meat by 84%. Vines, 76, has heard all these arguments. “It’s disproportionate,” he says. “How many people are there in the air at any one time? And what’s that doing to the environment? When you offset the fact that animals on the ground have a part to play in nature’s cycle as well.” Sometimes people suggest to Vines that his land could feed many more people if it was covered in plants not cows. “Would that be more efficient?” he counters, more curious than argumentative. “It wouldn’t in our case because you couldn’t have vegetables on Dartmoor; there are too many rocks and blocks.” Vines’s sales are pretty consistent, and in fact this January they were up on previous years. As we talk, he gives potted biographies for some his regulars: “the paleo boys”, a German composer, a BBC radio presenter, a chap with tattoos and chains who is vegetarian but buys three or four bags of casserole steak every week for his dog. They are people who care about where their food comes from, who believe they are making an informed, considerate choice and are willing to pay extra for that. Wild Beef describes its meat as “beyond organic”. “All governments want cheap food and you cannot do what we do at an affordable price for people on low incomes,” Vines acknowledges. “It becomes a lifestyle choice and people who have money to spend on preferential food will shop from us.” For all the media discussion of Greggs’ new vegan sausage roll and the coverage of Beyoncé and Jay-Z offering free tickets “for life” – well, for 30 years – to their concerts for a fan if they pledge to eat more plant-based meals, change is taking place slowly. Vines’s anecdotal experience of demand is, perhaps surprisingly, backed up by the statistics. Although veganism receives considerable attention, a 2018 study found that only 0.2% of the British population stopped eating meat in the previous year. It’s hard to be exact, but it’s estimated that vegans make up 2% of the population, vegetarians are 7% and flexitarians – those choosing not to eat meat for one or more meals a week – hover around 20%. Still, nine out of 10 British households regularly buy red meat. Should we be alarmed by the slow progress? Simon Fairlie has spent much of the past three decades thinking about our consumption of meat and asking whether it can ever be ethical and sustainable. He was a co-editor of the Ecologist and now edits a magazine called The Land; he’s also the author of a book, Meat: A Benign Extravagance, a thoughtful and rigorous trawl through the evidence. He was a vegetarian for six years and now he runs a microdairy with Jersey cows at Monkton Wyld Court, a commune in Dorset, and makes and sells Austrian scythes. For Fairlie, it’s inarguable that we should all eat less meat: it’s not a great cornerstone for a diet and it’s harming the planet. But none? He doesn’t think so. Meat is a luxury, he argues, but so too are strawberries or coffee and any number of foods: also, meat can lay claim to being a “luxury staple” in that it provides protein, fat, vitamins and carbohydrate.  “The main problem we face is climate change and over two-thirds of global warming is caused by fossil fuels and industrial processes,” says Fairlie, citing US Environmental Protection Agency figures from 2014. “If the whole world went vegan it wouldn’t stop global warming. To do that, we have to stop using fossil fuels; and when we do we almost certainly won’t be able to produce as much meat as we do now, because of a lack of artificial fertilisers and the need to use land for biofuels, and diets will change accordingly.” This is a topic that is both intensely tribal and resistant to simplification. In an unexpected recent development, avocados are now almost as vilified as red meat (sample headline from the Daily Mail about the Duchess of Sussex: “Is Meghan’s favourite snack fuelling drought and murder?”). How, the line goes, can having a small portion of pasture-fed beef raised by a local British farmer be worse – practically or morally – than eating an avocado, imported from Mexico, picked by low-paid, immigrant workers on land linked to illegal deforestation? “Technically, a vegan diet probably is sustainable, but it is not sensible,” says Fairlie. “A diet with modest amounts of dairy, fish and meat requires less land than a completely vegan diet because a substantial proportion of livestock are fed on waste products. We also keep grazing animals for maintaining biodiversity, preventing forest fires, and keeping land clear for amenity use or renewable energy generation. Their populations have to be controlled, and if we are to cull them, we might as well eat them. “A vegan diet is wasteful because it cannot use this valuable source of protein; whereas a high-meat diet is wasteful because it relies on feeding livestock inefficiently with grain that humans could eat.” What makes this issue so hard to resolve is that, in Britain, we expect food to be cheap. We spend an average of 8% of household expenditure on food to eat at home. That’s lower than any country except for the US and Singapore (in Nigeria, for example, the figure is close to 60%). It’s also lower than it has ever been: go back 60 years and Britons spent twice as much on food, in relative terms, as we do now. And, much like fast fashion, when you come to expect a price for a product – whether it’s a T-shirt or a 99p burger – it is difficult to turn back the clock. The most effective way to reduce our meat intake, in Fairlie’s view, is to charge more for it. (This is also the logic behind the sugar tax on soft drinks brought in last April: it is expected to raise £240m for the Treasury, which will be invested in school sports and breakfast clubs.) He would ideally prefer a swingeing tax on fossil fuels, but feels the only pragmatic way is to add VAT directly to meat that is sold in supermarkets, especially animals from industrial farms, though he would like to see small producers and farmers markets exempt. An unprecedented time has led to some unprecedented proposals. One of these is lab-grown meat. Engineered or “clean” meat has some stigmas to overcome: in a recent survey only a quarter of people found the idea “very” or even “somewhat appealing”. But there’s considerable money behind it: Google co-founder Sergey Brin has backed Dutch-based Mosa Meat, while Tyson, the US food giant, funds Future Meat Technologies. (Tyson is also investing heavily in Beyond Meat, a California-based company best known for its plant-based burgers and new facilities for rearing organic poultry: no one seems sure which horse to back.) Optimistic estimates suggest that lab-grown meat will be in shops and restaurants by 2021. One person who doubts the immediate impact of engineered meat is Abi Aspen Glencross, a farmer and chef whose PhD at King’s College, London had the grand aim to create “steak without cows”. After a degree in chemical engineering, Glencross, 27, decided she wanted to work in food, and lab-grown meat seemed a “no-brainer”. She secured funding from a big charity in the US and became one of only a handful of researchers globally looking into cultured meat. But after 18 months, Glencross became disillusioned with the project and quit. “It just felt like an ego trip, thinking you were saving the world,” she says. “I was trying to create a new product and it was going to cost a lot of time, money and resources. Or we could all be more vegetarian. And that’s already there, it’s feasible and socially accepted. So why aren’t we doing that? It kept ringing in my head. “We might never be able to grow a steak in a lab, we don’t know yet,” she goes on. “That’s a long way off. We can hardly vascularise a small piece of tissue that big” – her fingers are about a centimetre apart – “so a steak is a very far-fetched thing.” Part of the reason Glencross abandoned her PhD was that she read chef Dan Barber’s 2014 book The Third Plate, which lays down a blueprint for a new food system, where vegetables dominate each dish and meat is merely a sauce or a seasoning. She spent a few months working at Barber’s farm and restaurant, Blue Hill at Stone Barns in upstate New York. There, she became interested in heritage and alternative grains and now grows them on a small farm in Hertfordshire. Duchess Grains currently only supplies E5 Bakehouse in east London, but will soon sell more widely. Glencross is also co-founder of a supper club called the Sustainable Food Story. She’s not vegetarian, as it happens, and jokingly calls herself a “bad vegan”. “At the Sustainable Food Story, we use offcuts, offal, even byproducts of cheese-making in our dinners,” she says. “Last time we did blood pudding, using back fat and blood, and there’s a whole conversation to be had about that. It seems you’re one thing or the other: either you eat meat and you’re proud or you’re vegan. Well, some weeks I eat vegan, and some weeks I don’t.” It is perhaps a forlorn hope, but Glencross would like to see less focus on the turf war, often vicious, between farmers and vegans, and more information – for people who care about such things and can afford to pay for them – about where food comes from, how it was grown. “Quite often farmers will get attacked when you really want to be attacking factory farming,” she says. “But they’re faceless and you can’t shout at them, so you shout at the farmer killing pigs on his farm. Which is sad. Or, vice versa: people shout at vegans, because they are angry and hairy or whatever it always used to be said. Again, you’re still fighting the wrong people. I feel we should be anti-industrial farming as much as possible.” A Bureau of Investigative Journalism/Guardian report from 2017 found there were at least 789 megafarms in the UK, many of them owned by foreign multinationals. (A megafarm, by the US definition, houses at least 125,000 broiler chickens, 82,000 laying hens, 2,500 pigs, 700 dairy or 1,000 beef cattle; in the UK, a farm is described as “intensive” if it has at least 40,000 poultry birds or 2,000 pigs grown for meat or 750 breeding sows.) Two of the biggest operators in the UK are the US-owned Cargill, with more than 100 farms, and Moy Park, based in Northern Ireland but backed by a Brazilian company. Another Bureau/Guardian investigation last year discovered that American-style intensive cattle farms, where livestock have restricted or no access to pasture, were becoming more common in the UK. The largest farms fatten up to 6,000 cattle a year on “feedlots”. Such practices receive only a fraction of the coverage of the Greggs vegan sausage roll. But at the same time, there is something unsettling about meat becoming mainly available to the well off, whether it’s due to the price of “beyond organic” beef or an extra tax. There is much that is disturbing about intensive farming; at the same time it would seem nostalgic and questionable to return to a system where only an elite stratum of society has access to animal protein. Already, lower-income households in Britain spend more on food, as a percentage of their income, than the better off: 14% of their annual spend. As a concerned individual, it’s not always clear what to do next. Foodies can cut back on their meat intake, and make sure what they do eat is either offcuts or of impeccable provenance. Vegetarians and vegans will likely continue to grow in both numbers and influence, and the sharing of recipes on sites such as Instagram will inspire more people to eat differently. All of us can lobby our politicians for better standards and monitoring of intensive farms. We’re told that the stories of chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-pumped beef are “inflammatory and misleading”, by the US ambassador to Britain, but post-Brexit, there will be new concerns over food safety and animal welfare. And, in the end, we might have to accept that, on a personal level, our efforts feel insubstantial. “It’s difficult, because if you look at history, the biggest changes in our diet have come through things like war or natural disasters,” says Glencross. “It’s interesting to think: ‘Unless something really big happens, are we drastically going to change?’” She shakes her head and sighs, “Which is slightly worrying.” Something that both Glencross and Simon Fairlie would like to see is more smallholdings, farmed organically. Fairlie has worked out that we would have to eat half the meat we currently consume to cut emissions, but the production of dairy would remain similar. At present, it is difficult and expensive for a farmer to certify as organic; Fairlie would like to see those methods as the standard, while farms that want to use chemicals on their land pay a premium. It sounds like a utopia, but for Richard Vines trying to do things the right way has turned into a decent business. He launched Wild Beef in 1993 with very low expectations. He didn’t set out to be a high-end producer: “It was forced on me. I was going down the tubes otherwise.” Vines was 50, his marriage had just broken down, he’d lost his job and was “unemployable”, in his words. “I had a Land Rover, a Yorkshire terrier, 20 cows and 20 acres,” he recalls, as the wind whips through a frigid Borough Market. The owner of the local abattoir predicted that Wild Beef wouldn’t last three weeks. “Well, that was 26 years ago,” chuckles Vines. Back then the conventional wisdom was that if you wanted to make serious money in farming, you had to operate on the biggest scale possible. Now, Vines believes, there is an alternative, more ethical model. Thanks to farmers’ markets and selling direct to consumers online, a farm can be compact, small-scale and focus on quality rather than quantity. Discerning consumers are out there who care about taste and actively seek out good welfare practices. Vines admits that he relied on luck as much as good judgment when he was starting out, but the modern farmer can choose what kind of operation he or she aspires to run. He smiles and says, “There’ll always be people who want to eat good food.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German online Die Zeit has a report today, Climate Scientists Advise Eating Less Meat, admonishing westerners not to eat meat and not to drink milk, otherwise climate catastrophe will strike us violently.This of course is all based on “science” from the alarmist, government-funded Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany, where activists like Stefan Rahmstorf and Dr. anti-scepticism Hans Joachim Schellnhuber busily examine and analyse each and every negative  impact of each and every western lifestyle sin (at PIK there is nothing positive in western lifestyles – everything is negative).
One potentially mortal sin is the human enjoyment of meat and dairy products. This unforgivable transgression has been carefully scrutinised by PIK climate-impact researcher Dr Alexander Popp, who says:
With a return to Sundays-only meat and reduced consumption of dairy products, Germans can become healthier and do the atmosphere a big favour.
Die Zeit reports, based on PIK science:
The culprits foremost are two climate-gases: methane and nitrous oxide. The first is produced by the digestion of cows and the manure they excrete. The second, and even more potent gas, nitrous oxide, results from fertilising fields.
Popp and his colleagues have calculated that emissions of the two above-mentioned gases will increase by 76% compared to 1995 if meat and dairy product consumption continues to rise at the current rate.

Only with a  changed lifestyle, one that more often refrains from meat and milk products, and one with a climate-friendly production, do the researchers say 1995 levels can be reached.
Shaking a finger, Popp admonishes that:
Today’s emissions levels of the western lifestyle are to blame, and for that reason it is to be expected that people in rich countries be the first to make lifestyle changes. ‘It’s about fulfilling the function of setting an example.’
Popp singles out the real culprits:
The lifestyle of Americans and Europeans acts as a model in developing countries, where meat and milk are status symbols, which is how it should be again for industrial countries, says Popp. For that reason, meat and milk ought not be on the dinner table every day.
So there you have it. Our tax dollars used to fund a bunch of eggheads who have nothing better to do than to gripe and moan, and to constantly nag the rest of society.
Guess what I’m having for dinner today!

"In his shoddy manifesto, the accused shooter in Christchurch identified as an “eco-fascist”. Over the weekend Kellyanne Conway seized on the term – which is unfamiliar to many – to lump him in with so-called “eco-terrorists”, saying “He’s not a conservative. He’s not a Nazi.” No doubt she was banking on common understandings of contemporary environmentalism to draw a link to the political left.  Unfortunately for Conway, Nazism and a twisted version of ecological thinking are joined in the minds of a share of rightwing extremists. In social media and the more secretive spaces of the online far right, eco-fascists are proselytising for genocidal solutions to environmental problems. On Twitter, the “pine tree gang”, which journalist Jake Hanrahan describes as “less a cohesive movement than a loosely connected online subculture”, have been promoting ideas that blend a sense of impending environmental catastrophe with themes taken from white nationalism. This subculture – which so far appears to be small in number – is frequently drawn to a so-called “terror wave” aesthetic, which elevates images of terrorist insurgency; promotes a specific, martial fashion imagery; and fantasies about armed conflict in the wake of environmental and social collapse.Terror wave forums and threads are full of men in balaclavas, brandishing high-powered weaponry, wearing various combinations of tactical gear, combat uniforms and cheap athleisure wear. Images from the 1990s-era conflicts in the Balkans seem to have a particular appeal. You can browse terror wave images anywhere from Reddit to Imgur to YouTube or Twitter. Eco-fascist groups have also been associated with terrorism-promoting neo-Nazi umbrella groups such as The Base, whose alarming online rhetoric was reported on by Vice in 2018. Of course, the vast majority of contemporary environmentalists – those engaged in the noble, desperate struggle to save the planet from the consequences of human recklessness – are political progressives, and even radical leftists. They are not responsible for the co-optation of environmental thought by the far right, and nor should we conflate their position with that of white nationalists. But eco-fascism is a longstanding political ideology that is currently undergoing a revival in the fetid culture of the contemporary extremist right. In general, unlike many on the political right, eco-fascists concede the reality of looming ecological catastrophe. But the “solutions” they propose are frankly genocidal. Eco-fascists have lamented the despoliation of nature, which they associate with modernity and an industrial society which they feel has diminished the connections between race and territory. One of their principal concerns tends to be what they see as human overpopulation, and the tendency of migration and multiculturalism to move races out of their homelands. This line of thought can ultimately be traced back to figures such as Thomas Malthus, who at the end of the 18th century claimed that population growth was outstripping the capacity for food production, and advocated population control as a solution. Nothwithstanding the bad-faith “Hitler was a vegetarian” smears of conservatives, a strain of ecological thought was present in Nazism. In one of the most important modern accounts of eco-fascism, Janet Biehl and Peter Staudenmaier say that Nazi ecology was “linked with traditional agrarian romanticism and hostility to urban civilization”, and that ecological ideas were an “essential element of racial rejuvenation”. The Nazi slogan “blood and soil” was coined by their foremost ecological thinker, Richard Walter Darré, who meant it to capture a mystical link between race and a particular territory. In the decades since the rise of the modern environmental movement, the far right has continued its efforts to co-opt ecological thoughts and corrupt environmental movements. Some of the most important research on eco-fascism has come from people seeking to resist their entry into the environmental movement. At the same time, a small number of ecological thinkers have allowed themselves to canvass openly anti-human, eliminationist viewpoints that offer a ready basis for authoritarian, genocidal responses to ecological disaster. This is especially true in segments of the so-called “deep ecology” movement. Contemporary eco-fascists are inspired by a number of key figures. One is “Unabomber” Ted Kaczynski, whose terrorist campaign against what he called “industrial society” combined violence, misanthropy and a self-dramatising manifesto. Kaczynski’s apocalyptic account of a doomed, destructive civilisation – further expounded in his voluminous prison writings – and his willingness to act as a self-appointed executioner of his adversaries is a central inspiration for the would-be terrorists in the eco-fascist movement. Some, including Hanrahan, claim that the Netflix drama, “Manhunt: Unabomber”, aided the growth spurt of contemporary eco-fascism. Another figure who gets a lot of play in contemporary eco-fascist circles is Finnish deep ecologist writer Pentti Linkola, who openly calls for an end to immigration, the reversion to pre-industrial life ways, and authoritarian measures to keep human life within strict limits. Linkola is responsible for one of the starkest presentations of so-called “lifeboat ethics”, the idea that in the context of ongoing environmental collapse, some people should simply be allowed to die. “What to do,” Linkola writes in Can Life Prevail, “when a ship carrying a hundred passengers suddenly capsizes and there is only one lifeboat? When the lifeboat is full, those who hate life will try to load it with more people and sink the lot. Those who love and respect life will take the ship’s axe and sever the extra hands that cling to the sides.” Inspirations such as these have fuelled an online subculture that looks forward to, and even talks about accelerating the end of industrial civilisation. It dreams of a return to a blood and soil relationship between peoples and territories, and of a post-collapse society which will restore the authority of white men. Some of the people involved in this subculture also venerate dramatic images of insurgency and terror. It’s still hard to know how much of the alleged shooter’s manifesto to take seriously, but an eco-fascist inspiration is plausible enough to consider as we wait for more information to emerge from his trial and surrounding investigations. It’s hard to know exactly how many people are immersed in this milieu, but we have seen the damage just one man can do. What else might this ideology inspire? More broadly, while conservatives (like Trump) are fixated on denialism, parts of the radical right not only acknowledge environmental collapse, but welcome it as an opportunity to re-order society along their preferred lines, and to cleanse the Earth of those they despise. This makes a democratic, just, and global response to climate change all the more urgent. We must save our planet, and we must not create even the smallest opportunities for fascists. • Jason Wilson is a columnist for Guardian Australia"

Prof. H. Luedecke and C.O. Weiss
(Original German version here.)
We reported recently about our spectral analysis work of European temperatures [1] which shows that during the last centuries all climate changes were caused by periodic (i.e. natural) processes. Non-periodic processes like a warming through the monotonic increase of CO2 in the atmosphere could cause at most 0.1° to 0.2° warming for a doubling of the CO2 content, as it is expected for 2100.
Fig. 1 (Fig. 6 of [1] ) shows the measured temperatures (blue) and the temperatures reconstructed using the 6 strongest frequency components (red) of the Fourier spectrum, indicating that the temperature history is determined by periodic processes only.
On sees from Fig. 1 that two cycles of periods 200+ years and ~65 years dominate the climate changes, the 200+ year cycle causing the largest part of the temperature increase since 1870.

Fig. 1: Construction of temperatures using the 6 strongest Fourier components (red),  European temperatures from instrumental measurements (blue). It is apparent that only  a 200+ year cycle and a ~65 year cycle play a significant role.
The ~65 year cycle is the well-known, much studied, and well understood “Atlantic/Pacific oscillation” (AMO/PDO).  It can be traced back for 1400 years. The AMO/PDO has no external forcing it is “intrinsic dynamics”, an “oscillator”.
Although the spectral analysis of the historical instrumental temperature measurements [1] show a strong 200+ year period, it cannot be inferred with certainty from these measurements, since only 240 years of measurement data are available. However, the temperatures obtained from the Spannagel stalagmite show this periodicity as the strongest climate variation by far since about 1100 AD.
The existence of this 200+ year periodicity has nonetheless been doubted. Even though temperatures from the Spannagel stalagmite agree well with temperatures derived from North Atlantic sedimentation; and even though the solar “de Vries cycle”, which has this period length, is known for a long time as an essential factor determining the global climate.
A perfect confirmation for the existence and the dominant influence of the 200+ year cycle as found by us [1] is provided by a recent paper [2] which analyses solar activities for periodic processes.

Fig. 2: Spectrum of solar activity showing the 208 year period as the strongest climate variation.
The spectrum Fig. 2  (Fig. 1d of [2]) shows clearly a 208-year period as the strongest variation of the solar activity. Fig. 3 (Fig. 4 of [2]) gives us the solar activity of the past until today as well as the prediction for the coming 500 years. This prediction is possible due to the multi-periodic character of the activity.

Fig. 3: Solar activity from 1650 to present (measurement, solid line) and prediction for the coming 500 years (light gray: prediction from spectrum, dark gray: prediction from wavelet analysis). Letters M,D,G denote the historical global temperature minima: Maunder, Dalton, Gleissberg.

The solar activity agrees well with the terrestrial climate. It clearly shows in particular all historic temperature minima. Thus the future temperatures can be predicted from the activities – as far as they are determined by the sun (the AMO/PDO is not determined by the sun).
The 200+ year period found  here [2], as it is found by us [1] is presently at its maximum. Through its influence the temperature will decrease until 2100 to a value like the one of the last “Little Ice Age” 1870.
The wavelet analysis of the solar activity Fig. 4 (Fig. 1b of [2]) has interesting detail. In spite of its limited resolution it shows (as our analysis of the Spannagel stalagmite did) that the 200+ year period set in about 1000 years ago. This cycle appears, according to Fig. 4, regularly every 2500 years. (The causes for this 2500 year period are probably not understood.)

Fig. 4: Wavelet analysis of solar activity (showing which periods were active at which time). The dominant oscillations (periods between 125 years and 250 years) are clearly recognizable and recurring at 2500 years.
Summary
The analysis of solar activity proves the existence and the strength of the 200+ year periodicity which we found from historical temperature measurements, as well as from the Spannagel stalagmite data. This 200+ year cycle is apparently the one known as “de Vries cycle”.
This solar “de Vries cycle together with the AMO/PDO determine practically completely the global climate of the past  (Fig. 1) and the coming time. A significant influence of CO2 on the climate thus has to be excluded. This latter is not surprising in view of the small amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and its weak infrared absorption cross section (also in view of the various proves of NEGATIVE water feedback).

Fig. 5: Predicted global temperature of “official” models  (red) and real (measured) global temperature (green).
The present “stagnation” of global temperature (Fig. 5) is essentially due to the AMO/PDO: the solar de Vries cycle is presently at its maximum. Around this maximum it changes negligibly. The AMO/PDO is presently beyond its maximum, corresponding to the small decrease of global temperature. Its next minimum will be 2035. The temperature can expected to be then similar to the last AMO/PDO minimum of 1940. Due to the de Vries cycle, the global temperature will drop until 2100 to a value corresponding to the “little ice age” of 1870.
It accounts for the long temperature rise since 1870. One may note, that the stronger temperature increase from the 1970s to the 1990s, which is “officially” argued to prove warming by CO2, is essentially due to the AMO/PDO cycle.

"Today, American students from all 50 states are taking part in what could be one of the largest environment protests in history: a global school strike to demand that adults take action on climate change. In addition to a major rally at the US Capitol and more than 70 events around the country, the actions included an 11-minute school walkout at 11am ET to draw attention to a recent UN report warning that we have just 11 years to avoid a climate change catastrophe.  To support the students, and highlight the global emergency, the Guardian devoted our entire US front page – containing more than 40 stories – to climate change coverage from 11am to 11.11am ET. You can view our complete climate front page here.  The Guardian is also providing 24 hours of live coverage of the global student strikes as they travel across countries and time zones. The coverage began last night with our colleagues in Australia and has included reports from correspondents in Thailand, the UK, Belgium, Sweden, France, Spain, the US and many more. Throughout the day, the Guardian will highlight the voices of young people from the US and around the world who have never known a world where the climate isn’t rapidly heating. And in the coming year, and particularly in our 2020 election coverage, the Guardian will strive to feature the voices of young people in our climate reporting to ensure that those whose lives will be most affected by climate policy over the next century are part of the conversation. We hope you will consider making a contribution to support the Guardian’s independent journalism and our unique commitment to climate reporting.  In solidarity with the students joining today's global climate strike, Guardian US is devoting its homepage to climate change for the duration of the walkout, between 11:00 and 11:11am. The 11 minutes represents the number of years the UN has predicted the planet has before a global climate catastrophe. A post shared by  The Guardian US (@guardian_us) on Mar 15, 2019 at 8:03am PDT"
"It’s always unwise to call peak farce when we are dealing with Australia’s torturous climate and energy debate, so perhaps we can just categorise the following incident as mildly surreal. Scott Morrison was in Melbourne for much of this past week. On Wednesday he was out on the hustings with Daniel Andrews, one of the most progressive political leaders in the country, and a premier who has recently secured an emphatic mandate from the people. By stapling himself to Andrews, by cooperating mightily in a state where the Liberals are in deep political trouble, perhaps Morrison was hoping for a small measure of reflected goodwill. Whatever his aspirations, Morrison was asked about coal, as he has been every day since a group of Queensland Nationals decided to go to war with their leader Michael McCormack. The brawl that has fractured the government was unleashed just over a week ago, and it relates to McCormack’s failure to shirt-front the Liberals on coal plants and on divestiture powers to break up energy companies. For some of the rebels, this is a proxy war about Barnaby Joyce returning to the leadership (yes, really). For others, coal and energy really is the burning issue. Reporters inquired on Wednesday how Morrison could tolerate the Nationals defying his leadership by banging on relentlessly about wanting new coal plants. He calmly mouthed the responses prime ministers mouth in trying situations. Morrison noted that Joyce (“a passionate fellow”) had returned the red cordial to the fridge and was now sequestered, spent after a spell of thrashing, on the time-out step. Joyce had “settled” the insurrection, Morrison said, by acknowledging it had been a “misstep” to describe himself as the “elected deputy prime minister”. Having declared peace in our time (and I deploy that phrase in the Neville Chamberlain sense), Morrison then rolled around to energy projects. He said the government was about “supporting the development of commercially viable and feasible baseload power all around the country”. These projects could be “gas, it could be hydrogen … it could be hydro”. There’s a word missing there, right? It starts with c and ends in l. The prime minister declined to utter the word coal. As well as gas, hydrogen and hydro, Morrison noted there could be “other traditional sources”. C-o-a-l could not pass his lips. This omission would be of only glancing interest, or perhaps zero interest, had the prime minister not been the same bloke who, seemingly five minutes ago, had brought a lump of coal into the Australian parliament and brandished it lustily during question time, in one of the most boneheaded performances ever to grace the bear pit. “This is coal,” the then treasurer declared triumphantly in February 2017, brandishing his prop as if he’d just stumbled across an exotic species previously thought to be extinct. “Don’t be afraid,” Morrison said, soothingly, to his political opponents, waving the black rock kindly supplied by the Minerals Council of Australia. “Don’t be scared.” Just for the record, no one was scared then – except perhaps members of the voting public transiently in the visitors galleries of the House of Representatives witnessing the sudden onset of shark-jumping as a parliamentary sport. But perhaps the strange coal seance of 2017 was all a harbinger, more omen than stunt, because it’s pretty clear that Morrison, to borrow from himself, is a bit scared now. Being trepidatious is entirely reasonable, because it’s clear to anyone watching that there is a schism inside the government. Put simply, the schism is this. The Nationals want Morrison to produce a shortlist that commits the Coalition to supporting new coal projects. They want an explicit commitment made in public before the federal election, because they believe that commitment pays political dividends in central Queensland. To underscore this point, Joyce noted during one of his interventions that he was intent on protecting the interests of his regional heartland, and didn’t give a stuff about the climate-induced anxieties of voters in Melbourne. (In case you are wondering, this isn’t the normal Joyce word salad; this is a deliberate smack at the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. The Nationals believe Frydenberg is running most of the internal interference on this issue, because he’s worried about his inner city seat, and others like it.) The Liberals have made it equally clear that they do n-o-t (underlined) want the government to put taxpayers on the hook by supporting coal before the election, because that is the equivalent of cordially inviting their small-l liberal heartland to take out their baseball bats and start swinging come May – not just in Melbourne, but right around the country. If you are Morrison, that’s not an easy difference to split. Unless there’s some grand bargain in the offing – Morrison supporting a north Queensland coal project, then sealing the border allowing any Liberals south of Noosa plausible deniability – this is a straight win/loss proposition. Either the Nationals win, or the Liberals win, and while this unresolved roiling persists (and I predict the Nationals will persist), the bottom line is the government loses. While the priority is internal death match politics, the government makes its own compelling case for why Australian voters should show it the door. Just to summarise the general ludicrousness, in the space of seven months the government has gone from rolling Malcolm Turnbull in large part because he was too progressive on climate change, and dumping the national energy guarantee that might have given them all a measure of electoral protection on this issue, to the prime minister being unable to utter the word coal in public, for fear of offending voters worried about climate change. As the kids say, life comes at you fast. You wouldn’t believe it had you not seen it with your own eyes. Meanwhile, as the numpty show rolled on, and on, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank stood amid the clamour of the week and said what anyone with any respect for facts and evidence now says: climate change is real. It’s not cyclical, it’s a trend, and if we don’t start factoring it into our policy settings and our business decisions (meaning the prudent management of carbon risk), then Australia’s financial stability is at risk. It was an important speech from Guy Debelle, both in terms of the content, and in terms of the signal. Debelle speaks for an institution apparently intent on telling the public it does not intend to drop the ball on this most important of policy issues, which might give the students who demonstrated around the country on Friday some measure of comfort that the failure of their parents isn’t absolute. Eyes will also be on Labor over the coming weeks. The party that wants to form the next government is expected to release the remaining elements of its policy on climate change: what it will do to reduce pollution from heavy emitters, in transport and agriculture. Given the diabolical history of this issue, there is nervousness in Labor’s ranks about the onset of yet another cheap scare campaign once the policy is subjected to scrutiny, and the policy will be heavily scrutinised, not only by journalists but also by the stakeholders now assuming Labor wins the contest in May. Polling, both private and public, makes clear that a majority of Australians want action on climate change. Many voters see the cheapjack opportunism of the past decade as symptomatic of a political system that has lost its way. While political actors who favour rational action on climate change have the wind at their back in a way I haven’t seen since the federal campaign of 2007, there’s only one way to get a mandate to decarbonise the Australian economy. It’s not complicated. You have to seek one, and be brave enough to do that without fudges or strategic omissions or weasel words. -Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia’s political editor"
"They have a national reach that most climate campaigners would die for. They are familiar and respected experts on the science of meteorology. And they have prime-time slots at the end of almost every TV news bulletin, morning, noon and night. But the weather forecasters who guide everything from our clothing choices to our weekend plans seldom – if ever – mention the issue that is increasingly shaping our beloved British weather: climate change. This week, former BBC weatherman Bill Giles broke cover, and called for the BBC and other major broadcasters to overhaul their approach to forecasts, and add in information about the crucial context of climate change to their predictions about the daily weather.  While the weather can’t always straightforwardly be equated with a changing climate, the impacts of climate change are no longer a hypothetical concern, or a discussion for the future. Climate change is with us now, and is manifesting through rising temperatures, more violent and unpredictable storms, and heavier rainfall. What Giles rightly highlighted is that while weather forecasting continues to operate in a vacuum while the climate changes around us, it is abdicating its duty to provide accurate, scientifically-grounded meteorological advice to the public. Don’t people have a right to know how their climate is changing? And aren’t weather forecasts the obvious place to alert us to these new risks that we face? In fact, the UK is lagging far behind many other countries in terms of integrating what we know about climate change with the information provided to the public about the weather. In the notoriously polarised US, a brilliant programme led by George Mason University in Virginia and Climate Central has supported more than 600 TV meteorologists to contextualise their weather forecasts with information about the changing climate. Similar successes have been seen in Australia, where a programme run out of Monash University provides localised climate information in their weather segments. In Belgium, the weather forecaster Jill Peters has made a career from campaigning on climate change. So the silence from British broadcasters is troubling, and Giles’s intervention is long overdue. In a sense, the broadcasters’ nervousness is understandable – for a long time, it simply wasn’t possible to make definitive statements about the relationship between weather and climate. Communicators were faced with a catch-22 situation: make speculative statements about extreme weather and climate change, or sit on their hands while the very changes scientists had been predicting for decades materialised around them. But the science of ‘‘attributing’’ weather events to climate change has accelerated rapidly. It is now possible to say with confidence how much more likely (or how much more intense) a storm, or a heatwave, was made by climate change. Statements about the links between weather and climate still need to be made carefully, and in line with the science. But this kind of probabilistic, risk-based guidance is the bread and butter of TV weather forecasters, and they’re the perfect people to give audiences an insight into how the climate is changing. None of this means that accurate information about the risks of climate change is a panacea for public engagement on climate change. Its now well understood (and more than ever in thisera of “fake news”) that accurate evidence alone is unlikely to move the dial for people who don’t want to hear it. And simply hammering people with information about the risks of climate change could be counterproductive. The social science of climate communication points to the importance of striking a motivating balance between hope and fear in public messages. In practice, this means not only raising the alarm about the often terrifying consequences of a changing climate, but also providing advice and support on what people can do to save more energy, waste less food, or lobby their MP to prioritise climate change. Clearly, our humble weather forecasters can’t do this all on their own. But the inspiring rise of the school strike movement is proof of the frustration and urgency with which young people view the issue that will define their lives, and suggests the era of side lining climate change as something that environmentalists worry about, while the rest of us get on with our lives, may finally be coming to an end. From the way we eat, travel and heat our homes, to the conventions that govern our weather forecasts, climate change needs to move from the margins and into the mainstream – and fast. A daily public narrative that joins the dots between the weather patterns we see outside our windows, and the unprecedented changes now under way in the global climate, is one crucial piece of this puzzle. • Adam Corner is the research director at Climate Outreach and an honorary research fellow in the School of Psychology, Cardiff University"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis morning major media outlets are warning that a major Atlantic storm (Xaver) is brewing East of the southern tip of Greenland.
The DWD has issued the following storm track with projected barometric pressure.

Mi = Wednesday, Do = Thursday, Fr = Friday and Sa = Saturday, T = Low. Source: DWD_presse/status/408119086887870465.
The pressure is expected to drop to 966 hPa by Thursday as Xaver crosses southern Norway and reaches Sweden. Wind speeds could reach 180 km/hour at some North Sea coastal areas. Cities like Hamburg, Bremen and Rostock could see winds of up to 140 km/hr. The back side of the storm is expected to pump Arctic air down over Germany and causing blizzard conditions and heavy snow.

"Brexit is reversible. Article 50 can be juggled, delayed, and bounced around until the government decides to reboot and restart the process. In the meantime, another meaningless “meaningful vote” could happen in the next few days – while we ignore the only threat that truly matters. The effects of climate change are irreversible. That’s why it’s a crisis. The UN’s warning last year lays bare the dangers of this emergency. And these are dangers that we can only attempt to predict, because Earth has never faced a disaster of this nature before: the future is volatile on an unprecedented scale, with famines, floods, and droughts looming over us.   An urgent re-evaluation of our government’s priorities is imperative, morally and fundamentally, for everyone’s sake. The only members of our parliament who seem to have recognised this are the handful who showed up to the climate change debate that followed the last youth strikes. What could have been a revolutionary debate on our future, an opportunity for change and development of our climate policies, was instead just another disappointing instalment in the disheartening saga of government and parliamentary inactivity. What governments all over the world need to realise is that we still have an opportunity to take action. Nothing is as important as tackling climate change. It is our government’s duty to tackle the air pollution crisis, rapidly switch to renewable energy and make our economy more sustainable. We must take advantage of our connected, global community to create change in climate legislation around the world. In the US the Green New Deal spearheaded by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which could cut American greenhouse-gas emissions in half by 2030, is the very definition of what we must and can achieve as a collective, working together to end corporate climate tyranny. The implementation of similar strategies across the globe, by people united in the aim of saving our planet from ourselves, currently stands as our only solution. There is strength in numbers. The youth strikes have been a testament to the power of international solidarity. We will face our global environmental demise together – we will fight it together. But the dynamic, unified efforts of my generation to effectively save our planet should not be torn apart by nationalism; that would be an affront to all of us. We are going on strike because we are desperate to make the changes necessary for our survival. The only way we can is by cooperating with other countries – particularly European countries, our neighbours, friends, and allies – to legislate new, stricter regulations on the greatest polluters and contributors to global warming, namely, the oil and gas giants, that operate across the continent. Leaving the EU will only exacerbate our climate problems, and Brexit is the distraction climate deniers have longed for. To allow our government to play into their hands is a betrayal of ourselves and our planet – and of every young striker across the globe. The time for isolationism has passed. Instead, as a global collective, we must follow the lead of the younger generations, for their unity is a concrete affirmation of the only option we have left: international action. • Noga Levy-Rapoport, 17, led the London climate strike march on 15 February and has since become a core organiser at UK Student Climate Network"
"I want to say to all the climate strikers today: thank you so much for being unreasonable. That is, if reasonable means playing by the rules, and the rules are presumed to be guidelines for what is and is not possible, then you may be told that what you are asking for is impossible or unreasonable. Don’t listen. Don’t stop. Don’t let your dreams shrink by one inch. Don’t forget that this might be the day and the pivotal year when you rewrite what is possible.  What climate activists are asking for is a profound change in all our energy systems, for leaving fossil fuel in the ground, for taking action adequate to the planet-scale crisis of climate change. And the rules we are so often reminded of by those who aren’t ready for change are not the real rules. Because one day last summer a 15-year-old girl sat down to stage a one-person climate strike, and a lot of adults would like to tell you that the rules say a 15-year-old girl cannot come out of nowhere, alone, and change the world. Sweden’s Greta Thunberg already has. They will tell you the rules are that those we see in the news and the parliaments and boardrooms hold all the power and you must be nice to them and perhaps they will give you crumbs, or the time of day, or just a door slammed in your face. They will tell you that things can only change in tiny increments by predictable means. They’re wrong. Sometimes you don’t have to ask for permission or for anything because you hold the power and you yourselves decide which way the door swings. Nothing is possible without action; almost anything is when we rise up together, as you are doing today. I am writing you in gratitude and enthusiasm as someone who has lived for almost six decades, which has been time enough to see extraordinary change. To see what had been declared impossible happen over and over again. To see regimes topple when ordinary people rise up in nonviolent direct action. To see dramatic expansions of rights in both law and imagination. To see what were once radical new ideas about gender and sexual orientation and race, about justice and equality, about nature and ecology become ordinary accepted ideas – and then to see people forget how our minds were changed, and how much that process matters too. The world I was born into no longer exists. The role of women has changed extraordinarily since then, largely for the better. The entire Soviet empire collapsed suddenly 30 years ago, a few years after the east bloc of communist countries liberated themselves through the actions of people who were themselves supposed to be powerless to topple regimes backed by great militaries and secret police. I saw apartheid fall in South Africa, and a prisoner doing life become its president. I was born into a world where to be gay or lesbian or trans was criminalized, and I watched those laws and attitudes be change in states, in my country, the US, and in many countries. I saw wind and solar power go from awkward, ineffectual, expensive technologies only 20 years ago to become the means through which we can leave the age of fossil fuel behind. I have seen a language to recognize the Earth’s environmental systems arise in my lifetime, a language that can describe how everything is connected, and everything has consequences. Through studying what science teaches us about nature and what history teaches us about social forces I have come to see how beautiful and how powerful are the threads that connect us. Here’s one. Who did Greta Thunberg describe as a key influence on her actions? Rosa Parks. That a black woman born in Tuskegee, Alabama, in 1913 would influence a white girl born in Sweden 90 years later to take direct action about climate change is a reminder that everything is connected and your actions matter even when the results aren’t immediate or obvious. The way Rosa Parks broke the rules and lived according to her ideals still matters, still has power, still has influence beyond what she could have imagined, beyond her lifetime, beyond her continent, beyond her particular area of activism. The rules are the rules of the obvious, the easy assumptions that we know who holds power, we know how change happens, we know what is possible. But the real lesson of history is that change often comes in unpredictable ways, power can suddenly be in the hands of those who appear out of what seems to the rest of us like nowhere. I did not see Thunberg coming, or the Sunrise Movement or Extinction Rebellion or Zero Hour. When I went to Standing Rock I never dreamed this indigenous-led uprising against an oil pipeline would inspire Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to run for office. Nor that she would go on to win a victory that broke all the rules and become the great spokesperson for a Green New Deal. I didn’t dream it, but I knew that something powerful, magical, alive with possibility was happening. That’s why I wasn’t surprised when it did, and why I don’t assume we have seen all of what that gathering in 2016 achieved, either. It is not over, any more than Rosa Parks’s impact is over. Good work matters. Acting on your ideals matters. How it matters is not always immediate or obvious. What I see all around me is what I call climate momentum: people from New Zealand to Norway stepping up their response to climate change. I see pipeline blockades in Canada and the US, I see investors backing off from fracking and coal, I see universities and pension funds divesting from fossil fuel, I see solar farms and wind turbines going in all over the world and engineers working to make the technologies better, I see lawsuits against oil companies and coal companies, I see politicians, newspaper editorialists, businesspeople and others who have power under the usual rules getting on board in a way they never have before. There is so much happening, in so many ways, to respond to the biggest disaster our species has ever faced. It is not yet enough, but it is a sign that more and more are facing the catastrophe and are doing something about it. I don’t know what will happen, because what will happen is what we make happen. That is why there’s a global climate strike today. This is why I’ve started saying, Don’t ask what will happen. Be what happens. Today, you are what is happening. Today, your power will be felt. Today, your action matters. Today in your individual action you may stand with a few people or with hundreds, but you stand with billions around the world. Today you are standing up for people not yet born, and those ghostly billions are with you too. Today you are the force of possibility that runs through the present like a river through the desert.

"Tens of thousands of young people took to the streets on Friday with a clear message to world leaders: act now to save our planet and our future from the climate emergency. These schoolchildren have grasped something that seems to elude many of their elders: we are in a race for our lives, and we are losing. The window of opportunity is closing – we no longer have the luxury of time, and climate delay is almost as dangerous as climate denial.  My generation has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change. This is deeply felt by young people. No wonder they are angry. Despite years of talk, global emissions are reaching record levels and show no sign of peaking. The concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is the highest it has been in 3m years. The last four years were the four hottest on record, and winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen by 3-4°C in the last 50 years. Sea levels are rising, coral reefs are dying and we are starting to see the life-threatening impact of climate change on health, through air pollution, heatwaves and risks to food security. Thankfully, we have the Paris agreement – a visionary, viable, forward-looking policy framework that sets out exactly what needs to be done to stop climate disruption and reverse its impact. But the agreement itself is meaningless without ambitious action. That is why I am bringing world leaders together at a climate action summit later this year. I am calling on all leaders to come to New York in September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45% over the next decade, and to net zero by 2050. The summit will bring together governments, the private sector, civil society, local authorities and other international organisations to develop ambitious solutions in six areas: renewable energy; emission reductions; sustainable infrastructure; sustainable agriculture and management of forests and oceans; withstanding climate impacts; and investing in the green economy. The latest analysis shows that if we act now, we can reduce carbon emissions within 12 years and limit global warming to 1.5C. But if we continue along our current path, the consequences are impossible to predict. While climate action is essential to combat an existential threat, it also comes with costs. So action plans must not create winners and losers or add to economic inequality: they must be fair and create new opportunities for those negatively impacted, in the context of a just transition. Business is on our side. Accelerated climate solutions can strengthen our economies and create jobs, while bringing cleaner air, preserving natural habitats and biodiversity, and protecting our environment. New technologies and engineering solutions are already delivering energy at a lower cost than the fossil-fuel driven economy. Solar and onshore wind are now the cheapest sources of new bulk power in virtually all major economies. But we must set radical change in motion. This means ending subsidies for fossil fuels and high-emitting agriculture and shifting towards renewable energy, electric vehicles and climate-smart practices. It means carbon pricing that reflects the true cost of emissions, from climate risk to the health hazards of air pollution. And it means accelerating the closure of coal plants and replacing jobs with healthier alternatives so that the transformation is just, inclusive and profitable. Momentum is building, people are listening and there is a new determination to unleash the promise of the Paris agreement. The climate summit must be the starting point to build the future we need. I will close with a message for those who marched on Friday. I know young people can and do change the world. Many of you are anxious and fearful for the future, and I understand your concerns and your anger. But I know humankind is capable of enormous achievements. Your voices give me hope. The more I see your commitment and activism, the more confident I am that we will win. Together, with your help and thanks to your efforts, we can and must beat this threat and create a cleaner, safer, greener world for everyone. • António Guterres is secretary general of the United Nations"

"From Australia to America, children put down their books on Friday to march for change in the first global climate strike. The event was embraced in the developing nations of India and Uganda and in the Philippines and Nepal – countries acutely impacted by climate change - as tens of thousands of schoolchildren and students in more than 100 countries went on “strike”, demanding the political elite urgently address what they say is a climate emergency. In Sydney, where about 30,000 children and young people marched from the Town Hall Square to Hyde Park, university student Xander De Vries, 20, said: “It’s our time to rise up. We don’t have a lot of time left; it’s us who have to make a change so I thought it would be important to be here and show support to our generation.” Coordinated via social media by volunteers in 125 countries and regions, the action spread across more than 2,000 events under the banner of Fridays for Future. As dusk fell in the antipodes, the baton was passed to Asia, where small groups of Indian students went on strike for the first time. In Delhi, more than 200 children walked out of classes to protest against inaction on tackling climate change, and similar protests took place on a smaller scale in 30 towns and cities. Vidit Baya, 17, who is in his last year at MDS public school in Udaipur, said: “In India, no one talks about climate change. You don’t see it on the news or in the papers or hear about it from government. “This was our first strike as a nation and there were young people taking strike action in many cities. It is a fledgling movement but we are very happy with our action today. We are trying to get people to be more aware of climate change and the need to tackle it.” Across Africa, there were strikes in several countries. In Uganda, Kampala international student Hilda Nakabuye addressed striking students in the capital.

She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries. Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.” Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings. Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. In Sweden, youngsters gathered in Stockholm’s central square to hear 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, the girl whose single-minded determination has inspired millions of people around the world and earned a nomination this week for the Nobel peace prize. When she appeared, the crowd chanted her name and she earned cheers and applause by telling them: “We have been born into this world and we have to live with this crisis, and our children and our grandchildren. We are facing the greatest existential crisis humanity has ever faced. And yet it has been ignored. You who have ignored it know who you are.” Political leaders in some countries criticised the strikes. In Australia, the education minister, Dan Tehan, said: “Students leaving school during school hours to protest is not something that we should encourage.” The UK’s education secretary, Damian Hinds, claimed the disruption increased teachers’ workloads and wasted lesson time. But young people brushed off the criticism. Jean Hinchcliffe, 14, striking in Sydney, said on the Today programme: “I have been really frustrated and really angry about the fact I don’t have a voice in politics and I don’t have a voice in the climate conversation when my politicians are pretty much refusing to do anything … So I decided to strike and … suddenly us kids are being listened to and that’s why we continue to strike and feel it’s so important.” In the UK, where an estimated 10,000 young people gathered in London and thousands more took to the streets in Edinburgh and Glasgow, as well as other towns and cities, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, broke ranks with Hinds and praised the action in a video message with other Conservative MPs. “Collective action of the kind you’re championing can make a difference and a profound one,” Gove said. “Together we can beat climate change. “It will require us to change the way in which our energy is generated, change the way in which our homes are built, change the way in which our land is managed and farming operates. But that change is absolutely necessary.” In Tokyo, young people had earlier marched through the city’s Shibuya scramble crossing as part of the climate strike. About 130 people – including school and university students and other supporters – joined in the march, which started at the United Nations university and wound its way through the streets of the capital, including the busy Omotesando shopping street. One of the organisers, Ten Maekawa, 20, led the crowd in chants of: “What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now!” Maekawa said he believed it was important for youth to mobilise on the issue: “In 2030, the Earth will be in danger because of climate change. They’re responsible for the future, so it’s very important for the young generation to speak up about climate change.” In Florida, Marcela Mulholland, a 21-year-old student who in her lifetime has witnessed how rising sea levels are threatening her home and community, urged young people across the world to continue their campaign. “There’s no better way to find hope and meaning in this trying time than working alongside fellow people who share my grief for the world,” she said. Elsewhere in the United States, young people carried hand painted signs sporting their own slogans: “Denial is not a policy” and “fight now or swim l8r”. More than a hundred students marched across the Capitol’s lawn in DC, chanting “What do we want? Climate action. When do we want it? Now,” and were urged on by speakers organised by the Youth Climate Strike US. “It is time the world listens to these young people and pays attention to what we’re asking for,” said 16-year-old Maddy Fernands, the group’s press director. The speakers included Minneapolis resident Isra Hirsi, the 16-year-old daughter of Ilhan Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress in 2018. “Yes, we are at a dark moment in our history, but we are the light that can bring change,” Hirsi told the crowd. “We must end the extraction of the dirtiest fossil fuel in the world and keep it in the ground.” - Additional reporting by David Crouch in Sweden "

"Toyota and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) will kick in $7.4m to transform part of the carmaker’s decommissioned car manufacturing site in Altona into a commercial-grade hydrogen production and refuelling site. The new centre will demonstrate the processes required to produce hydrogen from renewable sources through electrolysis, and then the subsequent compression and storage.  Arena says the centre, once operational, will produce at least 60kg of renewable hydrogen each day, with onsite solar PV and battery storage providing electricity to support the energy requirements of the project. The president and chief executive of Toyota Australia, Matt Callachor, says the new centre on the Altona site will contribute to the carmaker meeting its target of zero CO2 emissions from sites and vehicles by 2050. “Hydrogen has the potential to play a pivotal role in the future because it can be used to store and transport energy from wind, solar and other renewable sources to power many things, including vehicles like the Toyota Mirai fuel cell electric vehicle,” Callachor said. “Right now, the biggest factor to the success of hydrogen being widely available is the lack of infrastructure,” the Toyota chief said. “The sooner we move to a zero-emissions society, the better, and Toyota is committed to making this a reality.” The Morrison government has opened public consultations on a national hydrogen strategy, after engaging Australia’s chief scientist to develop a roadmap with the cooperation of Canberra and the states. The Coalition’s move follows a commitment from Labor in January to set aside $1bn in funding from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation for clean hydrogen development, and to invest up to $90m from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency for research, demonstration and pre-commercial deployment of hydrogen technologies. Hydrogen is being promoted as a replacement for natural gas. It is being used overseas in the transport sector and in electricity generation. Last December, the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, recommended state and federal energy ministers take three immediate steps to develop the industry. He recommended work to allow up to 10% hydrogen in the domestic gas network, including making the required regulatory changes and implementation of technical standards. He said governments should scope potential for building hydrogen refuelling stations in every state and territory, focused on heavy transport, and undertake what he termed “co-ordinated international outreach to keep building Australia’s profile with major trading partners as a potential supplier”. Finkel said heavy vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells could meet increasing demand for zero-emissions transport, and replacing natural gas with hydrogen was an economical way of decarbonising direct combustion. The Arena chief executive officer, Darren Miller, said on Tuesday the demonstration of low-cost hydrogen production and distribution on the Altona site “is key to the uptake of hydrogen-powered electric vehicles in areas such as truck, bus and government fleets”. Miller welcomed Toyota’s decision to invest in local hydrogen infrastructure. “Australia holds a competitive advantage to play a global role in the emerging hydrogen export market due to our existing expertise and infrastructure,” the Arena chief said. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, said Australia had the potential to be a “world leader in hydrogen” because of abundant energy resources and proximity to emerging export markets in north Asia. Toyota’s electrolyser and hydrogen refuelling station is expected to be fully operational by late 2020."

"The Guardian asked student environmentalists from groups including the Youth Climate Strike US, the Sunrise Movement, Zero Hour, and Youth v. Apocalypse to explain why they are going on strike. Here are some of the responses we received, but you can read more on our 24-hour Climate Strike edition of our live blog.  I am 17 and cannot vote. Young people are not given social or legal agency over their own lives. We are often marginalized in adult spaces, and I’ve spent many conversations waiting for an invitation to speak because the adults talking took automatic authority. When generations of elected leaders have failed to take action on a crisis clearly and undeniably present, it falls on the shoulders of young people to make change happen. My generation has the solutions, and I am joining the Youth Climate Strike to break the pattern of adults silencing youth voices. I am a descendant of Holocaust victims, and I was born in New York City in the aftermath of 9/11. These tragic events allowed for my birth and made my loved ones and me who we are. Because of this, I recognize that terrible things can create good. When I feel overwhelmed by fear about the future, I fight it by remembering that the climate crisis is a chance to create lasting justice, from overpowering greedy corporations to demanding change for people of color who are disproportionately impacted by environmental issues. Supporting the Green New Deal, which prioritizes the most at-risk people and provides alternatives to those corporations, helps me know I’m doing good, not just preventing bad. I’m striking Friday because I live in Philadelphia, a city I love with my whole heart. Philadelphia is one of the most polluted major cities in the United States. In Philadelphia, at least 50% of our air pollution comes from fossil fuel projects around the city, most of which are located in low-income communities and communities of color. In Philadelphia, public schools missed five days of school in August and September this year due to excessive heat. In Philadelphia, 156,000 people, or 10% of our population, will be displaced by sea level rise if we don’t make drastic changes to our carbon emissions. I’m striking because I feel like I have run out of ways to communicate to my elected officials, that inaction on the climate crisis is violence, and that it is my life and air and future, and the lives and air and futures of every other 17-year-old girl – every young person – that are on the line. There is no planet B for my generation to escape the consequences of climate change. As a 17-year-old environmental justice activist, I fight for climate protection and a world run without pollution from fossil fuels. As I became more involved in the Zero Hour movement, I learned that where I live, in Riverside county, California, has some of the worst air quality in our country. Online and multinational corporations have built mega-developments and warehouses next to homes and schools across the inland region of southern California. The carbon emissions produced from the gas and diesel trucks, power plants and diesel trains contribute to the horrendous air quality that kills 15 people a day in California’s South Coast Air District. These deaths come in the form of intense allergies and asthma, chronic bronchitis, cancer and even heart attacks, according to the California Air Resources Board. Although that is our current reality, we, the youth of America, have the power to change the current policies that allow this. This is why I am working with youth leaders to start organizing climate strikes across California. Climate strikes are just one tactic to raise awareness and call people to action. Our network is working on increasing accessibility to striking. Not all students are able to strike, many who come from low-income communities of color cannot afford to miss school for climate justice. We must do better to reach our masses, show solidarity, and advocate by any means necessary. I am striking Friday, March 15th for my community and for those that cannot be present. This global movement is determined to make a difference on a mass scale towards clean air, energy, and zero emission from pollution. You can read more statements from young climate activists on our 24-hour live blog documenting the global climate strikes."
"Tim Flannery laments that young Australians today will never be able to experience in the same way the natural wonders he enjoyed in his youth. He grew up in Melbourne on remnants of the sandplain flora, “one of the great floristic gems of Australia,” he says. Once smothered in flowers in springtime, it has now largely been lost through development and altered burning regimes. Flannery, 63, spent his youth swimming and scuba diving in northern Port Phillip bay, which he says is now also gravely deteriorated.  He further points to the Great Barrier Reef, which suffered unprecedented mass bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and the “serious questions” about whether it can now be saved. “Something like 70% of the reef that was there a century ago is now dead,” he says. But without detailed records on species distributions, it’s impossible to map the losses due to climate change, explains Flannery, who recently returned to the 192-year-old Australian Museum in Sydney, where he was principal mammalogist from 1984–1999. Rather than being “a fusty old relic” the museum is playing a vital role in this, he says. “The collections that say where things were, and when, are here – and that’s the most important asset we’ve got to understand the response of biodiversity to climate change … The people of New South Wales need to understand what a valuable asset they have.” Flannery – who has named more than 30 new mammals over his career and was the Australian government’s climate commissioner from 2011–2013 – relocated to Sydney in January for the year-long role as a distinguished research fellow. This position, as the museum’s de facto climate change ambassador, was funded by anonymous private donors. While species loss is heartbreaking, Flannery says what keeps him awake at night worrying are the human impacts. “Global hunger has increased for the last three years because of extreme weather events, and that follows many decades of improvement,” he says. “To see that going backwards is terrifying, quite frankly. Nothing is more important than global food security.” Bringing attention to the plight of those suffering the effects of climate change, such as Australia’s Pacific Islander neighbours, is one of a series of goals he has set for his time at the museum. In 2018, Flannery sailed from the Solomon Islands to Vanuatu and the story was the same nearly everywhere. “Village after village was going underwater,” he says. Impacts ranged from lost soccer fields and crops through to devastation of villages and coral reef resources. Younger islanders understand “Australia is partly to blame because we have done so little, and they are quite angry”, says Flannery. The goal, he says, is “a better understanding in Australia of the often-catastrophic impacts that climate change is having on our near neighbours – and with government and individual awareness we can start doing something”. Inadequate action by governments has been brought into focus by ever-more alarming reports about the rate of warming, such as the recent long-term forecast from the UK Met Office that we might temporarily exceed 1.5C of average warming over preindustrial levels in the next five years. Preventing warming from exceeding 1.5C in the long term was one of the targets agreed by the world’s nations in the UN’s 2015 Paris agreement. “Sadly, I’ve been aware of [the urgency of] this for a long time,” says Flannery, who believes that breaching that threshold is inevitable in the next few decades, and that we are probably already committed to 2C of warming, “which is towards the catastrophic end of things”. Instead of getting “dismayed and depressed”, he suggests we focus on damage that’s still within our power to avoid. “We have to reduce emissions as hard and fast as possible … [and] develop technologies that will get gigatons of carbon dioxide out of the air by 2050.” Technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – such as giant seaweed farms and processes to accelerate weathering of silicate rocks – have been a focus of his of late. “We can claw back some of the damage. We will go through 2C, but hopefully come out the other side.”  While the debate over the science of climate change is long settled in Europe, political inertia has dogged Australia and the US, which notably pulled out the Paris accord following the election of Donald Trump. But Flannery sees a shift in the air – particularly in the wake of climate-linked disasters including the mass bleaching events; mass fish kills on the Darling River; and droughts, heatwaves and bushfire seasons that are all increasing in duration and intensity. “The speed and scale of impacts have been something that is really shocking,” says Flannery, who was on the Australian Academy of Science’s expert panel investigating the Darling River fish kills, and which this week laid the blame on the Murray-Darling Basin Authority for ignoring scientific advice and the threat from climate change. “People are shocked, but … they should be angry,” he adds. “The consequences will grow year by year, and stuff we were warning people about 20 years ago is now coming to fruition and is impossible to deny, unless you are wilfully blind. “Bullshit baffles brains, but only temporarily and we’ve gone through a period in Australia and the US where people have been able to lie … But we’re in a different world now, a world where people are living with climate change consequences, and bullshit is no longer baffling brains, and so we are about to see a big shift.” One transformation he’s seen is farmers changing from being deniers to advocates for action. “People see extreme weather events and don’t just think this is an odd occurrence, they see it as part of the longer-term trajectory of change that’s going to bring about more and more adverse consequences unless something is done,” he says. Earlier this year the Australian government formally noted the world’s first species to suffer extinction at the hands of climate change – the Bramble Cay melomys, a Torres Strait rodent that washed away in a storm surge caused by rising sea levels. Australia’s museums have a critical role to play in research and keeping collections and records that inform us about species such as this, so we can map changes and losses. Despite this, a lack of investment has plagued many of our museums, including the Australian Museum, which put a freeze on capital expenditure in December to help cover costs of renovations to take larger touring exhibits, including one on Tutankhamun, slated for 2021. Research staff numbers have fallen here and at other museums in recent decades “but the sort of skills that museums specialise in have never been more needed”, says Flannery, who was also previously the director of the South Australian Museum. Examples of crucial records held at the Australian Museum include that there were once “rock wallabies on Middle Head, rufous bettongs at Rose Bay and – until the 1970s – eastern quolls at Vaucluse, the last colony on mainland Australia”, Flannery says. He now hopes to muster the power of citizen scientists to gather data on the effects of climate change on the New South Wales environment. “Looking at the timing of when things happen – when plants bloom and when insects pupate … is one of the best ways of measuring climate change, and people can do it in their gardens,” he says."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThese are just some of the key headline words Europeans can expect to see and hear by Thursday and Friday.
The media, climate activists, and reinsurers are already salivating massively.
For sure the scientists at the PIK and Mojib Latif are already practicing their lines. They’re eagerly standing by their phones, ready for the media at a second’s notice.
The end of times is approaching. We should have all reduced that carbon footprint of ours. But we didn’t, and so get ready to pay.
Most of the weather misery, however will have been caused by black carbon witchcraft…cast by the 90 or so top carbon emitters, who have now been clearly identified. Once the violent storm passes, the climate witch-hunters will be out in full force, calling for the immediate purge of the carbon witches…bonfires will be burning at almost every town square. Let’s not waste time with trials.
Powerful North Sea storm brewing
The weather models are showing that a major winter hurricane-force storm will be sweeping across northern Europe Thursday and Friday. The chart above shows it’s going to be a powerful one, and so you may want to tie down that lawn and garden furniture, etc. Forget the stroll in the forest.

Meteorologist Dominik Jung at wetter.net writes that the pressure at the storm’s centre will drop to a rock bottom 960 mb by Thursday evening. Meanwhile at the storms outer edge the pressure will be around 1023 mb. That’s a difference of 56 mb across Germany!
The hardest hit areas will be the North sea coastal areas of Holland, Germany, and Scandinavia. Jung warns that huge storm surges have to be expected.
Hopefully authorities will act more quickly this time around.
Here are some projected wind speeds for some cities:
Hamburg: up to 120 km/h
Bremen: up to 130 km/h
Helgoland: up to 150 km/h
Rostock: up to 110 km/h
Berlin: up to 100 km/h
Hanover: up to 100 km/h
Cologne: up to 80 km/h
Frankfurt/Main: up to 70 km/h

"I am going on strike today because I don’t want to live in a world without wilderness. I have been lucky enough to grow up in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The place I call home is one of red rock and prickly pear cactus, dust and juniper trees and rattlesnakes, yet it is the state with the fourth highest species diversity in the country. Here, in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, I was brought up by the Chamisa desert, aspen groves and pine forests that all so miraculously coexist. The harsh contrast of sharp rock and vast, echoing, azure sky have taught me everything I know about being human. I am blessed by this land every day, and I am ashamed that my kind have neglected to care for the livelihood of river otter, black bear, wolf, the smell of the desert after a rain. These are what make my life worth living. And they are diseased, as is the Earth, as is our own culture. I am sick to my stomach at the already catastrophic loss of beauty we have caused. I am brokenhearted and sad. Most of all, I am angry. I am enraged at the inaction of our leaders, not only in regards to the extinction of species and decimation of wild places, but also at the blatant disrespect for human life and the survival of future generations in a livable world. It is time to be terrified, enraged, heartbroken, grief-stricken, radical. It is time to act We are living in the sixth mass extinction. Ice is melting. Forests are burning. Waters are rising. And we do not even speak of it. Why? Because admitting the facts means admitting that we are committing crimes of epic proportions just by living our daily lives. Because counting the losses means being overpowered by grief. Because allowing the scale of the crisis means facing the fear of swiftly impending disaster and the fact that our entire system must change. But now is not the time to ignore science in order to save our feelings. It is time to be terrified, enraged, heartbroken, grief-stricken, radical. It is time to act. That is why I have spent the last month frantically organizing a climate strike event in New Mexico. My future is at stake, as are the futures of my friends and family, and whatever next generations we might bring into the world. But our present is also at stake. And whoever is alive at this very moment must have a hand in this fight and a voice in this conversation. So come strike with us! This is home we are talking about! This is Earth! I am in love with this enchanted land; I cannot live without its wilderness, and neither can you. Hannah Laga Abram, 18, is the state lead organizer for US Youth Climate Strike in Santa Fe, New Mexico"
"Since we made headlines in February with the UK’s first school strike, we’ve seen an outpouring of support from our peers, parents, carers, politicians and other people from all walks of life. It seems that most people know we’re in a mess, but they just didn’t know what we can to do to get out of it. This is where the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN) stepped in, not necessarily out of choice, but necessity. There’s no time left for the “adults in the room” to solve the climate crisis. The politicians and powerful actors have failed us. Youth is rising up all around the world and here in the UK we’re emerging as one of the most powerful forces, demanding urgent and radical change.  The time for words is over, we need an era for action to stop impending climate breakdown. Pay attention, listen to us and, importantly, listen to the voices of those around the world already suffering the devastating effects of climate change. We may be young, but we’re fierce and we understand the challenges ahead of us. However, if we’re to be successful and create a world that remedies the situation we’re confronted with, everyone needs to step up and demand a better world. A world free from the inequalities of climate change, a world free from the economic disparities created by the system that is to be held responsible for the climate crisis. Climate change is the unifying issue of this generation. We’re united under the banner of “system change, not climate change”. We’re forging a vision for a better world, one aligned with climate justice as a primary value, not a tokenistic phrase to throw around with little thought for its meaning. We need you to support us in forging this world out of the ashes of our current one. Here’s how: Join the UK Student Climate Network and organise with us. Strike in your towns and cities. We’re a caring, thoughtful community, breaking down old prejudices and fighting for a more just world. You can set up a branch of UKSCN in your area and start doing weekly, fortnightly or monthly strikes. You can find information on how to get started on our website by clicking here. To get involved wherever you are in the world, head to the Fridays for Future website to find your nearest strike action. If there isn’t one nearby, register, start talking to friends, family, neighbours and everyone else. You’re joining a global movement and everyone has a part to play. If you aren’t able to give your time, why not make a financial contribution to support our fight? We have no illusions that change won’t be difficult to achieve, but we’re going to give it our best shot! We all need to take positive action and put pressure on our elected representatives, no matter which party they belong to. For too long our governments and others in positions of power have failed to take the necessary action and have relied upon delaying, denying and drowning out the voices of those who want to tackle the climate crisis. If those in power fail to enact the necessary changes, we need to give them the boot and elevate the voices that will stand up for people and planet. We need real leadership now. We’re not learning about climate breakdown. How we are to prepare for a drastically different world, or even properly fight for a different one if knowledge is being withheld? If you’re a teacher in a school or college or a lecturer in university you can put pressure on your institution to make the change. However, don’t just wait for change to happen, we need you to weave climate change into the educational fabric of our learning experience to give us the right tools for the fight! Society has atomised us from one another, hampering our ability to create change. We need to start talking, have conversations with one another, engage with people about the climate crisis. We’re all going to be affected, some worse from others. We can learn from each others’ experiences and create a world that works for all, not just the privileged few. This list isn’t exhaustive, but it’s a good place to start. To create a better, safer world, free from the devastation of climate change and ecological collapse, we need to reimagine the way our societies work. We need to challenge the status quo wherever we can and forge our own set of rules. There’s a whole world to create, so let’s not be bound by the stifling and disenfranchising politics of the current system. Support us to create our own. • UK Student Climate Network is a small group of volunteers who were inspired by the powerful and direct protests made by young people against climate inaction across the rest of Europe"
"It wasn’t long ago that Theresa May stated boldly that she wanted “the Britain of the future to be a truly global Britain, which is a force for good in the world. Steadfast in upholding our values – not least our fierce commitment to protecting the natural environment”. Not everyone was fooled – least of all the thousands of young people striking from school today to call on world leaders to finally take the climate crisis seriously.  The UK government likes to be seen as a climate leader. But while it continues to make some slow progress in decarbonising its economy at home, companies continue to take advantage of the UK’s “light-touch” corporate regulation to commit climate atrocities abroad. The current generation of schoolchildren have a much more global perspective than any before. Social media and the internet have made the world feel much smaller, and well-informed young people are quick to challenge governments over activities built on global injustices, past and present. That’s why stories like DeSmog’s Empire Oil investigation resonate with so many of those taking to the streets today. The six-month investigation by DeSmog reporter Chloé Farand showed how a group of companies listed on London’s junior stock exchange – the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) – were taking advantage of the UK’s lackadaisical regulation to exploit fossil fuel resources across Africa. Her stories showed that beneath London’s green veneer lies some dirty business. AIM was set up to make it easy for companies to raise capital, with much lighter oversight than they would experience on the larger London Stock Exchange. Some household names have grown extremely fast thanks to this model – fashion retailers Asos and Boohoo, and posh tonic water company Fever-Tree, for example. There is no suggestion that those companies have done anything wrong, and they are regularly held up as shining examples of how a lack of government interference can stimulate innovation. But there is a darker side to this system. AIM’s approach to regulation has also allowed dozens of small oil and gas companies to raise capital with the aim of exploiting Africa’s natural resources – all with minimal oversight. Many of these companies are registered in tax havens. And the organisations tasked with overseeing the activities of AIM-listed companies – known as nominated advisers or Nomads – are allowed to have a financial stake in the companies they are meant to regulate. All of this leads to flawed oversight and a web of conflicts of interest. In the background of all this is a neocolonialist agenda that this new generation of social activists are quick to recognise. They understand that there is something unjust about western companies based in Mayfair offices prospecting for oil and gas in countries that until recently would have been described as “colonies”. And they are quick to highlight the government’s hypocrisy in calling for global action on climate change while tacitly encouraging activities that will lock developing nations into high-carbon industries for decades. The school strikers, unlike many of the adults they feel have let them down, are not scared to point out this injustice. “How is it,” the strikers ask, “that the UK can claim to be a climate leader when it continues to encourage a system that allows companies to explore for fossil fuels in some of the world’s most politically unstable regions with minimal oversight?” In 2019, that seems a legitimate question. The UK government’s resistance to walking the walk on climate action goes beyond encouraging private companies to get out there and drill, however. Its own agencies are also complicit. Perhaps the best example of this is UK Export Finance (UKEF), a government credit agency that works to secure Britain’s economic interests abroad. In the past four years, UKEF has put up financial support for a massive new oil refinery in Oman, invested millions in offshore oil and gas development in Ghana and Brazil, and provided credit for coal-mining equipment in Russia, to name but a few projects. A joint investigation between Greenpeace and Private Eye calculated that UKEF had provided fossil fuel companies with £6.9bn in financial support between 2000 and 2017. MPs have finally cottoned on to this conflict between the government’s positive words and less-than-stellar international action. Parliament launched an enquiry into UKEF in December 2018. UKEF’s actions certainly seem a long way from what David Cameron was promising on the podium in Paris, days before hundreds of world leaders signed a landmark climate change agreement in December 2015, when he declared: “Instead of making excuses tomorrow to our children and grandchildren, we should be taking action against climate change today.” Well, those children have now marched out of school to make it clear that the all-too-familiar excuses for inaction will be accepted no more – today, tomorrow, or at any time in their future. • Mat Hope is editor of investigative journalism platform DeSmog UK"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe all know how do-gooder governments all over Europe and USA like to spend billions of dollars on every conceivable save-the-forests program worldwide.Well, it turns out they’re also spending billions on subsidising “green” wood-based bio-energy, which in fact is having the opposite effect, and thus contributing to the accelerated mass-destruction of forests worldwide. In the kooky world called “Green”, things always seem to work as follows:
1. Conjure up a fictitious future catastrophic problem, like AGW.
2. Demand governments enact programs designed to avert the catastrophe.
3. Watch these programs inflict real, massive environmental, social and economic damage right now.
Here’s yet another perfect glittering example from the world of Green.  The Global Forest Coalition has released a damning report WOOD-BASED BIOENERGY: THE GREEN LIE, which shines much light on Europe’s latest green mega-folly.
Journalist Stephen Leahy reports on it here: Europe’s Green Energy Portfolio Up in Smoke.
Here are some excerpts:
* In Europe’s vaunted green energy revolution 68.5% of its renewable energy portfolio comes from biofuels and burning wood for energy,
*27 million tonnes of wood biomass will be needed annually to supply planned power stations in the UK (United Kingdom).
* At least one million hectares of forest annually will be needed to feed the dozens of planned wood-fired power plants in Britain alone.
* The Netherlands is burning one million tonnes of wood annually. Germany is burning up to 16.5 million tonnes – mostly imported – and plans to double this figure by 2020.
*Deforestation eats up 13 to 16 million hectares every year and is responsible for 20 percent of the global warming emissions.
Deforestation is already a big problem globally without the biofuels boom. Promoting the use of wood material for biofuel will only accelerate deforestation.

According to Anne Petermann, executive director of the Global Justice Ecology Project:
We have an enormous deforestation problem already, there is no way massive increases in wood to feed bioenergy furnaces could ever be sustainable.
Leahy writes that particulate emissions from wood-burning are worse than coal, putting public health at risk. Biomass burning emits more fine particulates than coal. These invisible particles can damage lungs and make asthma worse.
Then there is all the energy and emissions involved in cutting, processing and shipping wood many thousands of kilometres from Africa, South America and Canada.

Not only are wood-based biofuels ecologically disastrous, but they are also economically unwise:
Subsidies in Britain will cost taxpayers about three billion dollars a year for the biomass power plants now under construction or planned, reports Robert Palgrave of Biofuelwatch.
Journal Science has bioenergy lands covering half of the planet’s arable lands by 2065.
Helena Paul sums it up:
The potential for disaster is absolutely enormous if this takes off in Europe and America.
Someone ought to remind Ms Paul what led to these disastrous policies in the first place. One may suggest that it was the green movement’s overzealous drive to save the planet from a highly exaggerated manmade climate change claim, all fueled and fanned by the media and kook green groups.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his wissenslogs blog, sister blog of Real Climate, Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has a post attempting to find an explanation for Europe’s heavy snowfalls and cold from last month.
Part of Rahmstorf’s problem is his habit of not asking to the right questions, which is a prerequisite for getting the right answers. Or maybe it’s more him purposely asking the wrong questions to avoid getting the right answers.
He reminds me of a fly bouncing off a window. Instead of asking “How do I get through the glass?”, the fly ought to ask: “How do I get on the other side?” Flying away and out through an open door certainly works a lot better than repeatedly ramming into the glass until dropping dead.
In his post he describes the snow and cold of December and poses the question: 
Is it because of global warming, or does it have nothing to do with it?”
First he says straight out that the cold December is by no means an indication that global warming has ended or that it is taking a break, citing 2010’s high global temperature from GISS. He then asks:
In the globally warmest year since measurements began in the 19th century, we have [in Potsdam] the most amount of snow since measurements began in the 19th century. Meanwhile the Arctic sea ice cover this December is at a record low. Do these records have anything to do with each other, or is it just a coincidence?“
The fly bouncing off the window now comes to mind, and expect the bouncing to continue. He then presents the following graphic:

It shows Potsdam maximum snow depth with a 15 year-smoothing. Note the outlier high of 41 cm recorded last month. From this graph he concludes:
The year-to-year fluctuations are very large, and show no noticeable trend.
Especially over the last 40 years, during a time the global temperature rose significantly, there is no trend in the December snow depths.”
And then asserts:
These are hefty indicators that there is no relation between this year’s snow record and global warming and that it is only a coincidence.”
(That applies for snow in Europe.) Now at least he’s headed in the right direction. So what’s the cause? Rahmstorf probes further, and glances at solar activity and quickly dismisses it, saying:

Just eyeballing the the graphic, it is obvious this is not a factor of influence  – an 11 year cycle cannot be detected.”
Rahmstorf aversion to the sun is obvious, and he really has a way of selecting graphics. With that scale one can hardly discern 100 years, let alone 11. That’s the graphic he linked to: Schwabezyklus.
He then adds that it can’t be the sun because the Lockwood und Fröhlich (2010) correlation of winter temps in Europe and solar activity is too weak (correlation coefficient 0.23). 
And not only that, the record warm winter of 2006/2007 came at a time when solar activity was near a low. And the currently weak sun is similar to a stituation before 1925, at a time when there were hardly any cold winters in Germany. So it can’t be the sun, he resons. Here we see that Rahmstorf has gone back to bouncing off the window.
So what could it be, he asks?
Rahmstorf suggests that it has to be “a very non-linear mechanism” causing the unusual snow and cold, like the one suggested by Petoukhov and Semenov (2010), i.e. a connection between ice cover in the Barents-Kara-Sea and the European winter weather.
Rahmstorf does point out that one has to be cautious here because Petoukhov and Semenov is the result of model calculations with one single climate model. Rahmstorf adds:
Indeed before I would consider such a mechanism as robust, it needs to be confirmed by other independent models and ( or observation.
Indeed Petoukhov and Semenov did not make any projection for any winter in particular, rather they presented the idea of winters associated with cold Arctic air could occur more frequently. If that turns out to be the case, it cannot be seen with two or three winters, rather we have to wait for a significantly greater number of winters.”
Not long ago, a number of PIK scientists embarked on a media blitz selling it all as everything but fact in the German media. The past can be also checked out to see if there is any correlation.
Rahmstorf sums it up:
Its quite possible that this month’s extreme snowfall is just a coincidence of the weather. But on the other hand there are indications that the boundary conditions in the Arctic have changed due to the ice melt over the years that could significantly change the weather statistic in Europe. Whether this December remains an outlier or whether more of this will occur in the future cannot be said. It’s an open research question.”
I think it should be a simple matter showing the lack of robustness of the Barents-Kara-Sea / European winter weather correlation. After that we will be able to say it’s time for the warmists to stop bouncing of the window.
Time to look for that open door.

"In 1980, at the age of 15, I led a student protest that got me expelled. Every day that I went to Durban city centre, I could see that the schools for white children were different to mine. Even though adults told us that we could not make a difference, once our eyes were opened to this injustice, there was no alternative. My friends and I were determined to make a stand against the glaring inequality in South Africa. Those who lived under apartheid know exactly what it means to live with an inherent threat to your existence. But rather than give in to the fear that it was too big to take on, we had no choice but to trust in the power of our individual actions. There are many lessons here for the climate change movement.  I was devastated to have been expelled from my school, but it did not stop me from demanding change. I knew I was not alone. Schools across South Africa became a powerful site for struggle after a student protest in Soweto in 1976 ended with extreme police brutality. Young people, who for all their lives had been told they were not equal and had no power, organised major protests and boycotts at their schools, which garnered national and international attention. Throughout history, our societies have owed a debt to young people who have recognised that sometimes you need to break the rules to create space for change. It was the strategy of civil disobedience, led by young people, that set South Africa on the path to ending apartheid. The “defiance campaign” of 1952 represents the best of this: 8,000 black South Africans – led by the likes of a young Nelson Mandela – deliberately broke discriminatory laws to court arrest. Their aim was to fill the jails to overflowing. While the authorities eventually crushed the campaign, it raised the visibility of this important justice movement and galvanised mass support. Just like South Africa’s youth leaders did decades ago, I believe young people striking for climate action today are building exactly the kind of mass movement needed to pressure leaders into acting. There have been multiple misguided attempts by politicians to patronise, belittle or discredit the teenagers leading these strikes. But for all their attempts at deflection, nothing can hide the fact that our leaders are failing to stop climate change. In fact they continue to spread lies, fund the fossil fuel industry and wrongfully claim that it will be too expensive to act. Meanwhile, we have fully entered the climate crisis and left behind a stable environment that enabled humanity to thrive. The kind of warming we see today, where wildfires, heatwaves, floods, droughts and storms are getting worse and worse, is only the beginning. If you feel immobilised by fear at the thought of this, imagine how it must feel for a child. And yet, as throughout history, young people have shown us that it is possible to overcome our fears by standing up for our rights. In August 2018, fires raged in forests of the Arctic Circle in Sweden, and Greta Thunberg decided to start her strike outside the Swedish parliament. These school strikes for climate have snowballed and on Friday more than 1,300 strikes are expected in nearly 100 countries around the world. We should be hanging our heads in shame that it has fallen on young people and children to miss school and take on the overwhelming burden of fighting this threat to human survival. But we have no time for that. We now have 11 years to halve our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and work towards bringing them down to net zero by 2050 to give us a chance for survival. This is not an invitation to procrastinate, but an impetus to act. If our leaders and indeed other adults are still clueless as to what they can do, my one piece of advice is: act like the kids. • Kumi Naidoo is the Secretary General of Amnesty International. He was formerly executive director of Greenpeace and the launch director of Africans Rising"
"More than 1.4 million young people around the world took part in school strikes for climate action, according to environmental campaigners. Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish student whose solo protest last August prompted the global movement, said: “We proved that it does matter what you do and that no one is too small to make a difference.” Children walked out of schools on Friday in 2,233 cities and towns in 128 countries, with demonstrations held from Australia to India, the UK and the US, according to the Fridays for the Future website. Further strikes are planned for 12 April. Eyal Weintraub, an 18-year-old from Argentina who took part in the protests, said: “We have reached a point in history when we have the technical capacities to solve poverty, malnutrition, inequality and of course global warming. “The deciding factors for whether we take advantage of our potential will be our activism and our international unity.” The strikes inspired by Thunberg drew widespread praise, with UN Women saying on Twitter: “She is proof that we need to listen to the young generation for a sustainable future.” The executive director of Oxfam International, Winnie Byanyima, said: “Our children are walking out of school saying we have failed them. This is the kind of clarity and energy we need now.” However, education ministers in the UK and Australia condemned the strikes and some commentators were critical. Madeline Grant, formerly of the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, asked: “Just how kind is it to shower praise on children who are fundamentally wrong?” Thunberg posted a response on Facebook to “people who wants us to go back to school”. “The favourite argument here in Sweden, and everywhere else, is that it doesn’t matter what we do because we are all too small to make a difference. [But] Friday was the biggest day of global climate action ever, according to 350.org,” she said. “People keep asking me ‘What is the solution to the climate crisis?’. They expect me to know the answer. That is beyond absurd, as there are no ‘solutions’ within our current systems. “We need a whole new way of thinking. The political system that you [adults] have created is all about competition. You cheat when you can because all that matters is to win. That must come to an end. “We need to start cooperating and sharing the remaining resources of this planet in a fair way. We are just passing on the words of the science. Our only demand is that you start listening to it, and then start acting.” • This article was amended on 20 March 2019. An earlier version referred to the next planned strike date as 15 April. The correct date is Friday 12 April."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe homeless are freezing to death, schools are closing, air traffic is paralyzed, flights cancelled, temperatures plummeting to -20°C, winds up to 60 km/hr making windchill feel like -40°C, autobahns and motorways are blocked by drifting snow, motorists stranded, trains are disrupted – that’s the ugly winter reality today in Germany. We’ve been seeing similar headlines in the UK and throughout all of Scandinavia. Global warming has met its Stalingrad.
Meanwhile, the Climate Generals are sipping champagne and eating caviar in sunny Cancun, see here.
Stern magazine reports here “Deep Freeze Weather To Remain Until March”:
And its going to continue: Today most of Germany will get 20 cm of  new snow on top of what there is now. Also in the days ahead it’s going to remain cold.”
H/t: NoTricksZone reader Bernd Felsche
Right now with the bitter cold bearing down on Europe, the German media are scrambling like piglets on an ice rink.  Indeed the news of global warming coming out of Cancun are coming across as a bizarre joke. Everywhere in the media we hear something like: “Duh duh duh…it’s…er, man-made climate change induced weather extremes, or something! We can’t explain it! But hold on – wait – it’s now in our models! Yup, there it is! Just the latest sign of global warming.”

Stern Magazine: “Cold of the century”
Stern asks the German Weather Service (DWD): How long is this warming cold going to last?
For the DWD it’s sure: ‘It’s going to remain cold.’ Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday daytime highs will hover around -10″C. Temperatures at night could plummet to -25 °C. Germany will be colder than Scandinavia, Canada and Siberia. ‘We are expecting winds of up to 60 km/hr on Wednesday and Thursday. That means the windchill will be minus 30 to minus 40°C,’ says meteorologist Dominik Jung of Wetterdienst wetter.net in Wiesbaden. ‘Whoever does not dress properly, risks freezing to death.'”
Well, I don’t know about Siberia. But man it’s cold out there with that wind. Reminds me of winters in Vermont. Stern magazine warns:
Anyone hoping for just for a couple of cold winter days is out in left field. Jung says these frosty days are only a taste of what’s coming. ‘It’ll be especially cold,’ says Jung, ‘in the Northeast temperatures will fall below levels we saw last year.'”
So much for the rare but exciting snowy winters Jones told us about awhile back. Meteorologist Jung’s projection for the rest if the winter remains icy. “It will be similar to last year’s cold winter. Don’t expect temperatures to warm up much until late March.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNew IPCC report discovers the important climate factor…and ignores it!
By D. E. Koelle
According to its own statutes, the IPCC is mainly responsible for anthropogenic climate change – and much less so for natural climate change, which has been around since the Earth first appeared. That could very well be the reason why the sun gets mentioned only with respect to its solar irradiance intensity at the edge of the atmosphere. There the irradiance is 1361 W/sqm and is relatively constant, and so the role of the sun on mid-term climate change is not taken into account.
However, for the first time in the history of the IPCC reports, the 2013 AR5 report discusses the Surface Solar Radiation (SSR) as a decisively important factor (chapter 2.3.3.). Decisive for the climate and temperature changes is not the solar irradiance at the edge of the atmosphere, rather it is the amount of solar energy that makes it to the Earth’s surface.
Between the Earth’s surface and the outer edge of the atmosphere we have the atmosphere with its clouds and aerosols, which determine how much solar radiation eventually reaches the surface of the Earth. Since 1983 the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program (ISCCP) has been measuring global cloud coverage. One spectacular result was the decrease in global cloud cover between 1987 – 2000, from 69% to 64%, i.e. precisely during the period of warming that triggered the CO2 hypothesis.

Figure 1: Mid-term variation of mean global cloud coverage according to data from the ISCCP for the period 1983 to 2010.
Of course this finding did not fit well with the current popular narrative and was immediately criticized and doubted. This prevented it being adopted by the IPCC report of 2007. Indeed cloud observation and the evaluation of the data from satellites are difficult and the results are subject to interpretation. But in the meantime we have recognized that there is an objective method of determining the effects of clouds and the impact of solar dimming: by measuring the effective solar radiation at the surface of the Earth. For the first time this is discussed in the new IPCC report in Chapter 2.3.3 and is confirmed by the longest existing dataset from Stockholm. It shows a clear fluctuation of solar energy between 90 and 135 W/sqm. And the range is considerably greater at lower latitudes.

Figure 2:  Effective solar insolation at the Earth’s surface for Stockholm 1922-2010 (59° north latitude).

The data from Stockholm not only correspond to the ISCCP-results, but also to the global temperature trends. Not only do the rise of global temperature and SSR correspond between 1910 and 1940, but also for the temperature drop between 1944 and 1980, and the rise until 2000. Figure 3 shows a comparison of 10 temperature curves from 10 global weather stations, without the statistical manipulations of a so-called “global mean temperature”.

Figure 3: Real temperature measurement values from cities on the globe.
The SSR curve correlates excellently with the original GISS dataset for the US temperature history yin 1999, before it was tampered with.

Figure 4: The original GISS temperature history for the USA as it looked in 1999. It was then replaced by a new curve which moved the maximum value to the year 1998.
Even if the important SSR factor gets mentioned for the first time in an IPCC report, this does not mean it was taken into account in other chapters of the report, and especially for the temperature development – to the contrary – it was ignored. Only the CO2 hypothesis is valid. Here the entire 0.8°C temperature rise of the last 100 years, for which part or all of it gets attributed to CO2,  can be explained by the impacts of the effective solar radiation at the Earth’s surface without any CO2 effects.
Already the temperature rise of 0.6°C between 1910 and 1940 cannot be explained by the CO2 effect because the CO2 concentration increased by less than 10 ppm during the period (from 298 to 307 ppm). Then from 1940 to 1975 the temperature fell 0.2°C – and certainly not because of a CO2 drop. The renewed temperature increase of 0.6°C from 1980 to 1998 was the initiator of the CO2 hypothesis. However, the temperature increase can be better explained by the increase in SSR intensity. The fact that the predicted continued temperature increase never materialized, and that there’s been a slight drop since 2000, completely contradicts the CO2 hypothesis.

A couple of loose ends to tie up as I prepare for the Berlin Conference.
First, bitter cold and snowfall have dominated the German headlines. This kind of thing was not supposed to happen – that is until about 2 weeks ago when scientists at the Potsdam Institute For Climate Impact Research suddenly changed their minds after one of their models showed European winters would be getting cold instead (because of global warming).
So let’s look back at what the PIK said just a year ago in FOCUS magazine in a report called: “Germany Will Be Sweating“, in December, 2009, just before Copenhagen:
Less snow, dry-hot summers and mild-wet winters. Scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research show us the most important climate trends for Germany. By the middle of the century the temperature increase and the resulting evaporation in some regions could lead to water shortages.
In the Alps, winters with snow cover will be shortened.
In the western areas, there will be less and less snow cover.

Then the PIK-effect kicked in. Just 10 days after the FOCUS report had come out, i.e. during the Copenhagen conference, the worst winter in over 40 years began to besiege Germany. (H/T to a reader comment here at Readers Edition).
And here’s another one from Bild tabloid, dated 27 November 2006 titled: Winter is Becoming Extinct:

Professor Mojib Latif (52), climate scientist at the University of Kiel: ‘In a hundred years we’ll practically have no more winters.

And the warming is going to accelerate! Scientists have calculated that the average temperature in the next 100 years will increase by up to 4°C. In 20 years it will be possible to go swimming in the Baltic Sea in October and to grow peaches in Hamburg.


H/t: ef-magazin.de.
And this is what we’re getting.
Finally, WUWT brings up a new peer-reviewed paper by Ryan O’Donnell, Nicholas Lewis, Jeff Condon, and Steve McIntyre that shows claims of a warming Antarctic in a peer-reviewed paper by Steig et al were bogus.
Interesting are Anthony’s comments on how reluctant the peer reviewers appear to have been when this sceptical paper landed on their desk. If it had been a paper showing accelerated warming, melting etc., then publication would have been a lot simpler. The peer review probably would have taken only 10 minutes over a cup of coffee. “And don’t worry, we’ll even write up the press releases for you and get this published right before the next conference.”
Anyway, while I’m in Berlin, I’ll post from time to time to provide an impression of how things are going. Hope you drop by.

"I see the government is planning to spend £10m on a rebrand of the National Citizen Service, creating a brand identity that will “live and breathe through every touchpoint in our customer journey” (Struggling councils criticise £10m Citizen Service revamp, 15 March). Instead of paying for this (literal) nonsense, why not put the money behind the work of the brave and inspirational activist schoolchildren who led the climate strike, trying to make sure our ability to live and breathe in the real world is not curtailed (Young activists around the world: why I’m striking today, 15 March)?

Shell’s statement that this remuneration was in part for “framing a methodology for aligning with the Paris agreement” is akin to congratulating a murderer for writing a biography of the lives his victims could have lived. It demonstrates an awareness of how controversial this level of pay is, but complete disregard for the devastation they are responsible for and their effect on future generations.

"By taking to the streets today to make their voices heard, young people are educating us about how important tackling climate change is to their generation. They are right to be worried about what kind of planet they will inherit and right to demand far-reaching action. Governments cannot sit back, leaving major decisions to market forces. It hasn’t worked and it never will. Polluting corporations will never do anything serious to solve the crisis.  Climate change presents terrible risks. But because it demands such massive change and government action, it’s also an opportunity to transform our economy, making it cleaner, healthier and fairer. Labour already has among the most ambitions carbon reduction targets in Europe and radical plans to create a zero-carbon emission economy by 2050. We plan to achieve that by ushering in a “green industrial revolution”. We have the plans to create hundreds of thousands of well-paid jobs in the renewable energy sector. That will help meet our target of 60% of energy to come from low-carbon sources within 12 years. The next generation will be trained in the skills needed to work in offshore wind, tidal lagoons and solar energy. Transport currently accounts for a quarter of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. By investing in public transport and cycle paths we will reduce our reliance on carbon-emitting vehicles. All new homes built will be zero-carbon too. The UK is home to some of the least populated areas of Europe, and under a green industrial revolution they will be allowed to thrive, not destroyed. Every national and local park in this country has been a victory won by communities through struggle. In the 1930s, working-class people staged a mass protest fighting their way up Kinder Scout in Derbyshire to fight for the “right to roam”, paving the way for the establishment of our national parks years later by a Labour government. And it was Labour’s postwar prime minister Clement Attlee who said that the countryside was not just “a means of producing food, but part of our great national heritage of beauty”. Building on this legacy, a Labour government will ensure that farming conserves and creates safe habitats for birds, insects and other wild animals, and encourages the growth of wildflowers. Labour has a strong record of international leadership on the environment, and action on climate change will be at the heart of our development and trade policies. We have a role not just in protecting and promoting biodiversity in the UK but protecting it in other countries and in the oceans that connect us. It’s past time all of us stopped looking the other way, learn from the passion and wisdom of young people and join them in actively organising for a better future. • Jeremy Corbyn is MP for Islington North and leader of the Labour party The Conservative party was invited to participate, but declined. Climate change is the most serious issue facing the world and is a truly global challenge. We have a moral responsibility to do what we can to prevent and mitigate the effects of climate change for future generations. Scotland has been praised as a world leader for the action we are taking to address the issue. We have introduced a new climate change bill that contains the most ambitious statutory targets of any country in the world for 2020, 2030 and 2040, and will mean Scotland is carbon neutral by 2050. However, the urgency of climate change means it is right that we are all challenged to constantly reassess our approach and to see where we can do more. It is of course extremely important that school pupils attend their lessons, and as first minister, I could not condone repeated absences during term time. But in Scotland our schools teach and encourage our young people to engage in public debate and to learn about the issues that concern them. Lowering the voting age to 16 as we have done since 2014 has only enhanced our political debate and in 2018 we celebrated the Year of Young People. The year gave young people new opportunities for their voices to be heard in all parts of our society and helped foster better understanding, cooperation and respect between generations. On a matter of such importance as climate change, it is inspiring that young people are engaged, interested and ready to take action themselves to hold world leaders and governments to account. Later this month I will be meeting a group of young people from across Scotland who have been active climate change campaigners to discuss the issue and hear their concerns. We must listen to the voice of the next generation and involve them in decision-making and policy development. It is their planet to inherit, and their passion to protect it should inspire us all. • Nicola Sturgeon is first minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP The students who are taking part in this climate strike are right to highlight what is the most serious issue facing any of us. Just as with Brexit, young people will be most acutely affected, and it’s our responsibility to support them. Liberal Democrats invested heavily in a cleaner environment during our period in government, setting up the Green Investment Bank, encouraging homes to cut emissions through the Green Deal, and cutting plastic bag usage by 85% through the 5p levy. Since Liberal Democrats left government the Conservatives have abandoned the positive record of the coalition. They have effectively banned onshore wind turbines, slashed subsidies to solar power, pursued an ideological obsession with fracking, cut incentives for electric vehicles, scrapped zero-carbon homes, cancelled rail electrification projects and approved a new runway at Heathrow. The hostility now levelled at young people who are taking a stand on this issue demonstrates that these strikes are noticed by those in power. It’s now up to Westminster to act responsibly – coming together across parties – to act on the demands of those who care about our planet. The failing Brexit project has crowded out too many important issues over the last three years, and it’s time our political system addressed itself once again to climate change. The Liberal Democrats will continue to be the greenest party in Westminster, and to argue that climate action can best be achieved at a European and international level – working with our neighbours rather than turning our backs. • Vince Cable is leader of the Liberal Democrats and former secretary of state for business If I were a school pupil today I would be striking against climate change and would make sure the whole school was striking with me. The reason couldn’t be simpler: time is running out. Time is running out to make the changes to our way of life, how we produce and use energy, how we travel around this Earth, how we build and warm our homes, how we use our natural resources. The threat is bleak: whole states disappearing underwater because of increases in sea level; not just more drought, but more starvation on an international level; widespread disappearance of species and an environment that is far more challenging to life on this Earth. We’re not just on the brink of ecological catastrophe, we’re in the middle of one. But what I’ve seen so clearly by these school strikers so far is that from speaker after speaker, young person after young person there is such an outpouring of eloquence, of vision, of positivity. To stand up and fight for the Earth is the noblest of all causes. Climate change faces humanity as a whole. It should be the main discussion across chambers, but Brexit has sucked the oxygen from our politics. It feels as if we should skip a generation in politics. Young people are demonstrating the vision and determined leadership to make is possible to make significant and swift progress towards a low-carbon existence. To follow their lead means that we can’t wait until Westminster wakes up. We all must be brave. The small town of Machynlleth in mid-Wales has been one of the very few towns in the world to declare a climate emergency, with ambition to make its buildings eco-friendly, encourage renewable energy developments and ensure its pension fund divested from fossil fuels. What got Machynlleth to make the commitment? It was a petition signed by 500 local people; a small community-sized step with a worldwide impact. • Adam Price is leader of Plaid Cymru Hope. That was what I felt when I entered Parliament Square last month to be greeted by hundreds of young people at the first Youth Strike 4 Climate in Britain. That day one young person carried a sign that read: “We are missing our lessons to teach you.” The question now is whether Westminster will listen to the wisdom of youth. Last year the UN warned we have a limited window of opportunity until 2030 to take positive action to limit climate catastrophe. Since then, councils across the country have declared a climate emergency with many committing to gold-standard climate action – often prompted by Green councillors. But parliament is still dragging its heels. This week, the chancellor tried to fob off the rising tide of youth activism with token policies that don’t go far enough. He said he plans to make travel companies offset carbon, yet is still building new runways. He talked about biodiversity, but kept quiet about his devastating cuts to Natural England. And his government is doing nothing to break the toxic hold fossil-fuel bosses have on our lawmakers. Youth strikers across the world know the planet can’t wait. I’m proud it’s my colleague in parliament, Caroline Lucas, demanding the government launch a Green New Deal with money ploughed into thousands of new green jobs and transformed local energy and transport networks. If ministers are serious about securing the planet for our children, they will act now. As a Green elected to represent millions of young Londoners, it’s amazing to see them make these demands of me and my political colleagues. It will be a privilege to stand beside our young people again today as they strike for their futures – I implore those in power to listen to their demands. • Siân Berry is co-leader of the Green party"

Share this...FacebookTwitterI started this blog on April 1st.
In April I got just over 8000 visits, and in May almost 28,000. Thanks readers!  I think I can allow myself a little indulgence of some sherry wood finish Glenmorangie to celebrate.
I got a lot of help from Big Blog, i.e.  climatedepot, WUWT  and Bishop Hill. When these boys drop your name, you really see spikes in the traffic volume.
But I’m not doing it for the numbers (though I have to admit it feels good to see a spike).  It’s for fun, and it has been more fun than I ever imagined.
I’m gong to continue looking for stories that readers might not otherwise hear about. Repeating what the other blogs say is not my thing…though I may have done that a couple of times. I think it was Jeff Id at the Air Vent who said: to blog successfully, you have to spend a lot of time reading. THAT’S TRUE. Writing is acutally the easy part. Some bloggers have got to be going through reams of literature.
My highlight post for May was gate-blowup. It didn’t pull in the most traffic, but it’s the one I was most satisfied with. I’ll be updating it in the future.
And one more thing – not once did I have to snip a reader’s comment because of bad behaviour. To me that says a lot about the kind of readers us sceptics get. This claim that we’re all a gang of angry, belligerent malcontents is yet another warmist fantasy. Such rubbish they put out sometimes.
Keep stopping by!

"Climate change activism is increasingly the domain of the young, such as 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, the unlikely face of the school strike for climate movement, which has seen many thousands of children walk out of school to demand that their parents’ generation takes responsibility for leaving them a planet to live on. In comparison, the existing political establishment looks more and more like an impediment to change. The consequences of global warming have moved from the merely theoretical and predicted to observable reality over the past few years, but this has not been matched by an uptick in urgency. The need to keep the wheels of capitalism well-oiled takes precedence even against a backdrop of fires, floods and hurricanes. Today’s children, as they become more politically aware, will be much more radical than their parents, simply because there will be no other choice for them. This emergent radicalism is already taking people by surprise. The Green New Deal (GND), a term presently most associated with 29-year-old US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has provoked a wildly unhinged backlash from the “pro free market” wing, who argue that it’s a Trojan horse, nothing more than an attempt to piggyback Marxism onto the back of climate legislation. The criticism feels ridiculous. Partly because the GND is far from truly radical and already represents a compromise solution, but mainly because the radical economics isn’t a hidden clause, but a headline feature. Climate change is the result of our current economic and industrial system. GND-style proposals marry sweeping environmental policy changes with broader socialist reforms because the level of disruption required to keep us at a temperature anywhere below “absolutely catastrophic” is fundamentally, on a deep structural level, incompatible with the status quo. Right now we can, with a massive investment of effort by 2030, just about keep the warming level below 1.5C. This is “bad, but manageable” territory. Failing to put that effort in sees the world crossing more severe temperature barriers that would lead to outcomes like ecosystem collapse, ocean acidification, mass desertification, and coastal cities being flooded into inhabitability. We will simply have to throw the kitchen sink at this. Policy tweaks such as a carbon tax won’t do it. We need to fundamentally re-evaluate our relationship to ownership, work and capital. The impact of a dramatic reconfiguration of the industrial economy require similarly large changes to the welfare state. Basic incomes, large-scale public works programmes, everything has to be on the table to ensure that the oncoming system shocks do not leave vast swathes of the global population starving and destitute. Perhaps even more fundamentally, we cannot continue to treat the welfare system as a tool for disciplining the supposedly idle underclasses. Our system must be reformed with a more humane view of worklessness, poverty and migration than we have now. Unfortunately for our children, the people they have to convince of all this are the people who have done very well out of this system, and are powerfully incentivised to deny that it is all that bad. Already, Joke Schauvliege, a Belgian environment minister, has been forced to resign after falsely claiming that she had been told by Belgian state security services that “ghosts” behind the scenes were behind demonstrations in Belgium. This conspiracism of the elite, these claims that genuine mass movement can’t possibly really exist and must be in some way being guided by agents provocateurs, is just one of the ways in which those currently running things have resorted to a kind of political gaslighting in an attempt to maintain their grip on power. Gaslighting is a term I don’t use lightly, because it describes a genuine form of emotional abuse, where an abuser will deny reality in an attempt to get their victim to literally doubt their own sanity, and this should not be diluted by overuse. Yet I struggle to think of another word that adequately sums up the way in which “sensible” adults are doubling down on their tactic of manufacturing a political reality which bears no relationship to the world we see around us. It’s the Marxism of Groucho rather than Karl: “Who are you going to believe? The serious political professionals or your own lying eyes?” US Senator Dianne Feinstein’s meeting with schoolchildren petitioning her to take action over the issue went viral because of the way she condescended to them for, basically, asking her to leave them a planet behind to live on. “I’ve been doing this for 30 years,” she said, “I know what I’m doing.” The obvious response is, of course, that messing something up for 30 years is quite long enough, thanks. Long tenure without results is not the same thing as expertise. This is a tough and bitter pill to swallow for the political professionals whose feet are firmly under the table. It is increasingly obvious that all their tactics have done almost nothing except run down the clock, but still they insist that it’s the young who just don’t get it and that things aren’t that simple. They’re the living embodiment of the famous New Yorker cartoon, with a suited man sat in a post-apocalyptic landscape telling his young audience “Yes, the planet got destroyed. But for a beautiful moment in time we created a lot of value for shareholders.” This is reality v the vested interests of the powerful. Any meaningful policy has to upset the established power base and the political donor class. Any policy that doesn’t upset these people will be useless. To pretend that we can compromise our way through this while we wait for a magical, technological bullet that will keep temperatures down without costing us anything is beyond wilful ignorance now. It is a question of basic morality. Many of today’s climate strikers won’t even be 30 by the time the 1.5C deadline comes around in 2030. They are asking us to consider a simple question: is their future worth more than preserving our reputations? What will our response to them be? • Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"
"Since August 2018 a Swedish teenager, Greta Thunberg, has sat outside her country’s parliament building every Friday rather than in a classroom. She is there to demand that the government takes climate action by implementing the 2015 Paris agreement. While some thought she would give up her strike, her resolve could not be broken by the cold, heat or disapproval from adults.  Last Friday children in 72 countries joined what have come to be known as the school strikes against climate change. It is important to note that one of the pillars on which the strike hangs is the Paris climate accord globally endorsed in 2015 at the 21st conference of parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Taken alongside the UN sustainable development goals, the hope is that global temperature rises above preindustrial levels can be kept at 1.5C or “well below” 2C. It is also hoped that with the development goals poverty and hunger can be terminated by 2050. Are these attainable targets? Negotiations on pathways of implementing the Paris climate agreement underscore the fact that there is a global agreement that countries must take action. But the indications of how this would be achieved are not at the level of ambition needed to counter, slow or stop the looming climate chaos. The problem with voluntary emissions reduction by nations is that such actions would only achieve the targets if the key polluters do their fair share of cutting emissions at source. This is not the scenario that is playing out, however. A special report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicated that the current ambition as set out until 2030 will likely result in a global warming of about 3C by 2100 and that this warming would continue. Unless the most polluting nations raise their emissions reduction ambitions, we are on track towards the literal incineration of the planet. Extreme weather events are already wreaking havoc on many regions. Small-island developing nations are at extreme risk of being swallowed up by the oceans. Nigeria and other African nations are at risk of highly challenged agricultural systems and intensified poverty regimes. Even with the best socioeconomic improvements in our nations, the consequences of 1.5C or 2C temperature increase will mean elevated health risks, water stress, human insecurity, damaged livelihoods and lowered levels of wellbeing. Temperature rises will lead to increased desertification, higher ocean acidification and migration of marine species to higher latitudes. The impacts on my home country, Nigeria, will be dire. Water stress will be higher in the Sahelian area and this will compel a higher rate of southward migration of pastoralists and farmers. Ocean acidification and coastal erosion, on the other hand, will force coastal communities to relocate into the hinterland. This is a scenario that will breed conflict. The strike for climate action is a significant step by children and teenagers, especially because it is their future that is at stake. Thunberg has been clear in her many speeches to policymakers and leaders. She insists that nations must wake up and that their sluggishness is a mark of laziness and irresponsibility. At the UN climate change conference in Katowice in December, she pointedly stated: “You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to us children.” One of the clear ways to apply that brake is to quickly phase out the dependence on fossil fuels for energy production and transportation. The truth is that the world must abandon fossil fuels within this century. The decline in use of this dirty energy must happen now. Rather than take this pathway, politicians lend their ears to fossil fuel corporations even in the corridors of the UN climate change conferences. Rather than cut emissions, the tendency is towards what is termed net-zero emissions. This means a polluter can keep polluting once they buy a licence for the actions by showing that an equivalent amount is being absorbed by trees in a poor community’s forest or that similar amounts are absorbed by the oceans or are reflected back into space through geoengineering. Sadly, Nigeria keeps flaring gas in the Niger Delta – a major local contributor of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our government’s deadline for ending gas flaring in 2020 does not appear achievable given progress on the ground. When children call adults immature, we must be attentive. It is not an insult. It is a plea for us to think of the future of our children. They insist that if there is no future there is no reason to sit in a classroom. We must listen to the children. Children of the world must unite in this struggle to force adults away from short-term measures predicated on profit, political gains and their lack of concern for the planet and the future. • Nnimmo Bassey is director of the ecological thinktank Health of Mother Earth Foundation"
"The United States and Saudi Arabia have hamstrung global efforts to scrutinise climate geoengineering in order to benefit their fossil fuel industries, according to multiple sources at the United Nations environment assembly, taking place this week in Nairobi. The world’s two biggest oil producers reportedly led opposition against plans to examine the risks of climate-manipulating technology such as sucking carbon out of the air, reflective mirrors in space, seeding the oceans and injecting particulates into the atmosphere.  Deeper analysis of the risks had been proposed by Switzerland and 12 other countries as a first step towards stronger oversight of potentially world-altering experiments that would have implications for food supply, biodiversity, global inequality and security. Some have been tried, but as yet none deployed at a scale that would affect the climate. This call for caution was supported by the president of the assembly, Siim Kiisler, Estonia’s environment minister, “We need to talk about governance of geoengineering. We need an international agreement on this in the future. Just ignoring the issue does not help. We need to talk about it and how to govern those technologies in the future.” But sources involved with the talks said the initiative was blocked, initially by the US and Saudi Arabia, then by Japan and other countries. Once dismissed as reckless science fiction, geoengineering has risen up the political agenda of some nations as the climate crisis has become more apparent. The petrochemical industry sees it as a way to justify further expansion of fossil fuel industries. Chevron, BHP and other high-emitting companies have invested in companies that are pushing ahead with experiments to pull CO2 out of the air. US academics at Harvard are also poised to conduct the biggest outdoor test of stratospheric aerosol injection, which simulates the cloaking effect of a volcano eruption. The researchers say this test, known as Scopex, will probably take place in New Mexico. One of the leading US scientists behind such research, David Keith, published a paper this week claiming the risks of geoengineering are not as great as previously feared. Opponents counter that earlier, more thorough studies show serious impacts on Asian monsoon cycles, African droughts, tropical cyclones and extreme temperatures. They want the UN to impose a moratorium on outdoor experiments using this form of technology. “More than a scientific test, this is a political test. It’s a way to establish the technology,” warned Silvia Ribeiro of the industry watchdog ETC Group. “Stratospheric aerosol injection would cause huge imbalances in the climate. We think it will also exacerbate geopolitical unfairness.” Many climate scientists argue such research is a distraction from proven methods of mitigating emissions through tree planting and a switch to renewable energy. Jacqueline McGlade, professor of sustainable development at University College London, said she supported certain types of locally appropriate land-based geoengineering but was extremely concerned about efforts to play with the stratosphere. “If we mess around with particulate matter, it could potentially affect everyone. As far as atmospheric physics are concerned, we don’t know everything.” Currently, the main prohibition on testing is the Convention on Biological Diversity, which the US is the only country not to have ratified. There are also provisions in the London Protocol, which forbids ocean seeding – another form of geoengineering, which aims to increase the capacity of sea water to absorb CO2. The question now is whether to strengthen the controls, by tightening rules and broadening oversight, or to narrow them down. The US argues that geoengineering should be left to climate forums, such as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This week, consensus proved impossible. On Wednesday evening, the Swiss delegation withdrew their resolution and expressed regret that “some countries” were reluctant to move forward. “Our motivation was to get more information to inform discussions,” the head of the delegation Felix Wertli said. “Governance of geoengineering is an important topic today, and even more tomorrow. The topic is not off the table. It is the start of a further conversation.” This was seen as a defeat for the “precautionary principle”, under which nations are supposed to put safety first when faced with uncertain but potentially catastrophic risks. Campaigners warned future debates on the subject are now more likely to focus narrowly on science and politics, rather than other species, food supply, water use, inequality and peace. “It is regrettable that efforts to strengthen existing UN governance on geoengineering met with resistance from a handful of high-emitting oil-producing countries,” said Lili Fuhr of the Heinrich Böll Foundation. “This task is now more important than ever as we see real-world experiments and public support for these technologies growing in exactly those countries, like the USA and Saudi Arabia, that were blocking progress on this issue this week in Nairobi.” This was not the only agenda item in Nairobi that Trump administration diplomats were accused of watering down; they were also accused of undermining efforts to ensure strong environmental governance. “They are trying to remove all targets and timelines,” said one senior delegate. An ambitious Indian resolution to phase out single-use plastics by 2025 has been diluted to resolving to “significantly reduce” them by 2030, said another delegate. The US was supported by Brazil and at least four other countries in pushing back the deadline and making the language more vague. On marine waste, a Norwegian proposal to build an effective global strategy for dealing with plastics that enter the oceans has also met with resistance from the US. “They want to postpone measures so they can protect their industry,” said an ambassador from a large developing country. Approached by the Guardian, a US official denied his country was playing an obstructionist role. This could prove to be the last time the UK is part of the European Union delegation at an international conference, and there is speculation that after Brexit the British position may be realigned with the economy-first, environment-second approach of Washington."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Green Parliamentarians in Germany have a lot of questions to answer.
Awhile back, spooked by a visit to Germany by Fred Singer, they sent a QUERY to the ruling government in attempt to stem the rising tide of skepticism in Germany.
Their query was filled with use of the word “denier” and attempted marginalize and demonize people who had different opinion, like the Berlin Manhattan Institute, EIKE, Fred Singer and the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Liberty.
Well, the Berlin Manhattan Institute, together with the Internet blog antibuerokratieteam.net, have fired back with a query of their own addressed at the green radicals. Below it’s in English.
It has 16 questions for the Greens to answer, though don’t get your hopes up that they will.
I was surprised by the extent the Greens are just hacks of industry – see Question No. 11.
========================================================
Query to the Parliamentary Faction ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS
From:      Berlin Manhattan Institute and antibuerokratieteam.net
To:            German Green Parliamentarians
Subject: Position of the ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS regarding open scientific debate and tolerating people with different views
Parliamentarians Dr. Hermann Ott, Bärbel Höhn, Hans-Josef Fell, Sylvia Kotting-Uhl, Oliver Krischer, Undine Kurth (Quedlinburg), Nicole Maisch, Dorothea Steiner and the faction ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS submitted an official query to the German Government (BT-Printed Document 17/3613), 3 November 2010.
This query also included an assessment of the scientific reputation of “climate denier” Prof. Fred Singer, and further asked if any peer-review works questioning the AGW hypothesis exist, and, if so, are they supported by scientific data?
The query submitted by the Greens, and especially its condescending tone, compel us to present the ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS with a query of our own.
We ask the following questions to the ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS:
1. Are the Greens aware that there are over 800 scientific papers that have been published and peer-reviewed, as well approx. 4000 sources of cited literature in the NIPCC Report Climate Change Reconsidered which question man-made climate change, and are all supported by scientific data? If not aware, do the Greens intend to expand their scientific knowledge so that in the future they will know the number of scientific publications out there?  And if yes, then why do the Greens deny their existence?
2. Are the members of the Green Parliamentarian faction aware that climate science is in fact still a very new scientific field that it has only begun to process the vast amounts of data collected thus far, and that it produces new surprising findings daily and is still a long way from being understood?  Are the members of the faction of Green Parliamentarians aware that scientific theories require empirical confirmation, and that their truth cannot be tested by model analyses?
3. Will the Greens even send a representative to the 3rd International Conference on Climate and Energy taking place in Berlin on December 3 -4 2010 with the objective of having a scientific discussion with the distinguished scientists who will be speaking there? Or will you remain hidden in your bunker?

4. If the Greens believe that the question of climate change and its possible human causes is already settled for good, then why don’t they call for the end of all the taxpayer financing of climate research work, especially when all the questions are answered? Are the Greens still aware of any redundant, needless  scientific work still taking place now that the questions are answered?
5. Are the Greens aware of any other institution, except for the Pope and their own party, that claims to be infallible?
6. The Greens cite the publications of the IPCC. Are the Greens aware of any incidents where scientific works questioning manmade climate change were either suppressed on multiple occasions in concerted actions, falsified, falsely presented, or not based on scientific research subjected to peer review (e.g. Climategate, Himalayagate, Glaciergate, Amazongate)?
7. Are you aware that the scientific career of Prof. Fred Singer, whom you characterize as unserious and unscientific, includes the following achievements and milestones? At the age of 16, Singer, as a Jew, had to leave Austria with his parents and emigrate to the United States, received a B.E.E. in electrical engineering from Ohio State University in 1943, an A.M. in physics from Princeton in 1944, taught physics at Princeton while he worked on his masters and his doctorate, obtaining his PhD there in 1948, he worked on the rocket science program of Johns Hopkins University for studying the ionosphere from 1946 to 1950, was attached to the U.S. Embassy in London as a scientific liaison officer with the Office of Naval Research from 1950 to 1953 where he studied research programs in Europe into cosmic radiation and nuclear physics, became Associate Professor of Physics at the University of Maryland and of the Center for Atmospheric and Space Physics in 1953, directed the meteorological satellite services for the National Weather Satellite Center (today at the NOAA) in 1962, was first dean of the School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences at the University of Miami in 1964, was deputy assistant secretary with the U.S. Department of the Interior in Water Management from 1967 to 1971 which at the time was also responsible for Atmospheric and Oceanic affairs, was also Deputy Assistant Administrator (Policy) at the U;S. Department of Environment from 1970 to 1971, Professor for Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia in 1971, retired 1994, and is author of numerous scientific papers and books.
8. Are the Greens aware that leading American climatologist Prof. Dr. Judith Curry, Director of Georgia Tech Institute Geophysical and Atmospheric Sciences, was invited on November 17, 2010 to appear before the Congressional Energy and Environment subcommittee to testify as an expert and said: “Manmade climate change is a theory, where the basic mechanisms are well understood but because of the extent of climate change due to feedback processes, it is highly uncertain. (…) The conflict over the theory of man-made climate change is based on our lack of knowledge on natural variability”? Do the Greens regard this scientist, who has published 144 peer reviewed papers, received numerous awards and was publisher of the American Journal Society for Meteorology, as a “denier”? Or is the Green Faction ready to acknowledge that there is also much theory in the field of climatology, just like in every other area of science?
9. Is it your view that distinguishing between unserious, unscientific work and serious, scientific work is done solely by determining whether a work supports or opposes the political standards of the Green Party?
10. Do the Greens believe that it is just a lucky coincidence that no journalist has ever gotten the idea to check up on the scientific reputation of experts that are paid by the Greens?
11. What is the Greens’ position on the fact that your politics accompanies the extreme subsidies to solar and wind energy, bought by donations from, among others, IBC Solar AG, SMA Solar Technology AG, Ostwind, Umweltkontor Renewable Energy, EWO Energietechnologie GmbH, Conergy AG, Pro Vento, Nordex AG, Windpark G. W. Meerhof GmbH & Co. KG, Ersol AGder Windpark GmbH & Co. KG, Wind Project Development GmbH, Solarworld AG, SMA Technologie AG, Solon AG fir Solar Technology, AGU Energy and Electrotechnology GmbH?
12. In which renewable energy industries, which are highly subsidized by law, and to what extent, have Parliamentarians of the Green Faction invested, and thus guaranteed themselves a sure financial return at the consumers’ expense?
13. Do the Greens intend to continue their constant use of the expression “climate denier” thus directly implying “Holocaust deniers”? If yes, do the Greens intend to amend corpus delicti of sedition (§ 130 StGB), so that future statements on climate change can be punished if they fo not comply with the party line of ALLIANCE 90/THE GREENS?
14. Will the Greens continue to use public money to encourage and incite others to commit of acts of crime, such as vandalizing rail tracks?
15. Will the Greens call protests at nuclear waste storage facilities only when they are in the opposition, and do the opposite when they are not?
16. Are the Greens aware of the point you’ve reached today when you have to be asked such questions?
Berlin, 30 November 2010

Lots of questions for the Greens to answer. We’re all holding our breaths!

"The veteran weatherman Bill Giles is calling on the BBC and other major broadcasters to radically overhaul their forecasts to incorporate information about climate change. The former head of BBC weather presenters has said more needs to be done by broadcasters to highlight climate change to face the “reality more squarely and openly”.  Giles, who presented weather forecasts at the corporation for nearly two decades, is urging TV channels to come up with a “radical approach to keep viewers properly informed”. In a piece for Radio Times, Giles, 79, writes: “The hourly forecasts that we now see do an excellent job in giving us the likely weather events over the coming few days, and this must continue. But to properly explain the underlying changes to climate they will need to look much further afield at the weather across the world, reporting and analysing extremes on a daily basis. “So I am calling on the BBC and the other major broadcasters to incorporate an additional five- to 10-minute slot into the forecast that focuses properly and honestly on the Earth’s changing climate. “This climate change slot should air at least once a week and would use our technical ability to show weather everywhere in the world to explain in clear, ‘non-jargony’ or technical terms the reasons why our climate is changing – largely due to human influences – and the effects of this on us and all other animals.” The forecaster, who says he has been highlighting the effects of climate change since the 1980s, warns: “If our mathematics are correct, then a 2C change will mean that the London summer climate in 2050 would be similar to that of southern France of today – and by 2100 similar to that of Athens.” A BBC spokesman said: “BBC Weather is already looking at climate change very carefully to see how we can communicate its impacts, particularly on extreme weather events both in the UK and around the world.” Asked whether it backed Giles’s calls, the Met Office said it “welcomes any opportunities to raise awareness and promote the science of climate change”. A spokesman added: “As our climate changes, so will the weather we experience on a day to day basis. Working with the media to increase understanding of the science behind how the likelihood of heatwaves, floods or storms may change in the future should be welcomed.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitter[Update: 6 July – The SZ has reposted its story]The left of centre German online Sueddeutsche Zeitung had, for a very short time, a quite inconvenient piece up today called, in English: News On Nature’s Respiration, which reported on findings just out from the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemicals in Jena, Germany, on the earth’s CO2 cycle and possible future impacts.
Mysteriously, the SZ suddenly ripped it down from its website! Google provides the link if you punch in the original German title “Neues vom Atem der Natur“. Other news sites link to the original SZ report as well, e.g. here and here.
The SZ reported that scientists had collected and evaluated data from 60 measuring towers located in many countries and various ecosystems and presented their findings in Turin, Italy today.
The scientists determined that plants absorb 450 billion metric tonnes of CO2 through photosynthesis each year, or about one seventh of the total amount in the atmosphere. Almost 60% is absorbed by forests and savannahs in the tropics, 11% by fields for food crops.
Humans, by contrast, emit about 36 billion tonnes through their activities, of which the majority gets absorbed by the oceans and atmosphere.
And every year almost the entire 450 billion tonnes gets released by the plants through falling foliage, decay, etc.
According to the now-disappeared SZ report, researchers led by the Max Planck Institute calculated how much the amount of CO2 released would change if the temperature changed. According to the researchers, a warming of 10°C would increase the emission by 40%. According to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung report:
That is considerably less than what was often assumed earlier. Earlier a doubling or a quadrupling was often discussed. And apparently this low factor applies for everything from the frozen tundra to the tropical rainforests.
The researchers of the Max Planck Institute concluded:
This dampens the fears that global warming could accelerate from more CO2 being released by savannahs and rainforests with every degree of warming.  This means that so far nature is absorbing a part of manmade CO2 year for year and stores it, thus buffering the climate effect.

Dr. Markus Reichstein of the Max Planck Institute is quoted by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung:
Especially alarmist scenarios for feedbacks from global warming and ecosystem respiration are shown to be unrealistic.
These feedback effects were not at all accounted for in the 2007 IPCC-Report.
I’ve tried to find the findings from the Max Planck Institute at their website, but haven’t been succesful yet. I think it’s very strange the SZ report would be up for about an hour, and then taken down. Someone probably didn’t like what it said.
UPDATE: I sent an e-mail to Dr Reichstein, who was indeed very kind to reply – and provided the following explanation:
Dear Mr Gosselin,
thanks for your interest in the topic. A simple web search however reveals that you are not “just a private reader with an interest” – rather you seem to have established a blog “NoTricksZone”, or is it someone else with the same name.
In any a as matter of fact let me just state that indeed the SZ published the article – probably accidentally – before the embargo for such publication lifted (the embargo will lift at midnight tonight). Hence the article was removed temporarily. That is all.
Best regards,
Markus Reichstein
Well, I am just a private citizen doing this blog for fun as a hobby. I’m not funded by anyone except myself. In any case, could be interesting to see if anything has been sanitised. We’ll see in 75 minutes.
UPDATE 2: Embargo has been lifted, the story has been reposted. As far as I can tell, it does not deviate from anything I’ve written. – P Gosselin

"The world is slaughtered by walls. Our walls aren’t made of stone, but constructed from something different. February saw record-high winter temperatures in the UK, defined by the burning of Saddleworth Moor and our supposed leaders truanting during the first climate change debate in two years. Juxtaposing these events reveals this country’s moral blindspot. While we still give airtime to climate deniers and delayers, fuelling debate as though the concrete causes of climate change are no longer based in science, we fail to stare at the real wounds festering around us.  We built walls around our empire, constructed out of colonialism, exploitation and imperial greed, with little regard for the enclosures we created. But history is permeable. It isn’t bound to classrooms, but something we are exposed to every day. We absorb the global narrative our country refuses to recognise, through the shared lives of activists, environmentalists and anyone with a phone and a voice. This narrative is composed from interweaving stories, the voices of a movement unrestricted by walls. Through this lens we are able to reshape our history, but only by first addressing our present. To remain ignorant is to remain immune to blame. It creates disconnection. This is why we need climate justice. There is a reason why teenagers and children have been chanting, “System change, not climate change”. The system is fundamentally at fault, and our leaders fail to recognise that. They are trapped behind yet another wall of their own construction. It prevents them from seeing the connection between our actions and their leadership. The Youth Strike 4 Climate movement isn’t just unprecedented, it’s also reforging fractured connections. Going across borders, trespassing upon political nuance laid out by generations before us, young people from around the world are weaving a new social fabric in which climate justice is our connecting force – a sledgehammer to the walls around us. Connections like these form as we reclaim our social media spaces. By building platforms for young activists to share their stories – whether they be of those living among cyclones in the Pacific or political danger in Brazil – the internet can be restored as a place for unfiltered intimacy with things that matter, revealing the reality of climate change for those living it. And, in creating a social network based on the values of internationalism and solidarity, we subvert the system of competition and separation permeating our lives. In ant colonies, large populations are sustained through the interactions between individual ants. There is little centralised authority in the most resilient colonies. On social media, teenagers have also been swept up in self-organisation, spreading their message from group to group, country to country, with the only central authority being the collective fear we all share. We are redefining political space and challenging the idea that social media platforms are only uncontrollable forces beyond our control. Instead, we’re creating tools to change the world, but on our own terms. As the power of far-right groups grows online, the digital presence of the Youth Strikes campaign fosters a sense of community that is more like systems of interdependence in the natural world than the walled enclosure of traditional politics. The self-organising power of the strikes and our closeness to others miles from us provides a new alternative. We’re not separate from each other and we are not separate from nature. We need those in power to act with urgency and new ideas, but we also implore them to address the causes of the crisis. In order to truly repair the climate, we must recognise the system of inequality that has caused its collapse. Britain, while it might not be the biggest carbon emitter in the world, has a responsibility to act, given its historical role in creating the crisis we find ourselves in. Our society is built on the coal-fuelled industrial revolution; we now export our consumerist emissions abroad while providing lines of credit and finance to the destructive industries ravaging through other lands. Our economic model is parasitic, with little regard for people or the planet. Competition, consumerism and separation fundamentally disrupt the patterns of nature. They are the causes of its impending collapse. Until we recognise our role in climate justice, we will be forever controlled by these forces. Our governments must look to the Youth Strike movement to learn a new way forward. Our movement is fuelled not only by anger, passion, fear and intelligence, but also by a deep understanding of the connectivity of all humans – and humanity’s relationship with the planet. In breaking down the walls of communication, new voices have emerged to define a politics for the future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) features an interview here with think-tank director and top German climate advisor Dr. Oliver Geden, who has of late become Germany’s latest enfant terrible for climate activists.
Geden, a true warmist, has become exasperated by the approach used by policymakers in curbing CO2 emissions, and views goals like the 2°C target as pie-in-the-sky and counter-productive.
The FAZ asks Geden if Warsaw was a success. His answer:
No. It was a failure, even when measured by the lowest expectations.”
Geden believes the winners of the conference were the USA, India, and China “because they have succeeded in anchoring a system where every state can decide itself what it is ready to contribute“. Sovereignty sure sucks.
Among the losers he sees the EU at the head of the pack, and developing countries, who were counting on huge monetary transfers. Overall Geden believes that 2°C (450 ppm) target was a naïve goal and was doomed to fail from the start. He says that “The global emissions have risen dramatically since the beginning of the UN climate negotiations“. Moreover, rich industrial countries won’t fulfill their promises to pay poor countries, Geden asserts.

Geden also sees the chances of a meaningful international climate contract getting signed in 2015 as very slim. He says that countries within the EU are “hopelessly in disagreement” when it comes to the climate targets for 2030 and that Eastern European countries are no longer interested in taking on a leadership position on the climate issue.
He also mentions that Germany is not going to convince anyone as the country “will clearly miss its 40 percent reduction by 2040 target“. Geden adds:
In 2013 German emissions will in fact rise for the second year in a row.”
“2°C Target can still be reached!”
With a performance like that, it’s going to be awfully tough for Germany to be taken seriously as an example for the rest of the world. The FAZ then asks Geden if he thinks the 2°C target is now off the table for good. Geden sees the 2°C target as “in fact failed”. He concludes:
As nobody knows on how things are to proceed after that, we will be seeing still many more studies that will ‘verify’ that the 2°C still can be reached, even if only under the most absurd assumptions, like through ‘negative emissions’ in the second half of the century.”

"There are other things around which Washington’s governor, Jay Inslee, could craft his stump speech. He could talk about how he dropped out of Stanford and moved into his parents’ basement because he couldn’t afford tuition. He could tell voters he was the first governor to challenge Donald Trump’s Muslim travel ban.  These things are mentioned when he talks to voters as a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. But from its announcement at a Seattle solar panel installation company, his campaign has remained laser-focused on fighting climate change. The 68-year-old says climate change is the reason he is running for president and he speaks of it as an imminent threat to the US and the world. Other issues matter but Inslee says America cannot afford to have another leader who does not have climate change as their top priority. “We have exactly one chance left to defeat climate change – and that’s during the next administration,” he told a crowd in a living room in Bedford on Saturday morning. “And when you have one chance at survival, we ought to take it.” Climate change is not a fringe issue in the Democratic party. While other candidates may not devote the majority of their speeches to it, they all speak of it as an urgent if not existential issue that must be tackled in the next administration. Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke has compared those fighting climate change to the troops who stormed the beaches of Normandy and warned Iowa voters that the planet has just 12 years left to avert disaster. The former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro has said his first executive order will be to return the US to the Paris climate accord. When New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduced her Green New Deal legislation, many candidates lined up to support it. Inslee says climate change cannot just be a box to be ticked – that if climate change is not the top priority, nothing will be done. “I wonder the difference between talk and action,” he said on Saturday. “Between bumper stickers and productive accomplishments. It can’t be just one of those things on your to-do list. It has to be a full-scale, full-throated commitment to get this job done.” Asked by the Guardian if the election of another Democrat would mean the US would miss its “one chance” to fight climate change, he said: “If it’s not job one, it won’t get done. And I’m the only candidate that’s saying that right now.” In his pitch to voters, Inslee leans heavily on his experience as governor, painting himself as a man who knows how to lead and who has overseen an economic boom and environmental reform. “I’ve been a governor,” he told a crowd at a town hall meeting in Exeter, later on Saturday. “And I’ve actually got things done instead of just talking about it. I’ve learned that getting things done is different than giving speeches. What I’ve learned is that executive experience is something that is really important when it comes to getting things done.” Inslee says fighting climate change offers economic promise, that clean energy will create millions of jobs. In Bedford, he told voters the “vast bulk” of money invested in clean energy will come from private equity markets, not taxpayers. “What we need to do is embrace policies that will help drive private equity into these industries,” he said. Such investment and job creation is already happening in Washington state, he said, as it pushes towards clean energy. Inslee has not just set himself apart from other Democrats by being a single-issue candidate. He has also broken ranks on a hot-button congressional issue. To successfully fight climate change, Inslee says, the Senate must eliminate the filibuster, which allows senators to require a 60-vote supermajority to pass legislation. He says the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has turned it into a “weaponised system to prevent progressive change”. Other candidates have either declined to endorse instituting the nuclear option or have said they oppose it. Furthermore, as candidates have largely patted one another on the back so far, even when they disagree on policies, without naming names Inslee has appeared to suggest some of his competitors’ commitments to combating climate change will not result in action. He also breaks with other candidates in his willingness to accept money from Super Pacs, organisations that can provide unlimited funding so long as they do not coordinate with candidates. Other candidates pledge not to take money from Super Pacs but Inslee has said he will not turn down funds from those which really want to fight climate change. He has pledged, however, not to accept any money from the fossil fuel industry or corporate political action committees. Last month, the Super Pac Act Now on Climate was formed to support Inslee’s run. So far, it has spent more than $1m on ad buys. Inslee lacks name recognition and barely registers in the polls, so such assistance could give him a much needed leg-up in early primary states. But it also runs the risk of opening him up to attacks as Democrats try to outdo one another in presenting their campaigns as unbeholden to outside groups. His decision to accept Super Pac money was condemned by the group End Citizens United. In a letter directed at Inslee, the group called single-candidate Super Pacs like Act Now on Climate “even worse than Super Pacs themselves”. In Bedford, Harlan Cutshall, 25, had driven from Boston to see Inslee speak. “I appreciate his focus on climate change and making that the centrality of his campaign,” he said. “I think that’s really needed in this debate in 2020. I think this is the defining issue of our time … everyone needs to be taking it very seriously and talking about it sensibly.” Jennifer Stitt, 55, said she was impressed but wanted to learn more about Inslee’s position on other subjects. “I want to hear how he truly intends to approach foreign affairs and cutting our debt,” she said. “I want to see him being able to respond to a more complete platform with a little bit more detail.” In Exeter, Barbara Berman, 66, said Inslee’s climate change message could prove powerful. “If he can roll it into improving the infrastructure and all that, we might have a winner,” she said. “It kind of sets him apart.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs mentioned in my last post, the Greens are now getting answers to the QUERY they submitted earlier to the German Government. The query is now proving to be a futile and sad attempt to stem the rising tide of skepticism in Germany, read here.
In this query, German Greens actually asked Angela Merkel’s government to deride climate science dissent and to join in on some sort of climate-denialsim. It was really weird, to say the least.
The German Government has aince responded to the green-query. From the answers, one clearly sees a German Government that is:
1) one-sidedly informed,
2) but is open to a scientific discussion (see no. 1o below).
It is true that Angela Merkel’s coalition government has made combating climate change a crucial issue. But much of that has to do with her one-sided activist advisers, particularly the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and its head, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber – the German climate science gatekeeper. This, as you will see, is confirmed by the Government’s response to the query.
Question no. 1 and 2 (paraphrased:
Are you aware of any peer-reviewed papers that dispute man-made global warming, and is there a discussion about the cause of climate change within the Government?
The Government responds claiming it bases its position solely on the findings of the IPCC and added:
The last IPCC report of 2007 has detected a definite warming  in the climate system and has determined that it is highly likely that the warming since the middle of the 20th century was caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.
The Federal Government is not aware of any works that have been peer reviewed that put the assertions in doubt.
Here the Government is stating they are not even aware of the huge body of science disputing AGW. They’ve been shielded from it. We know there are 800 peer reviewed skeptic papers out there. It’s a question of getting that body of science to them. I find the part “since the middle of the 20th century” peculiar as well. Why not the entire century?
As the Wikileaks documents show, Chancellor Merkel has far more pressing geo-political matters to attend to. For climate, she is advised by Schellnhuber and by her Environment Minister Mr. Norbert Röttgen, who, incidentally, was assessed in a Wikileak document as being just a layperson on the topic of climate science and environment. Indeed the advice Merkel is getting is one-sided and woefully incomplete.
On the questions 3-6, all concerning Fred Singer:

Fred Singer is a well-known so-called climate change skeptic because of his frequent appearances in the media worldwide.”
Again, this shows the government is not well-informed. Fred Singer is not a skeptic of climate change; he’s skeptic of the claim that today’s climate change is for the most part man-made. The Government’s response also states that it does not gather information about individual scientists or make judgements on their expertise.
On Question no. 7:
Are there any voices within the German government who question the man-made causes of climate change?
To this question, the Government flatly says that it relies solely on the IPCC – period. Here, someone needs to explain to the Government that relying on a single source for important information is not a wise idea, and is negligent. The German Government seems to believe that there is only one source of information, and that it [IPCC] is the only authority and is infallible.
On questions 8 and 9 concerning EIKE (and again Fred Singer), the German Government says it is not familiar with the organization. I doubt that’s true. But legally it’s a good answer.
QUESTION NO: 10:
Are you in favor of using public funds for spreading the claims made by climate deniers like Fred Singer?
The German Government welcomes an open scientific discussion on the importance and uncertainties of the results of climate science, as progress depends on lively and controversial discussions.”
Hardly what the green zealots and warmisnistas are calling for. It’s the exact opposite.
So we see that we have a government made up of a coalition that is woefully ill-informed, but at least goes on to say it is open to all scientific views.
Somehow we have to gently push the door open get the information in. But remember, Merkel is well-shielded. Certainly the process will take time, patience and effort, and may be much easier when the two ruling coalition parties are sitting in the offices of the opposition and the real hardcore greens and socialists are running the country into the ground.
For a copy of the Government’s response to the Query (in German), contact a spokesman at EIKE.

"As the news of the Christchurch mosque massacre broke and I scoured the news, I came across a map showing that the Friday morning climate strike in Christchurch was close to the bloodbath. I felt terrible for the young people who showed up with hope and idealism, wondered whether the killer or killers chose this particular day to undermine the impact of this global climate action. It was a shocking pairing and also a perfectly coherent one, a clash of opposing ideologies. Behind the urgency of climate action is the understanding that everything is connected; behind white supremacy is an ideology of separation. Of separation as the idea that human beings are divided into races, and those in one race have nothing in common with those in others. Of separation as the idea that though white people have overrun the globe, nonwhite people should stay out of Europe, North America, and now even New Zealand and Australia, two places where white settlers came relatively recently to already inhabited places – as a fantasy of resegregating the world. Of a lot of ideas and ideals of masculinity taken to a monstrous extreme – as ideas of disconnection, of taking matters into your own hands, of feeling no empathy and exhibiting no kindness, of asserting yourself as having the right to dominate others even unto death. And of course, of guns as the symbols and instruments of this self-definition. Climate change is based on science. But if you delve into it deeply enough it is a kind of mysticism without mystification, a recognition of the beautiful interconnection of all life and the systems – weather, water, soil, seasons, ocean pH – on which that life depends. It acknowledges that everything is connected, that to dig up the carbon that plants so helpfully sequestered in the ground over eons and burn it so that returns to the sky as carbon dioxide changes the climate, and that this changed climate isn’t just warmer, it’s more chaotic, in ways that break these elegant patterns and relationships. That chaos is a kind of violence – the violence of hurricanes, wildfires, new temperature extremes, broken weather patterns, droughts, extinctions, famines. Which is why climate action has been and must be nonviolent. It is a movement to protect life. Fighting against climate change is the equivalent of fighting against hatred That includes human life whether it’s the people of Central America impacted by failed harvests or of the Gulf Coast by hurricanes or the Arctic and their traditional relationships to seals, caribou and other species in crisis from climate change or the people of California, like the 82 killed in the inferno that in one day destroyed the town of Paradise last year. And it includes all life, because human beings are not separate from the fate of insects, of birds, of the life in the sea, of the forests that sequester carbon, of the diseases that will thrive on a warmer planet. I know a lot of climate activists, and I know what motivates them: it’s love. For the whole planet, for the most vulnerable people on it, for the idea of a livable future. It’s no accident that climate denial is integral to rightwing thinking, that Republicans in the US have been freaking out about the Green New Deal, that maximizing fossil fuel development and profit seems to be a cornerstone of their libertarian-capitalist ideology. To acknowledge that everything is connected is to acknowledge that our actions have consequences and therefore responsibilities they are unwilling to shoulder. Also that the solutions to climate change require cooperative work at all levels from local energy transition to national policies that stop subsidizing fossil fuels to international agreements to set emissions goals. In contrast, so much of rightwing ideology now is about a libertarian machismo in the “I can do anything I want” vein. It’s the pro-gun myth that we can each protect ourselves with a weapon when in reality we’re all safer with them out of our societies. It’s the idea that we can deregulate the hell out of everything and everyone can just look out for themselves whether it’s food safety or infrastructure safety or air and water quality. To kill someone you have to feel separate from them, and some violence – lynching, rape – ritualizes this separateness. Violence too comes out of a sort of entitlement: I have the right to hurt you, to determine your fate, to end your life. I am more important than you. It seems like, among other things a miserable mindset, one that aggrandizes your ego but withers your soul. Climate action has been and must be nonviolent. It is a movement to protect life To oppose it means in part standing up for those under attack – black churchgoers in Charleston, Jews in Pittsburgh, Muslims in Christchurch, among them. But it also means being the opposite of their ideals and their actions. It means generosity, respect, inclusion, nonviolence. I asked Hoda Baraka, who is both Muslim and 350.org’s global communications director, how it all looked to her in the wake of the climate strike and the massacre, and she said “In a world being driven by fear, we are constantly being pitted against the very things that make this world livable. Whether it’s people being pitted against each other, even though there is no life without human connection, love and empathy. Or fear pitting us against the very planet that sustains us, even though there is no life on a dead planet. This is why fighting against climate change is the equivalent of fighting against hatred. A world that thrives is one where both people and planet are seen for their inextricable value and connectedness.” Our work as climate activists arises from the recognition that acts have consequences, and consequences come with responsibilities, and we are responsible for the fate of this earth, for all living things now and in the future we are choosing with our actions– or inactions – in the present. But also from the recognition that ecological connectedness contains a deep beauty tantamount to love. Our goal as climate activists is to protect life. Those children and youth standing up for the future in Christchurch and in more than 1,700 other cities around the world were already the answer we needed.

"England is set to run short of water within 25 years, the chief executive of the Environment Agency has warned. The country is facing the ‘‘jaws of death”, Sir James Bevan said, at the point where water demand from the country’s rising population surpasses the falling supply resulting from climate change.  However, this could be avoided with ambitious action to cut people’s water use by a third and leakage from water company pipes by 50%, he says, along with big new reservoirs, more desalination plants and transfers of water across the country. “Around 25 years from now, where those [demand and supply] lines cross is known by some as the ‘jaws of death’ – the point at which we will not have enough water to supply our needs, unless we take action to change things,” Bevan told the Guardian, before a speech on Tuesday at the Waterwise conference in London. “We need water wastage to be as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby or throwing your plastic bags into the sea,” he said. In the speech, Bevan says: “Water companies all identify the same thing as their biggest operating risk: climate change.” By 2040, more than half of our summers are expected to be hotter than the 2003 heatwave, he says, leading to more water shortages and potentially 50-80% less water in some rivers in the summer. The population of the UK is expected to rise from 67 million to 75 million in 2050, increasing the demand for water. But Bevan says the average person’s daily water use of 140 litres could be cut to 100 litres in 20 years by more efficient use in homes and gardens. Currently, about a third of water is lost to leaks or wastage. The most controversial change needed to increase supply is building new mega-reservoirs, such as that proposed near Abingdon in Oxfordshire. “We have not built a new reservoir in the UK for decades, largely because clearing all the planning and legal hurdles necessary is so difficult and local opposition so fierce,” Bevan says. The government plans to streamline the planning process. “That will be controversial, but it’s the right thing to do,” says Bevan. More water will also need to be transferred across the country to water-stressed areas, such as the south-east, Bevan says, via pipelines or canals. Just 4% of current supplies are transferred between individual water companies, but there are plans for 20 new transfer projects. More desalination plants, such as Thames Water’s Beckton plant, will also be needed to turn seawater into drinking water, he says. “While there will be political challenges, there should be less difficulty over the economics,” Bevan says. “That’s because the investment needed to increase our resilience is modest compared with the cost of not doing it. While a severe drought would cost each household more than £100, the cost per household of the investment that would greatly reduce the risk is only £4 a year.” Water companies are required by the regulator Ofwat to cut leakage by 15% by 2020, although some have incurred huge fines in the past for failing to meet targets. Michael Roberts, the chief executive of Water UK, which represents the water companies, said: “As well as planning increasing investment, water companies have publicly committed to cut leakage by 50% by 2050.” “We’re also working with government and regulators to find ways to make it easier for people to reduce their daily water use, and if we all work together on this we can make sure the country continues to get the water it needs,” said Roberts. “A twin-track approach is the right way to go, reducing demand for water at the same time as increasing supply.” It is also vital that wildlife and natural habitats are protected from excessive water abstraction, said Tom Lancaster, at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), which is part of the Blueprint for Water coalition of 18 NGOs. “Government proposals to reform water abstraction and improve water management are necessary if we are to balance the needs of people and the natural environment,” he said. “This should start with government placing a duty on water companies to restore and enhance nature.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterBill Dawson has a worthwhile piece at the Yale Forum on Climate Change and the Media. Over the last months the warmists have experienced setbacks and are scrambling for ways to get back on track.
One way is message change. Change the framing, branding, PR, spin, and choice of language. It might even include throwing long used visuals like polar bears under the bus. Here are some examples of the message massaging in climate communication Dawson examines.
Don’t focus on climate science
One strategy is de-emphasizing climate change. Pollster Frank Luntz says the focus has to be more on the benefits of a clean-energy bill – domestic jobs, a healthier environment, and potentially less money sent to the Middle East for oil – and less on climate science itself.
The first rule of fighting climate change: Don’t talk about climate change.
John Kerry’s recent Power America energy bill did just that and stressed the positive aspects:
‘It’s primarily a jobs bill, and an energy independence bill and a pollution reduction-health-clean air bill,’ Kerry said. ‘Climate sort of follows. It’s on for the ride.’
The language may have sounded good, but the bill flopped anyway.
New slogans for new times
Gore has been using the slogan “climate-crisis” for quite some time now. But there is a growing feeling that it too may have outlived its shelf-life, and so others are tinkering with new slogans. For example NYT columinist Thomas Friedman suggests  avoiding “global warming” and replacing it with  “global weirding.”

 The modified version better conveys scientists’ projections, he argued, ‘because that is what actually happens as global temperatures rise and the climate changes. The weather gets weird’.
Times blogger and former columnist Andy Revken prefers using “energy quest” because “climate crisis” is no longer a productive way the frame the issue.
Science communication – refine it or replace it
Warmists complain about the supposed huge gap between what scientists say and do, versus how they are portayed. NOAA director Jane Lubchenco told reporters in March:
“scientists have seriously underestimated the importance of explaining what we know about climate in a way people can understand.’
Some scientists took it to an extreme and countered critics by calling out their “McCarthyite campaign”, i.e. a letter in Science signed by 255 members of the National Academy of Sciences.
Less, not more, scientific input
Others say that less science input into politics is needed, not more. Massive amounts of data and information invariably lead to a higher likelihood of errors being discovered.
There’s a lot more in Dawson’s piece. Read it!
Gosselin’s communication advice:
Communication is important in science. But I feel that Dawson and the warmists are ignoring the real problem they have – their science is flawed. It’s the science stupid! (and not the communication).

By Ed Caryl
The recent fate of the MS Akademik Shokalskiy has prompted arguments from the CAGW crowd that the global warming is causing more ice around Antarctica. The problem with this argument is that there has been no warming around Antarctica.
All the trends show cooling, especially in the area where the ship is trapped. The southern ocean is cooling, and has been for a long time, especially since 1996. The latitudes in the vicinity of Commonwealth Bay have been cooling since 1980. There is more ice because Mother Nature is freezing more ice.

Figure 1 is the surface temperatures in the band from 50° south to 70° south. 

Figures 2a and 2b are the annual average temperatures at Bases Casey and Dumont D’Urville, the two closest bases in East Antarctica to Commonwealth Bay. Source GISS.
If we look at a annual temperature trend map of the globe covering the last eight years, we see cooling especially at latitudes north and south of 45°, and at the equator.

Figure 3 is the annual temperature trends from November 2005 to October 2013.
Of course, the southern ice has responded to this decreased temperature by increasing, slowly since the low of 1980, but then much faster in the last three years following the local temperatures. See Figure 4:

Figure 4 is the Southern Hemisphere sea ice anomaly chart. Note that the current Southern sea ice is 1.5 Million square kilometers above the 1979 to 2008 mean value, nearly three times the negative anomaly in the Arctic. Source here.
But for whatever peculiar reason, despite all the observations, global warming scientists insist it’s more logical to blame the extra ice on warming!
The warmists never seem to realize that Antarctica can melt only if the temperature rises above freezing there. For all practical purposes, it almost never does rise above freezing. The summer ice only reduces because the wind breaks it up and blows it away into latitudes where the sea is warm enough to melt it.
The air temperatures blowing off the continent rise high enough (to just freezing) so that the ice blowing away is not immediately replaced as it is in the Antarctic winter. Ice flows off the continent not because it is melting, but because the pressure of two-mile-thick ice behind the edges is forcing it to flow. Average air temperatures at bases on the edge of the continent rise to just freezing in January despite 24 hours of daylight. This is why it can snow off-shore at the position of the trapped ship in late December. Rain is an extremely rare event anywhere in Antarctica except the peninsula.
No global warming – it’s over
As one can see from Figure 3, there is no global warming. It’s over. Both poles are now cooling, the tropics are cooling. Ice is increasing at both ends of the earth. Over the last eight years, there were a few isolated pockets of warming, a spot in the North Pacific, the Middle East, north-eastern North America, and off the west coast of Australia. Those spots are constantly shifting, and will soon go away.

"Over the past 20 years, Americans have been twice as likely to sweat through record-breaking heat rather than shiver through record-setting cold, a new Associated Press data analysis shows. The AP looked at 424 weather stations throughout the US lower 48 states that had consistent temperature records since 1920 and counted how many times daily hot temperature records were tied or broken and how many daily cold records were set. In a stable climate, the numbers should be roughly equal.  Since 1999, the ratio has been two warm records set or broken for every cold one. In 16 of the last 20 years, there have been more daily high temperature records than low. The AP shared the data analysis with several climate and data scientists, who all said the conclusion was correct, consistent with scientific peer-reviewed literature and showed a clear sign of human-caused climate change. They pointed out that trends over decades are more robust than over single years. The analysis stopped with data through 2018. However, the first two months of 2019 are showing twice as many cold records as hot ones. That is temporary and trends are over years and decades, not months, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate monitoring chief, Deke Arndt. “We are in a period of sustained and significant warming and over the long run will continue to explore and break the warm end of the spectrum much more than the cold end,” Arndt said. The former Weather Channel meteorologist Guy Walton, who has been studying hot and cold extreme records since 2000, said the trend is unmistakable. “You are getting more extremes,” Walton said. “Your chances for getting more dangerous extremes are going up with time.” One stark example is the southern California city of Pasadena, where 7,203 days went by between cold records being broken. On 23 February, Pasadena set a low temperature record, its first since 5 June 1999. Vermont native Paul Wennberg felt it. He moved to Pasadena in 1998 just before the dearth of cold records. “Even with the local cold we had this past month, it’s very noticeable,” said Wennberg, a California Institute of Technology atmospheric sciences professor. “It’s just been ever warmer.” In between the two cold record days, Pasadena set 145 hot records. That includes an all-time high of 113F last year. “Last year was unbelievable here,” Wennberg said. “The tops of a lot of the hedges, they essentially melted.” Scientists often talked about human-caused global warming in terms of average temperatures, but that is not what costs money or sends people to the hospital. A study this month found that in just 22 states, about 36,000 people on average go to the hospital because of excessive summertime heat. “The extremes affect our lives,” Arndt said, adding that they are expensive, with hospital stays, rising energy bills and crop losses. The AP counted daily records across 424 stations starting in 1920 and ending in 2018. The AP only considered daily not all-time high maximum temperatures and low minimum temperatures and only used stations with minimal missing data. More typical than Pasadena is Wooster, Ohio. From 1999 on, Wooster saw 106 high temperature records set or broken and 51 cold ones. In the previous eight decades, the ratio was slightly colder than one to one. In all, 87% of the weather stations had more hot records than cold since 1999. There have been 42 weather stations that have at least five hot records for every cold one since 1999, with 11 where the hot-to-cold ratio is 10-to-1 or higher, including Pasadena."

These are the results after the first month of blogging. The numbers have far surpassed my expectations.
The most activity came on April 24-27, after this climate blog was the first to report on the story we called: Russian Scientist: Expect Cooling – Pols Sitting On The Wrong Horse, hours before WUWT picked it up and linked to a botched UPI release. Ours was headlined almost 3 days at Marc Morano’s http://climatedepot.com/. In fact Climate Depot linked directly to 3 of our posts.
But I’m not doing this for the numbers. Rather, I’m focusing on finding interesting stories here in Europe that could otherwise go unreported. This is for fun and learning. Hope you keep dropping by.
