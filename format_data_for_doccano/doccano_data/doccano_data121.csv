" Britain said it wants deeper reforms to the EU Emissions Trading System than those proposed by the European Commission and Germany, favouring cancelling a “significant number” of carbon permits over launching a tool to regulate market supply.  In a report detailing its vision for the fourth phase of the EU ETS, which will run from 2021 to 2030, Britain said major changes to the system are needed to help businesses cut their greenhouse gas emissions, to protect them from foreign competitors, and to foster investment in low-carbon technology.  “The UK is asking for bold and comprehensive reforms to restore the ability of the EU ETS to drive cost-effective emission reduction and low-carbon investment,” Ed Davey, secretary of state for energy and climate change, said in a statement on Wednesday. The Commission, the European Union’s executive, in January proposed setting up a mechanism - dubbed the market stability reserve (MSR) - from 2021 to regulate the supply of allowances in the ETS, the bloc’s main weapon to combat climate change. As the only legislative proposal so far among wider recommendations to extend energy and climate goals to 2030, the MSR aims to expedite the shrinking of a surplus of more than 2 billion permits, which has knocked EU carbon prices to around 6 euros per tonne from more than 30 euros in 2008. But Britain has not formally backed the MSR. “The MSR can potentially help but it is not the comprehensive change we urgently need to tackle the surplus,” said a spokeswoman for Britain’s Department of Energy and Climate Change, adding that the government is studying the proposal.  Instead, Britain said it wants to cancel permanently a “significant number” of the surplus permits, without specifying a figure or range. The spokeswoman said the government is also weighing up a separate proposal from Germany to start the MSR in 2017, some four years earlier than proposed by the European Commission. Germany wants the 900 million allowances delayed from sale under the EU’s so-called backloading initiative to be put directly into the reserve, rather than gradually reintroducing them to the market as proposed by the Commission. UK-based experts backed Davey’s move. Damien Morris, head of policy at Sandbag, an NGO that campaigns on carbon markets, said: “This is a welcome and timely intervention from the British government. A wide range of stakeholders share the government’s view that the Commission’s proposal to fix the EU carbon market is not, by itself, sufficient to put the scheme on track to cost-effectively achieve Europe’s long-term climate goals.” Simon Moore, a senior research fellow at the thinktank Policy Exchange, said: “Cost-effective climate policy depends on putting a strong carbon price in place. The EU’s system could achieve this, but has so far been crippled by its design problems. Adopting the UK’s proposals would be a clear sign that Europe is committed to tackling climate change, and that it intends to do so in the most affordable manner.” Britain on Wednesday also called for an overhaul of EU rules expiring in 2020 that allow heavy industrial companies to get most of their carbon permits for free. In line with remarks in May by the Commission’s top climate official, Britain suggested the free permit provision should continue but that the list of eligible industries be trimmed and target only the most vulnerable sectors.

"For a garden water feature, most people make do with a fish pond. The well-to-do might run to a decorative fountain. Not Victoria Harrison. Rolling in and out beneath the floor of her dining room in medieval Itchen Stoke mill, she has almost a mile of one of England’s clearest, purest and – especially in the heat of last week – coolest streams.  “This is so wonderful, we hate to keep it to ourselves,” she says as we cross the rickety wooden bridge across her stream and onto the meadows. We gaze down at wild trout and grayling loitering among dark mats of Ranunculus weeds, looking for mayflies hatching among the gravel beds in the shallow stream. Dragonflies hover above. “We love to share all this. We had six school groups here last term.”   The river is the Itchen, which rises nearby in a shady roadside pond amid the downland of Hampshire north of Winchester, the ancient capital of Wessex. The river is probably the best example of one of the most remarkable - yet least remarked - features of the English countryside: chalk streams. Nobody does this better. Geographers say there are only 210 true chalk streams anywhere in the world, and 160 of them are in England. You can find them draining chalk hills from the River Hull in Yorkshire, through the Chilterns and North and South Downs to the Piddle in Dorset. The Hampshire Itchen, the nearby Test, the Lambourn in Berkshire, the Wensum in Norfolk, the Darent in Kent, the Frome in Somerset and many more are, ecologically, England’s rainforests. They are our unique contribution to global ecology.  Bubbling up out of thousands of springs, chalk streams collect first in ponds and then ripple over gravel beds through chalk hills towards the sea. They are typically wide, shallow and crystal clear, their alkaline waters pure thanks to the constant purifying and filtering in the chalk. They are an irreplaceable relic of our past, created as the ice sheets retreated from England 10,000 years ago. The gushing flows from melting ice brought huge quantities of the distinctive gravels that still occupy their beds and determine their ecology. “Never since have these rivers had sufficient energy to significantly alter their location, shape or size,” says Southampton University geographer Trevor Bond.  Chalk streams are centre stage in many of our best-loved images of perfect England. The Kennett, a major tributary of the River Thames in Wiltshire, flows past Wiltshire’s Silbury Hill, a man-made mound as old as the Egyptian pyramids, and on to Avebury’s stone circle.  Painter John Constable famously portrayed the Hampshire Avon and its water meadows in front of Salisbury cathedral. Kenneth Grahame’s Wind in the Willows was set on a chalk stream. Poet Sir John Betjeman wrote of the Kennett: “When trout waved lazy in the clear chalk streams, Glory was in me ...” Fishermen love chalk streams, especially fly fishermen. Fly fishing to catch trout was invented on the Itchen, centuries ago. Ecologists also love chalk streams. Rare species abound along these waters, including the southern damselfly, one of Europe’s most endangered insects, otters, kingfishers, the white-clawed crayfish and plants like the river-water crowfoot. As we walk Victoria’s meadow, a heron takes off from the rushes. Hereabouts too are lapwings, redshanks, barn owls and snipe. Back on the river, her black Labrador rapidly retreats from the water when a swan stops off from nibbling the weeds to hiss at it. A pair of otters now live here, after recently being reintroduced. But, just in the past three years, Victoria reports that water voles, which were once frequent, have disappeared.  The water meadows of chalk streams don’t just serve ecology. During last winter’s torrential rains, when they were putting up sandbags to protect homes in central Winchester from the Itchen’s rising waters, capturing water on upstream meadows such as Victoria’s helped slow the flow and reduce the flood peaks.  You would think we would long since have decided to take proper care of these treasures. But no, says Rose O’Neill, freshwater campaigner for WWF. Threats come from farmers and the demands of water companies and their customers – that is to say, us. And existing laws don’t work well in many places – something she blames on the main enforcement agency, the Environment Agency, which is increasingly hamstrung by political pressure to put jobs and cheap water charges first.  However, there is a growing movement to protect this half-forgotten heritage. NGOs such as WWF, along with anglers groups, last year formed the Chalk Stream Charter. It is demanding full legal protection for all chalk streams, says O’Neill. The Itchen has, in theory, copper-bottomed protection. It is listed under the EC’s habitats directive as a special area of conservation, as well as being a site of special scientific interest. Yet, only a couple of miles upstream of Victoria’s 18th-century mill, the waters of the Itchen are diverted for some of the country’s largest watercress farms, which together abstract almost 100m litres of water a day.  On the face of it, that’s fine. Watercress grows wild in the local chalk streams, and the farmed beds look rather like industrialised versions of chalk streams, with their shallow pools lined with gravel and constantly irrigated with sparkling river water. Its job done, most of the water then runs back into the river.  The trouble is that the beds are fertilised with nitrogen and phosphorus that change the streams chemistry and encourage the growth of blooms of algae. Worse, Harrison says as she leads us on a journey to find the evidence, the watercress companies have grown so big that they now bring salad vegetables from all over Europe to wash in the stream waters prior to packing. “These huge trucks come here, driving through our lanes, to wash foreign salad in water from our stream,” she says. This hasn’t killed the river by any means. It is still “as clear as gin”, as they say in these parts. But it isn’t as pure as it might be. The fertilisers are changing the river.  A threat that looms even larger, and that is shared by most of England’s chalk streams, is water abstraction. The streams are fed by springs that release water stored and purified in the chalk hills. Those hills are immense water stores – bigger than any manmade reservoir. That should mean the springs are unceasing and the rivers flows constant, even in the driest summer. Traditionally, chalk streams have been much less variable than others that rely on the rains. But with densely populated southeast England pumping two-thirds of its water from underground, usually from chalk, the water tables in the hills are falling. When the level sinks below the points where the springs emerge, the chalk streams dry up, killing their unique ecosystems.  We are turning off nature’s tap. The Environment Agency has 37 chalk streams on its endangered list because of over-abstraction, almost a quarter of the total. Many are shadows of their former selves.  The Chiltern Hills, whose springs supply the Mimram and Bean in Hertfordshire, both tributaries of the River Lea, are heavily overpumped, and the upper reaches of these two precious rivers regularly dry up in summer. The Mimram dried up for most of its length during the dry summer of 2005. Some life returns when the flows resume, but fish stocks have not recovered, and nor have otters.  The Mimram once had water mills its entire length and a century ago still rivalled the Itchen for wildlife. But expanding nearby new towns like Stevenage and Welwyn Garden City are sucking it dry.  This summer, most chalk streams are still flowing well, because last winter’s record rains topped up the underground water reserves. But a couple of dry winters would change that. As a recent WWF report on Britain’s waterways, Rivers on the Edge, put it: “When once our small chalk streams would have survived a drought, today the same conditions can finish them off.” In the past, when there were lower rates of abstraction, the water tables would have remained high enough during the drought for the springs to persist and the water to keep flowing. But now, if the winter level starts lower, due to greater abstraction and climate change, then the risk of it drying out in a dry summer is increased. As with the Mimram, the flow will probably resume when the drought ends. But, as with the Mimram, the long-term effects on wildlife - the fish, and fish eating predators like otters - are not easily reversed.  Further downstream from Victoria, the local water company, Southern Water, takes water direct from the Itchen at Otterbourne. More than 300,000 homes in Winchester, Southampton and around get their tap water from the river. Otterbourne is where human demands and the needs of the river come into sharp conflict. And the river is losing.  A decade ago, in its first detailed review of England’s chalk streams, the Environment Agency concluded that Hampshire sometimes took too much water out of the Itchen. Below a flow of 237m litres a day in the lower river (the normal river flow is considerably higher, but this is the kind of level they get down to in dry summers) mayflies and shrimps rapidly disappeared, with knock-on effects through the river’s food chain.  Such low flows will probably happen with increasing frequency as climate change gathers pace. Nobody knows for sure, but it is likely to make summer droughts longer and hotter, with chalk streams running dry more often and over much greater lengths, leaving fish stranded. The EA told Southern Water to reduce abstractions by putting in a pipe linking the nearby River Test, another chalk stream that is used less, to the Itchen water treatment works at Otterbourne. But the plan has not gone ahead, says O'Neill. Some EA scientists, she says, have concluded that it could damage the Test. There should be a better way to save the Itchen. But what?  One option, done in many other places, is to replace direct river abstractions with pumping water direct from the hills. But since the hills are ultimately the source of the water in the rivers, the effect is no more than to camouflage the continued plundering of nature’s most vital resource. And meanwhile, the deadline for “saving” the lower Itchen, originally set at 2015, is slipping by.  Is there a chalk stream near you? Let us know your thoughts below.

"Fred Pearce (So a fracking battle begins, but is it clear who is right?, 30 July) states that: “Given the choice between a wind turbine on the hill or a fracking well in a nearby field, many would choose the latter, whatever the climate equation.” This is simply not supported by the evidence. The latest public survey by the Department of Energy and Climate Change found that 70% of the public support onshore wind, compared to 29% supporting fracking. In addition, a recent ComRes poll, commissioned by RenewableUK, found only 13% surveyed supported fracking to deliver the UK’s energy security, compared to 48% for renewable energy. Many polls have asked people what type of generation they would prefer locally, and renewable energy options, including onshore wind, come out ahead of other options such as fracking. Across the UK people understand that we need onshore wind to help keep the lights on, reduce energy imports and get to grips with climate change. This is why support for onshore wind is on the increase.Maf SmithDeputy chief executive, RenewableUK  • The gallant Fred Pearce, who has worked so hard over the years to warn his readers of the dangers of climate change, should surely have referred to his excellent The Last Generation (2006), before committing himself to near-advocacy of fracking as a decent halfway house to climate change mitigation in the UK. To quote Mr Pearce, in his appendix to this book: “… if we are also concerned about having a quick hit on global warming to stave off more immediate disaster, then there is a strong case for acting hard on methane now – on leaks from landfills, gas pipe lines, coal mines, the guts of ruminants and much else.” As Mr Pearce knows, the main constituent of fracked gas is this same methane, which is now known to leak seriously from virtually all fracking installations. Nimbyism notwithstanding, there is still a strong case to be made for UK wind power, onshore and offshore, and for hydrogen, its electrolytically derived daughter energy store, which would fulfil the same fuel functions as natural gas.Mike KoefmanPlanet Hydrogen"

"Climate change is easily the most confounding 'collective action' problem we have ever faced. We must act – collectively – in the best interests of not only today's global population, but also the presumed interests of people yet to be born. It follows that nurturing a sense of shared identity – what is sometimes called social capital, or the elusive but ubiquitous concept of community – should make people more receptive to appeals for collective global action on climate change.  But a new report from the Fabian Society takes this argument one step further. According to the report's authors, Natan Doron and Ed Wallis, people instinctively think of the environment not in terms of carbon emissions and climate change, but in terms of the place where they live and the people who live there. For most people, protecting the environment starts at their front door, not with an internationally binding global agreement on dangerous climate change. Anti-social behaviour is the biggest concern, with climate change ranking alongside dog-fouling and littering. People feel that citizenship has declined, and that opportunities for working together are limited. However, the report argues that if people feel they are able to participate in and improve their local environment, they are more likely to support the global aims of environmental campaigns. If they think they can change things in their own back yard, they are more likely to think they can change the world. Their findings echo other research which suggests that people's sense of ""place attachment"" (which is as much about the local community and social cohesion as it is about physical geography) is a key influence on their views about climate change and other environmental issues. It has also long been recognised that reducing the psychological distance between people and climate change is an important challenge. So long as climate change remains a remote and abstract issue, it is easy to close our eyes and wish it away. Doron and Wallis make some bold recommendations for overhauling the way in which climate change campaigners operate. They suggest that the quickest way to get support for ambitious action on climate change globally is for campaigners to switch a proportion of their budgets away from lobbying international negotiations and towards supporting community organising to improve local environments. To build a popular environmentalism, they argue, global issues such as climate change must be brought back to the doorsteps of ordinary people, where tangible, local action on the environment can be seen to be working. They even propose a new bank holiday, to be held in the middle of the working week, which would focus national attention on community action and ""provide a focal point for campaigners to highlight local environmental projects on a large scale and generate widespread media attention, as well as an opportunity to reach out beyond the 'usual suspects'."" The basic logic of the recommendations – that climate change begins at home – is reflected in the newly launched For the Love Of campaign (which my colleagues and I at COIN worked on). Our research found that people from a range of different backgrounds (including conservatives and trade union members) responded positively to a narrative about climate change that focused on standing up for the ""things people love"" that are threatened by climate change. The video for the campaign shows a diverse range of people and the issues they are passionate about, from football, to gardening, to summertime. Flooded football pitches, disrupted growing seasons and increased summer rainstorms provide a direct link between climate change and people's passion. It's a powerful demonstration of the principle that global change has local effects. Clearly there are potential hazards in the ""go local"" approach. For a start, there is a risk of trivialising world-wide problems like climate change by homing in on individuals' everyday concerns. Wouldn't it be better to get people thinking about the big issues – the poverty and malnourishment that climate change will bring – rather than the minutiae of the issue? But, for better or for worse, these issues are not top of mind for most of us, most of the time. This doesn't mean that people are oblivious to them, but that a conversation about climate change must build a bridge between concerns about the local environment (or the everyday things that people love) and the global dimensions of environmental change. The lesson from the Fabian Society report is that building community cohesion, nurturing a sense of collective action around local environmental issues, and supporting micro rather than macro concerns can be a portal through which a more global sense of citizenship can be achieved. Groups such as the Transition Towns network have been saying this for quite a long time, but have not yet been able to break into the mainstream. Perhaps a new bank holiday to celebrate the virtues of linking local community action to global campaigns would do the trick: confronting climate change, 'for the love of' a day off...

"Australia could end the disadvantage endured by its Indigenous population by opening up traditional lands as dumping sites for nuclear waste from around the world, a former prime minister, Bob Hawke, has said. Hawke said he was confident that the answer to long-standing indigenous socioeconomic problems was to allow radioactive waste to be stored on Aboriginal land, and use the revenue to improve living standards.  Speaking at the Indigenous Garma festival in the Northern Territory, Hawke said he had met Adam Giles, the territory’s chief minister, to discuss the idea and had got a favourable response. “We need to do something substantial to finally eliminate these disgraceful gaps in well-being and lifetime opportunities,” Hawke said. “I have no hesitation whatsoever in putting the situation in very specific terms because I believe I have the answer. “I’ve discussed this proposal with Adam Giles, who tells me he’s been approached by a number of elders who, like himself, are keenly supportive of the proposal.” Despite having some of the largest deposits of uranium in the world, Australia has maintained a long-standing opposition to nuclear power and storing radioactive waste from overseas. In June, traditional Indigenous owners in Muckaty Station, north of Tennant Creek, triumphed in a seven-year battle to stop domestic nuclear waste being dumped on their land. The site was officially nominated for radioactive dumping but four different clans claimed they had not been consulted and that the site was near a sacred area. The Northern Land Council, which made the nomination, relented amid a challenge in the federal court. Hawke, who was prime minister between 1983 and 1991, said any nuclear waste dumping would need Indigenous leaders’ full consent, but he stressed that the solution would give Australia “the capacity for substantial new expenditure on indigenous Australians”. He said that towards the end of his premiership in 1991, he asked the then chief scientist, Ralph Slatyer, to investigate the possibility of storing nuclear waste in remote locations in Australia. The report found that “Australia has the safest remote geological formations in the world for this purpose, in the Northern Territory and, to some extent, in Western Australia”, Hawke said. “Our friends in the environmental movement say the challenge of climate change is a global one requiring international co-operation, and they are right,” he said. “With Australia having the safest nuclear disposal sites in the world, we have a responsibility and obligation to make these sites available for this purpose. “In creating a safer energy cycle for a world threatened by global warming, we would not only be doing good for the rest of the world, we would be doing enormous good for Australia as the world would pay handsomely for this service. “In other words, we make the world a safer place, we earn an enormous amount of new money, and we use that money to help close these unacceptable gaps between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.” Dave Sweeney, a nuclear-free campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said Hawke’s proposal was a “bloody disgrace”. “Here you’ve got a privileged white man standing up saying this rubbish should be dumped on systematically disadvantaged people’s land,” he told Guardian Australia. “It’s offensive and it’s dumb. “For more than 20 years Aboriginal communities at multiple sites in South Australia and the NT have mobilised and defeated federal government plans for a national radioactive waste dump on their country, most recently at Muckaty. To think that they will accept an international dump is fanciful. “To put forward that the best way to address the shameful state of the economic and structural disadvantage of the world’s oldest continuing culture is through hosting the world’s worst industrial wastes is a profound and perpetual policy failure.” In his Garma speech, Hawke said he was “sick and tired” of the impasse in improving the fortunes of Indigenous people. He said he was saddened that he was never able to strike a treaty with Indigenous people while he was prime minister, but he said he fully supported the present move to recognise Aboriginal heritage in the constitution."
"Refrigerant gases have apparently been struck out of the carbon tax repeal bill’s legal requirement for price cuts to be passed on to consumers, even though they were at the centre of the Abbott opposition’s dire warnings about price hikes. As opposition leader, Tony Abbott repeatedly warned that big increases in the cost of refrigerant gases would flow straight through to the price of food and other goods. “It is a hit on their refrigerant costs. Refrigerant gases are going up almost five times under the carbon tax and every supermarket, every refrigerated manufacturer and processor is going to be hit that way,” Abbott said in July 2012, as he travelled the country on his anti-carbon tax campaign. In May 2012, he visited a Canberra food wholesaler, Frozpak, and said the business was facing a triple whammy, because “the carbon tax hits their power costs; it hits their transport costs and it hits their refrigerant costs, and that’s why so much of the staples of our daily life are going to be significantly more expensive under the tax.” At the same event, the then shadow environment minister, Greg Hunt, said the business was “living proof that it’s not big businesses but it is small, family businesses that are going to pay the carbon tax”. “The cost of their refrigerant alone is almost going to triple. It’s not a small increase; the cost of the good itself is almost going to triple under the carbon tax. The costs for Frozpak are likely to be in the vicinity of $60,000 a year extra.”  Also in May 2012, Abbott visited food distributors PFD Food Services and said: “First of all, power costs will go up by an estimated 20% and then, of course, there’s the carbon tax that’s coming in on transport in 2014 if this government is re-elected and, finally, there’s the massive carbon tax on refrigerants, which are vital to a business such as this.” But after a backlash by business to the Palmer United party’s amendments to the carbon tax repeal bills, it appears that refrigerant gases (or so-called synthetic gases) are to be removed from the list of regulated supply goods – namely, goods for which suppliers are required, by law, to pass through cost savings and who are subject to hefty penalties if they do not. Only electricity and gas producers are now left on the list. Synthetic gases now apparently join other goods, like food and airline tickets, over which the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) only has the power to act if a company makes a “false and misleading statement” about the effect of the carbon tax on its prices. It does not have the power to force companies to show how savings from the carbon tax repeal have been passed on, and to fine them if they have not been passed on. The chaotic scenes in the Senate on Thursday occurred after the PUP leader, Clive Palmer, made last-minute changes to an amendment to the repeal bills, significantly tightening the requirements and penalties for suppliers of electricity, gas and synthetic gases. Business lobbyists such as the Australian Industry Group warned the changes placed overly onerous requirements on those supplying and selling refrigerant gases. On Sunday, Hunt said he was confident he had reached a deal with the PUP on the amendment that would mean the repeal bills would pass both houses of parliament this week. However, he has also indicated that he will call PUP’s bluff and bring on a vote if there are any more last-minute hiccups, given the government’s severe embarrassment and Palmer’s changes last week. Abbott’s campaign as opposition leader also claimed that the carbon tax would add about 5% to the cost of food. Supermarkets like Woolworths are now saying that because very few prices actually went up when the tax was introduced, few would now be coming down. Speaking on Adelaide radio on Friday, Hunt claimed supermarkets and airlines could be fined by the ACCC if they did not remove a carbon tax impost from their prices when the tax is repealed. “The law is, if a company had added the price of the carbon tax then they have to take it off, or the ACCC will come after them with $1.1m fines, and that includes supermarkets, airlines; that includes landfill operators, not to mention electricity and gas,” he said. A partner with the multinational law firm Norton Rose Fulbright in Melbourne, Elisa de Wit, told Guardian Australia the statement was “erroneous”. “Companies such as supermarkets, airlines … [and] landfill operators are presently under absolutely no legal obligation to take off the price of carbon, if and when the existing legislation is repealed,” she said. “They merely need to ensure that they do not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct, or make any false or misleading statements about their prices.”"
"Predicting global surface temperature changes in the short-term is a challenge for climate models. Temperature changes over periods of a decade or two can be dominated by influences from ocean cycles like El Niño and La Niña. During El Niño phases, the oceans absorb less heat, leaving more to warm the atmosphere, and the opposite is true during a La Niña. We can't yet predict ahead of time how these cycles will change. The good news is that it doesn't matter from a big picture climate perspective, because over the long-term, temperature influences from El Niño and La Niña events cancel each other out. However, when we examine how climate model projections have performed over the past 15 years or so, those natural cycles make a big difference.  A new paper led by James Risbey just out in Nature Climate Change takes a clever approach to evaluating how accurate climate model temperature predictions have been while getting around the noise caused by natural cycles. The authors used a large set of simulations from 18 different climate models (from CMIP5). They looked at each 15-year period since the 1950s, and compared how accurately each model simulation had represented El Niño and La Niña conditions during those 15 years, using the trends in what's known as the Niño3.4 index. Each individual climate model run has a random representation of these natural ocean cycles, so for every 15-year period, some of those simulations will have accurately represented the actual El Niño conditions just by chance. The study authors compared the simulations that were correctly synchronized with the ocean cycles (blue data in the left frame below) and the most out-of-sync (grey data in the right frame) to the observed global surface temperature changes (red) for each 15-year period. The authors conclude, When the phase of natural variability is taken into account, the model 15-year warming trends in CMIP5 projections well estimate the observed trends for all 15-year periods over the past half-century. It's also clear from the grey figure that models that are out-of-sync with the observed changes in these ocean cycles simulate dramatically higher warming trends over the past 30 years. In other words, the model simulations that happened not to accurately represent these ocean cycles were the ones that over-predicted global surface warming. The claim that climate models are unreliable is the 6th-most popular contrarian myth. The argument is generally based on the claim that climate models didn't predict the slowdown in global surface warming over the past 15 years. That's in large part because during that time, we've predominantly experienced La Niña conditions. Climate modelers couldn't predict that ahead of time, but the models that happened to accurately simulate those conditions also accurately predicted the amount of global surface warming we've experienced. Yu Kosaka and Shang-Ping Xie from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography published a paper in Nature last year taking a similar approach to that of Risbey and colleagues. In that study, the authors ran climate model simulations in which they incorporated the observed Pacific Ocean sea surface temperature changes, essentially forcing the models to accurately reflect the influence from these ocean cycles. When they did that, the authors found that the models simulated the observed global surface temperature changes remarkably well. The results of these studies give us two important pieces of information: The second point is supported by many recent studies finding that unprecedentedly strong Pacific trade winds have been churning the ocean and funneling more heat to the deeper layers, leaving less to warm the surface. All signs point to this being a temporary change, and once the oceans begin to switch back to more frequent El Niño conditions, we expect to see less efficient ocean heat absorption leading to accelerated warming of global surface temperatures. It's unfortunate that in the meantime, people who don't understand how the climate or modeling work have used the surface warming slowdown to incorrectly argue that climate models aren't reliable and that global warming is nothing to worry about. This new study shows once again that climate models are indeed reliable, and if we don't soon act to slow down human-caused global warming and the risks it poses, we're likely headed for a very bleak future."
"A predicted 40% decline in rainfall in southern Australia could mean that the West Australian capital, Perth, will have to rely on alternative sources of water in future, a new climate change research paper warns.  The study, led by an academic at the US’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, examined the causes of rainfall decline in southern Australia over the past few decades and concluded that human activity was a significant contributor.  The findings, published in the journal Nature, say that increases in greenhouse gases and ozone in the Earth's atmosphere are responsible for suppressing rainfall. Other measured factors, such as aerosol particles, are not as significant. “Simulations of future climate with this model suggest amplified winter drying over most parts of southern Australia in the coming decades in response to a high-end scenario of changes in radiative forcing,” it states. “The drying is most pronounced over south-west Australia, with total reductions in austral autumn and winter precipitation of approximately 40% by the late 21st century.” The Perth area is particularly vulnerable to these predicted rainfall changes because most of its rainfall occurs between May and September. This winter rainfall largely arises from wind and storm patterns that bring moist air from areas such as the Indian Ocean. Previous studies suggest that trapped heat in the atmosphere, driven by the release of carbon emissions, is changing this weather pattern, pushing the Roaring Forties’ system further south. This means that Perth, and to a lesser extent Adelaide and Melbourne, faces far lower rainfall because of climate change. The ramifications for Perth are stark, a climate scientist at Melbourne University, David Karoly, told Guardian Australia. “Things are going to get a lot worse for Perth,” he said. “They are already seeing the impact of reduced rainfall and the future will see an additional doubling of the decline they’ve already seen. “The rainfall flow into Perth reservoirs has already reduced by up to 75% over the past 50 years. This study gives us much greater confidence that this was down to human-induced climate change. “The only way for Perth to continue as a city is to find alternative water sources because a further large decline in rainfall will mean they won’t have enough water to supply their current population.” Karoly said the lack of rain, which will also severely affect the winemaking region of Margaret River, and other agriculture in Western Australia, will confront future governments with some difficult decisions.  ""The WA government has already developed two water desalination plants in response to the drop in rainfall we’ve already seen,” he said. “If Perth shifts to getting its water primarily from desalination, they have a dilemma. Desal plants need a lot of energy; they are sometimes described as liquid electricity. There isn’t enough renewable energy currently in WA to power lots of desal plants, so by powering them by fossil fuel electricity they make the problem worse.” Nerilie Abram, a climate research fellow at the Australian National University's College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, said the study paints a “very worrying picture” for parts of Australia. “This new study adds another compelling piece of evidence to the idea that we can expect southern parts of Australia to keep getting drier over the coming century, unless strong action can be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” she said. “The impacts to Australia of the westerly winds pulling in tighter around Antarctica won’t just be seen in changes to our rainfall patterns. These winds are also warming the oceans around the edges of Antarctica, causing the margins of the large ice sheets to melt, and this is expected to have big implications for how quickly sea level will rise over the coming centuries.”"

"The coalition’s flagship insulation programmes have failed to put the UK on the right track to meet its commitments on cutting greenhouse gases, a review by the statutory advisers on climate change has found. The number of cavity wall insulations – one of the most effective measures for cutting energy use – has plunged by more than two-thirds owing to a change in government schemes to encourage insulation. The judgement is the first clear statutory assessment of the “green deal” and “energy company obligation”, the government’s twin schemes to cut energy wastage by investing in efficiency measures for domestic properties, and has found both wanting.  The green deal, under which householders can apply for loans to provide their homes with energy-savings installations such as insulation, has long been criticised for failing to attract enough takers, partly because the cost of paying back the loans is so high.  The energy company obligation, under which the big six energy generators and others had to provide insulation to a large number of households in social housing and vulnerable situations, was also drastically changed by the current government, resulting in a far lesser obligation on the companies. If policies remain the same, the UK will cut carbon dioxide emissions by only about 21% to 23% from 2013 to 2025, compared with the government’s own targets of a reduction of 31% over the same period, according to the Committee on Climate Change, the body set up under the Climate Change Act to provide independent advice to ministers on how to meet carbon targets. Adrian Gault, of the CCC, told the Guardian that the interest rate currently charged on homes wishing to make improvements such as loft or cavity wall insulation, or double glazing, should be halved to about 3.5% in order to attract takers. The current scheme, under which householders can take out long term loans of as much as 25 years with interest rates of as much as 8%, rather than receive grants or other incentives, as under previous schemes, has resulted in a substantial decline in the number of people gaining insulation, according to recent research. The CCC reported on Tuesday that progress on energy efficiency had “plummeted”– for instance, more than 600,000 cavity walls were insulated in 2012 but only 170,000 were in 2013. The authors of the CCC report said the green deal and ECO schemes should be altered to provide more of incentive to people to take up the opportunities, which account for a large slice of the UK’s ability to cut emissions. Climate change campaigners said the report showed the government was not on track to meet its obligations.  Simon Bullock, senior climate change campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The wettest winter on record should be a wake-up call that the impacts of climate change are already battering Britain, and without tougher action they will only get worse.” He quoted the CCC report in saying that the investment in measures to lower greenhouse gas emissions could provide a boost to the UK economy. But he warned that ministers, instead of pursuing these advantages, were “sleeping at the helm”. UK carbon emissions have stalled in recent years after two decades of falling, owing in part to the use of coal rather than gas in power generation. Coal has been cheap because the US has been using a lot less of it, as it has turned to indigenously-produced shale gas, but in the EU it will be curtailed as regulations on other emissions from coal-fired power stations bite. Paul King, chief executive of the UK’s Green Building Council, added: “While the government has clearly made good progress on some of its efforts to cut carbon, the [report] exposes the lack of headway on on energy efficiency within our buildings – and, in particular, an unravelling of the previous good work on home energy efficiency. Time is running out.” In a statement, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ""The Climate Change Committee recognises the good progress we have made in many areas with emissions now around 24% lower than in 1990 and renewables producing 15% of all the UK’s electricity generation. By cleaning our power supply, making homes and businesses more energy efficient and driving low carbon growth across industry we are confident the UK’s carbon emissions will continue to fall at an increasing rate."""

"Climate change is the most serious threat to the Great Barrier Reef, according to a major new report. Warmer ocean currents are also likely to remain a threat to the Queensland coral ecosystem for many years, the Great Barrier Reef Outlook Report 2014 said.  “It is already affecting the reef and is likely to have far-reaching consequences in the decades to come,” the 300-page report said. Climate change remains the reef’s biggest threat, despite improvements since the last report five years ago. While the northern third of the reef enjoys good water quality, other areas are in jeopardy. “Key habitats, species and ecosystems in the central and southern inshore areas continued to deteriorate,” the report said. Poor water quality from land-based run-off, coastal development and fishing remain concerns. But the report noted progress in the rising numbers of humpback whales, estuarine crocodiles and loggerhead turtles. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has prepared the report with contributions from Australian and Queensland government agencies and scientists. “More needs to be done at reef-wide, regional and local scales,” it said. The report came ahead of the United Nations’ world heritage committee decision, due in 2015, on whether to give the reef “in danger” status. At its annual meeting in June, Unesco decided it would give Australia until 1 Feburary next year to prove it was looking after the reef."

"Governments are failing to take advantage of a potent opportunity to counter climate change by strengthening local land tenure rights and laws, data suggests. Analysis suggests that in areas formally overseen by local communities, deforestation rates are dozens to hundreds of times lower than in areas overseen by governments or private entities. About 10-20% of global greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to deforestation each year.  The findings were released by the World Resources Institute (WRI), a thinktank, and the Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI), a global network that focuses on forest tenure. ""This approach to mitigating climate change has long been undervalued,"" a report detailing the analysis says. ""Governments, donors and other climate change stakeholders tend to ignore or marginalise the enormous contribution to mitigating climate change that expanding and strengthening communities' forest rights can make."" Researchers were able to comb through high-definition satellite imagery and correlate findings on deforestation rates with data on differing tenure approaches in 14 developing countries considered heavily forested. Those areas with significant forest rights vested in local communities were found to be far more successful at slowing forest clearing, including the incursion of settlers and mining companies. In Guatemala and Brazil, strong local tenure resulted in deforestation rates 11-20 times lower than outside of formally recognised community forests. In parts of the Mexican Yucatan, the findings were even starker – 350 times lower. The climate implications of these forests are significant. Standing, mature forests not only hold massive amounts of carbon, but they also suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. ""We know that at least 500m hectares [1.2bn acres] of forest in developing countries are already in the hands of local communities, translating to a bit less than 40bn tonnes of carbon,"" Andy White, coordinator of RRI, said. ""That's a huge amount – 30 times the amount of total emissions from all passenger vehicles around the world. But much of the rights to protect those forests are weak, so there's a real risk that we could lose those forests and that carbon."" White says there has been a massive slowdown in the recognition of indigenous and other community rights over the past half-decade, despite earlier global headway on the issue. But he sees significant potential to link land rights with momentum on climate change in the minds of policymakers and the donor community. ""In developing country forests, you have this history of governments promoting deforestation for agriculture but also opening up forests through roads and the promotion of colonisation and mining,"" White said. ""At the same time, these same governments are now trying to talk about climate change, saying they're concerned about reducing emissions. To date, these two hands haven't been talking to each other."" The findings come before two major climate summits. In September, the UN secretary general will host international leaders in New York to discuss the issue; in December, the next round of global climate negotiations will take place in Peru, before intended agreement next year. The Lima talks are being referred to as the forest round. Some observers have suggested that forestry could offer the most significant potential for global emissions cuts, but few have directly connected this potential with local tenure. ""The international community hasn't taken this link nearly as far as it can go, and it's important that policymakers are made aware of this connection,"" Caleb Stevens, a rights specialist at the WRI and the report's principle author, said. ""Developed country governments can commit to development assistance agencies to strengthen forest tenure as part of bilateral agreements. They can also commit to strengthen these rights through finance mechanisms like the new green climate fund."" The best-known, if contentious, international mechanism aimed at reducing deforestation is the UN's Redd+ initiative, which since 2008 has dispersed nearly $200m to safeguard forests in developing countries. Yet critics say the programme has never fully embraced the potential of community forest management. ""Redd+ was established because it is well known that deforestation is a significant part of the climate change problem,"" Tony LaVina, the lead forest and climate negotiator for the Philippines, said. ""What is not as widely understood is how effective forest communities are at protecting their forest from deforestation and increasing forest health. This is why Redd+ must be accompanied by community safeguards."" Stevens says prioritisation of local tenure is a ""mixed bag"", varying significantly from country to country. He points to progress being made in Liberia and Kenya, where laws are being reformed to recognise community rights, as well as in Bolivia and Nepal, where about 40% of forests are legally under community control. Indonesia could be on a similar path after a court ruling last year. ""Many governments are still quite reluctant to stop their attempts to access minerals and other resources,"" Stevens said. ""But some governments realise the limitations of their capacity – that this model of government-owned and -managed forests usually doesn't work. Instead, it often creates an open-access free-for-all."" Not only are local communities often more effective at managing such resources than governments or private entities, but they can also become significant economic beneficiaries of those forests, eventually even contributing to national coffers through tax revenues. Certainly there is scope for such an expansion. RRI estimates that the 500m hectares under community control constitute a third of what communities around the world are actively – and, according to the group, legitimately – claiming. ""The world should rapidly scale up recognition of local forest rights even if they only care about the climate – even if they don't care about the people, about water, women, biodiversity,"" White said. ""People do care about all of these other issues. That's why a strategy of strengthening local forest rights is so important and a no-brainer – it will deliver for the climate as well as reduce poverty."""
"Efforts to reduce aviation carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will be outweighed by the growth in air passengers, according to new research. Plane ticket prices would need to rise by at least 1.4% a year for emission levels to fall, the research by the University of Southampton said.  But such a rise would buck the recent trend of lower air fares, said the authors of the research. They said that even if proposed mitigation measures were agreed upon and put into place, air traffic growth rates were likely to outpace emission reductions, unless demand was substantially reduced. The research’s co-author Professor John Preston said: “There is little doubt that increasing demand for air travel will continue for the foreseeable future. “As a result, civil aviation is going to become an increasingly significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.” The authors of the new study, which has been published in the journal Atmospheric Environment, have calculated that the ticket price increase necessary to drive down demand would value CO2 emissions at up to 100 times the amount of current valuations. “This would translate to a yearly 1.4% increase on ticket prices, breaking the trend of increasing lower airfares,” said co-author and researcher Matt Grote. He went on: “The price of domestic tickets has dropped by 1.3% a year between 1979 and 2012, and international fares have fallen by 0.5% a year between 1990 and 2012.” The research suggested any move to suppress demand would be resisted by the airline industry and national governments. The researchers say a global regulator “with teeth” is urgently needed to enforce CO2 emission reduction measures. “Some mitigation measures can be left to the aviation sector to resolve,” said Prof Ian William, the head of the Centre for Environmental Science at the University of Southampton. He went on: “For example, the industry will continue to seek improvements to fuel efficiency as this will reduce costs. However, other essential measures, such as securing international agreements, setting action plans, regulations and carbon standards will require political leadership at a global level.” The research suggested that the UN body the International Civil Aviation Organisation “lacks the legal authority to force compliance and therefore is heavily reliant on voluntary co-operation and piecemeal agreements”."
"Climate change may threaten Australians’ livelihoods, affect the viability of communities and put pressure on social stability, the co-chairman of a thinktank hoping to influence public health responses has warned. Emeritus professor Bruce Armstrong, of the University of Sydney’s school of public health, told Guardian Australia the issue was both publicly and scientifically important. “Whatever some people might think, global warming is occurring and the climate is changing and it is easy to see how health can be impacted, but until now there has been a relatively small scientific contribution into these health impacts. “People tend to look at climate change as just temperatures getting a little hotter and that being something they can manage. They don’t seriously see the impacts that will flow from a small increase in the average temperature where the net effect will be enormous.” The Australian Academy of Science brought together 60 “early- and mid-career” scientists and researchers in Brisbane, hoping to influence how policymakers and governments respond to the impacts of climate change on public health. It asked them to tackle the complex interactions between increasing weather extremes and the impacts on health. The think-tank was organised into groups examining five key areas: temperature and extreme weather events, infectious disease, food and water supplies, livelihood and disadvantage, and security, social instability and conflict. Each group spent two days analysing the key challenges in each area before making early recommendations to be translated into a report later in the year. Armstrong said climate change had the potential to affect health directly through heatwaves and extreme weather, and indirectly through increases in the prevalence of certain diseases if, for example, public sanitation was compromised due to floods. In an introduction, the president of the academy, Professor Andrew Holmes, wrote that the “impact of climate change on health and wellbeing is likely to be profound”. “It’s been challenging,” said Monash University climate scientist Dr Ailie Gallant, one of the researchers asked to look at the impacts of climate change on future food and water supplies. “We looked at everything from physical science issues such as the transport of pathogens in water supplies to future conflict issues.” Earlier this year World Bank President Jim Yong Kim warned: “Fights over water and food are going to be the most significant direct impacts of climate change in the next five to 10 years.” A feature of the think tank, said Professor Sharon Friel, of the College of Medicine, Biology and Environment at the Australian National University, was how multiple disciplines had been brought together to try to solve complex problems. “We’ve had engineers, anthropologists, human geographers and public health researchers, for example, coming together to allow us to think about these climate change social inequalities and human health challenges in a way you just would not normally be able to do.” Recommendations included improving early warning systems, better engaging disadvantaged communities, developing frameworks to link research, reducing food waste and more research into the links between conflict, instability and climate change. Professor Neville Nicholls, of Monash University’s school of geography and environmental science, said: “Our recommendations are designed to save lives and improve livelihoods now and in the future. “If we can do better at adapting to these events now and avoiding the health consequences of these extreme events then it is one of the best ways to adapt to the climate change that we can no longer avoid. This becomes more critical as governments are slow to mitigate. “This is an attempt to influence the way research is organised in Australia. The recommendations are read by government ministers and senior bureaucrats and it’s a chance to point out what is not being done in the research field.” Thirteen previous think-tanks have tackled issues including agricultural productivity, recovery of natural resources, water management and population increase. The academy aims to have a complete report with recommendations to present to policymakers, politicians and the public by December."
"Hippies in a slate quarry in Wales are celebrating four decades of green revolution this weekend, having transformed the character of a local town, pioneered new energy technologies and constructed a water-powered railway. The Centre for Alternative Technology (Cat) near Machynlleth also created hundreds of jobs and a tourist attraction that draws in around 70,000 visitors a year.  Many of the radical ideas from the centre in mid-Wales are now thoroughly mainstream. Alternative technologies are no longer alternative, as the world seeks to tackle climate change and diversify energy supplies. But the centre’s original aim to democratise technology remains unfulfilled, and there is a realisation that its mission is far from complete. Its radical recipes for achieving a zero-carbon Britain remain unpalatable to politicians and the public. The pioneers of Cat were inspired by the Club of Rome’s 1972 warning of dwindling resources in an over-populated world. They took over the disused slate quarry just north of Machynlleth with a dream to seize back technology for the people and live more lightly on the Earth. Conditions were harsh: no sewers, mains water or electricity – just acres of slate. But slowly they began to transform the moonscape into a mosaic of paths, gardens and energy-efficient buildings constructed as far as possible out of local materials. One of the early arrivals, Bob Todd, remembers: “Some of us were what you might call hippies because we had a different set of values to the rest of the population. “But they were a lot of very dedicated people keen to be able to demonstrate a lifestyle that would be both satisfying and softer on environment. “There was a strong feeling that a lot of technology had become very specialised so most people are just users of it and don’t have much understanding of it or influence on it.” Democratising technology was the watchword: insulate your home with shredded newspaper, make a solar water heater by painting an old radiator black and buying a few parts from a plumber. Building by building, Cat spread across the grey desert, greening the land with compost donated by the visitors paying entry fees in increasing numbers – some motivated by the desire to protect the environment, others by the need to distract holidaying children from persistent Welsh rain by unlocking the joy of gardening with human waste. The centre fostered a “Renaissance man” approach. As science education steadily specialised into tighter niches, Cat founded a course in general engineering to produce practitioners with an overview of entire systems based on broad general knowledge. “We wanted the course to go back to what village blacksmiths used to be round here, who could make a water turbine from scratch – they knew about the water, engineering, the mechanics, the electrics. We don’t train people like that at all. It would be extremely useful in lots of areas,” Todd says. And the holistic approach spanned from the practical to the theoretical. In 1977 Cat produced its alternative energy strategy for the United Kingdom.  Another of the pioneers, Paul Allan explains: “Back in 70s there had been more energy consumed every year – the mindset was ‘more energy equals more progress, more growth … that’s good’. “We bundled up our report to Tony Benn’s ministry of energy to say: ‘there’s a different approach – you need to be using less energy by using it more efficiently’. That was heretical. At that time nuclear was going to be too cheap to meter, we hadn’t tapped north sea oil reserves and nobody understood about the effects of climate change. “Now with today’s eyes, nuclear is expensive, North Sea oil is on the decline and we know with climate change we have to do a repaid decarbonisation. What we said at the time was very far ahead – so far ahead that people couldn’t really hear it.” As concern about climate and energy security have grown, many of Cat’s unthinkable ideas have found their way into energy policy worldwide – and some of the young idealists from its early days are in possession of desirable knowledge. The centre’s organisers estimate that 200 jobs have been generated. They are invaluable technical posts in a rural economy otherwise dependent on tourism, sheep and farm subsidies. Some of the luckier geeks have founded firms which have the potential to turn them into millionaires. Not all the technologies have worked. One early whisk-shaped vertical wind turbine nearly shook itself apart on the exposed hillside. It transpired that the manufacturers had never tested the device in high winds – they had used an electric motor to keep it turning during demonstrations. A Cretan wind turbine also proved impossible to operate on the site. Made from traditional materials, including cloth sails, the windmill seemed to fit the Cat DIY ethos. But every time the Welsh wind speed shifted, staff had to climb the turbine and adjust the sails. “Hilarious – but useless,” one said. A reflective trough concentrating solar rays on a heating device was another flop. It was designed for sunny climes – and worked well in the Welsh summer. But a glance from the low-angled winter sun focused heat in the wrong place and fried the mechanism. An inter-seasonal heat store failed, too. The idea was to collect water heated by summer sunshine from a black roof then dribble it into a large well-insulated underground tank. The tank would hold the warm water then release it in the winter when it would help to take the chill off the building. It worked, but had to be stopped after a scare over legionnaires’ disease. There is growing interest in reviving this technology with closed systems that keep bacteria out. “Failure is the manure for success” is Cat’s motto, but the centre is starting to ask “where next”? The success of the technologies that Cat pioneered has drawn well-funded institutions into this increasingly contested intellectual space. One answer is Cat’s latest document – Zero Carbon Britain, which argues that it is possible to achieve zero emissions in the UK using current technology, if only politicians have the will, and the public is supportive. The recipe involves eating much less meat and dairy produce, and living closer to work. It is still an uphill task for the hippies on the mountainside. • Roger Harrabin is the BBC’s environment analyst. His report on Cat is being broadcast on Radio 4’s Today Programme on 1 August 2014.

"Tony Abbott is under pressure from business, environment groups and climate policy experts to bolster his Direct Action climate policy with a new carbon pricing policy or tough regulations to give Australia some chance of meeting its 5% emissions reduction target in an affordable way. But the legislation implementing Direct Action may not pass the Senate, and the Coalition is vowing not to have any form of carbon price and is promising to run another anti-carbon tax campaign against Labor after the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, locked in his party to taking a new policy for an emissions trading scheme to the next election.  After the Senate finally made good on Abbott’s promise to “axe the tax” on Thursday, the prime minister hailed the demise of the “useless, destructive [carbon] tax” and promised the Coalition would “never do anything that damages the economy”. “The trouble with an emissions trading scheme is it is just another form of tax … we are not going to have a carbon tax, the only person who will take a carbon tax to the next election is Bill Shorten.” Shorten said the Labor party would not support Direct Action, which was a “boondoggle” constructed for “internet trolls … and right-wing shock jocks”. The leader of government business in the house, Christopher Pyne, vowed the Coalition would “hang this around [Shorten’s] neck until election day … he has given the Coalition a whole new lease of life”. But the demise of the tax focused attention on the Coalition’s alternative Direct Action policy. While welcoming the repeal of the existing tax, Australian Industry Group's chief executive, Innes Willox, said Australia in the end “has to find a market-based mechanism for action on climate change to work properly”. “We’ll see how far Direct Action gets us and how it looks in its final form, but we think the government is going to have to look at a range of other policies, including purchasing international carbon permits, and some kind of market mechanism to reach our target,” Willox said. The Business Council of Australia's chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, said: “Our preference is for a properly designed price on carbon and a market mechanism, but we have to go back to basics.” John Connor, the chief executive of the Climate Institute thinktank, said Direct Action would need “massive strengthening” and Australia would also need “a host of other regulations to get within even cooee of our minimum emission reduction target” and eventually a carbon price would have to be implemented. And professor Ross Garnaut, the climate expert who advised Labor governments, said Direct Action was “not up to the job”. “Any real action will now have to wait for a change in political circumstances. In the meantime, Australia has a become a problem for international efforts on climate change,” he said. The future of legislation setting up Direct Action is unclear. Labor and the Greens will oppose the bills, which the Senate will vote on when it returns in August, and it is also opposed by the Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm and the Family First senator Bob Day. Clive Palmer had declared it a “waste of money”, then he linked his support to the government backing his “dormant” emissions trading scheme, and on Thursday when asked by Guardian Australia he said: “I don’t know, I’ll make up my mind later.” Direct Action involves a $2.5bn fund to provide grants to companies and organisations bidding for money to reduce their emissions, but crucial parts of the plan have been delayed until next year, including the “baselines” to ensure polluting industries don’t “go rogue” and increase their emissions and undo (in terms of national emission reductions) the reductions made by the projects paid for from the emissions reduction fund. Emissions from new state-of-the-art plants or mines or land clearing are not considered “rogue” under the plan, and industry has argued for loose baselines against which any “rogue” behaviour by existing operations may be measured. The Minerals Council says that as ore grades decline it will take more energy for existing mines to produce and process the same amount, and “gassier” coal deposits will have to be accessed, and therefore the existing baseline might be too tough and the government might have to allow it to be varied upwards. The liquefied natural gas industry points out that production is set to treble over the next six years and baselines will need to take account of that. According to the available modelling, even if Australia spent $88bn from 2014 to 2050 on Direct Action-type policies, emissions would still rise by about 45%.  The former Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull said in 2011 that continuing to use a big government taxpayer-funded scheme to reduce emissions in the long term would ""become a very expensive charge on the budget in the years ahead"". Abbott dismissed the need for modelling of Direct Action during the election campaign, saying the Coalition intended to “have a crack” at implementing the policy, rather than commission alternative modelling, and that even if it didn’t meet the 5% target, no more money would be allocated."
"Forget the future. The world already is nearly five times as dangerous and disaster prone as it was in the 1970s, because of the increasing risks brought by climate change, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organisation. The first decade of the 21st century saw 3,496 natural disasters from floods, storms, droughts and heat waves. That was nearly five times as many disasters as the 743 catastrophes reported during the 1970s – and all of those weather events are influenced by climate change. The bottom line: natural disasters are occurring nearly five times as often as they were in the 1970s. But some disasters – such as floods and storms – pose a bigger threat than others. Flooding and storms are also taking a bigger bite out of the economy. But heat waves are an emerging killer. Flooding and mega-storms were by far the leading cause of disaster from 2000-2010. About 80% of the 3,496 disasters of the last decade were due to flooding and storms. Seas are rising because of climate change. So are extreme rain storms. There is growing evidence that warming temperatures are increasing the destructive force of hurricanes.  Heat waves didn't even register as a threat in the 1970s. By 2010, they were one of the leading causes of deaths in natural disasters, along with storms. In Russia alone, more than 55,000 people died as a result of heat wave in 2010. Disasters were about 5.5 times more expensive by 2010 than they were in the 1970s, and most of that was because of the rising losses due to floods. The cost of disasters rose to $864bn (£505bn) in the last decade."

"Australia is earning global scorn this week, as the first nation to dismantle a well-functioning national policy for reducing greenhouse emissions. While this is a major step backward, and many Australians will consider it reckless, I believe that there is hope for the future, if we focus our efforts on renewable energy, rather than a price on carbon. Our Clean Energy Future package was the best carbon price scheme in the world. It included $13bn for clean energy plus independent, non-partisan processes for measuring progress, setting targets and evaluating the potential of renewable energy.  Political journalists have rightly condemned the government for demolishing our climate policy. Bernard Keane at Crikey writes ""It’s an attack ... on the future and on the young."" He says it makes Australia ""an international greenhouse vandal."" Lenore Taylor at the Guardian Australia is equally scathing. But she also challenges us to rethink our strategy. She says “those concerned about climate change” now “need to regroup”.  Taylor is right. She and I were at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, where the UN climate convention was created – and we have both followed the debate closely since then. At the time, the best scientific advice said humanity had to immediately cut emissions by 60%. What actually happened? We increased emissions by 40%. The old strategy of negotiating for a global agreement, around a price on carbon, has clearly failed. There are three main reasons why the carbon price negotiation strategy failed. The first reason is that the global climate negotiation process was powerless. It required a voluntary consensus of nations in order to cut pollution. There is simply not enough good will in the family of nations for that to be possible. Nations were allowed to sprint ahead of the pack on their own. Germany invested massively in solar, which brought down its price so solar is now competitive against fossil fuels. But leaders such as Germany were penalised by trade law, which prevented them from protecting their innovative, low carbon industries against cheaper imports from high-pollution countries. On one hand, international law rewarded polluters with a race to the bottom in the climate negotiations and on the other hand, it punished nations who invested in innovation. The second problem is that public opinion and conservative political parties, especially in the English-speaking world, turned significantly against climate science. Polluters, especially in the US, and Rupert Murdoch’s global media empire waged a war against climate action: promoting junk science, slandering climate scientists, vilifying renewable energy and rewarding climate denier politicians, such as Tony Abbott. The third problem is that global business became more powerful than national democracies. There is more power in the hands of global corporations than in democratically elected parliaments. Business-as-usual shaped politics, which determined policy. As ABC TV’s Four Corners programme said recently, ""coal has defined Australia’s political economy"". The good news in this dire scenario is that leaders such as Germany have made solar and other clean technology cheap enough to beat fossil fuels on price. This completely changes our strategic scenario. That fact needs to be fully appreciated by climate campaigners and political parties. The next, related piece of strategically good news is that renewables are naturally popular. Polls around the world show that solar especially, but also wind and other clean technology, enjoys a super-majority (70%+) of support. Public campaigns for climate action and most political party agendas have focused on a carbon price, which remains unpopular and difficult to communicate. They have largely ignored renewables, which enjoy a high level of public affection and are easy to promote. Carbon markets are only understood by a tiny, political elite and thus continue to lack the legitimacy of solar or wind energy. Green Banks, such as Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation or the New York Green Bank are a positive development and deserve more emphasis in climate campaigns. They harness the dynamism and power of financial markets, to fund renewable energy. This makes them more effective policies than any plausible carbon price. Once clean energy has displaced a substantial proportion of fossil fuel generation, this economic might will create the political momentum that is required before we can properly tackle emissions from the other areas: mining, manufacturing, agriculture, cement, forestry, aviation and design. The dynamism and realpolitik of clean energy make it a superior public policy to carbon pricing alone. We have a responsibility to turn the tactical failure of carbon pricing into a strategic win for the environment. Renewable energy is the key to changing the political game, so we can save our climate."
"The new set of Conservative environment and energy ministers announced on Tuesday bring a track record of opposing renewable energy, having fought against wind and solar farms, enthusiastically backed fracking and argued that green subsidies damage the economy. New energy minister, Matthew Hancock, signed a letter to David Cameron in 2012 demanding that subsidies for onshore windfarms were slashed. “I support renewable energy but we need to do it in a way that gives the most value for money and that does not destroy our natural environment,” he said at the time.   Hancock, who takes over from Michael Fallon, also opposed new turbines in his Suffolk constituency, arguing: “The visual and other impact of the proposed turbines is completely unacceptable in this attractive rural corner of Suffolk.” New environment secretary and former Shell employee, Liz Truss, dismissed clean renewable energy as “extremely expensive” and said it was damaging the economy during an appearance on BBC Question Time last October. “We do need to look at the green taxes because at the moment they are incentivising particular forms of energy that are extremely expensive,” she said. “I would like to see the rolling back of green taxes because it is wrong that we are implementing green taxes faster than other countries. We may be potentially exporting jobs out of the country as our energy is so expensive.” In 2009, as deputy director of the free-market thinktank Reform, Truss said energy infrastructure in Britain was being damaged by politicians' obsession with green technology: “Vast amounts of taxpayers' money are being spent subsidising uneconomic activity,"" she said. Research from the London School of Economics recently concluded that green policies were not harming economic growth. Truss will have a key role in regulating the environmental safety of shale gas exploration and has said fracking would benefit people living nearby. “We need to make sure shale gas is being exploited in this country, which will benefit local communities,” she said on BBC Question Time. As well as fracking, Truss backed “renewable” nuclear power as a way to “hit green targets”. In her first statement since being appointed as environment secretary, Truss said: “I look forward to tackling the important issues facing our rural communities including championing British food, protecting people from flooding and improving the environment.” She did not mention fracking or the controversial badger cull, which she has supported in parliamentary votes. Truss, Hancock and another new appointee to the Department of Energy and Climate Change, Amber Rudd, all face conflicts between their new ministerial responsibilities and their previous constituency work. Truss has spoken out about insufficient flood protection for farmland in her Norfolk South West constituency. But she is now responsible for flood defences and faces a £500m hole in the budget needed to keep pace with the rising flood risk being driven by climate change. Truss has also been a vocal opponent of an energy-from-waste project – an incinerator – at Kings Lynn. She has opposed solar farms being built and also complained the energy secretary Ed Davey that subsidies helping crops to used to generate energy was making straw difficult to get for pig farmers. One of the most contentious issues Truss faces will be over the badger cull. Her East Anglian constituency is far from the bovine TB hotspots in the west of the UK, but she has been keenly involved in rural issues - for instance, she is pro-hunting. Lord Krebs, chair of the sub-group of the Committee on Climate Change that looks at adaptation to the effects of global warming, said at a meeting of the all-party environment group in Westminster on Tuesday that he would wait for a private conversation with Truss before advising her on that.  But he did say that he would offer his advice on badgers and bovine TB - a subject which the prominent zoologist examined in detail for the previous Labour government, finding that a cull was not likely to solve the problem.  He told the Guardian: ""I would say don't be so focused on killing badgers (as a way of controlling the disease) but go back and look at all the policy options."" Hancock has opposed both windfarms and new housing developments, while Rudd has raised her constituents safety fears about the Dungeness nuclear power plant in her constituency. Rudd, whose represents the coastal constituency of Hastings and Rye, has been praised by campaigners for supporting sustainable fishing and has raised questions about how government energy efficiency programmes would help social housing. The Renewable Energy Association said it looked forward to working with Truss, Hancock and Rudd. The trade body's chief executive, Dr Nina Skorupska, said of the outgoing Greg Barker, who Rudd replaces: ""Not only did he bring stability to the department, he also brought passion and enthusiasm."" Truss, Hancock and Rudd appear not to have made any public statements about climate change."

"David Cameron is warned today by Graça Machel, widow of the late South African statesman Nelson Mandela, that unless world leaders made 2015 a year for development, the consequence would not just be poverty but also growing military conflicts from which the rich would be unable to protect themselves for decades to come. It is Machel's first global political act since the death of her husband last year. The letter to Cameron has also been signed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the rock star Bono, the Nobel peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus, the billionaire entrepreneur Mo Ibrahim and the 17-year-old Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai. The letter presses the prime minister to take the lead on an international UN framework agreement on climate change in 2015, and to secure an agreement on new tighter UN millennium development goals, an issue on which he took a personal lead last year. The letter coincides with the anniversary of Mandela's birthday – and also the day on which the current stage of negotiations on replacing the millennium development goals is due to close. At present there is little sign of progress on the goals, with signs that there will be an increase in the number to 17 and a proliferation in targets to 145. That number is widely seen as unwieldy. The joint letter warns: ""A growing insecurity caused by unequal access to increasingly scarce natural resources leads to tragic conflicts from which nobody – no elite, no matter how rich – can hide. This is an entirely plausible outcome of a complacent business-as-usual approach to 2015. ""Which world do you want to live in by 2030? Which world it will be depends upon the decision you make in 2015, and the preparations we make for it now."" The letter also calls for a global movement to unite development, climate and human rights campaigns around this agenda to force the ambition that is needed. A campaign called Action/2015 – backed by hundreds of organisations from around the world, from Amnesty International to the All Africa Conference of Churches, Save the Children to the ONE Campaign – will be launched in January 2015. The letter says: ""The good news is a global movement is coming together for 2015 and the future, inspired by the words of Nelson Mandela: 'Like slavery, like apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is manmade and it can be overcome by the actions of human beings.' Climate change too can and must be remedied by the actions of human beings."" The campaigners say they fear that the summit on climate change called by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, this September is already in the balance, with states unwilling to make the early commitments they have been asked to for fear of weakening their negotiating hand. Cameron is under pressure to confirm he will go to the summit on 23 September, and make a substantial pledge, but has so far made no commitment, citing the Scottish referendum and his own party conference. Efforts are also being made to galvanise the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who has so far said little on the subject. Brendan Cox, of Save the Children, said: ""This is a warning siren from some of the world's most respected leaders and we ignore it at our peril. 2015 is a huge year for the planet and the people that live on it, but on our current trajectory we risk squandering this opportunity. It's not too late to correct course and raise ambition, but it soon will be."" Dr Sipho Moyo, from the One Campaign, said: ""2015 is an historic opportunity for change. A focused package of ambitious but achievable development goals can really empower grassroots citizens of the global south – and those globally who campaign in solidarity with them – to demand and receive vital life-saving and life-changing health, education and infrastructure services from governments. ""If this happens, eradicating the injustice of extreme poverty is within our grasp – we can't and we won't let this opportunity slip."""
"Former environment secretary Owen Paterson is to give the annual lecture for the UK’s most prominent climate sceptic group, the Global Policy Warming Foundation.  Paterson, who slashed funding for adapting to climate change impacts in the UK, agreed to give the lecture just days after leaving office.  The GWPF is led by Lord Nigel Lawson and the annual lecture has been given by high-profile climate sceptics, including in 2013 former Australian prime minister John Howard, who described those urging action on climate change as “alarmists” and “zealots” for whom “the cause has become a substitute religion”. Paterson’s repeated failure to endorse the conclusions of the world’s scientists and governments that climate change is dangerous and caused by fossil fuel burning had led to the assumption that he was a climate change sceptic, but the announcement of his support for the GWPF confirms it. Lord Lawson, chairman of the GWPF, told the Guardian he had wanted a British lecturer after a series of speakers from overseas. ""I felt Owen Paterson would give an excellent and thoughtful lecture. At the time I invited him he was still in post as environment secretary, a job of considerable relevance to the successful development of UK shale gas, which the GWPF strongly supports."" But the confirmation of Paterson's views has prompted campaigners to question the UK government's commitment to tackling climate change. ""Paterson held an office to do things that help protect the UK public from the impacts of climate change and it is extremely good that he has gone,” said Andrew Pendleton, at Friends of the Earth. “But there are still questions to answer about how this government is dealing with climate change: how seriously do they take it? This is not about an internecine fight within the Tory party, it is about the future of humanity.” Ben Stewart at Greenpeace UK said: “Some people would say that for the last two years Paterson has been delivering a rolling 24/7 lecture for the GWPF. Maybe it’s for the best that he’s come out of the closet and formalised the relationship.” Bob Ward, policy director at the LSE's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said: “This provides a glimpse of how far the tentacles of Lord Lawson’s lobby group have extended into government departments. Let us sincerely hope that the new environment secretary, Elizabeth Truss, is better informed about climate change than her sacked predecessor.” Paterson, who was also responsible for defences against rising flood risk - the greatest consequence of climate change in the UK - made a series of sceptical comments during his time as environment secretary.  In September 2013, he said: “People get very emotional about [climate change] and I think we should just accept that the climate has been changing for centuries.” In June 2013, he said: “The climate has not changed. The temperature hasn’t changed in 17 years.” On the same occasion, the BBC’s Any Questions show, he said: “The measures that we take to counter climate change may cause more damage than they gain.” A Conservative Party spokesman declined to say whether it had been a mistake to appoint a climate sceptic as environment secretary. He said the words in the letter sent by prime minister David Cameron's to Paterson after the latter's sacking spoke for themselves: ""I would like you to know how much I have personally appreciated your friendship, loyalty and support over the years, and your commitment to the government’s priorities."" The GWPF is the UK’s most high-profile climate sceptic group and it is a charitable foundation. But it recently announced it would be setting up a separate lobbying arm, the Global Policy Warming Forum, after advice from the Charity Commission on the conflict between charitable status and political campaigning. Other sceptics who have given the GWPF annual lecture include former Czech president, Václav Klaus, who said: “The widespread acceptance of the global warming dogma has become one of the main, most costly and most undemocratic public policy mistakes in generations. The previous one was communism.”  Another lecturer was Australia’s most senior Catholic, Cardinal George Pell, who said global warming has “stopped”, that carbon dioxide is “not a pollutant, but part of the stuff of life” and that if carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was doubled, then “plants would love it”. The GWPF does not reveal the source of its funding. “The GWPF relentlessly promotes the use of fossil fuels – so who are the funders behind that lobbying?” said the Green party’s James Abbott. Ben Stafford, head of public affairs at WWF-UK, said: “As environment secretary, Owen Paterson has seen at first hand the impacts of a changing climate. This year’s severe floods in England were a stark reminder about the risks we face in the years and decades ahead. We hope he’ll use his GWPF lecture to make the case for ongoing UK leadership, both at home and abroad, to secure a strong international deal to limit emissions, and to invest in measures to mitigate the impacts we are already seeing.” "
"Australia’s carbon price has been repealed, leaving the nation with no legislated policy to achieve even the minimum 5% greenhouse emissions reduction target it has inscribed in international agreements. After eight years of bitter political debate, during which climate policy dominated three election campaigns and contributed to the demise of two prime ministers, after last week’s Senate drama in which the repeal was again defeated and this week’s lengthy last gasp debate, the Senate has now finally voted to make good Tony Abbott’s “pledge in blood” to “axe the tax”. The government was backed by seven of the new crossbench senators, including the three Palmer United party senators, Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm, Family First senator Bob Day, Motoring Enthusiast senator Ricky Muir, DLP senator John Madigan. Independent senator Nick Xenophon was unwell. Only the Australian Labor party and the Greens voted against repealing the carbon pricing scheme they introduced, which came into effect two years ago. Leader of the government in the Senate and former climate change minister Penny Wong said repealing the bills meant “this nation will have walked away from a credible and efficient response to climate change”. Wong said the prime minister Tony Abbott had “staked his political career … on fearmongering and scaremongering and that is what this debate has been about for years”. “I think future generations will look back on these bills and they will be appalled … at the short-sighted, opportunistic selfish politics of those opposite and Mr Abbott will go down as one of the most short-sighted, selfish and small people ever to occupy the office of prime minister.” Government backbencher Ian Macdonald accused opposition parties of being hypocrites for refusing to accept the will of the voters and said that while he had “an open mind”, he would like to point out that Brisbane had recently had its coldest day in 113 years. Greens leader Christine Milne said it was “a vote for failure” amid interjections from government backbenchers that she should “get over it” because the parliament was “respecting the will of the Australian people”. The bills passed 39:32. There was none of the jubilation that accompanied their passage in the lower house, but the leader of the government in the Senate, Eric Abetz, shook hands with backbench senator Cory Bernardi, who led the revolt against Malcolm Turnbull when, as leader of the opposition, he backed Labor’s carbon pricing scheme. The tax was $25.40 a tonne and was scheduled to move to the floating and lower international price in 12 months. The repeal will cost the budget around $7bn over the next four years as around 350 businesses, mainly electricity generators and big manufacturers, no longer have to pay the tax. The government argues the carbon pricing scheme has been ineffective, but national emissions have actually fallen by 0.8% in the first calendar year of its operation, the largest fall in 24 years of records. Since the tax began, emissions from the east coast electricity market have fallen 11%, but emissions from other sources – especially coal and gas mining have increased. The government also says households will be better off by an average $550 – the amount treasury estimated prices would rise when the tax was introduced – but supermarkets and airlines are now saying consumers should not expect price reductions. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s special powers are to monitor and enforce only electricity and gas price reductions. Electricity bills will rise, but by an estimated 9% less than they otherwise would. Gas bills will rise by an estimated 7% less than they would have with the tax still in place. The Abbott government says it will now achieve the target of a 5% reduction in Australian emissions compared with 2000 levels by 2020 with its Direct Action policy, which will offer $2.5bn in competitive grants over the next four years to companies and organisations voluntarily reducing emissions. The budget actually allocated only $1.14bn over the four-year forward estimates for the scheme. The government said this is because they will pay on delivery of the abatement. The policy is voluntary and puts no overall cap on emissions. The government itself has not modelled Direct Action (Abbott said he would prefer to “have a crack”), but two other modelling exercises found even the 5% cut would cost far more than $2.5bn, and the independent climate change authority – which the government is seeking to abolish – has said Australia’s “fair share” of international emissions reductions has now increased to between 15% and 19% by 2020. The government says it is sure Direct Action will meet the 5% target, but Abbott has said he will not allocate any more money even if it does not, and has not said how he would make deeper reductions in Australia’s emissions which are likely to be required after the United Nations meeting to try to forge a new post-2020 climate agreement in Paris next year. Malcolm Turnbull warned of the long-term costs of the policy in a speech to parliament after he was deposed as leader because of his support for an emissions trading scheme, when he said Direct Action style schemes were “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale”. The carbon price repeal bills were voted down in the Senate last week after a last-minute change to a Palmer United party amendment was ruled to be unconstitutional by the clerk of the Senate. The government had been prepared to accept the amendment but then changed it again over the weekend after business groups raised major concerns.  Business groups welcomed the repeal as a “first step” towards achieving an effective emissions reduction policy. The Business Council of Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group called on the government to “develop and implement a cost-effective emissions reduction fund” as “part of a toolkit of measures to reduce emissions”. But the Climate Institute thinktank said that “by repealing laws that price and limit carbon pollution, Australia today became the world’s first country to dismantle a functioning and effective carbon market, taking a monumentally reckless backward leap even as other major countries are stepping up climate action”. And the Australian Conservation Foundation said: “This backwards step makes Australia an international embarrassment.” Describing it as a “tragic day”, Greens leader senator Christine Milne said after the vote that “the big polluters should pay for the destruction they are causing to the planet”. She accused the Coalition of “wanting to cost-shift the burden of climate change onto the community and away from the people who are causing it”. Both Labor and the Greens say they remain committed to carbon pricing as the best way to reduce emissions. Speaking after the vote, agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce said the tax had imposed high costs on families, and questioned whether it was needed, saying “look at the weather today, look at the way you are dressed, no one thinks it is too hot”. “I believe there is climate change happening, I just don’t believe we are going to change it with a broad-based consumption tax.” “I am glad the carbon tax has been axed … we have Direct Action and there are programs that hopefully can assist … but the idea that somehow we inflict on every household the fact that we would attack their power prices to the Australian taxation offices. They took it to the Australian people and the Australian people rejected it,” Joyce said."
"“A lot of suburban water planners plan for yesterday,” says Eric Kuhn, general manager of the Colorado River Water District. But in Denver the national baby boomer vogue for suburban “ranchettes” with water-sucking lawns so big that you need a tractor to mow them is giving way to a millennial preference for downtown living in condos and lofts. SUVs are out, light rail, car and bike shares are in. And when it comes to water policy, Denver is behaving in a way that makes the future seem not only tenable but even bright.  City boosters point to an educated population but the city’s secret weapon may simply be a youthful outlook. With surrounding farmland jokingly called the “Burgundy of pot”, the Denver Post even has a column devoted to cannabis. Denver is rivalled by only Portland, Oregon, for sheer number and quality of craft breweries.   Ironically, the foundation supporting all this grooviness was laid by mid-19th-century forefathers so politically incorrect that their ideas of “Manifest Destiny” were even considered beyond the pale in their own day. As University of Colorado historian Patricia Limerick notes in A Ditch in Time, her history of Denver’s water works, Colorado’s first governor, William Gilpin, even saw the state capital as “a focal point of impregnable power in the topographical configuration of the continent”.  Railway promotions from Gilpin’s era promised west-bound settlers that “rain follows the plow”. Absurd as their ideas were, as Limerick observes, settlers drawn west by these egomaniacs did eventually succeed in harnessing water in dry places. Almost a decade before William Mulholland brought Eastern Sierra water crashing more than 200 miles south to Los Angeles, Denver had erected what in 1905 was the largest dam in the world near the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains on the South Platte River. By the 1930s, Denver’s water prospectors had slipped a pipeline through a railway tunnel piercing the continental divide. Successive bores through a rib of mountains so wall-like that they divide north American drainage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans allowed Denver to relieve key Colorado River tributaries in the western Rockies of more than half of their flows. By 1986, Denver had diverted so much rural water from both the eastern and western sides of the divide that in his 1986 classic Cadillac Desert dam critic Marc Reisner referred to it as the “Los Angeles of the Rockies”. In 1990, as the population served by Denver Water approached one million (this includes suburbs), plans for the Two Forks dam, a massive new project, were on the drawing board. With its 615ft-tall retaining wall, the Two Forks dam would have flooded six towns. Denver Water saw federal approval as a mere formality, and the city was even planning to pay for Two Forks without federal assistance. And then, in a shock decision, the Environmental Protection Agency under the new administration of George HW Bush, vetoed the project.  Before the Two Forks veto, across the US but particularly in the dry west, conventional wisdom had it that the only good river was a dammed one. Between hydro-power and vast reservoirs created by dams, there was arid plain, no high desert that could not be made to bloom. But, nearly a quarter of a century later, it’s clear that Two Forks was a – perhaps the – watershed moment in western water projects. The era of big infrastructure, a 20th-century drive that had left more than 30,000 dams plugging up waterways west of the Mississippi, was over. Freshwater fisheries were collapsing and with them whole ecosystems once sustained by streams and fish. The two biggest river deltas on the Pacific coast were either dead or dying. There simply wasn’t enough water to keep on damming rivers.  “That was a real game-changer for all utilities,” says Denver Water’s current manager Jim Lochhead. “We learned we needed to conserve more, we needed to reuse the water we had, we needed to use existing structures instead of building new ones.” Within his agency, Two Forks changed Denver so profoundly that, for many years afterwards, the city had environmental lawyers once more likely to sue it than do business with it on the water utility’s ruling board.  It was in 2002, however, that Denver felt the aftershock of the loss of Two Forks to its reservoir system. Colorado River snowmelt, source of half of Denver’s water, plummeted to a quarter of normal flows. Limerick relishes Denver’s response. It straight-facedly accelerated a drought-tolerant native landscape programme (Denver Water coined the phrase “xeriscaping” and opened the first demonstration garden under the name). But the rest of the alarm rang in what Limerick calls “madcap” style.  Rather than resort to predictable preaching about the virtues of conservation, something modern westerners have acquired a certain deafness to hearing, Denver hired a young local ad agency to ridicule waste. Sporting types were hired to dress up as toilets and run across fields at athletic events to broadcasts of “Don’t let your toilet run”. Print campaigns advised: “Only wash the stinky parts.” Joke-shaming is now central to the city’s conservation strategy. Denver Water’s newest effort, a “Don’t be that guy” campaign, features a NASCAR-issue dude laying on a thick carpet of turfgrass holding a flowing watering hose where his manhood should be.  Since 2002, water usage in Denver has dropped roughly 40 gallons per person per day. According to Denver Water, it now serves almost twice the population it did fifty years ago and uses only six per cent more water. For want of new dams, Denver is repurposing obsolete gravel pits to store water and has reached out to its traditional foes. Eric Kuhn’s agency representing Colorado River interests on the opposite side of the Rockies and Trout Unlimited, a powerful national alliance of anglers, a kind of Greenpeace of American freshwater fisheries, among them. In exchange for signing off on enlargement of an existing reservoir that will further drain an already dangerously sucked-dry West Slope, Kuhn and others exacted funds from Denver Water for stream restoration, agreements to keep stream flows tolerable for fish at key times, and, perhaps most importantly, a commitment that a utility dependent on profit from water sales would put a ring around its service area to reign-in sprawl. Trout Unlimited’s Colorado executive director David Nickum meets regularly with Denver Water and has even co-authored an op-ed piece in the Denver Post with its general manager. “It’s not kumbaya all the time,” says Nickum. However, he agrees with Kuhn and even Denver Water’s CEO Jim Lochhead that the era of big infrastructure is over. It’s an accountability thing. Unlike the situation in Los Angeles, where the eastern Sierra lake devastated by “Chinatown”-era water politics is 200 miles away, Denverites consider the west slope of the Rockies their backyard. “So Denver Water is caught in the middle,” says Kuhn. “Their constituents expect them to provide high-quality, low-cost water and do it in a way that doesn’t mess up their playground.” Interested in finding out more about how you can live better?

"The much-debated Keystone XL pipeline could produce four times more global warming pollution than the State Department calculated earlier this year, a new study concludes. The US estimates didn’t take into account that the added oil from the pipeline would drop prices by about $3 a barrel, spurring consumption that would create more pollution, the researchers said.  The researchers estimate that the proposed pipeline, which would carry oil from tar sands in western Canada to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast, would increase world greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 121 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. The department said this year that, at most, the pipeline would increase world carbon dioxide emissions by 30 million tons. Such emissions have been on the mind of President Barack Obama, who has said his administration would allow the pipeline to be built “only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.” The new estimates, from scientists at the Stockholm Environment Institute, were published Sunday by the journal Nature Climate Change. Peter Erickson, lead author, said his work implies that the pipeline could basically wipe out reductions from some potential pollution-cutting policies under discussion. Outside experts not connected to the study gave it mixed reviews. The American Petroleum Institute found the study to be irrelevant because regardless of the pipeline, the tar sands will be developed and oil will be shipped by railroad if not by pipeline, spokeswoman Sabrina Fang said. The State Department declined to comment on the research by Erickson and co-author Michael Lazarus. Lower prices may sound good, but there’s no free lunch, said Wesleyan University environmental economist Gary Yohe, who praised the work. “Lower fuel prices are bad if they don’t include all of the social costs,” Yohe wrote in an email. “Consumers are happy, but the planet is not necessarily.” An increase of 121 million tons of carbon dioxide is dwarfed by the 36 billion tons of carbon dioxide the world pumped into the air in 2013.  That’s why University of Sussex economist Richard Tol dismissed the calculated Keystone effect as merely a drop in the bucket. If somebody is concerned about climate change, he wrote in an email, the pipeline “should be the furthest from your mind.” Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution of Washington agreed the amount is small, but said the concern is more about the idea of boosting emissions than the degree of change. Independent energy economist Judith Dwarkin in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, dismissed the study, faulting the idea that added oil production will lower the price and boost demand. Usually, she said, it is consumption that spurs price and then oil production."
"Australia’s repeal of the carbon price has provoked a largely negative reaction overseas, with former US vice president Al Gore calling it a “disappointing step”. Gore said Thursday’s abolition of the mechanism means that “Australia is falling behind other major industrialised nations in the growing global effort to reduce carbon emissions and ensure a clean and prosperous future”.  “[It is] a disappointing step for a country that continues to experience the worsening consequences of the climate crisis.” Gore, who appeared alongside Clive Palmer in a bizarre press conference in June to iterate the Palmer United party’s position on the carbon price, said be was encouraged by the support for the Renewable Energy Target, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Climate Change Authority. “These programs are examples of Australia’s long and continued excellence in combating the climate crisis, and must continue,” Gore said. He added that he was “hopeful” that Australia would adopt an emissions trading scheme (ETS), as advanced by Labor and, in a radically watered down form, by Palmer. Connie Hedegaard, the European Union’s climate commissioner, also voiced disappointment at the carbon price repeal. “The European Union regrets the repeal of Australia's carbon pricing mechanism just as new carbon pricing initiatives are emerging all around the world,” she said. “The EU is convinced that pricing carbon is not only the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions, but also the tool to make the economic paradigm shift the world needs. “This is why the EU will continue to work towards global carbon pricing with all international partners.” The European Union has had an emissions trading scheme in place since 2005. The scheme, which covers around 45% of total greenhouse emissions from the 28 EU countries, was due to be linked to Australia’s own emissions trading scheme, but this will now not happen. The UK, which is part of the EU ETS, has declined to officially criticise Australia over the abolition, although a senior UK Conservative recently condemned Tony Abbott over his “reckless” approach to climate change. However, a spokeswoman for Ed Davey, the UK’s climate change minister, told Guardian Australia that Britain wanted to work with countries to “encourage ambitious action” on climate change, preferably via carbon pricing. “The UK supports the development of carbon pricing around the world as the most cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and incentivising the technologies required for the transition to a low carbon economy,” she said. The repeal of the carbon price means that Australia now has no primary mechanism designed to lower carbon emissions. The government has insisted it is confident that it will be able to implement its voluntary Direct Action scheme, which will hand around $2.5bn to businesses for emissions-lowering projects. However, PUP, Labor and the Greens have all voiced their opposition to Direct Action, meaning it appears unlikely to pass the Senate. Several independent analyses have found that Direct Action would not meet the government’s target of a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020, on 2000 levels, without major new investment. The government claims it will meet this goal but has not undertaken any modelling to support this assertion."
"Two blue glass boxes rise from the grass next to the Melbourne Cricket Ground. If you glance at them – on your way to an Aussie rules game, of course – you’ll notice some pipes inside.  Nothing special, really. It’s only a sewer mine. Or, as the officials prefer: the Yarra Park Water Recycling Facility.   Below ground, a large pipe snakes uphill, avoiding tree roots. It taps into the main vein below the snooty suburb of East Melbourne, and sneaks off with its sewage. In summer, the large parklands around the ground are irrigated entirely with recycled water from the facility. In the winter, it flushes the toilets of tens of thousands of spectators each weekend.  The facility supplies cheaper water than the gigantic Victorian desalination plant, which was built with considerable cost and controversy 100km south-east of the city. Both were completed in 2012. But the desalination plant, unlike the sewer mine, has never produced a drop. Something strange and remarkable has happened in Melbourne. Five years ago, the city of over 4 million inhabitants nearly ran out of water. Now it is regarded among the most innovative, water-smart cities in the world.  From 1997 to 2009 southern Australia suffered through the “millennium drought”, its longest dry spell on record. “The drought was a huge wake-up call,” says Dr Cathy Wilkinson, an executive director at the Office for Living Victoria, the government body now in charge of water policy. “The way water was managed had a huge impact on people every day. Waterways were drying up, junior sports clubs couldn’t play on their ovals because they were too dry and dangerous.” In panic, the then Labor government ordered a mammoth desalination plant – with a top capacity of half the city’s water consumption – and a pipeline to bring water from the north of the state. It also issued tight water restrictions. Newspapers reported on neighbourhood water vigilantes; people using rainwater tanks feared being seen with green lawns. Water consumption dropped 40%, per person per day. Without that shift, drinking water supplies would have run out.  The imminent threat concentrated minds elsewhere. Local councils, unable to water outdoor space, began to seek alternatives.  Prof Ana Deletic, associate dean of engineering at Monash University, explains that research flourished, especially into reclaiming stormwater – the polluted rainfall that flows off roads and car parks, into the bay.  “The same amount of runoff goes into Port Phillip Bay as we use in Melbourne each year,” she says. “We were talking about how we could capture some of that water and reuse it, but also save our streams in the process.” The university now hosts the Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities, which has over 70 researchers and a budget of over $100m. It’s a multi-disciplinary body, with programmes looking at social drivers, planning, technology and, importantly, how to get it all adopted in real life.  Deletic’s speciality is green walls that treat greywater: the system where plants recycle greywater, filtering out pollutants and using them as nutrients for growth. “It’s a technology that cools your city, makes it beautiful but also produces water,” she says. Enter a conservative state government in 2010. It mothballed the desalination plant and the pipeline and established the Office of Living Victoria, with a holistic mandate – much like what the academics had ordered. Wilkinson says that, historically, water planners sought to predict and provide. The city was a drain; waterways just pipes to the bay. Now the vision is decentralisation. Catch and store water where it falls. Treat stormwater and wastewater locally, where possible, and reuse it to irrigate parks and gardens. Use drinking water for drinking, not for everything.  “When we do our long-term water planning, we need to think about the complete range of sources, and match the right water for the right job,” Wilkinson says. “At its heart it’s about how Victoria can be resilient and liveable in the face of a whole heap of changes that are going to happen.” Chief among these changes are a fast growing population – up to 7 million by mid-century – and a harsher climate. Droughts are projected to become more frequent and severe. Rainfall is likely to decrease, but when it does rain, it’s more likely to pour. The millennium drought was followed by two dangerously wet years, including the wettest summer on record, which flooded a third of the state.  The government has begun funding suitable projects and “whole-of-water-cycle” management plans are being drawn up across the city.  The office’s modelling anticipates an astonishing range of gains by 2050: nearly halving mains demand, cutting one-third from wastewater volumes, reducing stormwater runoff by 40%, and saving one-third of the electricity used in the system. All at a tidy saving of up to $7bn . What makes this all the more peculiar is that otherwise, the government has been environmentally backward. This March, the state’s commissioner for environmental sustainability quit early, claiming the government was advising bureaucrats not to use the term “climate change”. The Office of Living Victoria has been the subject of controversy too. An investigation by the ombudsman into its procurement practices is expected within weeks. There are also complaints about a lack of transparency in its modelling. Michael O’Neill, senior environmental consultant at Arup, was part of the team for the MCG sewer mine. He says Melbourne’s approach is internationally renowned, “not just in academic and policy circles, but also in the multinational engineering firms”.  The Yarra River, which winds through the city, is infamously brown. It was clear when the colonists started the city on Wurundjeri land, but now it’s said to run upside down. So, when American tennis player Jim Courier dived into the river after winning the Australian Open in 1992 and 1993, the rest of the city shuddered.  “One day,” O’Neill says, “maybe, one day, we’ll get the Yarra back to a situation where we can to swim in it. Anything is possible.” Michael Green is a journalist based in Melbourne. Interested in finding out more about how you can live better? Take a look at this month’s Live Better challenge here.

"Tony Abbott has come under fresh pressure to put climate change on the agenda at the upcoming G20 gathering, with a group of medical scientists led by the Nobel laureate Prof. Peter Doherty warning Australians face “serious health risks” if the issue isn’t urgently tackled. In an open letter to the prime minister, a group of 12 of Australia’s leading medical scientists call on Australia to take a “strong lead” in reducing carbon emissions or risk a major impact on public health.  “Adverse health outcomes related to climate change are already evident in many regions of the world,” the letter states. “By mid-century serious health risks are likely to be widespread, particularly in vulnerable communities, including in Australia. Workloads and economic and logistical demands on the nation’s health system will also rise as these impacts increase.” The scientists cite a large number of health risks posed by climate change, including heatwaves, fires, water shortages and the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Regional food production is set to decline, while mental health and rates of illnesses such as gastroenteritis are expected to worsen as temperatures rise. The experts state that “mismanagement of the world’s climate and environment is weakening the foundations of health and longevity”, calling on Abbott to embrace clean energy technology.“This issue warrants urgent consideration at the G20 meeting,” the letter reads. “The health of present and future generations is at risk from ongoing human-induced climate change.” The authors include Doherty, Prof. Gus Nossal, Fiona Stanley and the editor-in-chief of the Medical Journal of Australia, Prof. Stephen Leeder. Unlike previous G20 meetings, the upcoming gathering of the world’s leading powers in Brisbane will not have climate change on the agenda. The Abbott government has stressed that economic growth will be the primary focus of the talks. Abbott has said the topic of climate change is likely to come up in discussions but added that it was “important to ensure that these international meetings don’t cover all subjects and illuminate none”. In July, Australia became the first country to repeal a price on carbon emissions. The government is also looking to scrap the two key clean energy bodies – the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency – and is reviewing the country’s 20% renewable energy target. Australia currently has no policy to reduce carbon emissions, with the Coalition’s preferred replacement for carbon pricing, the Direct Action climate plan, facing severe opposition from Labor, the Greens and the Palmer United party in the Senate. Several independent analyses have cast doubt on whether the plan could meet Australia’s target of a 5% reduction in emissions by 2020, with the Department of the Environment recently admitting it has not done any modelling as to the scheme’s impact. The US president, Barack Obama, has pledged to cut emissions from power plants by 30% by 2030, on 2005 levels. This would be achieved by imposing strict new standards on coal-fired power stations that will push US states into cleaner forms of energy, Obama said. Last week the deputy Labor leader, Tanya Plibersek, told a meeting of US business leaders: “Nobody expects the G20 to be the meeting where people make binding commitments or talk about how exactly each country is going to reduce its climate emissions, but what the G20 can be is a statement that the G20 members understand that this is a pressing economic issue. “By contrast the United States is setting a very good example in this area.”"
"Extreme weather like the drought currently scorching the western US and the devastating floods in Pakistan in 2010 is becoming much more common, according to new scientific research. The work shows so-called “blocking patterns”, where hot or wet weather remains stuck over a region for weeks causing heatwaves or floods, have more than doubled in summers over the last decade. The new study may also demonstrate a link between the UK’s recent flood-drenched winter and climate change.  Climate scientists in Germany noticed that since 2000 there have been an “exceptional number of summer weather extremes, some causing massive damage to society”. So they examined the huge meanders in the high-level jet stream winds that dominate the weather at mid-latitudes, by analysing 35 years of wind data amassed from satellites, ships, weather stations and meteorological balloons. They found that blocking patterns, which occur when these meanders slow down, have happened far more frequently. “Since 2000, we have seen a cluster of these events. When these high-altitude waves become quasi-stationary, then we see more extreme weather at the surface,” said Dr Dim Coumou, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “It is especially noticeable for heat extremes.” The intense heatwaves in Russia in 2010, which saw 50,000 people die and the wheat harvest hit hard, and in western Europe in 2003, which saw 30,000 deaths, were both the result of blocking patterns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in 2011 that extreme weather would become more common as global warming heats the planet, causing both heatwaves and increasingly severe rain storms. The rise in blocking patterns correlates closely with the extra heating being delivered to the Arctic by climate change, according to the research which is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academies of Science (PNAS). Coumou and his colleagues argue there are good physical reasons to think there is a causal link, because the jet streams are driven by the difference in temperature between the poles and the equator. As the Arctic is warming more quickly than lower latitudes, that temperature difference is declining, providing less energy for the jet stream and its meanders, which are called Rossby waves. Prof Ted Shepherd, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, UK, but not involved in the work, said the link between blocking patterns and extreme weather was very well established. He added that the increasing frequency shown in the new work indicated climate change could bring rapid and dramatic changes to weather, on top of a gradual heating of the planet. “Circulation changes can have much more non-linear effects. They may do nothing for a while, then there might be some kind of regime change.” Shepherd said linking the rise in blocking events to Arctic warming remained “a bit speculative” at this stage, in particular because the difference between temperatures at the poles and equator is most pronounced in winter, not summer. But he noted that the succession of storms that caused England’s wettest winter in 250 years was a “very good example” of blocking patterns causing extreme weather during the coldest season. “The jet stream was stuck in one position for a long period, so a whole series of storms passed over England,” he said. Coumou acknowledges his study shows a correlation – not causation – between more frequent summer blocking patterns and Arctic warming. “To show causality, computer modelling studies are needed, but it is questionable how well current climate models can capture these effects,” he said. Prof Tim Palmer, at the University of Oxford, wrote in a PNAS article in 2013 that understanding changes to blocking patterns may well be the key to understanding changes in extreme weather, and therefore to understanding the worst impacts of climate change on society. But he said climate models might have to run down to scales of 1km to do so. “Currently, national climate institutes do not have the high-performance computing capability to simulate climate with 20km resolution, let alone 1km,” he wrote. “[I] look forward to the day when governments make the same investment in climate prediction as they have made in finding the Higgs boson.”"

"These are dark days for Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. On 29 July, the last major regulatory hurdle facing the development of Australia’s largest coal mine was removed by Greg Hunt, minister for the environment. The Carmichael coal mine, owned by India’s Adani Group, will cover 200 sq km and produce 60m tonnes of coal a year – enough to supply electricity for 100 million people. Located in Queensland’s Galilee Basin, 400km inland from the reef, it will require a major rail line, which is yet to receive final approval, to transport the coal, which must then be loaded on to ships at the ports of Hay Point and Abbot Point, near Gladstone on the Queensland coast, adjacent to the southern section of the reef. Both ports require dredging and expansion to manage the increased volume of shipping. Once aboard, the coal must be shipped safely through the coral labyrinth that is the Great Barrier Reef, and on to India, where it will be burned in great coal-fired power plants. The proposed development will affect the reef at just about every stage. Indeed, so vast is the project’s reach that it is best thought of not as an Australian, or even an Australian-Indian project, but one of global impact and significance.  Often hailed as one of the seven natural wonders of the world, the Great Barrier Reef stretches 1,400 miles along Queensland’s coast and covers an area the size of Germany. It is home to a truly extraordinary variety of living species. From giant grouper to tiny eels that inhabit the anuses of sea cucumbers, its creatures amaze the thousands who visit it each year, as well as the millions who watch it virtually through nature documentaries. But what fascinates scientists is the way the myriad reef organisms co-operate to create such a prolific ecosystem in what is an essentially unproductive sea. The trick lies in give and take: coral polyps and giant clams allow their tissues to be colonised by algae, which, in return for shelter and nutrients, provide food via photosynthesis. The reef organisms even co-operate to produce clouds, by releasing cloud-seeding molecules into the atmosphere, so that the reef is protected from ultraviolet radiation. Remarkably, the earliest evidence of this astonishing ecosystem is found not in Australia, but in the green hills near Verona in northern Italy. There, 54-million-year-old sediments laid down in a shallow lagoon preserved the remains of the oldest coral reef fish known. Just a million years earlier, the planet had been devastated by a gargantuan eruption of natural gas, which caused unprecedented greenhouse warming. The oceans turned acidic, corroding the sea floor; the waters warmed, and countless organisms perished in a great extinction event. The first modern reef-building and inhabiting creatures appeared in the wake of this cataclysm, and they have flourished ever since. When the region around Verona was a tropical lagoon, a seaway known as the Tethys stretched from Europe all the way across Asia to Australia. Reef organisms flourished in the ancient seaway, laying the foundations for today’s pan-tropical coral reef communities. But it was off the Queensland coast that these organisms found conditions most to their liking, allowing them to build the greatest coral wonderland on Earth. Today, the Carmichael mine development is occurring adjacent to what is now a very sick Great Barrier Reef. A 2012 study established that around half of the coral composing the reef is already dead – killed by pesticide runoff, muddy sediment from land clearing, predatory starfish, coral bleaching and various other impacts. The coal mine development will add significant new pressures. First will come the dredging for the new ports. The 5m or more tonnes of mud, along with whatever toxins they contain, will be dug up, transported and dumped into the middle of the reef area. Some studies suggest that the suffocating sediment will not drift far enough to harm the majority of the reef. But who can say what impact tides, currents or cyclones, which are frequent in the area, will have on the muddy mass? The raw coal itself will be another pollutant. Coal dust and coal fragments already find their way from stockpiles, conveyor belts and loaders into the waters of the reef. Indeed, existing coal loaders have already dumped enough coal for it to have spread along the length and breadth of the reef. In areas near the loaders, enough has accumulated to have a toxic effect on the corals that grow there. There is also the ever-present possibility of a coal ship running aground on the reef. The region is littered with wrecked vessels, and as the number of voyages increases such accidents become more probable. Even if the coal is safely shipped to India, and burned in coal-fired power plants there, the attack on the reef will continue. Within days or weeks, the carbon dioxide emitted from Indian smokestacks will have returned to the atmosphere over the reef. There it will have two major effects, best envisaged as heat and acid. The reef is exquisitely sensitive to global warming caused by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide because it sits atop a shallow and very broad continental shelf. Like a shallow saucer of water left in the sun, its waters warm rapidly, and are effectively cut off from cooler, deeper water that elsewhere helps dissipate the heat. Corals die from a curious cause when the water in which they grow warms up. Unaided, the coral polyp is unable to feed itself sufficiently. So it shelters algae in its tissues, which capture sunlight and produce food using photosynthesis, which is then shared by the coral. In what is a kind of business partnership, the coral contributes nutrients and shelter in return. But the algae can only photosynthesise efficiently in relatively cool water. As the water warms, the algae produces less food, until the algae costs the coral organism more than it is worth to maintain. Then the polyp ejects the algae. Incidentally, it’s the algae that give the coral its colour; and so when it’s ejected, the coral takes on a ghostly white hue, giving rise to the term “bleaching”. If the hot water lingers for six weeks or more, the polyps die of starvation, and a green slime replaces the wonders of the reef. The first bleached coral appeared on the Great Barrier Reef in the 1970s, and each decade since has seen more and more catastrophic bleaching events, some of which have killed up to 60% of the coral on the reef. You might think the corals could adapt, but studies show that the warming is now happening so fast that it is outstripping the ability of corals to migrate. Many scientists believe the vast majority of the reef will die if the planet warms by as little as 1.5C above its pre-industrial average. We are perilously close to having emitted sufficient greenhouse gas to achieve that. As if the warming isn’t bad enough, some of the carbon dioxide is dissolved into seawater, where it forms carbonic acid, causing a phenomenon known as ocean acidification. This makes it vastly harder for organisms to lay down a calcareous skeleton. Our oceans are already 30% more acidic than they were at the beginning of the industrial revolution, and in sensitive regions this is already having catastrophic effects. The north Pacific is particularly vulnerable to acidification, and it may offer some insights into what is ahead for the reef. Already, large economic and natural impacts have been felt as the north Pacific has acidified. Oyster spat (young oysters) for the entire north-west Pacific oyster industry are cultivated at two large facilities. Beginning in 2008-09, mass mortality of the spat began to occur due to acute acidification of the seawater drawn into the growing tanks. The hatcheries have adapted their regimes so spat can now be raised, but wild organisms all feel the full effect of the acidity. The impacts of acidity on corals are only now beginning to be investigated. Much remains to be learned, but all stages of the coral lifecycle appear to be vulnerable, with fears that the effects will be greatest on eggs and spawn. Australia’s cavalier attitude to its great reef makes little sense without knowing about its coal industry. It is powerful in a way that few industries globally are. Until recently, Australia controlled a greater proportion of the seaborne coal trade than Saudi Arabia did the oil trade. Domestically, coal-fired power plants provided 90% of the nation’s electricity. The coal barons have made it their business to ensure that nothing gets in the way of their profits. But much has changed in the past five years. Coal prices are at a historic low, and as electricity demand has fallen, and renewables have expanded, coal now supplies a mere 69% of the nation’s electricity. The industry has woken up to the threat it faces, and it’s now putting all its efforts into self-defence. What it sees as bureaucratic “green tape” – ie, environmental regulation – has been high on its agenda, as it tries to breathe new life into stalled coal projects. This is not the first time the reef has been threatened with destruction. In the 1960s, proposals were developed by the premier of Queensland, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, to mine the reef for fertiliser for the state’s sugar cane fields, and to drill the corals for oil and gas. Were it not for the catastrophic consequences for marine life of the Torrey Canyon oil spill on the south-west coast of the UK in 1967, the proposal may have gone ahead. As it was, the Australian federal government granted the reef a measure of protection instead, creating the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to allow for wiser management in the future. Today, ordinary Australians are waking up once more to the dire threat facing their reef. They are joined by a thriving tourism industry. With marine tourism alone earning $4bn a year for the local economy, it’s the most profitable business in the reef region. It is also a large employer, pushing local public sentiment very much on to the side of protection. If the Carmichael coal mine is a global story, and the Great Barrier Reef a global asset, then the issue should not be left to Australia alone to decide. The citizens of the world deserve a say on whether their children should have the opportunity to see the wonder that is the reef. Opportunities to do this abound. Petitioning national governments to put climate change on the agenda of the G20 summit, to be held in Australia in November this year, is one. Pushing governments to play a constructive role at the 2015 climate negotiations in Paris is another, as is letting the Australian government know directly that everybody has a stake in the reef, and that it needs to act to secure its future. The Great Barrier Reef does not have to die in a greenhouse disaster like the one that devastated the world’s oceans 55 million years ago. But if we don’t act decisively, and soon, to stem our greenhouse gas emissions, it will. This article was amended on 4 August 2014. An earlier version referred to carbolic acid.

"Just a few years ago, funding for energy efficiency projects seemed doomed. But now it’s surging back:  At the same time, retirement funds and private equity firms are analyzing ways to create their own efficiency bond funds. What’s driving this new surge of financing for efficiency? I see a convergence of four factors that are key to fundamental market transformations: Energy costs have shifted from a background concern to a critical issue for a growing number of companies. Large data centers were among the early movers in efficiency since energy is often their largest expense after employees. Now agricultural companies increasingly worry about the impact of the price fluctuations of oil on their crops. Industrial customers – the sector that will be largest consumer of energy by 2020 – don’t debate carbon regulations anymore but instead plan how to meet them.  With the International Energy Agency estimating that $8tn will get spend worldwide on efficiency between now and 2035, energy has simply become part of doing business. We’re living in the golden age of efficiency technology. LED lighting is expected to grow from 6% of the market to 75% by 2020. Solar panels have dropped from over $75 a watt to nearly $0.50 a watt. Even energy storage is percolating into the mainstream after decades of development. We can expect to see more changes over the next 10 years than in the last 50.   It’s not just hardware, either – the importance of software is almost impossible to underestimate combined with technologies like smart thermostats providing instant information on how much energy you’re using – a huge change from waiting for a bill. The main impediment to past efficiency efforts has been a lack of funds. “As-a-service” models solve this problem by funding efficiency through savings. Various models exist - Pace, On-Bill Payment, ESCOs – but the goal is ultimately the same: to make the cost invisible. While paying for upgrades through savings has been around for years, what makes it more appealing to customers now is that smart technologies can provide certainty that what you can measure, you can monetize. It is particularly interesting that the model can be applied to everything from luxury hotels to middle-income housing. When you have Texas and California – the two most populous states in the union – competing for green job growth, you know that sustainability and efficiency are trends that have moved beyond early adopters. That bears out in the building industries: commercial and residential contractors, lighting specialists and electricians are virtually all shifting their businesses to accommodate demand for efficiency. Having contractors and consultants on board is critical to mainstreaming energy efficiency because they are the people who get things done. Imagine how long the auto industry would have taken to evolve without independent mechanics or gas stations, or how long it would have taken the computer industry to grow without IT managers. As long as we have a dynamic market, efficiency may always face certain challenges. Shifting energy prices can make attention to curbing energy use wax and wane. Promising new businesses and technologies sometimes fizzle out – which in turn may cool the interest of some funders. But I see the momentum created by these four factors – customer awareness, technology, business models and distribution channels – creating a classic virtuous cycle where customer demand fuels innovation and competition, which in turn fuel financing and further growth. The result will be bigger than we can imagine. Chris Hummel is the chief marketing officer of Schneider Electric. The finance hub is funded by EY.

"British actor Emma Thompson has staged a solo protest against Tony Abbott’s stance on climate change during a trip to the icy wilderness of the Arctic. Thompson singled out the Australian prime minister for criticism while on a visit to the remote island of Spitsbergen. She is pictured holding a sign that reads: “Tony Abbott climate change is real, I’m standing on it!”  Abbott previously called the science of climate change “crap” but has recently been at pains, while leading the world’s first repeal of a carbon price, to stress his acceptance that human activity is altering the world’s climate. Thompson visited the Smeerenburg glacier in the north-west of Spitsbergen, which is part of the Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. The double Oscar-winning actor is travelling in the region, along with her 14-year-old daughter, on the Greenpeace ship Esperanza to highlight the threat posed by climate change.  A study published in Nature last year found that Arctic sea ice had melted at a rate of 8% each decade over the past 30 years, driven by warming temperatures. Thompson and Greenpeace also want a legal sanctuary to be declared to protect the Arctic from oil drilling and industrial fishing. Thompson said: “We’re told that it is all our fault, global warming – we want the fuel, we want our cars, and that the oil industry is merely responding to the needs of a greedy public. “But that’s simply not fair. Most of us want to live cleaner lives, but our governments don’t make these things easily available. “The changes we need, that the Arctic needs, must come from the top as well as the bottom. We need electric cars to be cheaper and more accessible. We want safer bike lanes in every big city. “We want plastic bags to be banned for good. We need governments to stand up to the dirty industries that have for so long funded and controlled them, and to give us all an affordable chance to live our lives in a more sustainable way.”"

"The carbon tax is no more. I've already said a great deal on the live blog this week about how absurd this is – to repeal a policy that various pieces of evidence suggested was working – and replace it with either nothing, or with next to nothing. I have been a supporter of carbon pricing since I first understood it was a valid public policy response to constraining carbon pollution. I was a supporter of the concept when John Howard pursued in 2007, and have been a consistent supporter of a market based mechanism to reduce emissions ever since. I was a supporter when Greg Hunt, as an up and coming junior minister in the Howard government, moved decisively behind the scenes to get his then boss to support emissions trading.  This policy has the virtue of being economically rational and consistent with the balance of available climate science. Even if you argue the toss on the science, if you think somehow you know better than people who have dedicated their professional lives to understanding climate science, then carbon pricing, on the balance of the evidence is a reasonable piece of public policy risk management – a sound precautionary principle. In Australia, despite multipartisan screw ups, despite Labor making a total hash of this, the Greens making the perfect the enemy of the good, despite all the populist clap trap from the Coalition under Tony Abbott on this subject, the parliament actually implemented carbon pricing.  The US, under the current president, would like to implement carbon pricing but cannot because of legislative deadlock. Now we've undone it, and it's not clear whether there will be another opportunity to replace what is now gone. I know Abbott went to the election promising to scrap this policy. Of course the prime minister should be congratulated for upholding his election promises as a point of principle. But given he's broken so many other election promises, I wish he'd added this to the list. This would have been a terrific election commitment to break. Wrong way, parliament of Australia. Go back."
"There has been a lot of attention on ice at the southern pole of the Earth. To be clear, the Earth’s climate is changing and the Earth is getting warmer. This means that the oceans are warming, the atmosphere is warming, sea levels are rising, and ice is melting. In fact, the Earth’s ice is melting almost everywhere. In the Arctic, sea ice is in a long-term retreat, the Greenland ice sheet is melting, so is the Antarctic ice sheet as are the world’s glaciers. But, there is a perplexing anomaly. The sea ice (ice floating on water) that surrounds the Antarctic appears to be growing. Scientists want to know why.  There are many hypotheses, and my colleague Dana Nuccitelli has written about this recently, but here I add a few emerging points. For instance, we know that there is an enormous amount of ice atop the Antarctic ice sheet that is melting each year. Since ice is much fresher than sea water (less salty), the resulting freshwater is creating a fresher zone of water surrounding the continent. The presence of fresh water affects how easily ice can form.  Another view has looked at the quality of the measurements themselves. Could some of the increase be a spurious trend in the measurements themselves? This view was investigated in a very recent publication by Ian Eisenman and colleagues. What the authors found was that a change in sensor calibration caused a shift that has been interpreted as ice acceleration. In the abstract, the authors state, Specifically we find that a change in the intercalibration across a 1991 sensor transition when the data set was reprocessed in 2007 caused a substantial change in the long-term trend. Although our analysis does not definitively identify whether this change introduced an error or removed one, the resulting difference in the trends suggests that a substantial error exists in either the current data set or the version that was used prior to the mid-2000s… furthermore, a number of recent studies have investigated physical mechanisms for the observed expansion of the Antarctic sea ice cover. The results of this analysis raise the possibility that much of this expansion may be a spurious artifact of an error in the processing of satellite observations. First, we should understand how challenging this problem is. Satellites can measure microwave emission from the ground level. The energy emitted by sea ice differs from the energy emitted by open water. Furthermore, the energy emitted by a surface changes with temperature. As a consequence, it becomes difficult to distinguish between cooler ice temperatures and warmer water temperatures, for example. So, different algorithms have been developed to make these distinctions and the algorithms have changed over time. The image below shows that moving from one algorithm to another (red to blue) caused a shift in 1991 and a significant difference of ice extent from the IPCC AR4 (black square in right image) to the more recent AR5 (black circle in right image). An easier way to view the impact of the algorithm switch is shown below which plots the difference between the methods. There, the 1991 jump is clearly evidence. I communicated with the lead author, Dr. Eisenman who made a number of points. First, this study does not find a flaw in the IPCC report, rather this study shows that a change in the state of science at the time the reports were created. Further, he helped me assess the impact of the new findings. He told me that if the former methodology is correct, it means that the rate of ice expansion has been over estimated. Ice would still be expanding but at a substantially slower rate than recent estimates. If the latter method is correct, it means our recent estimates of ice expansion are correct. But remember, regardless of what is happening to the sea ice, it is clear that the Antarctic is losing ice overall as water from the great ice sheet melts into the ocean. This is why science is exciting. Real science exists on the edge of our knowledge. My own view is that there is some ice growth from the water freshening that I discussed earlier and some because of changes to the Antarctic Circumpolar current. But I don’t think that is sufficient to explain the recent increase. I think these authors are on to something. Only time will tell what the real story is. "
"The recent heat waves will have claimed lives among the elderly and vulnerable, but until death statistics are studied the precise numbers will not be known. Government advisors say improved ventilation, tinted windows and external insulation are cost effective measures that could be installed in existing houses, hospitals and care homes to reduce the health impact. Already 90 per cent of hospital wards are prone to overheating.  But the government's Adaptation Sub-Committee reports that houses currently being built in the UK are designed for ""yesterday's climate"" and will not protect people from weather extremes. They predict that premature deaths from overheating could triple to 7,000 a year by 2050 and today's poor standards will contribute to that. The committee reviews all sorts of threats to life and property from climate change and points out that the country saved a lot of money because improved sea defences managed to hold out against last December's record storm surge. Some industries, notably the power companies and some train operators are adapting to climate change but many are not. Three quarters of existing flood defence structures are still not being properly maintained and not enough is being spent on safeguarding ports, airports and water supplies and protecting roads against future heat and flooding. One problem anticipated by the report is thunderstorms causing severe local flooding, partly due to inadequate drainage on new developments. The committee says that a report six years ago urged new regulations to tackle this problem but so far the government has done nothing."
"Federal wildlife officials plan to withdraw proposed protections for the snow-loving wolverine Tuesday, in a course reversal that highlights lingering uncertainties over what a warming climate means for some temperature-sensitive species. Wolverines, or “mountain devils”, need deep snows to den. But while there is broad consensus that climate change will make the world warmer, drilling down to determine what that means for individual species remains difficult.  US Fish and Wildlife Service director Dan Ashe said predictions about climate change’s localized impacts remain “ambiguous”. Rejecting the conclusions of the agency’s own scientists, Ashe said that made it impossible to determine whether less snow cover would put wolverines in danger of extinction in coming decades. The decision carries potential ramifications for other species affected by climate change – from Alaska’s bearded seals and the Pacific walrus to dozens of species of corals – as scientists and regulators grapple with limits on computer climate models. The Associated Press obtained the decision prior to a formal announcement expected Tuesday. “Climate change is a reality,” Ashe said. “What we don’t know with reliability is what does climate change mean for denning habitat that wolverines prefer.” He added, “It’s possible wolverines are adapting and continuing to adapt.” Federal wildlife officials last year had said future temperature increases could melt snowfields in high elevation mountain ranges in the lower 48 states where wolverines are found. They called for increased protections to keep the species from going extinct. The first indication that stance had changed came last month, in leaked memo from a Fish and Wildlife regional director in Denver who overturned her staff’s recommendations for more wolverine protections. Wildlife advocates blamed the reversal on pressure from state wildlife agencies. They said they intend to sue Ashe’s agency in federal court to force it to adopt protections. Officials from western states including Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Idaho had opposed federal protections, and said the animal’s population has increased in some areas in recent decades. That’s similar to what happened to the bearded seal. It received protections from the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2012 only to lose them last month, when a federal judge sided with Alaska officials who said 100-year projections of sea ice losses were based on speculation. At least two other species, the American pika and black-footed albatross, were denied protections in recent years after the government concluded some of the animals might die off because of climate change, but enough would survive to keep the populations viable. But Ashe said when the evidence is clear his agency will act, such as the 2008 decision to list the polar bear as a threatened species because of sea ice losses in arctic from global warming. For wolverines, the withdrawal also means an end to the federal government’s proposal to re-introduce the species to the southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico. Ashe said he intends to encourage the state’s governors to pursue reintroductions on their own. Once found throughout the Rocky Mountains and in California’s Sierra Nevada mountain range, wolverines were wiped out across most of the US by the 1930s due to unregulated trapping and poisoning campaigns, said Bob Inman, a wolverine researcher with the Wildlife Conservation Society. In the decades since, they have largely recovered in the northern Rockies, where 250 to 300 of the animals live, but not in other parts of their historical range. Steve Running, a University of Montana ecology professor and member of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said computer models used to predict future temperatures and precipitation amounts become less accurate as they go further out in time. That makes it hard to localize potential impacts. But Running added that climate trajectories over recent decades give an accurate depiction of what’s in store and should be used by wildlife managers now to make long-term decisions. Over the past 50 years, he said, the snow melt in the northern Rockies has shifted two weeks earlier in the spring. “If you take 50 more years and think of it as two more weeks earlier, wolverines are probably one of the classic poster children of a highly temperature-sensitive animal,” he said."
"Our economic future cannot be separated from our environmental future. Advocates for trade must understand this and seize the perfect opportunity to prove that freer trade can combat climate change and contribute to more overall sustainability. Freeing trade and fighting climate change are often portrayed as separate causes, ever at odds, working at cross-purposes, while contributing unavoidably to inevitable trade-offs between economic growth and environmental preservation. The two causes are pursued in separate silos of global concern through separate negotiations employing separate policy and legal languages.  But the landscape is changing. The US, China, the European Union's 28 member states, and 11 others among the 160 member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have launched negotiations to eliminate global tariffs on green goods. There is now the very real prospect that the first binding global agreement to fight climate change will come from what may seem to many an unlikely source – the WTO. Initially, these new trade talks are solely about tariffs. Total global trade in environmental goods such as wind turbines and solar panels amounts to $1tn and growing fast. Tariffs on some of these products are as high as 35%. Eliminating needless taxes at the world's borders would speed the flow of new green technologies to all the places in the world that need them urgently in the struggle to confront climate change. This tariff-cutting will be no easy task. The WTO has been labouring without success to liberalise trade in environmental goods and services in global trade negotiations for more than a dozen years now. The decision of this subset of WTO members to deal with the issue of green goods separately is a good sign. But hurdles remain. The biggest hurdle will be agreeing on a definition of an ""environmental good"". Is it one whose purpose is environmental protection? Or should the definition be broader? Should it include goods that perform more efficiently or environmentally than the alternatives? How about goods that are made in a green way? What about green component parts? Trade negotiators seem inclined for now toward a fairly narrow definition. They have chosen to begin with a list of 54 environmental products. This list is a good starting point – but only a starting point. Another hurdle will be agreeing upfront on how to add new products easily as green technologies continue to evolve. WTO members have learned this lesson from their frustrating experience with an agreement abolishing tariffs on information technology products. The IT product list is frozen in 1996. Negotiators are trying now to add such ""newfangled"" IT products as tablets and smart phones. The goal is for these tariff cuts to take effect once enough WTO Members have joined that they account for a ""critical mass"" of world trade in environmental goods. The countries launching the negotiations account for 86% of that trade. A ""critical mass"" may be viewed as 90%. At that point, the tariff cuts would be extended to all 160 WTO Members – including those who have not yet signed the agreement. Tariff-cutting, however, will have only a minor effect on overall global carbon emissions. The larger challenge for trade negotiators will be to show that these new efforts in the WTO can lead to more than merely tariff-cutting. A WTO agreement to eliminate duties on green goods must become the foundation for a broader agreement to confront climate change on many fronts by promoting global trade in sustainable energy. Beyond tariff-cutting is the greater opportunity for the WTO. Why stop by simply eliminating border taxes on trade in environmental goods? Why not do much more? Why not prove that the supposed choice between economics and environment is often a false choice, and that efforts to promote trade and protect the climate can and must be mutually reinforcing? By all means, eliminate tariffs. But make that only the beginning. Go on to eliminate barriers, too, to trade in environmental services. Address standards, regulations and other non-tariff trade barriers that are often more restrictive than tariffs. Strengthen intellectual property regimes for clean innovations. Enhance the sustainability of global supply chains. Encourage sustainable government purchases. Call a halt to duelling trade remedies over green subsidies. And take real action to discipline energy subsidies of all kinds in ways that promote sustainability. Serve trade and climate together by transforming this proposed tariff agreement into a comprehensive sustainable energy trade agreement for all the world.

"In the time it takes you to read this blog post, eight fluffy climate policy teddy bears with cute little green hearts on their chests will have been stabbed to death and their stuffing pulled out for use as a pan scourer by your friendly neighbourhood coal mining magnate. Now I don’t really know what I mean by any of that, but it seems to fit the surrealist circus sideshow mood of the climate policy debate in Australia right about now.  And by the time you have read this blog post who knows what the policy outlook might be? Will we have a price on greenhouse gas emissions, or will we not? Will we have a policy that charges polluters for the waste emissions they pump into the air or, as is the wont of the Abbott Government, a policy that asks taxpayers to pay for polluters to cut their emissions? Will the public get a guaranteed refund on any costs of the carbon price… you know, like the one that already exists under the current legislation and compensates the vast majority of taxpayers for minuscule cost of living increases? One thing that can never be taken away, however, is the surrealist vision of climate campaigner and former US vice president Al Gore standing with Clive Palmer to endorse the fickle policy hopes of the latter - a man who wants to mine 40 million tonnes of coal from Queensland’s Galilee Basin and in so doing liberate an estimated 3,291 million tonnes of CO2-e into the atmosphere over 30 years. You just couldn’t make it up. But if you’re desperate for a little sliver of stability from this climate policy fandango, then fear not. Because the phrase “the more things change, the more they stay the same” could just about define the last few months of Australia’s climate policy debate. In real terms, nothing has actually changed at all, regardless of what happens in the coming days or over the course of me typing out this blog post. That’s because Australia’s target to cut emissions by the year 2020 remains at just five per cent based on their levels in 2000. When the statutory Climate Change Authority reviewed Australia’s current target, the group described it as “inadequate” and recommended it should be tripled. This level of cuts would mean Australia’s entire budget for emitting greenhouse gases between 2013 and 2020 would stand at 4,193 tonnes of CO2-e (or to put it another way, a carbon budget eventually two thirds-swallowed by one proposed Palmer coal mine). Remember too, this is the same Climate Change Authority (CCA) now apparently supported by billionaire Clive Palmer – the man who emerged as a policy powerbroker thanks to the eponymous political party he created out of thin air and his personal mining fortune. The chances of the Abbott Government heeding the advice of the CCA appear as distant now as ever. If the Abbott Government is successful at getting its “direct action” policy legislated, then the Prime Minister has already said there’ll be no extra cash if his policy falls short the five per cent target (most analysts would replace my conjunction ‘if’ with the word ‘when’). But back to the Faustian pact, of sorts, negotiated between Palmer and Gore to retain Australia’s renewable energy target and save the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The deal was described by those who made it happen as a chance to avoid “a big step backwards” as both measures are seen as vital to supporting growth in renewable energy. The fact that this was apparently achieved by putting Al Gore in a room with a coal miner must have left some climate campaigners scratching their heads. But regardless of the outcome of the coming days, the Australian Government must still take its “inadequate” five per cent target, its dislike of clean energy financing and its unwavering support for the coal industry into rooms of international negotiators over the next 18 months. There, Australia will still likely be viewed internationally by many as a climate change turncoat. A nation once praised as a leader but now viewed as a laggard. The fact that Australia was seen as a climate change ‘leader’ while it was (and still is) shooting for the top of the world’s coal and gas export charts should be seen for what it was. Prime Minister Abbott probably still won’t be going to the summit of world leaders being convened in September by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to try and boost ambitions on greenhouse gas cuts. But while Abbott can choose not to show his face in New York, the Australian government cannot conceivably avoid having to front up to UN climate change meetings in Lima, Peru, at the end of this year. That’s when it is hoped the bulk of the work will be done to draft a new global agreement on cutting greenhouse gas emissions to be signed a year later in Paris. As a process that works on consensus, Australia has the option of placing a veto on anything it doesn’t like and in turn slowing down the entire global negotiating progress. If that happens, then the enduring images of the PalmGore sideshow will quickly fade (well yeh OK, some things cannot be 'unseen', but you get my drift)."
"""Nuclear power remains, prospectively, one of the cheapest low-carbon technologies and can play an important role as part of a cost-effective portfolio of technologies to decarbonise the power sector."" As the Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, this is something you’d expect me to say, but this is the viewpoint of the Committee on Climate Change in its progress report to Parliament earlier this month.  Recently, Tom Burke wrote on these pages of the ""costly gamble"" of investing in new nuclear because of rising renewable energy output. I’m afraid that the ""costly gamble"" will be not investing in new nuclear plants. I’m not arguing against renewables, but it isn’t the answer alone.   The UK needs a mix of low-carbon sources of energy. This must include nuclear. Renewables cannot provide power to the grid 24/7 even though the UK gets as much as 15% of its electricity from these sources. So, one versus the other isn’t the answer – it must be a combination of both. A cost-effective portfolio of technologies, to quote the committee again.  Nuclear can support power to the grid 24/7 and with an ambitious plan for building new nuclear plants, it could provide an even greater proportion of the electricity needed in the UK. It is a fallacy to try to compare renewables with nuclear as both will work in different situations. Nuclear can provide a continuous supply to the electricity grid, while renewables will be reliant on the elements.  The government estimates that by 2025 the UK will need 60GW of new electricity generating capacity and the infrastructure to run it. Of this, 35GW would come from renewables and 25GW would come from other sources, including nuclear power.  The first of the new nuclear plants will be Hinkley Point C in Somerset. However, Burke questioned the ‘strike price’ – the minimum price paid for the electricity generated agreed between EDF Energy who will build the plant and the government. To quote the committee's report again, it stated specifically on Hinkley that ""the agreed strike price therefore offers good value for money and the potential for significant cost savings from a new nuclear programme in the UK"". All large infrastructure investment projects – be it new nuclear capacity, a new wind farm or solar farm – have a strike price. Burke argued that the Hinkley price of £92.50/MWh was too high, but compare that with the offshore wind farm price of £155/MWh and £120/MWh for a large solar farm.  Over its lifetime of at least 60 years, Hinkley Point C is expected to contribute £2bn to the economy – £100 million of that will directly benefit the local economy through each year of construction.  The UK hasn’t built a new nuclear power station for 20 years and all of the current stations will begin to retire in the next 15 years or so. If we don’t build new ones, that means we could potentially lose a fifth of electricity which is generated on home soil, meaning we’d have to import more. We’d lose a low-carbon source of energy generation which for each kilowatt hour only emits 5g of CO2, compared to 900g from coal-fired. We’d potentially lose a major component of the UK’s science and engineering base too.  But building this new nuclear capacity will mean thousands of jobs. Our own conservative estimates put this at a peak of 32,500 jobs annually, some have put it more towards 100,000 when retiring current plants and simultaneous build of new plants are taken into account.  Upwards of 5,000 apprenticeships will be created across new build, creating much needed jobs and training for young people.  Annual exports from the nuclear industry could increase from £700m a year to up to £1.6bn. We’re already seeing workers from Sellafield going to share their knowledge and experience with other countries, and research and innovation from our universities is also helping other countries in decommissioning and management.  Yes, building a new nuclear power plant takes time. By starting the process now, the UK can increase its secure low carbon electricity generation, in tandem with renewables, ensuring the country continues to decarbonise the UK’s energy supply and contributing to economic growth creating long term, high quality jobs.  • Keith Parker is chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association"
"Australia’s position as one of the best places in the world to live was reaffirmed last week with the release of the 2014 United Nations Human Development Report, which saw Australia ranked second only to Norway among all nations in the world. The report, conducted by the UN Development Report Office, measures each nation against a number of criteria, including income, health, education and gender equality to rank 187 nations according to the Human Development Index (HDI). Australia’s second ranking is not surprising. Not just because other measures such as the OECD’s Better life Index rank Australia as first, but because since 1998 Australia has been ranked in the top five nations on the HDI. Only Norway has had a longer run in the top five. The HDI attempts to combine all elements of life into a single number. And while it has some basic measurements for health and education, such as longevity and years of schooling, each component is also broken down by sub-components. Crucially, while income is a major indicator of a nation’s position on the index, all categories are weighted. Thus while Australia is only ranked nineteenth according to gross national income per capita, because we are ranked highly on life expectancy and education our overall ranking on the HDI is well above nations like Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Luxembourg, which have higher incomes per capita. The report, however, is not just about who is “winning”, but also discovering which nations are not developing as well as others – or those which are going backwards. Overall, the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest nations has actually improved since the 1980s. In 1980, the average HDI score of the top 10 nations was about double that of the nations ranked 100th to 110th . Now the average score of the top 10 is only about 25% higher than those nations ranked 100th to 110th . But while the world as a whole has developed, massive problems persist. The report found that more than 2.2 billion people are either near or “living in” what the report defines as “multidimensional poverty” – that is poverty measured by health, education and living standards. The report also noted that “more than 15 per cent of the world’s people remain vulnerable to multidimensional poverty” and “about 12 per cent (842 million) suffer from chronic hunger. Nearly half of all workers – more than 1.5 billion – are in informal or precarious employment.” So for those of you who have noticed that permanent full-time work is becoming harder to come by, you are not alone. And while the poorest nations have improved their situation over the past 30 years, that does not mean inequality itself has diminished as an issue. Indeed, the report notes the jaw-dropping statistic that “the 85 richest people in the world have the same wealth as the 3.5 billion poorest people”. The inequality between developed and developing nations as a whole might be declining, but within those nations inequality is chronic. The report found that “between 1990 and 2010 income inequality in developing countries rose 11 per cent”. In effect, developing nations are getting richer, but due mostly to the richest people in those nations getting richer, rather than everyone. Among the most developed nations, inequality also remains prevalent. The report has a rather intriguing index that adjusts the HDI for inequality. On this adjusted measure Norway and Australia remain first and second, but some nations are greatly affected. The US, for example, drops from fifth to 28th on the HDI once inequality is taken into account: The report also examines gender inequality by comparing the performance of men and women against each of the HDI components. On this measure, Australia again does well. Australian men’s HDI is ranked first while Australian women are ranked second. And when looking at income, the estimated difference between male and female gross national income per capita is much less in Australia than most highly developed nations: The breakdown of each component also reveals some interesting aspects. On health, Australia ranks highly on life expectancy but poorly on obesity. Our total health expenditure is actually among the lowest for developed nations which, given our overall health ranking, suggests it’s an efficient spend of money. But somewhat surprisingly, the amount of health expenditure spent directly by households is quite high – almost as high as in the US and well above that of the UK: With regards to education, Australia again does well on measures like education attendance and years spent in schooling. But on measures of performance in mathematics, reading and science, Australia’s secondary students are only in the middle of the pack. Interestingly, while Australia’s education expenditure is also low, of the top seven nations ranked by students’ average score, only Estonia and Finland spend more than Australia does – suggesting, while expenditure may be important, it is certainly not the primary determinant of a nation’s educational performance. The report also examines environmental factors, such as depletion of forests and withdrawal of the nation’s fresh water supply. It notes that “climate change poses grave risks to all people and all countries” and that “between 2000 and 2012 more than 200 million people, most of them in developing countries, were hit by natural disasters every year, especially by floods and droughts”. On this score Australia has a fair bit to be embarrassed about. In 2012, among the 25 most developed nations, Australia was among the lowest users of renewable energy and had the third highest emissions of CO2 per capita: The report notes that “no country anywhere will be immune to the long-term effects of climate change” and that the way the world tackles climate change ... “can be critically important for reducing the frequency and magnitude of [developmental] shocks”. So while our overall HDI score suggests we are leading the way, given the repeal of the carbon price and moves to weaken or remove the renewable energy target, the way Australia is tackling climate change is certainly not something the world should follow."

"Edelman, America’s biggest public relations firm, has for the first time formally declared it will not take on campaigns that deny global warming, in response to an investigation by the Guardian. However it is unclear on its commitment to existing clients that have been involved in spreading doubt about climate change and fighting regulations to cut carbon pollution. The explicit rejection comes in response to a story earlier this week that saw a number of top firms in the industry – but not Edelman – declare as a matter of company policy that they viewed climate change as a threat, and that they would not take on clients or campaigns that deny climate change.  In an apparent damage control exercise, the PR firm alerted the Guardian to what may be the industry’s first official position on climate denial. A statement on its website reads: “Edelman fully recognises the reality of, and science behind, climate change, and believes it represents one of the most important global challenges facing society, business and government today. To be clear, we do not accept client assignments that aim to deny climate change.” Michael Bush, a spokesman for Edelman, expressed regret for the company’s earlier response. “Unfortunately, that position was not fully shared … when [the Guardian] initially reached out to us.” Edelman and other top PR firms earn millions every year crafting messages and campaigns surrounding climate change. Edelman reportedly had earnings of $747m last year, and has represented the powerful oil industry lobby, the American Petroleum Institute (API), as well as conservative groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), that oppose Barack Obama’s environmental agenda. After other industry leaders such as WPP and Weber Shandwick came out against climate deniers, an Edelman executive, Ben Boyd, told a Chicago radio programme: “we do not work for deniers”. Boyd also said the company would “scrub, on a daily basis, our client roster and look at the behaviours of our clients”. The commitment was a departure for Edelman, which earlier told the Guardian it took on clients on a case-by-case basis. “Expanding the dialogue in a constructive manner, and driving productive outcomes to solve energy challenges are the key criteria for evaluating client engagements,”Bush added in an email. Edelman had also been reluctant to respond to an earlier survey by the Climate Investigations Centre, inadvertently emailing researchers: “There are only wrong answers to this guy”. Kert Davies, the founder of Climate Investigations, said the Edelman’s position was an important shift. “Edelman’s position on climate change before this statement was at best opaque. Now they might be the first big PR firm to actually have a published ‘position’ on climate change and rejecting climate science denial,” he wrote in an email. “This is a big step … and it might pull the rest of the industry along to take a firm stance on climate change.” However, Edelman still left itself room for manoeuvre. Bush later backpedalled on Boyd’s commitment to “scrub” the client roster, writing in an email: “We did not intend to suggest that we have launched a ‘scrubbing’ operation of our client roster, but that we continually look at our client portfolio. As you might imagine with thousands of clients it’s an ongoing exercise.” He also declined to say whether Edelman had let go or “scrubbed” clients – such as API and Alec that have been involved in spreading doubt about climate change and fighting regulations to cut carbon pollution. Edelman has a rigorous in-house carbon accounting system. In a blogpost last month, its chief executive, Richard Edelman, wrote that business should be involved in seeking market solutions to climate change and expressed concern that some 40% of Americans believe that humans are not changing the climate. “There is a significant failure of communications regarding the environment,” Edelman wrote. API has lobbied hard to expand oil and gas drilling, and speed construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from the Alberta tar sands. A carefully crafted statement on the API website does not explicitly deny the science of global warming, but it does inject an element of doubt where there is none over the link between the burning of fossil fuels and climate change. “While we rely on them for most of our energy and will likely do so for years to come, emissions from their production and use may be helping to warm our planet by enhancing the natural greenhouse effect of the atmosphere,” API says on its website. Alec meanwhile has sought to roll back clean energy rules and tax homeowners who install solar panels. Or as Boyd told WBEZ in Chicago this week: “We do not work for deniers, but we recognise that there is great nuance and grey in this conversation.”"
"Even before I was a travel writer, I approached sights described as ""magical"" with a good deal of skepticism. Too often, I have been promised miracles and delivered slights-of-hand – the usual bravura and bluff of tourism. The bioluminescent bay in Vieques, Puerto Rico was one of the few places that made good on its promises. Maybe the only one. By day, the warm shallow bay looked unremarkable, even somewhat dingy compared to the crystalline waters of nearby Caribbean beaches. But at night, the flash and spark of the tiny phytoplankton in this Mangrove lagoon filled me with literal awe. It was like living lightning. Since January, however, the bay has gone dark – and no one knows why.  Theories abound, as a number of articles have explored in the last few months: too much human usage, or strong winds that have disturbed the bay's infinitesimal inhabitants. Like many rare ecosystems, bioluminescent bays are fragile, and the shifting patterns of both weather and tourism can affect them greatly. But it's been hard not to notice what's been missing from these discussions: climate change. This oversight is particularly glaring given that this isn't the first of Puerto Rico's bioluminescent bays to go dark in the last year. Grand Lagoon – just a ferry ride away from Vieques in the town of Fajardo – went out for most of last November. The same explanations were debated then: unprecedented extreme weather events, or run-off from several nearby construction sites. No doubt either – or both – were contributing factors. But somehow, the conversation (at least in the media) never seemed to connect what was happening in Fajardo with global environmental concerns. Given the ever-increasingly serious warnings about climate change – which 97% of climate scientists now agree is caused by human activity – it would seem to merit at least a small place in the popular discussion of these back-to-back mysterious ecological collapses. Scientists who specialize in bioluminescent plankton have – to little fanfare – already warned us that these creatures are endangered. Two years ago, Dr Michael Latz, a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, told New Scientist magazine that ""as global warming changes ocean flows, these micro-organisms are increasingly at risk"". Scientists at Canada's Dalhousie University showed that, since 1950, the worldwide population of phytoplankton has declined by 40% due to the rising sea surface temperatures caused by a warming planet. We also know that the indirect effects of climate change have dangerous ramifications – the likes of which we are only just beginning to comprehend. Those strong winds and extreme weather events that have buffeted the bays? Increased sea surface temperatures – driven by climate change – may contribute to them as well, as we know from studying hurricanes. ""The intensity, frequency, and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes ... have all increased since the early 1980s"" reports the 2014 Third National Climate Assessment: ""The recent increases in activity are linked, in part, to higher sea surface temperatures."" Like a pot being brought to boil, the seas are heating up. The first time I visited Vieques in 2006, tour operators encouraged me to swim and kayak in the bay, but told me to avoid the motorboats, since their dirty engines created diesel-fuel dead zones. Since then, locals have developed new conservation guidelines: no swimming or touching the water with your skin at all – things I wish I had known not to do. But these and other protections have done nothing to save the bay's famed bioluminescent organisms. But this isn't just about one or two tourist attractions on small islands in the Caribbean. Bioluminescent bays are rare because they are much more fragile than your average marine ecosystem. Like canaries in the proverbial coal mine, their loss is a warning that hardier creatures and more common shores will be endangered soon. I was taught in elementary school that we live in a world with five oceans – an idea that feels laughable now. There is only one ocean – the world ocean, a vastness that ignores the political demarcations of maps and men. Its problems cannot be solved piecemeal, and more and more studies suggest that we might not ""solve"" them at all. Long before we detonated the first nuclear bomb or undertook a Cold War, nature invented the idea of mutually assured destruction – and she might just hold true to her end of the bargain. If we are to do anything to begin to address the problem we have created, it will require a clear-eyed look at its true magnitude, and an understanding of the interconnectedness of our world – and its waters. Environmental concerns must be integrated into personal, political and commercial decisions on every level. We can no longer pretend that our trash disappears forever when it hits the wastebasket, or that we are not implicated in the environmental degradation of the far-away countries who now supply our ravenous need for consumer goods.  The phrase ""think globally, act locally"" might be mocked for its utopianism, but it's a mantra we need to heed when it comes to the environment. Otherwise the lights will continue to go out, in Vieques and around the world.  I don't even have a good picture of the Vieques bio bay to remember it by – like all real magic, it looks shoddy in reproduction. Perhaps, like the Grand Lagoon, it will come back, at least this time. But how often must nature flip the switch before we start paying attention?"

"There is no doubt our earth is warming and our seas rising – or that humankind is the cause. There is no evidence to refute this – or any genuine scientific counterargument in the climate change debate. This is not ""absolute crap"". It is the inescapable truth. If we do not act, the consequences will be severe. It is predicted we will endure more droughts, more bushfires, more floods, more storms – more extremes. The damage to our coasts, our farmland, our forests and our animal life will be irretrievable – and irreversible. And today, we must decide whether Australia will step up and play our part.  Next year, in Paris, world leaders will gather to develop the next set of emissions goals for 2030. Australia can choose: we can attend that conference proud that we are making our contribution to a global effort, or we can be embarrassed by our lethargy. We can go as a country with an integrated, effective emissions trading schemes (ETS) or as a nation with no climate policy. The governments of the world, both progressive and conservative, are making their choice clear. Today, 39 national and 23 sub-national jurisdictions – accounting for almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions – have implemented or are on track to implement carbon pricing instruments, including ETS. Already, the world’s emissions trading schemes are valued at more than $30bn. China’s seven pilot schemes alone cover a quarter of a billion people – the second largest carbon market in the world, second only to the European Union’s. South Korea will introduce its ETS on 1 January 2015. Mexico put a price on carbon in 2013. The European Union has had an ETS for many years, and many European countries have applied their own carbon pricing on top of the European system, including France in 2013. In the United States, Oregon and Washington are exploring carbon pricing options, and California – itself the world’s 8th largest economy – already has an ETS in place. This growing international trend means every year more people are trading more emissions in more markets, for more money - and we can vote today for our economy to be a part of this. Labor’s ETS provides an added commercial incentive for better carbon capture and storage, natural gas and clean coal – delivering more benefit for Australian industries. And Labor’s ETS is ready to link to the world’s biggest emissions trading market – the European Union. Our world is moving forward on climate change. If Australia goes backwards, we will be going alone.  World leaders recognise what former Republican US treasury secretary Henry Paulson recently called ""the profound economic risks of doing nothing"". Paulson, a powerful conservative, has said that ""waiting for more information before acting"" is not conservative. It is taking a very radical risk. Tony Abbott is no leader. He is incapable of identifying the risks and costs of inaction. He is sleepwalking his way to a major climate policy disaster. It is a disaster that guarantees he will be remembered forever for his environmental vandalism. While the prime minister dithers over his dodgy deals with the crossbench, Labor’s policies continue to deliver economic and environmental benefits. Since we put a price on pollution two years ago, emissions in the energy sector - the main industry covered by the carbon tax – have dropped by 10.4%. Since the renewable energy target was introduced, $18bn has flowed into Australia’s renewable energy sector.  Under Labor, wind power generation tripled. The number of jobs in the renewable energy sector tripled. And the number of Australian households with rooftop solar panels increased from under 7,500 to almost 1.2m. Abolishing the carbon tax will put Australia out of step with the rest of the world – and it will cut us off from the next wave of international investment in clean energy. Already, after nine months of this government talking down the RET – and lying about its impact – Australia has slipped from fourth to eight on Ernst and Young’s renewable energy country attractiveness index. Australia is one of 144 countries in the world with a set of renewable targets - and Labor believes we should lead the world as a supplier of clean energy.  If we are strategic, if we are smart, Australia can power our future prosperity with solar, wind, geothermal and tidal energy. This is not just about taking advantage of our country’s natural gifts, the sunlight that bathes our continent and the waves that break upon our coastline. It means Australian researchers, scientists and investors leading innovation and creating economic growth by developing new energy technology and boosting energy efficiency. This is precisely what the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) are helping achieve. Last year, every dollar ($1) the CEFC invested generated two dollars ninety ($2.90) of private sector investment – yet this government is so blinded by its ideology that it wants to abolish this organisation. The parliament can vote for Labor’s emissions trading scheme today. The intricate, carefully calibrated design work has been done. The international compatibility is assured. Labor’s ETS is legislated. It is ready to go. Australians are bigger, better and braver than this awkward, divisive, backward-looking government. They deserve a government that represents their moderate, informed views on climate change –not one that delivers pre-Enlightenment, science-sledging nonsense. They can participate in mature debates about the future of our environment and the future of our economy. And unlike this prime minister, Australians can look beyond self-interest and see the national interest, the global interest. We all have choices in history. Some are more important than others. Today we can embrace the extreme risk of doing nothing. And when, in the future, it is proved to be wrong, the costs will not be measured by a wry laugh, an embarrassed smile or a belated and sincere expression of regret from the government. No apology will suffice. It will be forever remembered as your greatest folly. Not because we were responsible, but because this parliament did not accept our responsibility."
"A rash of bear attacks in Russia have left at least three people dead and many more injured in recent weeks as record high temperatures, freak snow, hailstorms and flooding hit Siberia and the country's far east. Human activity may be behind some of the attacks. Experts cited by the news agency Interfax said nets and obstacles have prevented salmon from swimming up rivers to spawn, leaving bears without a regular food supply.  Extreme weather can also disrupt the predators' biorhythms and food supply, said Vladimir Krever, director of the biodiversity programme at WWF Russia. Recent attacks include one at 2am on Wednesday at a meteorological station in the forests of Sakha Republic. A bear broke down the door of a residential trailer and bit the arm of the woman inside, only to be scared away by her loud screaming. Three days earlier another bear ambushed a boy on Iturup island as he was walking home from his grandmother's house. The bear had dragged the 14-year-old to the shore by the time police arrived and shot it dead. The boy had 170 stitches and remains in critical condition. This month, a bear killed three construction workers on Sakhalin island and left two in critical condition in an attack that was partially filmed on one of the men's mobile phones. During another attack in the Sakha Republic, a man's mobile phone saved his life when it suddenly activated and the tone scared off a bear that was biting his head. Adult brown bears found in Siberia and far-east Russia can grow to more the 590kg (1,300lbs) in size. ""The increase [in] number of extreme natural phenomena, hurricanes, storms, sudden heat or cold  … can lead to a growth in conflict situations for people in nature, including with bears,"" Krever said. A heatwave this month has led to Russia football matches to be delayed and a ceremonial changing of the presidential guard to be cancelled. ThisRecord-breaking temperatures were reported in the Siberian cities of Barnaul, Kemerovo, Novosibirsk and Novokuznetsk. On 12 July, a heatwave in the Novosibirsk region ended suddenly when the temperature dropped and the area was pelted with egg-sized hailstones, to the horror of beach-goers in one viral video. The same day, a rainstorm turned into a blizzard and left up to 10cm of snow in the Chelyabinsk region owing to what experts said was an Arctic cyclone. Also in July, authorities declared a state of emergency after three months' worth of rain fell in 36 hours in Magadan, cutting off some residents while others wakeboarded behind cars and trucks. According to Alexey Kokorin, head of the climate and energy programme at WWF Russia, these phenomena are part of a trend he attributed to global climate change, which on top of natural variations has caused the frequency of extreme weather events to more than double in all parts of Russia over the past two decades. ""In Russia, all these things have happened, snow in southern Urals and heatwaves in Siberia, but now they're happening more often,"" he said."
"Let's buck the doom and gloom of the nightly news bulletins for a minute and kick off with some cheer. According to the Gates Foundation, the world is – by almost any measure – better than ever. This may sound counterintuitive when so many people are struggling at home, but extreme poverty around the world has halved since 1990, a record number of girls attend school, and diseases that once wiped out entire communities are in retreat.  All of this is partly thanks to the internationally agreed millennium development goals. Although they did not get everything right, the MDGs set clear and concise targets. From eradicating poverty and boosting education to tackling disease and mother-and-infant mortality, the goals helped focus minds and funding on core, achievable aims. International representatives will gather in New York on Monday to finalise their proposals for global development for the next 15 years. Or, as the UN puts it, the 13th session of the open working group on sustainable development goals. Of course, it is not quite as simple or as powerful as the Make Poverty History campaigns. No wonder the process is yet to capture the world's imagination. But make no mistake, this is a real opportunity to change our planet for the better. With the correct goals, we can wipe out extreme poverty, secure health coverage at all ages and begin to reverse climate change. That is a thrilling prospect – which is why these negotiations need an urgent injection of radical ambition led by the UK. However, the British government is not doing enough to push things forward. Negotiations on development are a very real example of how the isolation this country is falling into – which so delights the Tory back benches – is not just bad for Britain, but bad for all those who hope for an equitable world. When Labour was in power, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown used hard-won political capital to convince and to cajole other rich states into playing their part. David Cameron and his government must get off the sidelines and do the same. At the negotiations this week, there are three things this government should push for. First, the UK should lead calls to place the battle against climate change at the heart of any new agreement. It should push for a commitment to keep the global rise in temperature below 2C to become top priority, as well as retaining pledges on environmental sustainability. The climate is the central development issue of the next century. If we fail to tackle the changes in our environment, all the gains we make elsewhere – from health and poverty to food and sanitation – will be reversed. Second, the UK should use its status as the home of the NHS and a world leader in public health to demand a headline commitment on universal coverage. As the party that founded the NHS, healthcare for all is central to Labour's beliefs. There is convincing evidence that universal health coverage leads to better outcomes, reduces inequality and helps prevent 100 million people a year from descending into poverty. That is why we want to see universal health coverage included at goal level. On poverty, the UK should extend further than a simple plan to eliminate the risk of anyone having to survive on just $1.25 (73p) a day. It should raise the bar and call for an ambitious new target of $2. The new goals are scheduled to expire in 2030, but today, more than 1 billion people live on $1-2 a day. We cannot simply overlook that level of poverty for the next 15 years. Of course, the next development targets must focus on more than climate change, poverty and universal healthcare, but we think that is a good place to focus our efforts. In addition, the goals must address inequalities in gender and education, resource scarcity, disease and hunger, sanitation, governance and the rule of law. And they must maintain respect for, and recognition of, human rights and much else besides. The UK has a robust record on development. We have helped steer the world to groundbreaking agreements – the time has come for Britain to do so again. There is no time to lose – there are millions of lives to save."
"People taking a dip in the North Sea will find it hard to believe that the water is any warmer than it was 15 years ago. But if you are a fish or a crab, a degree or two makes the difference to whether a stretch of sea suits your lifestyle and breeding success. Unlike the land surface, where weather changes each day mask climate change, water temperatures rise slowly but steadily. Research has already shown that cod, which need cold water to breed, are moving north, but a more detailed study has found that marine creatures living on the bottom are trekking north too.  Biologists from the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt have been dredging the same 40 sites for 20 years, watching for the migration of species, and have seen a dramatic change since 2000. The ratio of warm water species has increased, but in total, biodiversity has dropped, so some animals have disappeared altogether. Crabs in particular have been racing north to grab new territory. One that might be found on British beaches this summer is the tiny hermit crab, Diogenes pugilator. Originally a native of the Mediterranean and adjacent Atlantic, it is now found on beaches as far north as the Humber. You will have to look fairly hard though – its maximum size is 5mm. In the winter, when the fringes of the North Sea can get cold, these and other crabs retreat to deeper and warmer waters and wait for the spring. But their presence in summer is a sure sign of climate change."

"The magical winter wildlife spectacle of hundreds of thousands of wading birds converging on British estuaries could be under threat as research shows big declines in some of the most familiar species.  Results from the Wetland Bird Survey reveals that ringed plovers, oystercatchers, redshank and dunlin are among the eight most abundant species overwintering on UK estuaries to suffer significant and consistent population drops over 10 years. Conservationists believe several factors are responsible, including climate change forcing the birds to areas outside the UK, and say collaborative international research is imperative. Examinations of the traditional sites, the largest of which include the Wash, Morecambe Bay and Thames Estuary, are also required to determine if there are site-specific issues. Ringed plovers have suffered a decline of 39% in 10 years in over-wintering birds and those breeding in the UK. Redshank have fallen by 26% and Dunlin by 23%. Curlew have fallen by 17% and oystercatchers by 15% in the 10 years to June 2012. Knot have dropped by 7% and the bar-tailed godwit by 10%. Grey plover are down by 21%, according to the data collected by thousands of volunteers. Chas Holt of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), who coordinated the survey, said: ""I think we should be quite alarmed because the declines for many of these species are pretty consistent. Species like the ringed plover, redshank and dunlin, their decline has been consistent for 10 to 20 years now. And there is no obvious change happening, so in 10 years time we could be well down on numbers. ""It is hard to get a handle on exactly what is going on. When you see declines like this, it could be one of two or three main reasons. ""The overall population of the species as a whole could be in decline. These birds are breeding in the Arctic then wintering much further south in a flyway that runs right from north-west Europe down into Africa. So they are wintering over a large area. So, is the whole population in decline? Are they producing more young but is the survival rate lower? Or are they just slightly shifting distribution?"" Such consistent declines, he said, ""mean we certainly have to take stock and understand what is going on"". Research by Wetland International has shown winter populations of some of the species have recently shifted away from the UK to Dutch and German coasts, possibly in response to milder winters. Another possibility is fewer young waders being successfully reared in the Arctic, which is experiencing rapid warming. Waders produce spectacular shows during the peak period from November to January. The Wash, the largest in terms of overall numbers, holds a minimum of 350,000 birds at a time, not just waders but also ducks including widgeon and pintail, and geese such as the dark-bellied brent goose. It has been estimated that around 2m birds throughout each year use the Wash, where Norfolk meets Lincolnshire, attracted by its vast sandbanks and salt marshes. Richard Hearn, head of species monitoring at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), said: ""The declines in waders and other wintering waterbirds in the UK over the past decade or more, as revealed by the Wetland Bird Survey, are indicative of wider concerns about the state of our environment. ""They demonstrate the unprecedented period of change that these waterbirds are undergoing, and highlight the need for a step change in monitoring and relevant conservation action if we are to avert continued biodiversity loss."" The Wetland Bird Survey, a partnership between the BTO, the government's advisory joint nature conservation committee and the RSPB, in association with WWT, monitors birds at more than 2,000 wetland sites from estuaries to ponds across the UK."

"South-east Australia is set for an “abnormally early” bushfire season, with firefighters calling for substantially more resources to tackle fires that are predicted to become fiercer and last longer in the years ahead. The New South Wales rural fire service has said the danger period for bushfires, which normally begins on 1 October in most areas of the state, has already begun statewide, and is urging residents to reduce fire risks around their houses.  The RFS dealt with more than 90 bush and grass fires last weekend alone, with a fire in the Clarence Valley this week burning through 9,500 hectares and requiring 150 firefighters, aided by eight aircraft, to contain it. The National Firefighters Union of Australia has warned that parts of NSW and Victoria are primed for widespread bushfires due to a warm winter that saw the growth of vegetation, which can fuel fires. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, July was 0.29C warmer than the long-term average, with rainfall 32% below average. Longer-term trends, driven by climate change, have seen the duration and frequency of Australian heatwaves increase markedly since the 1970s, making the landscape more prone to bushfires. The firefighters’ union estimates that it will need to double the number of professional fire fighters by 2030, from 2010 levels, to deal with lengthening bushfire seasons. Jim Casey, from the NSW branch of the Fire Brigade Employees Union, said this would mean an extra 3,500 firefighters would need to be added in NSW alone. “We are seeing more extreme fires, on top of that there is storm damage, flooding and concerns around the increasing medical role played by firefighters,” he told Guardian Australia. “So, in the short term, the question around more resources is pivotal. But we are a Band-aid on a gangrenous stump on this issue. We need a concerted effort both in Australia and internationally to tackle climate change. Unfortunately, with the repeal of the carbon price, we are swimming against the tide of history a bit.” Casey said firefighters were noticing earlier bushfire seasons, as well as more dangerous fires. “The kicker is that the fires are becoming more difficult to control,” he said. “We are seeing a move towards fire acting more unpredictably, moving very quickly and destructively. There’s only so much you can do with a fire engine if there’s a 10km wall of flame heading towards you.” Casey said firefighters were expecting a bushfire season “every bit as bad” as last year, when fires tore through the Blue Mountains and the central coast. NSW has introduced new measures in the past week to help deal with the risk of bushfires. Fines for a range of fire-related offensives have been raised, with the throwing of a lit cigarette from a car now incurring a $660 fine. Failing to comply with a fire hazard reduction notice will cost an offender $2,200. Residents are now able to clear trees on their property within 10 metres of their home, without seeking approval. Other vegetation, other than trees, can be cleared up to 50 metres from the dwelling. Professor Lesley Hughes, of the Climate Council, said as the climate warmed, Australia would have to get used to more ferocious periods of bushfire. “The south-east of Australia is in a drying trend, so the bushfire seasons are getting earlier and lasting longer,” she said. “The indications are that it’s likely we’ll see something like the Blue Mountains fires again this year. “The global question is how to reduce carbon emissions. What we’re doing now will affect the second half of the century, so we can’t just turn off the warming switch. We need to fix the root of the problem but in the meantime we need to adapt to the growing risk of fire in many parts of Australia, particularly NSW, Victoria and parts of Western Australia.” Last year, Tony Abbott, who regularly volunteers for fire fighting duty, said the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Christiana Figueres, was “talking through her hat” for suggesting there was a link between global warming and bushfires. “Fire is part of the Australian experience … it has been since humans were on this continent,” he said. “Climate change is real … but these fires are certainly not a function of climate change, they are just a function of life.”"

"When Ocean Spray opened a new distribution center in Lakeland, Florida in 2011, the facility’s proximity to a rail yard used by a competitor created a behind-the-scenes opportunity to work together. Ocean Spray wanted a cheaper and more efficient way to ship its products from a New Jersey facility to Lakeland, while rival juice company Tropicana was paying to send empty rail cars south on a “back haul” from New Jersey to Florida.   Working with an existing logistics partner named Wheels Clipper, over the course of a year Ocean Spray shifted 80% of its shipping along the New Jersey–Florida route off trucks and into Tropicana’s empty rail cars. The change reduced carbon emissions by 20% and slashed transportation costs by 40% – about $200 per load – on that route, according to a 2013 analysis by the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics.  Over the last year, Ocean Spray has ramped up to 100% rail on the New Jersey-Florida route. In a similar move, competing confectioners Hershey and Ferrero announced a partnership in 2011 to reduce costs and cut carbon by sharing facilities and creating one North American supply chain. The alliance has removed 584 trucks from the road according to Hershey and prevented the release of 6.5m pounds of carbon dioxide over the past two years. These seemingly oddball examples of cooperation between market rivals are examples of “collaborative shipping”. Proponents say the practice could help make the global goods movement system – which has not changed much since the introduction of the standardized shipping container more than a half-century ago – more sustainable. “It’s not broken – literally – product does still get to where it needs to go,” says Alex Stark, marketing director at Kane Is Able, a third-party warehousing and logistics company. “But it’s broken in the sense that it can be done much better”. Global shipping is a $60bn-a-year industry that makes it possible for companies of nearly all sizes – from small-hold coffee farmers in Brazil to multinational tech giants like Apple – to move between countries and continents with remarkable speed and at relatively low expense.  But the system is riddled with inefficiencies that cost manufacturers and consumers money, waste fuel and dump planet-warming emissions into the atmosphere. Just one link on the chain – road freight carried by medium- and heavy-duty trucks – creates nearly 6% of all global greenhouse gas emissions (pdf) according to a 2012 analysis.  In the United States 15% of those trucks run empty while the remaining 85% run on average at just 64% capacity, according to Jason Mathers of the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). The group – which sponsored MIT’s study of the Ocean Spray-Tropicana shipping partnership – is encouraging collaborative shipping as a means to lower costs, save fuel and wring carbon out of supply chains. “If we could only capture half of that unused capacity, you’re talking about 100m metrics tons of carbon savings annually, and billions of dollars of savings”, Mathers says.  In a 2012 report called “Smart Moves,” EDF documented the most effective ways for  shippers to cut freight costs and improve the efficiency of their supply chains. It distilled from them “five rules of greener freight”: demand cleaner equipment and practices, choose the most carbon-efficient mode of transport, collaborate internally and externally, redesign logistics networks, and get the most out of every move. Since the report came out, says Mathers, “The place where we’re seeing most momentum is this concept of getting the most out of every move – making sure that the trucks that are on the road are as full as possible”. But collaboration in shipping faces some of the same barriers confronting most ideas that challenge convention: inertia, tradition and risk aversion. With the economy still recovering “the temperature of the business world is such that people don’t want to take risks,” says Kane Is Able’s Stark. Part of the problem, says Chris Kane, chief customer strategy officer at Kane Is Able, is that firms with products to ship are typically interested only in their own supply lines to retailers, and fail to consider opportunities to collaborate.  Kane is so sold on collaborative shipping that he’s written an free e-book about it (pdf), in which he likens current shipping practices to “taking a taxi to the airport, only to discover that five of your friends were going at the same time, and you could have paid less (and burned less fuel) to ride a shared shuttle bus.” Ceramic tile manufacturer Dal-Tile decided to change its established practices because shipments departing its Monterrey, Mexico, production facility were running at just 20% of capacity. The reason was intrinsic to the product: the company’s heavy loads of tiles were at the US legal weight limit for the type of truck trailer the firm was utilizing.  Working with Transplace, a third-party logistics provider, Dal-Tile determined that by shifting these shipments to a high-capacity rail boxcar the firm could send more of its own freight per shipment - with room to spare for goods from nearby manufacturers. Transplace located firms such as Whirlpool that were willing to pack their bulky-but-lighter freight into Dal-Tile’s not-yet-full boxcars.  This consolidation of shipments yielded a 30% net reduction in shipping costs. Managers face competing priorities for their attention, says Edgar Blanco, research director of the Carbon-Efficient Supply Chains Research Project at the MIT Center for Transportation & Logistics. “Even though there may be opportunities for collaboration in transportation,” Blanco says, “it’s not as clear that that’s where their managers will invest their time because there are still so many things to do in their more critical areas”. Trust is another hurdle. “Companies are concerned that competitors may learn details of their product shipments, or that their products might be delayed as a competitor’s are given priority”, says EDF’s Mathers, “The companies that are having success have invested time in building trust between the collaborators and [third-party logistics] service providers”. Stark is convinced the trust barrier can be overcome. After all, he says, products “don’t compete on a truck. They compete in the hearts and minds of the consumers who are buying them”. Indeed, for Ocean Spray sustainability manager Kristine Young, the collaboration on shipping with Tropicana was simply a smart business decision. “As there are more environmental, social and financial pressures put on business, we need to be more comfortable collaborating with unexpected partners”, she says. “We can compete on the shelf and collaborate on the back of a truck. This collaboration has signaled to our transportation partners that we are open to innovative solutions that reduce carbon emissions and costs”.  “What these case studies show,” says MIT’s Blanco, “is that as you get more maturity and more examples, [distrust] becomes a lower barrier to try and collaborate.” Justin Gerdes is a San Francisco Bay area-based independent journalist specializing in energy and the environment, with a focus on energy and climate policy.

"Ten of the world's biggest PR firms told the Guardian last week that they will not represent clients that deny man-made climate change. Could this be the first steps towards a rehabilitation for the much-maligned public relations industry? The oft-murky comms and PR landscape is at its murkiest when you dig into the world of lobbying, or the 'dark arts' as its ominously referred to by those within the industry. So to see these PR companies publicly renounce climate change deniers, theoretically rejecting lucrative profit in favour of doing the right thing, is a pretty significant step forward for an industry with perhaps the worst reputation of them all.  But what of the rest of the creative industries? Advertising agencies consistently take home the top PR prizes at creative festivals and the spotlight has already fallen upon some of their actions. In March 2014, Greenpeace picketed the offices of Saatchi & Saatchi in London in an attempt to get its client, P&G, to stop using palm oil. The design industry has also had some questions to answer. A wave of controversy erupted after Zaha Hadid's Heydar Aliyev centre in Azerbaijan was awarded Design of the Year, despite the project being connected with human rights abuses. Hadid has also been questioned about construction worker deaths in Qatar, where her company is building its Al-Wakrah World Cup stadium. Over 1,000 migrant workers have died in the country (pdf) since it was awarded the World Cup in 2010. Her response was curt: the company had done things by the book. As architects, it wasn't their problem, nor responsibility. There are two common threads here. One, all of these headlines are the result of a direct challenge. Whether it be the media, activists or a charity, each have gone straight to the source and asked these respective organisations to clarify their position. As a result, Edelman, the biggest PR firm in the US has declared it will not accept climate denial campaigns. However, the second thread is a much more important one for the long-term future: responsibility. Hadid is a prime example. When questioned on the topic of workers dying, Hadid pointed the finger at the Qatari government, while looking the other way. Creative agencies are often little different. When it comes to shady practices, it isn't their place to ask such questions. Moreover, the client would simply take their business to a less belligerent firm. Unfortunately, that is the reality that continues to hold us back and limits the progress that we do make. Until we can find a way in which to fully equivocate 'doing good' with 'doing well', then you're asking agencies to decide between a business case and an ethical case. The good thing is that there are grounds for optimism everywhere. People are starting to ask more questions and pressure is slowly growing. We're already seeing a shift towards socially responsible and ethical campaigns at awards shows such as ours at D&AD; but equally it was fascinating to see the response to the Design of the Year award. Rather than the award being judged purely on the merits of design, the expectation now is that the judges should not separate the work from its context and who it was commissioned by. In the longer-term, the real optimism comes from the millennial generation starting out in the creative industries. Through our D&AD New Blood programme, we work with young creatives who see the importance of balancing profit-making and a social purpose as fundamental to the future of business. It's our job to ensure these creatives are given the platform and opportunities to flourish and develop into leaders of the future. But, until that point we're relying on bravery from firms willing to disrupt the norm, go against the grain and potentially give up a little in the short-term, in order to benefit in the long-term. Correction: This article was amended on Monday 11 August to clarify that the deaths of over 1,000 migrant workers are not connected to construction of the Al-Wakrah World Cup stadium, but instead the total number of worker deaths in Qatar since the World Cup was awarded to the country in 2010.

"Ministers and diplomats from countries responsible for 80% of the world’s Co2 pollution were gathered around a table in Paris on Friday and Saturday to discuss the contours of a new global climate treaty, due to be signed here in less than 18 months’ time. A handful of other countries, including the Marshall Islands, joined them. We were here not because of the volume of our emissions, but because of the vulnerability of our existence. For atoll island countries like mine lying less than two metres above the rising oceans, the ambition and architecture of the new agreement will play a big part in determining whether our countries survive into the second half of the century. It is quite simply a matter of life or death.   A draft of the new agreement is due to be tabled at the annual climate conference in Lima later this year. As our December 2015 deadline for Paris edges closer, the pace of climate diplomacy has intensified, and a flood of new reports has warned of the extreme risks of a warmer world, and helped to map out the steady decarbonization of the world economy that is necessary to avoid them. Thankfully, the message overall is a positive one: we have the tools and technology to do it. Now we need the leadership and political will to make it happen.  The horizon ahead is full of opportunities. This September, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon will call world leaders together in New York to discuss climate change for the first time since Copenhagen in 2009. It will not only be an opportunity to announce “bold new actions” that edge us closer towards a peak in global emissions, but also to accelerate progress towards the Paris treaty. As my president wrote last week, “bringing leaders together at the 11th hour didn’t work last time, but this time we have an opportunity to get on the same page a year in advance.”  Preparations are on track, and the politics are much better this time as well. In the days leading up to this week’s Major Economies Forum meeting in Paris, China and the US – by far the world’s two biggest emitters – put climate change at the top of the agenda for their strategic and economic dialogue in Beijing, something few would have thought possible just a few years ago.   No two countries can do more to reduce global emissions when working together. And the G2, as the world’s two superpowers are sometimes called, must lead the pack by bringing forward their post-2020 emission reduction commitments for the Paris agreement in the first quarter of next year. It is important that they do this in early 2015 for two reasons. First, if the big polluters move early, the rest have the confidence to follow, and the critical mass for a strong deal will emerge. Second, we need to understand what the big emitters’ pledges add up to well before Paris so that adjustments can be made, if necessary, to get us on track to avoiding dangerous climate change.  There is wide acceptance of the need for a “sunshine period”, which will allow for a peer review of proposed commitments before they are locked in. For vulnerable countries like mine, “not enough” will never be seen as “good enough”. If we have all agreed to limit warming to below 2C, then we need to see the action to match. A second issue causing great concern for the world’s island states and least developed countries are proposals that the first round of commitments under the Paris treaty should take us all the way from 2020 through to 2030. In effect, we would be using the 2015 agreement to set targets for some 15 years away, potentially locking in low ambition and putting the below-2C goal out of reach.  In our view, we need more frequent opportunities to ratchet-up and accelerate efforts, both individually and collectively. New science and the increasing costs imposed by climate impacts drive public concern, and with it political pressure for stronger action. So next year, we should use the latest science and projections to set commitments out to 2025, and then come back to the table towards the end of this decade to set targets for 2030, and all step forward together again. Already, the US has said it is attracted to this shorter five-year cycle, and it would chime with China’s five-year economic plans as well.  Last but certainly not least, our new agreement must create a vision for a safe climate future. As the IPCC has told us, we need global emissions to approach zero by the middle of this century. In other words, national policies, and public and private sector investment decisions, must be based on the premise that the fossil fuel era is coming to an end, and the renewables revolution is here to stay. We must build this understanding into our negotiations, our leaders must say it in New York, and our Paris treaty must say it as well. I’ve been a politician long enough to know that politics is the art of the possible, and that negotiation requires compromise. But on some things, like the future of my country, compromise is not an option. As I said to the big emitters meeting in Paris, the agreement we sign here next year must be nothing less than an agreement to save my country, and an agreement to save the world. • Tony de Brum is minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of the Marshall Islands"

"Barack Obama and Xi Jinping are set to attend a climate summit hosted by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon in September. The US and Chinese heads of state are on a “very long list of confirmations” to attend the one-day conference in New York, according to UN climate chief Christiana Figueres.  The summit is an opportunity for world leaders to showcase the action their countries are taking on climate change and to make fresh pledges. Business, city and civil society leaders have also been invited to take the microphone with their contributions. Figueres said: “It is a very exciting day, in which we will see played out in front of us the huge variety of climate action.” The idea is to build momentum for a global treaty next year in Paris, but its success depends on buy-in from the top of major economies. “We are very confident that heads of state will come,” Figueres told RTCC. Asked if that included China and the US, she said: “Yes, definitely.” A spokesperson from Ban Ki-moon’s office denied having a list of attendees, but said: “We are very encouraged by the large number of positive responses from heads of state and government and we are expecting as many of them as possible to attend to the summit.” Over one million campaigners are expected to descend on New York the day before the summit starts, in what organisers are calling the “largest ever climate march“. The US and China are the two single largest emitters of greenhouse gases. The two powers discussed climate change at high-level talks earlier this month and both have made steps towards cutting emissions. In June, Obama’s administration announced curbs on pollution from fossil fuel power stations. Meanwhile, China is steadily cutting the carbon intensity of its economic growth and has indicated it could present plans for an emissions cap as early as next year. Figueres said the US announcement was “very welcome” but said more would be needed to reach a global deal in Paris. “No country is doing enough to stay on the path of a 2C temperature rise,” she said. “The agreement in Paris will be looking at that.” Countries are due to put forward plans for their national contributions to mitigating climate change by March 2015. “All countries are very very busy doing their homework,” said Figueres. That includes Australia, which will still be expected to contribute despite a U-turn on its core green policy last week. The country took the controversial decision to axe its carbon tax, which prime minister Tony Abbott said penalised businesses. “That is not the end of the story,” Figueres said. “They repealed the carbon tax, which is one very specific policy measure that can be undertaken to address climate change. It is not the only policy measure. “The challenge here for Australia is, since they are very committed to a global agreement in Paris, that means they need to go back to the drawing board.”"
"Research into ways to engineer the Earth’s climate as a last-ditch response to global warming will be rendered “unviable” if the associated ethical issues are not tackled first, a leading environmental philosopher has warned. Prof Stephen Gardiner, of the University of Washington, Seattle, told the Guardian that so-called geoengineering risked making problems worse for future generations.  Gardiner was in Sydney for a two-day symposium that aimed to grapple with the moral and ethical consequences of geoengineering, also known as climate modification. Later this year, the United States’ National Academy of Sciences is due to publish a key report into the “technical feasibility” of a number of proposed geoengineering methods, which fall into two categories. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) tries to cut the levels of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and store it, for example, in trees, algae or underground. A second category, known as solar radiation management tries to lower the amount of energy entering the Earth’s atmosphere from the sun by, for example, spraying sulphate particles into the stratosphere or whitening clouds. Gardiner said political inertia was one reason why the world had failed to respond meaningfully to climate change and rising greenhouse gases. “There’s a temptation for the current generation particularly in the rich countries to take benefits now and pass the severe costs on to the future,” he said. “Arguably that’s one of the big reasons we have failed so far on climate policy because we have succumbed to that temptation. “But when it comes to geoengineering, one of my biggest worries is that we might pick geoengineering as an intervention that replicates that pattern. “We might try and adopt a quick technological fix but one that holds the worst impacts for a few decades without much attention to what happens after that. What does happen after that could be even worse than what would unfold if we just allowed the negative climate impacts in the near term to materialise.” He said that it was time to engage with the ethical and moral questions now that major scientific institutions and a growing group of researchers were starting to consider geoengineering. “We are still in the early stages and very few people have written and talked about this. The good news is that the major scientific reports generally do signal that they think there are major ethical, political, legal and social issues that need investigating. The crucial thing is whether we get beyond saying that as a throwaway line to actually dealing with those implications. “Unless you can deal with these social and political issues then any kind of geoengineering would be unviable anyway – or at least any remotely ethically defensible version would be unviable.” In 2009, a Royal Society report called for more research into geoengineering and concluded that CDR techniques “should be regarded as preferable”. A proposed experiment to test a way to deliver particles into the upper atmosphere using a balloon and a one kilometre-long pipe was cancelled in 2012 after it was reported that two of the scientists involved had submitted patent applications that were similar to the techniques being proposed. A study earlier this year in the journal Nature Communications comparing five different proposed methods of climate engineering found all were “relatively ineffective” while carrying “potentially severe side effects” that would be difficult to stop. Prof Jim Falk, of the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute at the University of Melbourne, told the symposium there were more than 40 distinct methods that could be described as geoengineering, including planting large numbers of trees and painting roofs white. He said: “There’s a huge array of ideas and they go from local scale to intermediate scale to a global scale. The scale, the impacts and the risks all go up together.” • Graham Readfearn’s travel and accommodation was paid for by the symposium organisers."

"During the filming of Dr Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick’s satire on nuclear armageddon, Kubrick is supposed to have turned to its star, Peter Sellers, and asked: “Have you ever heard of mutually assured destruction?”   “No,” replied Sellers, “but hum a few bars and I’ll join in.” Listen carefully to politicians discussing energy policy today and you’ll hear them humming along too. The genius of such military doctrine is to make the absurd and extreme seem reasonable. That’s what attracted Kubrick’s satirical eye. When the new energy minister, Matthew Hancock, announced the bidding for new oil and gas licences, the first onshore for several years, to make it seem reasonable in the face of hostility to fracking in Conservative heartlands, he hummed a lot about protecting Britain’s most beautiful landscapes, such as national parks and places designated as areas of outstanding natural beauty.  Scratch the surface of the statement, though, and it became clear this was not, in fact, an outright ban on such developments. Scratch a little further and you realise that it would have the politically convenient effect of pushing the development of oil and gas shale reserves more to the north of England, where Conservatives are generally unpopular anyway. But, promising the protection of national parks while encouraging the further exploration and production of fossil fuels is, regardless, the climate change equivalent of old government advice to “duck and cover” in the event of a nuclear strike at the height of the cold war. It might make it seem safer, and the overall policy more reasonable, but won’t change the catastrophic outcome. In the Dr Strangelove era it was missiles that could never be used, now if we are to avoid climatic chaos, it is carbon that can never be burned. Why, then, look for more, if we can’t burn what we already know is there? Some argue that fracked gas can form a bridge out of dirtier fossil fuels to a cleaner energy system.  To do that its exploitation would have to be part of a deliberate policy of transition, engineered explicitly to work within scientific emissions limits, and with its own sunset clause to phase the gas out too. That isn’t the case.  Any such strategy would also have to overcome the long historical dynamic that energy use begets more energy use. Substitution generally doesn’t happen. New sources add to, rather than replace, existing ones as economies and demand for energy grow in an expansive dance. It also overlooks that way that each energy source comes with its own physical, economic and social infrastructure that tends to lock it into place and make any subsequent transition harder. Lobbies and special interest groups form to protect their tax breaks and privileges. It’s a shame. Recent research suggested that the world needed to spend $1 trillion extra per year on green energy to have a decent chance of not crossing the climate danger line. That sounds like a lot of money until you look at the estimates of current subsidies going to fossil fuels, which range from the International Energy Agency’s $500bn, to the IMF’s figure of $1.9tr.  An energy policy that guarantees we will burn more fossil fuels than it is safe to burn can never be reasonable. Promising to protect national parks in this instance is like saying it is okay to burn a house down with the people inside as long as you promise not to touch the garden.  Often it is history that strips the aura of reasonableness from a patently unreasonable, if not recklessly irresponsible, situation. What nurses a banal acceptance of mutually assured destruction is the air of normality that the fossil fuel sector is able to attach to itself. From arts sponsorship to the irony, for example, of BP sponsoring the Commonwealth Games when given their day job, they should only rightfully be allowed to sponsor a “destruction of the Commonwealth Games”. The recent demolition of the cooling towers at Didcot power station could have been a powerful symbolic moment. A signal for a bold and liberating new adventure in how to meet our energy needs.  Announcing that same week the new onshore oil and gas licences instead revealed a government clinging to the past.  Often against enormous odds, and in some of the poorest parts of the world, people are finding ways to combat climate change. Giving local communities around the world greater protection and recognition of their rights in forests, for example, proves better for them and better for the climate. Dinosaurs apparently, were simply unlucky, hitting extinction when they experienced an extreme form of climate change that was not of their own making, at an inconvenient evolutionary moment.  Unless we start loudly humming a new tune, like community-controlled renewable energy, you have to wonder what our excuse will be…"
"Around the planet, wildfires are becoming larger and more destructive. This summer, a series of wildfires enveloped large areas of Canada’s Boreal forest, blanketing western North America with smoke. One key question is, do these fires have an effect on climate by darkening Arctic ice with layers of soot, causing more sunlight to be absorbed by the ice? For the second year, the Dark Snow Project science team has taken to the ice on Greenland to investigate the forces driving Greenland's ice loss. They are looking at the causes of surface darkening on the ice sheet that's been observed over the last decade.   The Dark Snow Project is a collaborative effort between a multidisciplinary, international group of experts. The driving questions are, what's causing the steady darkening of the Greenland Ice Sheet that has been observed in the past decade? Is it an important cause of ice melt? Does it represent yet another climate ""feedback"" which is accelerating global change? A number of natural processes cause ice to darken. The simple process of melting causes ice crystals to deform and reflect less light. In addition, pollen, sea spray, desert dust, pollution from industry and shipping cause darkening. However, there are also other causes. Recently, newly published research strengthens the idea that wildfire soot has driven extensive melt over the ice sheet, and in addition, that layers of refrozen water are themselves darkening factors that drive further melt. In addition to increased wildfires, the Dark Snow Team will be investigating the impact of algae and microbes, which, increasingly favored by warming temperatures, are gaining a larger foothold on the ice.  Dark Snow biologist Dr. Marek Stibal has found that a species of algae living on the ice produces a very special pigment that acts as a sunscreen, protecting it against the intense summer glare. The pigment is the very same molecule that gives black tea its color. The dark pigment, visible in many photos of ice during melt season, is an important, but not well understood, part of the darkening process. As warmer temperatures spread over larger areas of the ice, more liquid water is made available - a vital factor for algae growth. In addition, scientists wonder whether industrial pollution may be delivering key nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus to the ice, further driving algae growth. Data is gathered through use of small aerial drones that hover over the ice and gather photographic evidence of changes in whiteness. The team has modified several small drones for their science purposes this year, and they are gathering exciting data under challenging conditions. By combining observations and sampling at the surface, with low-altitude drone observation, and ice-sheet-scale imagery from satellites, the team hopes to have a complete micro-to-macro view of the ice darkening processes.  The original mission of Dark Snow was not just to do science, but also to bridge the communication gap with a wider public, to better inform a global audience on the key findings that fill in the climate change story.  With a feature story in Rolling Stone magazine, and high-profile interviews with Dark Snow scientist Jason Box on NBC, Vice News, and recently, the Real Time with Bill Maher, that communication part of the mission is also being realized.  The Dark Snow Project is a citizen scientist collaboration, funded by a continuing crowd-source effort online. That effort is still ongoing at this time. One project the team still hopes to fund for August is a satellite hookup for internet connectivity, so as to be able to communicate day-to-day, and moment-to-moment, with journalists and citizens around the globe. I am anxious to see how this combined funding and media strategy works. While my own climate research is completely unfunded (yes, you read that right), my activities in the thermal sciences has a much more traditional source of resources. Will the Dark Snow project show that alternatives to the traditional research grants are viable? We will see."
"In 1965, US President Lyndon Johnson had a special message for the American Congress on conservation of the environment. Worried about the ""storm of modern change"" threatening cherished landscapes, Johnson said: “This generation has altered the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale through… a steady increase in carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels.”  The same quote appears at the beginning of the 2010 book Merchants of Doubt: How A Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming by science historians Erik Conway and Professor Naomi Oreskes. Plainly the line – almost half a century old now – was picked to show just how long the impacts of fossil fuel burning have been known in the corridors of the highest powers. The book explained the efforts since the 1960s of vested interests and ideologues to underplay the risks of pumping ever-increasing volumes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. One of the most startling revealing aspects of the book was how some of the same institutions and individuals who held out against a wave of scientific warnings about the health impacts of tobacco smoke became integral to efforts to block any meaningful policy response to greenhouse gas emissions. Oreskes is a Professor of the History of Science at Harvard University and she has a new book out, again co-written with Conway. The Collapse of Western Civilisation: A view from the future is written from the perspective of a historian living in the year 2393 and looking back at what went horribly wrong in the lead up to the “Great Collapse”. Here's my Q&A with Oreskes. Q: Merchants of Doubt looked at the role of think tanks, vested interests and free market ideologies in attacking the science linking fossil fuel burning to climate change, smoking to cancer, pollution to acid rain and CFCs to the ozone hole. Four years later, has anything changed? Not really. There are some new faces on the horizon, but recruiting “fresh voices” has been a tactic for a long time. So even the things that may look new are in fact old. The Heartland Institute has become more visible, and the George Marshall Institute a bit less, but the overall picture continues: these groups continue to dismiss or disparage the science, attack scientists, and sow doubt.  They continue to try to block action by confusing us about the facts. And the arguments, the tactics, and the overall strategy has remained the same. And, they’ve been extremely successful. CO2 has reached 400 ppm, meaningful action is still not in sight, and people who really understand the science—understand what is at stake—are getting very worried.  Q: How did you move from being a geologist working in Australia for the Western Mining Corporation to being a scholar of the history of science?  Oh this is a long story. I was always interested in broad questions about science. History of science gave me the opportunity to pursue those broad questions.  Q: You were filmed for an ABC documentary that pitched a climate change ""advocate"" against a ""sceptic"". You met Australian politician and climate science sceptic Nick Minchin - the key political kingmaker who engineered the leadership challenge that gave the now Prime Minister Tony Abbott the Liberal leadership. What were your impressions of Minchin? Well, I think he is a basically nice guy who has fallen into a trap: the trap of imprecatory denial. He doesn’t like the implications of climate change for our political and economic system, so he denies its reality. But climate change will come back to bite us all. It is already starting to.  Q: So you worked in Australia as a geologist, toured here to promote Merchants of Doubt and had an academic role at the University of Western Australia, so you've seen a bit of how things have played out. How do you think Australia has been influenced by organised climate science denial? Clearly. One sees all the same strategies and tactics being used there, plus a few additional ones (trotting out geologists to claim there are hidden underwater volcanoes that are responsible for the extra atmospheric CO2.) The Institute of Public Affairs in Australia has been very active trotting out skeptical and denialist claims with little or no basis in evidence. If you go to their web site, they link back to many of the very same groups whose activities we documented in Merchants of Doubt : the Cato Institute, the American Enterprise Institute, Competitive Enterprise institute, the Heritage Foundation. It’s the same old, same old: defend the free market, deny the reality of market failure, block action that could actually address those failures. And of course, that is the point of the new book: by denying the reality of market failure, and blocking corrective action, these folks are actually undermining our economies, and laying the foundations for kinds of government interventions that will make them pine for the good old days of a carbon tax. Q: Oh yes the new book - The Collapse of Western Civilisation: A view from the future. You've written it from the point of view of a historian writing about the ""Period of the Penumbra (1988–2093) that led to the Great Collapse and Mass Migration (2073–2093)"". It doesn't sound like there are too many laughs? Not unless we are talking about black humour. Our editor, when he first approached us, said he found it funny in a Dr Strangelovian way. I took that as a huge compliment.  Q: Dr Strangelove - a character that apparently borrowed parts from the real life Edward Teller, the so-called ""father"" of the H-bomb. Your new book borrows much from real life events and modern science too doesn't it (it's a clunky segue, but I'm sticking with it)? Yes of course. A good deal of the power of that film came from the fact that while it was farce, it was all too true in some ways—or at least, all too plausible. It was conceivable that the world would end not in deliberate, calculated aggression, but in stupidity, mistakes, and men and machines run amok.  Kubrick understood that. Fortunately, we escaped disaster in the Cold War, because enough people realized what was at stake. Erik and I have often discussed that, in this case—climate change—a lot of people, folks like Nick Minchin included—don’t seem to realize what is at stake. They’ve dismissed the science. They’ve pooh-poohed the mounting evidence that disruptive climate change is already underway. They’ve assumed scientists were over-reacting, and that all environmentalists are watermelons. And that bodes poorly for our future. Because the longer we wait, the more plausible our “collapse” scenario, with its unhappy implications for western democracies, becomes.  Q: But what is it that you think drives the denial industry? How much of it is just pure self-interest? Is it fear of socialism - a kind of post-Cold War paranoia that you identified in Merchants of Doubt? Or is it ideological fervour like the kind you've witnessed amongst American Tea Baggers?  I think it’s a complicated mix. Certainly, there are some very cynical individuals and groups who are protecting their own self-interest, with little or no regard to the consequences for others. There are also those who have bought into the watermelon argument—that environmentalists are green on the outside, red on the inside—and that climate change is just an excuse to bring in socialism by another name.  Then there are also many people who I think believe, or have persuaded themselves, that climate change is just another fad, exaggerated by scientists who just want more money for their research, or environmentalists who over-react to small threats or are unrealistic about where their bread is buttered. Finally there is the power of rationalization—people whose bread really is buttered by the fossil fuel industry, or people who are heavily invested in the industry in one way or another, and just don’t want to accept that there is a fundamental problem.  Q: Is that a big issue - do you think? That the nuances of the science aren't that widely understood and so it's an easy job to confuse people about it? Yes I think so. That’s one reason why these disinformation campaigns have been so successful. It’s always easy to find some aspect of the science that is uncertain, or confusing, and focus on that to the exclusion of the larger picture Q: It sounds like an almost intractable situation. Is there something you think should have happened, that didn't, that might have helped to combat that misinformation?  Well, it certainly would have helped if political leaders had not repeated that disinformation!  Q: What would you do about it? What I am doing: writing and talking about it, so we can accurately diagnose the problem. You can’t solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. Q: Researching denial and organised misinformation has been your thing for about a decade now. So what's next? A book about the solutions? How not to go down the road to collapse?"
"The UK is slashing its climate change diplomacy budget even as global efforts intensify to reach a deal. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) cut spending on its core climate change activities by 39% over the past three years, figures show.  This reduces the UK’s capacity to influence other countries’ positions on climate action in the run-up to the global deal expected in 2015. Newly appointed foreign secretary Philip Hammond is seen as less interested in climate change than his predecessor William Hague, meaning the trend is likely to continue. Tom Burke, a former advisor to the FCO, said the government “has cut its capacity to get a better deal for the world in half”. “Until 2010, the UK government was playing a leading role in shaping the global debate on climate change. There was a growing awareness of the importance of climate change as a core national interest,” said Burke. “Since 2010, the foreign office’s role in that has been cut.” The extent of the cuts was revealed in response to a Freedom of Information request by RTCC. Between 2011-12 and 2013-14, spending on activity related to climate change, the low carbon economy and energy security fell 28%, from £22m to £16m. The figures do not include staff costs and overheads. In the response, an FCO official said the reduction “has been planned as a necessary part of our overall savings programme, and we have been able to revise our spending so that we are able to prioritise it in areas where the FCO can have the most impact”. The majority of that spending was on projects under the Prosperity Fund, which “promotes action on global issues in areas of strategic importance to the UK”. When project-specific spending is taken out of the equation, it reveals even deeper cuts to the department’s essential capacity for climate diplomacy. The budget for FCO’s climate change and energy department, special representative for climate change and overseas missions was hacked by 39%, from £7.5m in 2011-12 to £4.5 million in 2013-14. The project budget also suggests a shift in priorities. Spending on “energy/resource security” projects increased by 11% at the same time as “climate change” projects faced a 39% cut. These cuts took place on Hague’s watch as foreign secretary. However, he was widely viewed as champion of strong climate action in the cabinet, which also contained the climate sceptic Owen Paterson. Hammond, who came into the post from the defence department, said on taking office his priorities were “security, economy and Europe”. Climate change did not get a mention. The subject will become increasingly relevant as countries consider the emissions cuts they can bring to climate talks in Paris next year, where a global deal is set to be signed. With a reduced budget, the FCO will be limited in efforts to influence other countries ahead of formal negotiations. Currently, most major embassies have a team focused on the low carbon sector. Around 20 officials are dedicated to climate related activities in Beijing. Burke, who advised the department’s special envoy on climate change until 2012, said Hague was “a powerful voice” for strong climate action in government. “Despite agreeing to the cuts, he was a reliable supporter of more ambitious efforts on climate change and I don’t think Mr Hammond will be,” said Burke. “That will encourage the foreign office, which has never fully grasped the importance of the issue, to keep downgrading it.”"
"Along with its warning this week that delaying action on climate change would cause enormous economic losses, the White House has announced a series of data-related initiatives to prepare US food and water supplies – along with the industries and jobs that rely on them – for climate challenges. The White House hopes the data will spur and enhance efforts by industry, communities and other sectors to improve water and food security, as well as overall resilience to climate change.  A new report from president’s council of economic advisors found that the costs of cutting greenhouse gas pollution and coping with global warming’s impacts would rise by 40% for every decade of delay. It is “clear that not taking action has far greater costs” than prompt action, White House counselor John Podesta told reporters on a press call this week. The newly announced initiatives feature public-private collaborations that aim to render government data on agriculture, weather, climate and water more informative and accessible to businesses and the general public. Three major technology firms have committed to helping researchers crunch the vast amounts of data needed to develop climate models and other analytical tools:  Microsoft has also put US Department of Agriculture data sets online via its Azure Marketplace, and is partnering with the agency to encourage software developers to create new tools for using them. Among the other projects listed: There are also a number of university-corporate partnerships, as well as commitments from big data firms Quandl, The Climate Corporation and SWIIM. Several other well-known corporations made commitments that – while admirable in aspiration – were light on detail, or seemed to represent ongoing efforts that were shoehorned into the White House’s food-resilience framing: The White House’s announcement was part of President Obama’s broader “Climate Action Plan” – announced in June 2013 – to lower greenhouse gas emissions and prepare American communities for the effects of human-propelled climate change.

"The White House has warned that delaying action on climate change would carry a heavy price, racking up an additional 40% in economic losses from climate impacts and other costs over the course of 10 years. White House officials said the stark finding from the president's council of economic advisers underlined the urgency of Barack Obama's efforts to cut carbon pollution.  In addition to a new report on the economic cost of delay, the White House is poised to launch two new initiatives on Tuesday dealing with fast-rising methane emissions from the natural gas industry, and buffering food security against future climate change. “We are pushing across the board on the elements of the climate action plan,” John Podesta, Obama's counsellor, told a conference call with reporters. Several former treasury secretaries and a couple of billionaires have come forward in recent weeks to warn Americans about the economic risks of climate change. By producing its own report on the costs of climate change, the White House appeared to be moving to bolster Obama's climate agenda from industry attacks. Industry groups claim that new Environmental Protection Agency rules for power plants will cripple the economy. In their rebuttal, Obama's economic team said the costs of delaying action to cut carbon pollution would be far higher in the long term - 40% over the course of a decade, in terms of the increased costs of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and dealing with climate impacts. The costs were projected to rise even more steeply with each additional degree of warming above the 2C threshold for dangerous climate change, the report said. “Each decade we delay acting results in an added cost of dealing with the problem of an extra 40%,” Jason Furman, chairman of the council of economic advisers, told a conference call with reporters. “The total amount we would have to pay today would be 40% larger if we waited a decade instead of acting now.” Delaying action would deepen the risks to property and livelihoods. It would also make it more costly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A 3C rise above pre-industrial levels would shave about 0.9% a year off global GDP, or about $150 billion a year, the report said. A 4C rise would cost the global economy 3.1% of global GDP a year, it said. “The cost …..ramps up potentially astronomically to the point that even if you want to you couldn't actually stabilise the temperature,” Furman said. Furman said the finding was based on an analysis of 16 different economic models, and took into consideration economic damage due to climate change, and lost investment and other opportunities. The report – and the other interventions – appeared timed to build support around the main pillar of Obama's climate action plan, regulations limiting carbon pollution from power plants. The EPA is holding public hearings in Atlanta, Denver, Pittsburgh and Washington DC this week on regulations to cut carbon pollution from power plants by 30% over the next 16 years. The EPA regulations, which target the country's largest single source of carbon dioxide emissions, are the main pillar of Obama's climate plan – one of the signature issues of his second term - and by default contentious. More than 1,600 people have signed up to speak at the hearings, and 300,000 have sent in written comments. Some 680 groups have signed up to lobby the EPA, according to the Center for Responsive Politics – more than any other government department. The regulations are critical to Obama's commitment to the international community to cut greenhouse gas emissions 17% on 2005 levels by 2020. The EPA Administrator, Gina McCarthy, told reporters on Monday that she expected opponents to focus on the economy. “We are bound to hear this week and beyond that EPA actions are bad for the economy,” she said. Industry groups, such as the American Petroleum Institute and the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, accuse the EPA of waging a “war on coal” and say the regulations will damage the economy. A Republican congressman, Mike Kelly, likened the regulations to terrorism, in an event at the conservative Heritage Foundation on Monday. “You talk about terrorism, you can do it in a lot of different ways,” he said. “But you terrorise the people who supply everything this country needs to be great – and you keep them on the sidelines – my goodness what have we become?”  Opponents of the EPA regulations also argue that they will be ineffective unless China and other big emitters also take action on climate change. But McCarthy told the call America had to take actions at home to cut carbon pollution “or a global solution on climate change won't make it to the table”. She said there were already signs that the EPA regulations had encouraged China and other countries to do more to cut their own emissions. The White House, the EPA Senate Democrats, economists, and environmental groups argue the regulations represent an opportunity – and that it would be far more costly to delay action. The former treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, wrote in the Washington Post last week that framing the regulations as a trade-off between the environment and the economy was as false choice. “The real question should be: What is the cost of inaction? In my view — and in the view of a growing group of business people, economists, and other financial and market experts — the cost of inaction over the long term is far greater than the cost of action,” Rubin wrote. Senate Democrats are expected to expand on that argument at a budget committee hearing on Tuesday called “The costs of inaction: the economic and budgetary consequences of climate change”. European and British economists have warned for years about the costs of inaction on climate change, with Nicholas Stern coming out with his landmark report in 2006. But those findings did not get wide airing in the American media until earlier this year when a group of billionaires and former treasury secretaries came out with their report, Risky Business, on the costs of ignoring the climate problem. Meanwhile, the Obama administration will on Tuesday announce a number of new initiatives on containing fast-rising emissions of methane from the natural gas industry. The White House is also due to announce a new effort by companies such as Microsoft and Coca Cola on plans to help protect food production."
"While most of the facts in your article (Missed targets: when companies fail to keep their key sustainability promises, 21 July) were accurate, we were disappointed with the broad brush with which Rainforest Action Network’s (Ran) work with the Disney Corporation was painted. Has Disney fallen behind on its initial paper sourcing targets? Yes. Will Ran be closely monitoring the situation and working with Disney to ensure implementation of its new policy? Yes. But the fact is that Disney’s policy regarding how the massive corporation purchases its paper is one of the strongest and most comprehensive policies that Ran has ever seen. It is a policy that addresses issues of climate change, human rights and rainforest destruction across all of Disney’s global operations, including all of Disney’s licensees and subsidiaries. This is a complex and challenging policy to implement in full – it will affect more than 10,000 factories in China alone – and Ran believes that Disney is currently working in good faith toward putting this policy into effect.  In addition, this policy has already had a very real impact, creating a ripple effect in Indonesia – the current epicentre of global deforestation. Disney has already excluded some of the most egregious rainforest destroyers on the planet from its supply chain and the company’s actions helped lead to a groundbreaking new forest policy from that corporation – a policy that Ran will also be closely monitoring for years to come to ensure full and meaningful implementation. Ran greatly appreciates the incredibly complex and comprehensive nature of this shift in corporate practices. And Disney has been consistently proactive in informing the sustainability community about its progress and challenges on this front. Ran is in this fight for the long haul, and we will be monitoring these policies closely. But so far we have every reason to believe that Disney is moving in the right direction and can serve as a critical lever for industry-wide change that will benefit the planet and the people who live on it.Lindsey AllenExecutive director, Rainforest Action Network"
"At the beginning of the 2000s, a handful of NGOs were calling for the world to wake up to global warming, but since then it has grown to become a mass movement. The campaign issues can be complex and the voices many. To help you navigate, here's a list of the top ten books to help you understand the movement.  The latest book from Naomi Klein, author and activist, is set to be released in September this year. Before engaging with environmental issues, Klein was part of the movement against neoliberal globalisation. Her new book picks up a central critique of many climate groups, explaining why capitalism is deeply related to the climate crisis. As a member of the board of 350.org, she shares not only comment but practical insights into the strategies and plans of the movement. A golden oldie, The End of Nature by US-scholar and long-term climate activist Bill McKibben, is said to be the first non-scientific book on global warming. It treats climate change as one part of a global ecological crisis, which can only be solved by a radical change of the perception, and treatment, of nature. The book is important because it demaded extensive change at an early stage (1989) and it directs this demand not only towards politicians, but to society as a whole. This 2012 release comes from the popular scholar-activist Patrick Bond, from South Africa. Using examples from countries in the global south he argues that market-based instruments such as carbon trading and the clean-development mechanism are not working. They often have negative consequences for the local population, harm the environment and make little impact on reducing emissions. Also from 2012, this book reports on a less well-known part of the movement. Australia is characterised by a vivid and broad debate around climate change that involves church groups, trade unions and political parties. The movement here tends to be moderate and has significant political weight – it played a central role in the decision to adopt a national carbon tax. British journalist and activist Mark Lynas explores how to overcome the environmental and climate crisis in this 2011 publication. Lynas advocates the use of controversial technologies such as nuclear energy and genetic engineering. The ideas proposed in the book prompted debate and soul-searching among the green movement in Britain. In this 2010 book, activists report on the World People's Conference on Climate Change in Bolivia in April 2010. This alternative conference developed radical demands for civil society and southern states, such as a climate justice court and huge financial transfers. It illustrated the ability of the movement to engage political actors, and development new alliances after the failure of the Copenhagen conference in 2009. Bolivia brought parts of the conference declaration to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) process, but they had no enduring effects. A good introduction into the central concept of the movement – justice. In Tokar's 2010 publication he explains why activists refuse the ""false solutions"" of climate change such as as economic instruments. He stresses the responsibility of the northern countries for emission cuts and resource transfers, and the need to support southern countries. This small booklet from 2010 documents climate camps. The camps are popular forms of protest in the movement that relate direct action to sustainable living and education. The first camp was in 2006 near the coal-fired power station Drax in the UK and protested against its huge emissions. The reader reveals conflicts in the camps, shows how much organisational energy they require, and explains why they came to an end in the UK in 2010. This publication was written by internationally known activists and scientists in 2009. It is a broad and critical analysis of climate policy and also explores alternative ways to solve the crisis, considering the application of perspectives such as feminism. The flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto protocol as well as the idea of green capitalism are criticised and alternatives such as climate justice and sustainable economies are presented. This relatively unknown piece from 1999 had a huge impact on the climate movement. The report by the NGO CorpWatch is the origin of the term and concept ""climate justice"", starting a public debate. It is impressive how similar the original definition is to its current use and that the concept, which added a new dimension to the understanding of climate change, stemmed from a single NGO.

"While there’s a 97% consensus among climate science experts and their research that humans are causing climate change, only about 67% of Americans believe global warming is even happening, including 25% of Tea Party members and 61% of other Republicans. Only about half of Americans realize that humans are causing global warming. Social scientists have been investigating this disconnect between the evidence and expert consensus, and public opinion. Is it caused by information deficit and misinformation surplus, political and ideological biases, or some combination of these factors?  There’s one school of thought among social scientists that information just doesn’t matter – in fact, it might even be polarizing. In essence, liberals feel as though they’re on Team ‘global warming is a problem caused by humans’ while conservatives identify with Team ‘no it’s not.’ Some social scientists believe this cultural identity is so strong that scientific evidence, facts, and information can’t break through it. A 2012 study led by Yale’s Dan Kahan seemed to support this idea, finding that conservatives who are more scientifically literate are less worried about global warming. However, that study looked at general science literacy. A new paper led by Sophie Guy, published in the European Journal of Social Psychology, looks at climate-specific knowledge and ideology. The authors conducted a survey of a national sample of 335 Australians and tested their climate knowledge by asking them to correctly identify factors that are and aren’t causing the rise in atmospheric greenhouse gases (for example, deforestation, automobiles, pesticides, and ozone depletion). They also asked participants, “How much do you feel you know about climate change?,” about their climate-related beliefs, and their ideology. The authors concluded, ...[climate] knowledge dampened the negative influence of individualist ideology on belief in climate change. Individualists favor small government and self-sufficiency, in line with the libertarian wing of the Republican Party. Individualists were less likely than communitarians (those who think interdependence is an important part of society, i.e. “it takes a village”) to believe that climate change is happening. However, individualists with high climate-specific knowledge were significantly more likely to accept the climate is changing than those with low climate knowledge. Communitarians were equally likely to accept that climate change is happening regardless of their level of climate-specific knowledge, because the facts mesh with their ideology. In another interesting result, perceived climate knowledge made hierarchists (those who favor distinct socioeconomic classes – closely related to the ‘religious right’ in the USA) more likely to reject that humans are causing global warming. This may explain Kahan’s results, because those who have solid general scientific literacy may have an inflated perception of their understanding of climate science.  Thus, scientifically literate hierarchists may be more likely to let their biases influence their opinions on the causes of global warming because they have an inflated perception of their understanding the underlying science. This may also explain why we so frequently hear from engineers, geologists, and physicists who are skeptical of human-caused global warming despite lacking expertise in climate science. Because of their scientific backgrounds, they may have an inflated sense of their understanding about climate science, and thus draw incorrect conclusions that conform to their ideological biases. There are two pieces of good news in this new study indicating that information does make a difference and climate education isn’t a lost cause. Across the participants as a whole, People who were knowledgeable about climate change believed more strongly that it is happening, that it is being caused by human activities, and that it has negative consequences than those with less knowledge. Second, conservatives of a libertarian flavor were more likely to accept that global warming is happening when they had a better understanding of the climate. This indicates that some conservatives are persuadable; that information, evidence, and facts can potentially break through their ideological filter. On the other hand, the results of this study also suggest that conservatives of a more hierarchist flavor may not be persuadable by climate information and evidence. As their perceived understanding of climate change grows, their acceptance of human-caused global warming falls. There’s no question that ideological biases play a big role in rejection of global warming. However, the results of this study indicate that for a majority of the public, including some conservatives, information that increases understanding about the climate can also increase public acceptance of global warming."
"For the last few months, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have been at record levels unseen in over 800,000 years. The chairman of the IPCC, an international panel of the world’s top climate scientists, warned earlier this year that “nobody on this planet is going to be untouched by the impacts of climate change”. Future generations will no doubt wonder at our response, given the scale of the threat. It’s known that death, poverty and suffering await millions, and yet governments still vacillate. But solutions are available. Here are ten reasons to be hopeful that humans will rise to the challenge of climate change. Any politician who runs as the personification of hope is bound to be a bit of a let down. And so it seemed for five long, hot years. Barack Obama inaugurated his first US presidential term by promising to “roll back the spectre of a warming planet”. Yet he seemed unable (or willing) to even roll back the ghosts haunting his Congress. Now, as he staggers into his legacy-building stage, Obama has confronted and even circumvented Congress. His emissions caps on coal power stations, announced last month were the culmination of a massive public relations push and scientific blitzkrieg with Obama as its champion, potentially making the next presidential election a referendum on climate change action. Just a day after the launch of Obama’s big crackdown on coal, He Jiankun, a top Chinese government climate advisor told Reuters, “The government will use two ways to control CO2 emissions in the next five-year plan, by intensity and an absolute cap”. This was the first time the promise of limiting absolute emissions had emerged from a source close to the Chinese leadership (even if He was later forced to disown the comments).  The response of world’s largest emitter of carbon has the potential to be swift and decisive, given its centrally controlled economy. Responding to smog-tired residents in China’s cities, the government has ordered a mass shutdown of coal plants within a few years. Coal control measures now exist in 12 of the country’s 34 provinces. Greenpeacehave estimated that if these measures are implemented, it could bring China’s emissions close to the level the International Energy Agency says are needed to avoid more than 2C warming. According to the authoritative IEA thinktank, the price of installing photovoltaic (solar electricity) systems dropped by two thirds over the past six years. The resulting solar explosion has generated a “prosumer” market, in which the owners of homes and businesses are taking ownership of a growing proportion of the energy supply. During June in Australia’s “sunshine state” of Queensland the price of electricity fell below zero for several days, largely thanks to the input from privately-owned solar panels. The UK, Germany and other European nations smashed their record solar outputs over this year’s summer solstice. Dozens of cities, institutions and investors are taking their money out of fossil fuel companies after the launch of a divestment campaign in the US around 18 months ago. Similar campaigns were used in the past to hamstring apartheid South Africa and tobacco companies, but this one is happening faster than any of those. Supporters of the movement include former US vice president Al Gore, who says fossil fuel companies are overvalued because they cannot burn the assets they own if the world is to avoid dangerous climate change. “Investors have so far been slow to appreciate the implications for the carbon-intensive assets within their portfolios.” The UN says global warming will impact more women than men because they make up the majority of the world’s poor. Close to two billion people rely on wood, charcoal and agricultural waste for cooking and heating. The primary gatherers of this toxic, labour- and carbon-intensive energy source are women. Thus, the education and social emancipation of women could be one of the greatest catalysts for grassroots climate action. Bangladeshi women who previously lived without electricity have been retraining as solar technicians to bring power to the country’s 95 million people who live without electric light. The country now has the fastest growing solar sector in the world with 2 million households fitted with solar power units. Falling technology prices, innovation and some decent government initiatives have seen renewables taking an increasing share of global electricity generation. After stalling through the early part of last decade, the increase is now inexorable. The sector, flushed with confidence, has begun to attract the kind of sustained investment growth of which most industries can only dream. In 2013 investors contributed US$268.2 billion to renewable projects – 5 times more than in 2004. The average growth of US$24 billion per year is in the same ball park as the riotous expansion of venture capital during the late 90s dot com bubble, except it has already lasted five time longer. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that by 2030 spending on renewable energy sources could make up two thirds of a global energy spend of US$7.7 trillion. In every part of the world (barring the Middle East) governments are taking advantage of the cheapest way to bring down their emissions – by saving energy. Energy efficient housing and appliances have seen global household emissions drop almost 1% per year, which doesn’t sound like a lot, but a 1% drop over a year is equivalent to every resident of New York going completely off grid. In the EU, households reduced their consumption by 15.5% between 2000 and 2011. In the developing world, where urban populations are booming and millions of new homes will need to be built, the IPCC has said there is a “window of opportunity” to create sustainable housing for the future. Since 2009, the United Nations’ Sushi programme has been training local builders and planners in Thailand, Brazil, India and Bangladesh to use low cost energy efficient building practices for social housing projects. A recent WWF/Ceres report found that the 53 US Fortune 100 companies who report their emissions had cut their carbon footprint by 58 million megatonnes in 2012 - roughly equivalent to the total emissions of Peru. This was achieved mainly through energy efficiency measures, although switching to green energy sources was also a factor. These measures are turning out to be not just cost effective but actually a business imperative. Each megatonne reduction saved an average of US$19 - a total of US$1.1 billion across just 53 companies. In the UK, tyre manufacturer Michelin has dropped its £20 million energy bill by 20% in five years by employing energy managers. “[Climate] adaptation is just good business,” say analysts from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Oil and gas companies are finding it increasingly expensive to find and extract their buried gravy. The Wall Street Journal reported in January the total capital expenditure of fossil giants Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell grew to £70 billion in 2013, yet all three have experienced huge declines in production relative to cost as their budgets are stretched by the need to open new wells in challenging environments. Off the coast of Brazil, huge oil fields lie more than 5km beneath the deep ocean floor. Despite the world’s largest corporate spending programme (£138 bn), national driller Petrobras is being driven towards the wall by the crippling expense of drilling so deep.  One area where the shift from Promised Land to land of compromise has been exemplified is the Arctic. Oil companies see the region’s melting sea ice as a fine opportunity to recover vast untapped reserves. But the costs of exploring the region have proved too great for Shell, who after spending £5bn, have shelved their exploration in the region. Many other companies, although notably not Russian behemoth Gazprom, have ruled out Arctic exploration in the foreseeable future. “I don’t think we’ll see any oil production in the Arctic any time soon. Probably not this decade and not the next,” Lundin Petroleum chairman Ian Lundin said in February. “The commercial challenges are too big.” Since 2011 electric car sales have doubled every year. Consumer acceptance of the technology is on an exponential growth curve that researchers say will see more than one million such vehicles driven across the world by the end of 2015. Five years ago, the technology was a quirky, futuristic gimmick lacking any serious impact on the global car market. Questions were raised about its price competitiveness. But in Norway, one in every hundred cars is now electric. Beyond the oft-enlightened Norse, the technology has a growing foothold in the US (which is by far the largest single market with 174,000 cars), Japan (68,000) and China (45,000)."
"How is deforestation and climate change affecting the lives of indigenous women? Women play a very important role in food production and often have to bear the brunt of the added burden of adapting to climate change in forests and farmland. Natural resource developments such as oil palm plantations or oil and gas exploration damage their fragile ecosystems and affect their ability to produce food. Despite this, they seldom have the rights to their lands. Without these rights they stand to lose their sole source of food, income and shelter.  Additionally they are often not allowed to participate in national and international strategies to tackle the issues that affect them. These are challenges that exist right across Latin America. How is the Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI) helping to address the issues of insecure and unclear land rights for indigenous people in Latin America? As a coalition we encourage collaboration between our partners and community organisations, who work through research and advocacy to catalyse major breakthroughs in forest and land rights priorities. We campaign to ensure policy and market reforms allow indigenous peoples and local communities to benefit from the lands they have lived on for generations. Currently, one of our focuses is on mainstreaming the issue of gender justice and the promotion of collective rights of women to land and forest. Is the lack of strong and effective legislation the underlying issue? Not necessarily. The underlying issue is that women's rights are often not respected at many levels. Their contributions are not acknowledged within their own communities, in the legal frameworks of their countries, nor are women included in global discussions around natural resource management. How could enhancing women's presence in forest governance improve resource conservation and regeneration? Enhancing women's participation in decisions over land and resources will ensure their knowledge, initiatives and needs are accounted for. Their lives are intertwined with the forests and they are integral members of indigenous and local communities, and have contributed to the governance of their territories and resources. Their knowledge is important in decisions related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. How are you working to address this? We work with our partners and collaborators, like the National Organization of Andean and Amazonian Indigenous Women of Peru, to intervene through research, convenings and international networking opportunities, technical assistance, and communications support. Two years ago, the Conference of Parties (COP), decided to improve the participation of women in the negotiations on national climate change strategies. However, the United Nations (UN) has yet to address land rights as part of the structural foundations of women's inequality. Without this no gender equality or climate change solutions can be complete or effective. To address this gap, we recently brought indigenous women from across the world to Lima for the International Indigenous Women's Forum, Land and Climate Change: Challenges and Opportunities in COP 20. Our goal is to generate recommendations for the Peruvian government to bring to the forefront of discussions at the COP in December, around women's role and contributions. What recommendations have come of the forum? The forum has come up with 12 recommendations centered on land rights and the contributions of indigenous women and communities to climate change policy at the national and international level. They include considering women in the tenure and collective titling of lands and territories, requiring states to prioritise empowering communities to adapt to climate change, and creating participatory mechanisms to develop, enhance and strengthen the capacity of indigenous women and our organisations. There is also a proposed review of legal frameworks to ensure the active, effective and equal participation of indigenous women at all stages and levels of decision-making. Ultimately what do you hope to see in UNFCCC's 2015 climate change agreement? We would like to see the promotion of collective land tenure rights, and the critical role of women within these collective land tenure systems, as major principles for countries to adhere to as a part of any international climate change mitigation and adaptation strategy. What challenges does RRI face? As a coalition, RRI has had to overcome challenges experienced by all coalitions in aligning the priorities of our diverse organisations. Our job then has been to connect organisations that perhaps would not have otherwise been working together, and help them see the 80% of their agendas that they agree on, rather than the 20% of their agendas where they diverge. What best practice can you share? Listen to the people who live and depend on the lands and forests. Consider women as equal actors and respect their knowledge and contributions. Giving women an equal voice is the best approach to addressing climate change issues in indigenous communities.

"New Zealand’s vast Southern Alps mountain range has lost a third of its permanent snow and ice over the past four decades, diminishing some of the country’s most spectacular glaciers, new research has found. A study of aerial surveys conducted by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) discovered that the Southern Alps’ ice volume has shrunk by 34% since 1977.  Researchers from the University of Auckland and University of Otago said this “dramatic” decrease has accelerated in the past 15 years and could lead to the severe decline of some of New Zealand’s mightiest glaciers. Glaciers, made up of ice that collects above the permanent snowline, have their size and shape altered by various conditions, such as temperature, wind and rainfall.  The Niwa data shows that New Zealand’s glaciers experienced three growth spurts during the 1970s and 1980s due to a change in the Pacific climate system that generated more wind. But since that wind circulation has returned to its previous state, rising global temperatures have caused the glaciers to retreat dramatically. About 40% of the recorded ice loss has been in the dozen largest New Zealand glaciers, including the Tasman, Murchison and Maud glaciers. These huge slabs of ice and snow, supported by rock, take many years to respond to changing temperatures but are now collapsing, according to researchers. “We are losing the bottom half of these large glaciers as they sink into lakes,” Trevor Chinn, a glaciologist at Niwa, told Guardian Australia. “We are also losing access to the upper glaciers. We used to be able to walk up them but it’s much harder now because the ridges are turning into gravel cliffs and they collapse. “There’s been a tipping point where the glaciers melt down to the same level as the river bed. We started getting the first lakes from melting glaciers in the 1970s and they’ve all grown. “It’s more or less decimated some of the tourist trips because people have so far to walk to the spectacular glaciers now. In the Mount Cook area, they used to have glacier tours and now they have lake tours to look at the floating icebergs.” Chinn has been documenting the glaciers of the Southern Alps, a 450km stretch of mountains that runs along the spine of New Zealand’s south island, since the 1970s. He said the delayed impact of rising temperatures is likely to shrink the glaciers even further. “In the long term, the ice in the valleys will disappear,” he said. “We won’t lose glaciers until the snowline moves above the top of the mountain. At Mount Cook, it will take 15C to 20C of warming to do that, so we will still have glaciers, they will just be a lot smaller. “The glaciers are responding to changes in the climate since 1890, so we are operating from a long way behind where we are. This decline will take decades.” The collapse of New Zealand’s glaciers is part of a wider global trend, with the thickness of smaller glaciers decreasing by approximately 12m on average between 1961 and 2005. This, in turn, will contribute to rising sea levels. Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the melting of mountain glaciers has added around 6-7cm to sea levels since 1900. A further 10-20cm is expected to be added from glaciers by 2100."
"As I sit here in a northern part of the United States (Minnesota), a rare summer arctic blast barrels down from Canada on what otherwise is one of the warmest days of the year. Global warming? I could use some global warming today, people are saying.  Not only is this a teachable moment, but it coincides with a major new study on climate connections. First, let’s see the current jet stream. It is wildly undulating, first swinging up into northern Canada before curving back and plunging into the central United States.   Typically, the jet stream represents a separation between cold arctic air and warmer southern air. If you are north of the jet stream, temperatures are cold whereas south of the jet stream it's more likely to be warm.  With this in mind, and the jet stream shown, you can almost predict the temperature pattern in the next image. The match is incredible and it is clear that my Minnesota cold-blast is more than balanced out by near 90°F temperatures in northern Canada. With all of this, I want to talk about a new study that looks at these fluctuations on a longer term.  Very recently, a paper Amplified mid-latitude planetary waves favor particular regional weather extremes was published in the journal Nature Climate Change. The authors, James Screen and Ian Simmonds, investigated the role that changes to upper level winds in the atmosphere have on the occurrence of extreme weather. What they found was very interesting. People who follow this site and the climate literature no doubt are aware that a hotly debated topic has arisen in recent years. I have written about studies that have linked loss of Arctic ice and warming of the Arctic region to more severe undulations in the jet stream. That research is still in its infancy and consequently, very exciting. While the idea that global warming increases jet stream undulations have been challenged by others, it is clear that some recent observations support the hypothesis. The latest study is related to this topic but still unique. The authors don’t ask the question “are humans changing the jet stream patterns?”. Instead, they ask, “how do undulations in the jet stream affect weather?”. To be fully accurate, the study isn’t just about jet streams, it really deals with mid-latitude planetary waves but for this article, I will use the term “jet stream” as a surrogate for simplicity. The authors went back into our weather records (1979–2012) and found the 40 months with the most extreme weather (most extreme precipitation and most extreme temperatures). They then evaluated how “wavy” the jet stream was during those extreme months. They found that,  months of extreme weather over mid-latitudes are commonly accompanied by significantly amplified quasi-stationary mid-tropospheric planetary waves. Conversely, months of near average weather over mid-latitudes are often accompanied by significantly attenuated waves. In common parlance, this means that when the jet stream undulates and travels very slowly, we see more extreme weather. Conversely, when the jet stream travels in a straighter path, the weather is less extreme. This association itself is not new but it brings the connection of large-scale climatic variations and our local weather to the fore of attention. Perhaps more important, however, are the follow-on observations from the authors. In particular, they report, Depending on geographical region, certain types of extreme weather (for example hot, cold, wet, dry) are more strongly related to wave amplitude changes than others. The findings suggest that amplification of quasi-stationary waves preferentially increases the probabilities of heat waves in western North America and Central Asia, cold outbreaks in eastern North America, droughts in central North America, Europe, and central Asia, and wet spells in western Asia. Dr James Screen, a Research Fellow at the University of Exeter and lead author of the study told me,  The impacts of large and slow moving atmospheric waves are different in different places. In some places amplified waves increase the chance of unusually hot conditions, and in others the risk of cold, wet or dry conditions.  To my knowledge, previous investigations have not elucidated the geographical locations of extreme weather nor have they identified the location-dependent weather extremes. It will be interesting to watch present and future weather to determine if these relationships between waves and weather continue.  A note of caution however, we must be mindful that there are other weather factors at play which are superimposed on those discussed in the article. For instance, changes from El Niño to La Niña in the Pacific and long-term variability of sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic are also known to impact our weather extremes. Separating these multiple factors will take skill. "

"There’s a bit in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland where things get “curiouser and curiouser” as the heroine tries to reach a garden at the end of a rat-hole sized corridor that she’s just way too big for. She drinks a potion and eats a cake with no real clue what the consequences might be. She grows to nine feet tall, shrinks to ten inches high and cries literal floods of frustrated tears.  I spent a couple of days at a symposium in Sydney last week that looked at the moral and ethical issues around the concept of geoengineering the Earth’s climate as a “response” to global warming. No metaphor is ever quite perfect (climate impacts are no ‘wonderland’), but Alice’s curious experiences down the rabbit hole seem to fit the idea of medicating the globe out of a possible catastrophe. And yes, the fact that in some quarters geoengineering is now on the table shows how the debate over climate change policy is itself becoming “curiouser and curiouser” still. It’s tempting too to dismiss ideas like pumping sulphate particles into the atmosphere or making clouds whiter as some sort of surrealist science fiction. But beyond the curiosity lies actions being countenanced and discussed by some of the world’s leading scientific institutions.  Geoengineering – also known as climate engineering or climate modification - comes in as many flavours as might have been on offer at the Mad Hatter’s Tea Party. Professor Jim Falk, of the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute at the University of Melbourne, has a list of more than 40 different techniques that have been suggested. They generally take two approaches. Carbon Dioxide Reduction (CDR) is pretty self explanatory. Think tree planting, algae farming, increasing the carbon in soils, fertilising the oceans or capturing emissions from power stations. Anything that cuts the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Solar Radiation Management (SRM) techniques are concepts to try and reduce the amount of solar energy reaching the earth. Think pumping sulphate particles into the atmosphere (this mimics major volcanic eruptions that have a cooling effect on the planet), trying to whiten clouds or more benign ideas like painting roofs white. In 2008 an Australian Government–backed research group issued a report on the state-of-play of ocean fertilisation, recording there had been 12 experiments carried out of various kinds with limited to zero evidence of “success”. This priming of the “biological pump” as its known, promotes the growth of organisms (phytoplankton) that store carbon and then sink to the bottom of the ocean. The report raised the prospect that larger scale experiments could interfere with the oceanic food chain, create oxygen-depleted “dead zones” (no fish folks), impact on corals and plants and various other unknowns.  The Royal Society – the world’s oldest scientific institution – released a report in 2009, also reviewing various geoengineering technologies. In 2011, Australian scientists gathered at a geoengineering symposium organised by the Australian Academy of Science and the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering. The London Protocol – a maritime convention relating to dumping at sea – was amended last year to try and regulate attempts at “ocean fertilisation” – where substances, usually iron, are dumped into the ocean to artificially raise the uptake of carbon dioxide.  The latest major United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also addressed the geoengineering issue in several chapters of its latest report. The IPCC summarised geoengineering this way. CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on a global scale. There is insufficient knowledge to quantify how much CO2 emissions could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. Modelling indicates that SRM methods, if realizable, have the potential to substantially offset a global temperature rise, but they would also modify the global water cycle, and would not reduce ocean acidification. If SRM were terminated for any reason, there is high confidence that global surface temperatures would rise very rapidly to values consistent with the greenhouse gas forcing. CDR and SRM methods carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale. Towards the end of this year, the US National Academy of Sciences will be publishing a major report on the “technical feasibility” of some geoengineering techniques. The symposium in Sydney was co-hosted by the University of New South Wales and the Sydney Environment Institute at the University of Sydney (for full disclosure here, they paid my travel costs and one night stay). Dr Matthew Kearnes, one of the organisers of the workshop from UNSW, told me there was “nervousness among many people about even thinking or talking about geoengineering.” He said: I would not want to dismiss that nervousness, but this is an agenda that’s now out there and it seems to be gathering steam and credibility in some elite establishments. Internationally geoengineering tends to be framed pretty narrowly as just a case of technical feasibility, cost and efficacy. Could it be done? What would it cost? How quickly would it work? We wanted to get a way from the arguments about the pros and cons and instead think much more carefully about what this tells us about the climate change debate more generally. The symposium covered a range of frankly exhausting philosophical, social and political considerations – each of them jumbo-sized cans full of worms ready to open. Professor Stephen Gardiner, of the University of Washington, Seattle, pushed for the wider community to think about the ethical and moral consequences of geoengineering. He drew a parallel between the way, he said, that current fossil fuel combustion takes benefits now at the expense of impacts on future generations. Geoengineering risked making the same mistake. Clive Hamilton’s book Earthmasters notes “in practice any realistic assessment of how the world works must conclude that geoengineering research is virtually certain to reduce incentives to pursue emission reductions”.  Curiouser still, is that some of the world’s think tanks who shout the loudest that human-caused climate change might not even be a thing, or at least a thing not worth worrying about, are happy to countenance geoengineering as a solution to the problem they think is overblown.  For example, in January this year the Copenhagen Consensus Center, a US-based think tank founded by Danish political scientist Bjorn Lomborg, issued a submission to an Australian Senate inquiry looking at overseas aid and development. Lomborg’s center has for many years argued that cutting greenhouse gas emissions is too expensive and that action on climate change should have a low-priority compared to other issues around the world.  Lomborg himself says human-caused climate change will not turn into an economic negative until near the end of this century. Yet Lomborg’s submission told the Australian Senate suggested that every dollar spent on “investigat[ing] the feasibility of planetary cooling through geoengineering technologies” could yield “$1000 of benefits” although this, Lomborg wrote, was a “rough estimate”. But these investigations, Lomborg submitted, “would serve to better understand risks, costs, and benefits, but also act as an important potential insurance against global warming”. Several academics I’ve spoken with have voiced fears that the idea of unproven and potentially disastrous geoengineering technologies being an option to shield societies from the impacts of climate change could be used to distract policy makers and the public from addressing the core of the climate change issue – that is, curbing emissions in the first place. But if the idea of some future nation, or group of nations, or even corporations, some embarking on a major project to modify the Earth’s climate systems leaves you feeling like you’ve fallen down a surreal rabbit hole, then perhaps we should also ask ourselves this. Since the year 1750, the world has added something in the region of 1,339,000,000,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (that’s 1.34 trillion tonnes) to the atmosphere from fossil fuel and cement production. Raising the level of CO2 in the atmosphere by 40 per cent could be seen as accidental geoengineering. Time to crawl out of the rabbit hole?"
"Beef’s environmental impact dwarfs that of other meat including chicken and pork, new research reveals, with one expert saying that eating less red meat would be a better way for people to cut carbon emissions than giving up their cars. The heavy impact on the environment of meat production was known but the research shows a new scale and scope of damage, particularly for beef. The popular red meat requires 28 times more land to produce than pork or chicken, 11 times more water and results in five times more climate-warming emissions. When compared to staples like potatoes, wheat, and rice, the impact of beef per calorie is even more extreme, requiring 160 times more land and producing 11 times more greenhouse gases.  Agriculture is a significant driver of global warming and causes 15% of all emissions, half of which are from livestock. Furthermore, the huge amounts of grain and water needed to raise cattle is a concern to experts worried about feeding an extra 2 billion people by 2050. But previous calls for people to eat less meat in order to help the environment, or preserve grain stocks, have been highly controversial. “The big story is just how dramatically impactful beef is compared to all the others,” said Prof Gidon Eshel, at Bard College in New York state and who led the research on beef’s impact. He said cutting subsidies for meat production would be the least controversial way to reduce its consumption. “I would strongly hope that governments stay out of people’s diet, but at the same time there are many government policies that favour of the current diet in which animals feature too prominently,” he said. “Remove the artificial support given to the livestock industry and rising prices will do the rest. In that way you are having less government intervention in people’s diet and not more.” Eshel’s team analysed how much land, water and nitrogen fertiliser was needed to raise beef and compared this with poultry, pork, eggs and dairy produce. Beef had a far greater impact than all the others because as ruminants, cattle make far less efficient use of their feed. “Only a minute fraction of the food consumed by cattle goes into the bloodstream, so the bulk of the energy is lost,” said Eshel. Feeding cattle on grain rather than grass exacerbates this inefficiency, although Eshel noted that even grass-fed cattle still have greater environmental footprints than other animal produce. The footprint of lamb, relatively rarely eaten in the US, was not considered in the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds, said the new work is based on national US data, rather than farm-level studies, and provides a useful overview. “It captures the big picture,” he said, adding that livestock is the key to the sustainability of global agriculture. “The biggest intervention people could make towards reducing their carbon footprints would not be to abandon cars, but to eat significantly less red meat,” Benton said. “Another recent study implies the single biggest intervention to free up calories that could be used to feed people would be not to use grains for beef production in the US.” However, he said the subject was always controversial: “This opens a real can of worms.” Prof Mark Sutton, at the UK’s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: “Governments should consider these messages carefully if they want to improve overall production efficiency and reduce the environmental impacts. But the message for the consumer is even stronger. Avoiding excessive meat consumption, especially beef, is good for the environment.” He said: “The US and Europe alike are using so much of their land in highly inefficient livestock farming systems, while so much good quality cropland is being used to grow animal feeds rather than human food.” Separately, a second study of tens of thousands of British people’s daily eating habits shows that meat lovers’ diets cause double the climate-warming emissions of vegetarian diets. The study of British people’s diets was conducted by University of Oxford scientists and found that meat-rich diets - defined as more than 100g per day - resulted in 7.2kg of carbon dioxide emissions. In contrast, both vegetarian and fish-eating diets caused about 3.8kg of CO2 per day, while vegan diets produced only 2.9kg. The research analysed the food eaten by 30,000 meat eaters, 16,000 vegetarians, 8,000 fish eaters and 2,000 vegans."
