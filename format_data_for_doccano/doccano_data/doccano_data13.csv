Christopher Monckton of Brenchley sends this article by Grant Goldman, a popular radio host in Sydney, Australia.
In July 1937 when the Marco Polo Bridge incident launched Japan’s aggression against China, that was not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action against Japan.
In March 1939 the German occupation of Czechoslovakia was not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action against the Nazis.
In November 1956 Soviet troops overrunning Hungary was not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action against the USSR.
In October 2013 the massacre of Syriac Orthodox Christians and destruction of 14 churches in Sadad in Syria was not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action against the Jihadis responsible.

The likelihood that there are more slaves in the world today than at any previous time in human history is not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action against the slave trade.
Three terrible genocides were perpetrated in the twentieth century.  By the Turks against Armenian, Assyrian and Greek Christians in 1915, by the Soviets against the Ukrainians in 1932-1933, and of course by the Nazis against the Jews from 1939 to 1945.
None of these horrible events prompted Australian religious leaders to act with one voice.
Why am I telling you all this?
What is important enough for Australian religious leaders purporting to represent Anglicans, Catholics, Hindus, Buddhists and Jews, to get together and write to the Government and the Opposition demanding action?
Well, a person named Thea Ormerod, representing a numerically insignificant outfit called Australian Religious Response to Climate Change, drafted a letter for them all to sign, calling for a 40% cut in the level of carbon dioxide emissions compared with 1990 levels by the year 2025, and an 80% cut by 2030.

We are talking here about the comprehensive economic destruction of Australia, with mass unemployment, grinding poverty, widespread hunger and disease, shocking child mortality and truncated lifespans for everybody who is not amongst the elite.
Thea Ormerod is likely related to Neil Ormerod, who is Professor of Theology at the Australian Catholic University.  Oh yes, this is the educational institution which a month ago awarded two scholarships, each for full tuition fees for four years, to honour executed drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.
This leads me to observe that the worthy goal of getting Australia to lead a worldwide campaign to abolish capital punishment is not important enough for Australian religious leaders to write to the government demanding strong action.   But strong action against carbon dioxide is what they want.
The Church of England has been pushing the anti-energy barrow for some time. They actually ran a Global Divestment Day on February 14 this year.  It attracted little attention because St Valentine’s Day is the day when most people are busy chatting each other up and eating chocolate.

What issues do you want your Church to concentrate on?  World peace? Ending poverty?  Defeating disease?  Combatting crime?  Protecting minorities? Saving children from sexual abuse?  Helping the homeless?  Maybe, just maybe, even campaigning against sin?
What about preaching forgiveness?   That is what churches used to do.  Or do you want your church to act like basically a subsidiary of the Greens?
It’s your Church, and it’s your money that pays the bills.  If the Churches do forget that, then people will get baptised, married and buried online.  It’s cheaper.
The Church of England is part of a push to reduce Australia’s carbon dioxide emissions compared with 1990 levels by the draconian figure of 80% in the next fifteen years, which would make Australia unable to feed, house and clothe Australians.
In Britain, North America and Australia the Church of England has declared war on coal, through a combination of divestment programs and propaganda from the pulpit.
Time for some facts about coal.   The gerontologist and evolutionary biologist Caleb Finch tells us that since the early 1800s life expectancy in Europe has doubled.  The single greatest factor in the longevity revolution has been coal.

Beginning in the eighteenth century and accelerating into the nineteenth century, coal made possible stunning increases in productivity.  Coal saved from destruction the forests of Britain which by the mid eighteenth century were rapidly disappearing.
Coal dramatically reduced pollution caused by cooking and heating with wood and animal dung.  Coal permitted large scale smelting of metals. Coal made possible modern medical science and modern agriculture. Coal opened the way to commerce and freedom of movement on a scale never before imagined.
Thanks to coal, for the very first time ordinary workers who were not members of the aristocracy nor of the clergy had leisure time.  Life was still tough, but thanks to coal life rapidly improved.
Instead of being permanently enslaved to tasks like collecting wood to heat and to cook, women had the opportunity to learn to read and become educated or musical or artistic or political or charitable as they wished.
Coal made possible the growth of democratic institutions and, vitally important, the abolition of slavery.   Nineteenth-century Britain saw the flowering of culture with bands, orchestras, choirs, drama societies, literary societies, trade unions, and, of course, the flowering of the Church of England.


I’ll mention some of the great hymnists of the late eighteenth century and the nineteenth century.  In chronological order (top left to bottom right): John Wesley (1703-1791); Edward Perronet (1726-1792); William Cowper (1731-1800); John Newton (1725-1807); Reginald Heiber (1783-1826); Joseph M. Scriven (1819-1886); Matthew Bridges (1800-1894); Carl Gustav Boberg (1859-1940).
Thanks to coal, hymn books could be printed cheaply and thanks to coal there were trees left in the land to make the paper.
In Britain, by 1860 around 400,000 coal industry workers were each producing around 175 tonnes of coal in a year for an annual total of seventy million tonnes of coal.  In 1913 around 1,100,000 coal industry workers were each producing around 264 tonnes of coal in a year for a total of 290 million tonnes.
This great increase in coal production coincided with wonderful progress in every aspect of society.  People lived longer, ate better and their purchasing power increased year by year.

As the twentieth century dawned, coal was already popularising the wonderful blessing of electricity.  The former major disadvantage of coal-fired power – sulphur dioxide emissions – was overcome with fluidised bed combustion using limestone, and coal has continued as the world mainstay of electrical power.

Tragically, 1.3 billion people – eighteen percent of the world’s population – have no access to electricity and so are deprived of all the wonderful things we take for granted.  Expansion of coal production is vital as part of the energy mix necessary to offer the poor and disadvantaged of the world an escape route from poverty, misery and short lifespans.

By declaring war on coal, people who purport to represent the Church of England are committing a terrible crime against the world’s poorest people.
My suggestion to the people purporting to lead the Church of England is re-read the Parable of the Talents.  It’s still there in Matthew Chapter 25, verses 14-30.

The Parable of the Talents (etching): Lucas van Doetechum (floruit 1554-1572)

"Industry and environment groups have questioned the point of the Coalition government’s “safeguard mechanism” – which promised to keep a lid on industrial greenhouse gas emissions – after major companies were allowed to again increase pollution without penalty. BHP, Anglo American and Tomago Aluminium were among companies given the green light to increase emissions by a combined 1.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year in an announcement by the Clean Energy Regulator in late July.  The permitted increases are nearly equivalent to the 1.7m tonnes of emissions reduction purchased by the government through its main climate policy, the $2.5bn emissions reduction fund (ERF), at an auction in March. Those cuts cost taxpayers $27.6m. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) said it showed there was no point in the safeguard mechanism existing in its current form. The scheme was initially promised to stop increases in industrial emissions unreasonably wiping out cuts paid for through the ERF. Despite this, companies bound by the safeguard increased emissions by 12% in its first two years of operation. “It is worse than a do-nothing policy. It is achieving the exact opposite of what it was designed to achieve,” the ACF’s climate change program manager, Gavan McFadzean, said. Tennant Reed, from the Australian Industry Group, said the mechanism currently had compliance costs for businesses “but no real purpose”. He said it could be used as a building block for reducing industrial emissions, but “right now it’s more like a single Lego block lying on the floor – without effect, unless you step on it”. The safeguard mechanism sets an annual or multi-year pollution limit, known as a baseline, for industrial facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes a year. Original baselines were based on either the highest point in pollution at a site between 2009 and 2014 or a forecast of future emissions. Companies that exceeded that level were expected to pay to offset the additional emissions. In practice, some had to pay but many companies that breached baselines were allowed to increase their limit without penalty. Under changes being introduced in March, all facilities are being moved to limits based not on their total emissions, but on emissions intensity – how much they expect to emit per unit of production. It will confirm that companies can move limits up or down over time depending on how their business is performing. The July data shows Anglo American has been granted a 33% increase in the allowed annual emissions from its Capcoal mine in Queensland’s Bowen Basin, from 1.98m tonnes to 2.63m tonnes a year. An Anglo American spokesperson said the increase was required as the underground metallurgical coalmine had moved into deeper and “naturally more geologically gassy” conditions. “The safeguard mechanism anticipates that in comparing emissions between years these kinds of factors are taken into account,” the spokesperson said. The Australian Conservation Foundation said if the mine emitted up to its limit the increase would be equivalent to putting more than 140,000 extra cars on the road. BHP owns or co-owns six of the facilities granted an increase in emissions baseline. They include iron ore mines in Western Australia, coalmines in Queensland, Olympic Dam in South Australia and the Gippsland Basin oil and gas joint venture operated by Esso. Combined, their emissions allowance has risen by 753,099 tonnes a year. A BHP spokesperson said the increased baselines were consistent with its company-wide goals of keeping its total emissions at or below 2017 levels in 2022 and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Other sites granted an increased emissions limit included the Tomago aluminium smelter in New South Wales (a 118,000 tonne, or 10%, rise) and a Roy Hill iron ore mine in the Pilbara (a 55,000 tonnes, or 14%, increase). New facilities granted baselines in addition to the newly permitted 1.6m tonnes emissions rise included a coalmine at Mount Pleasant, NSW, owned by Mach Energy, which can emit up to 663,971 tonnes a year. Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said the safeguard mechanism had been “completely ineffective” in capping pollution, let alone bringing it down. “The Liberals continue to refuse to give the policy any teeth, which shouldn’t be surprising given this government’s ideological opposition to real action on climate change,” he said. The Greens’ leader, Adam Bandt, said the scheme had been designed to meet the needs of big industry, not the climate. He called for the reintroduction of a carbon price. “If you pull someone over for doing 90 in a 40 km/hr school zone you should fine them, not lift the limit to 110,” he said. “The government has let the polluters write the rules.” Reed, who works on climate, energy and environment policy for the Australian Industry Group, said the mechanism could help cut industrial emissions if it included updated baselines, a predictable plan to make them tighter over time and support for companies that compete internationally. A spokesperson for the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, did not answer a question about how the government planned to reduce industrial emissions, but denied money spend on the ERF was wasted. They said it had delivered 14.8m tonnes of emissions abatement. “Without the ERF, Australia’s emissions would have been higher,” the spokesperson said. A review commissioned by Taylor, led by the former Business Council of Australian president Grant King, recommended in May that the mechanism be changed to introduce “below-baseline crediting” to reward companies that reduced emissions below their cap. To qualify, companies would have had to undertake “transformative” projects that reduced emissions intensity (the amount they emit per unit of production) so they were not rewarded for just producing less or shutting down. Taylor said the government accepted the recommendation and would begin consulting with industry on how to establish a “low-emissions technology deployment incentive scheme”. No further details have been released. The proposal could be a step towards transforming the safeguard mechanism into what it was initially intended to become – an emissions trading scheme under which companies could buy and sell carbon credits and limits could be reduced over time to cut carbon pollution. Taylor has rejected suggestions the safeguard mechanism was a form of carbon pricing or would become one. McFadzean said: “Frustratingly, the safeguard mechanism actually has the basic architecture required to drive down industry emissions. The thing missing is political will.” National emissions were largely flat under the Coalition government before the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the economy. They dipped slightly in the most recent greenhouse accounts, but industrial emissions continued to rise."

Climate Crisis extremists attack experts who challenge claims of imminent climate Armageddon

Guest opinion by Paul Driessen
ISIL and other Islamist jihad movements continue to round up and silence all who oppose them or refuse to convert to their extreme religious tenets. They are inspiring thousands to join them. Their intolerance, vicious tactics and growing power seem to have inspired others, as well.
After years of claiming the science is settled and unprecedented man-made catastrophes are occurring right now, Climate Crisis, Inc. is increasingly desperate. Polls put climate change at the bottom of every list of public concerns. China and India refuse to cut energy production or emissions. Real-world weather and climate totally contradict their dire models and forecasts. Expensive, subsidized, environmentally harmful renewable energy makes little sense in world freshly awash in cheap, accessible oil, gas and coal.
Perhaps worse, Congress is in Republican control, and in 23 months the White House and Executive Branch could also shift dramatically away from the Freezing-Jobless-in-the-Dark Side of the Force.
Climate Crisis industrialists are also fed up with constant carping, criticism and questions from growing numbers of experts who will not kowtow to their End of Days theology. Once seemingly near, their dream of ruling a hydrocarbon-free world of “sustainably” lower living standards become more remote every week. Extremist factions had dreamed of a global climatist caliphate and want vengeance.
So borrowing from Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton mentor Saul Alinsky’s book, Rules for Radicals, they have gone on the attack: Pick a target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it. A good tactic is one your people enjoy. A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag. Keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions. They’ve also borrowed from the Islamic State playbook: Silence your enemies.
Led by Greenpeace associate Kert Davies, this Climatist Jihad wing of the climate chaos movement has launched a well funded, carefully choreographed vendetta of character assassination and destruction, vilifying dangerous manmade climate change “deniers” and trying to destroy their careers. Their Big Green, Big Government and media allies are either actively complicit, rooting from the sidelines or silent.
Instead of bullets, bombs and beheadings, they use double standards, Greenpeace FOIA demands, letters from Senator Ed Markey and Congressman Raul Grijalva, threats of lost funding and jobs, and constant intimidation and harassment. Submit, recant, admit your guilt, renounce your nature-rules-climate faith, Climatist Jihadis tell climate realists. Or suffer the consequences, which might even include IRS, EPA and Fish & Wildlife Service swat teams bursting through your doors, as they did with Gibson Guitars.
Their first target was Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics scientist Wei-Hock “Willie” Soon. Working closely with Greenpeace’s Climate Investigations Center, the Boston Globe and New York Times alleged that Dr. Soon received $1.25 million from the fossil fuel industry, but failed to disclose those funds when his scientific papers were published and falsely claimed he had no conflict of interest.
The charges are bogus. Harvard had full knowledge of Dr. Soon’s research financing and took 40% of the grant money off the top: some $500,000! The details are all public records, and Dr. Soon has a solid track record of going where his careful and extensive research takes him – regardless of where the money comes from. Not a scrap of evidence suggests that he falsified or fabricated data or conclusions, or twisted his science to satisfy research sponsors, on any of the numerous topics he has studied.
He has received incredible flak from environmentalist pressure groups, media outlets and even his own university – and has courageously stood behind his research, analyses and findings, which continue to withstand intense scientific scrutiny. Harvard-Smithsonian recently said it “does not support Dr. Soon’s conclusions on climate change,” and Harvard Earth and Planetary Sciences Professor Daniel Schrag averred that Soon’s approach to finding global average temperatures was perhaps not “as honest as other approaches.” But they offer not a scintilla of evidence to support their allegations of inaccuracy and dishonesty, and give him no opportunity to respond.
Indeed, one of the most prominent aspects of the climate imbroglio is the steadfast refusal of alarmist scientists to discuss or debate their findings with experts who argue that extensive, powerful natural forces – not human carbon dioxide emissions – drive Earth’s climate and weather. “Manmade disaster” proponents also refuse to divulge raw data, computer codes and other secretive work that is often paid for with taxpayer money and is always used to justify laws, treaties, regulations, mandates and subsidies that stifle economic growth, kill jobs and reduce living standards.
Dr. Soon is not the only target. The Climate Jihadists are also going after Robert Balling, Matt Briggs, John Christy, Judith Curry, Tom Harris, Steven Hayward, David Legates, Richard Lindzen, and Roger Pielke, Jr. More are sure to follow, because their work eviscerates climate cataclysm claims and raises serious questions about the accuracy, credibility, integrity and sanctity of alarmist science.
Climate Crisis, Inc. wants a monopoly over the issue. Its members focus almost exclusively on alleged human causes of climate change and extreme weather events – and would love to see skeptics silenced. Crisis proponents will not even attend scientific conferences where skeptics discuss natural causes and alarmists have opportunities to defend their hypotheses, models and evidence. (Perhaps the FCC needs to investigate this monopoly and issue “climate neutrality” rules, to ensure honest and balanced discussion.)
It fits a depressing pattern: of the White House, Democrats and liberals shutting down debate, permitting no amendments, conducting business behind closed doors, not allowing anyone to read proposed laws and regulations, rarely even recognizing that there are differing views – on ObamaCare, ObamaNetCare, IRS harassment of conservative donors and groups, PM Netanyahu’s speech to Congress, or climate change.
The Climate Crisis industry thrives on tens of billions of dollars annually, for one-sided climate research, drilling and fracking studies, renewable energy projects and other programs, all based on dubious claims that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions threaten climate stability and planetary survival.
Businesses, job holders and consumers pay the huge costs of complying with the resultant regulations and soaring energy costs. Taxpayers pay for much of the research and propaganda that drives the rulemaking. Russia and hard-left foundations have also contributed billions to the process; and government unions, environmental pressure groups and renewable energy companies give generously to researchers and to politicians who keep the alarmist research programs, regulatory processes, mandates and subsidies alive.
All of this raises another elephantine issue. If a couple million dollars over a decade’s time creates near-criminal conflict-of-interest and disclosure problems for skeptic/realist scientists, what effects do billions of dollars in research money have on alarmist researchers and their universities and institutions?
Few, if any, alarmist researchers have disclosed that their work was funded by government agencies, companies, foundations and others with enormous financial, policy, political and other interests in their work, ensuring that their conclusions support manmade factors and debunk natural causes. Many of those researchers have signed statements that their research and papers involved no conflicts, knowing they would not get these grants, if their outcomes did not reflect the sponsors’ interests and perspectives.
Moreover, ClimateGate, IPCC revelations and other investigations have revealed extensive and troubling incidents of manipulated data, faulty models, wild exaggerations, and completely baseless claims about hottest years, disappearing glaciers, coastal flooding and other “crises.” And those claims severely impact our energy costs, jobs, living standards, economic growth and freedoms.
We need to end the double standard – and investigate the alarmist researchers and institutions.
Or better yet, let us instead have that all-out, open, robust debate that climate realists have long sought – and alarmists have refused to join. Equal government and other money for all research. All cards and evidence on the table. No more hiding data and codes. Answer all questions, no matter how tough or inconvenient. And let honest science decide what our energy and economic futures will be.

"The reaction to the euthanasia of Marius the giraffe at Copenhagen Zoo has highlighted cultural differences in attitudes to animals and death between the UK and Denmark. I first visited the Copenhagen Zoo around 20 years ago and met the zoo’s scientific director Bengt Holst, who found himself recently at the centre of a campaign to save Marius, and is now the subject of another calling for his resignation.  The zoo had then, as it still does, a policy against using contraception for its animals and consequently a policy of euthanasia of the surplus animals that would arise as a result. In contrast to most zoos around the world which use contraception or sterilisation to control their animals’ reproduction, Copenhagen Zoo has chosen not to for two principal reasons. Some methods of contraception can have negative effects on an animal’s health and future reproductive ability, although slowly science is eliminating these.  But the Danes also strongly believe that being a parent is an enriching experience for their animals. The problem is that while it solves one animal welfare problem – the well-being of the breeding adults – it creates a subsequent ethical issue, that of what to do with the “surplus offspring”. To humans, the concept of surplus offspring sounds wrong, but in the world of zoos, where space for endangered species and resources to keep them is limited, it is a different story. An enclosure to house giraffes is very expensive to build and maintain – and zoos do not have limitless pots of money. So if you allow animals to breed as often as they want, inevitably the result is animals perceived as surplus to requirements.  If Marius has many siblings or other relatives in the captive giraffe population, not just at Copenhagen but at other Danish zoos and even those across Europe, then his genes are not important in terms of maintaining genetic diversity. This is one of the goals that drives zoo conservation, as it is genetic diversity that allows species to adapt to changes in their environment – and zoos see themselves as providing a population safety net. For wild animal populations this is of vital importance. So Copenhagen Zoo would argue that by allowing Marius to live – in any zoo, and especially one of those in Europe already well-stocked with individuals bearing his family’s genes, he is taking up limited and valuable space. Space that should be allotted to an individual that will add to or help maintain genetic diversity. This is a very pragmatic stance. To many people in Britain this goes against our cultural identity as a nation of animal lovers. Danes love animals too, but express this in a different manner. They would, I suspect, agree with animal welfare experts in arguing that death itself is not an animal welfare issue; what is important is that the death is humane, and that the life that preceded it was good. In the UK we are perhaps too focused on longevity and not on quality of life. This is the key difference in attitude to the case of Marius the giraffe. Conservation biology is driven by society’s recognition that human actions have driven many species to extinction and that we have a responsibility to do something about it. This is an ethical question, and again, it is society that determines what is right or wrong – not me, and not Bengt Holst or Copenhagen Zoo. Most societies around the world have determined that it is wrong to drive other species to extinction, but many differ on the question of how to save them. So in this case, I’m sure that Copenhagen Zoo chose to euthanise Marius because it sincerely believes that this is the best course of action for giraffe conservation. Similarly, keepers in Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire euthanised their six lions last week for the same reason. Equally, others sincerely believe that this situation should have been avoided by the use of contraception, despite the welfare implications for the breeding adults. It is perhaps time for us to remember that the nations of the world are jointly responsible for managing the world’s flora and fauna. Intentionally or not this case has sparked an important debate. It is only by attempting to understand each other’s cultures that we can hope to make any progress on global issues such as wildlife conservation."
"I’d like to tell you about my home, Masig Island. Masig is a coral cay in the Torres Strait Islands, about halfway between the tip of Cape York and the mainland of Papua New Guinea. I wake and sleep to the sound of the ocean breathing its waves on to the beach. My genealogy, my ancestors, my family tree lies here. This island is my library, my school and my storyteller. It’s love, it’s life, and it’s ancient. There is a mythical, spiritual aura around this place. We are not migrants to this sacred land, we have lived here for generations. Masig is my playground and my kids’ playground, and will be their kids’ playground after them. I want my kids to live life to the fullest, and live life how we have enjoyed it. When I watch my kids running on the beach, I think about how I ran on that beach and my grandfathers, great grandfathers and their forefathers did before us. And I want to gift my grandchildren and great grandchildren a place they can call home. I want to see my kids swim in the ocean, respecting the abundance of food that the ocean gives us and enjoying the freedom of being on your own traditional land, as we have been doing for thousands of years. But climate change is putting our island home at risk. The Torres Strait has not contributed to climate change, but we are on the frontline of its impacts. I’ve seen the impacts myself very clearly as the years pass. Inundation and the erosion of the shorelines have washed away our roads, salinity is destroying our coconut trees and garden crops, and our drinking water wells have been contaminated. I’ve seen human remains washed into the sea, and I’ve had to collect the bones of my ancestors from their sacred resting place on the shoreline, and move them further inland. These impacts are something we weren’t prepared for. We are warriors, and we are bringing our warrior spirit to this fight Unless something is done urgently, the climate science tells us that the impacts will get worse, and could even threaten our ability to stay on Masig Island. The threat of being displaced – all due to the Australian government’s failure to act on climate change – is one felt across the diverse Torres Strait Islands. This would be a catastrophe for Torres Strait Islanders. Our land is the string connecting us to our culture. It ties us to who we are. If we were to move, we would be like helium balloons disconnected from our culture. Our culture would become extinct. We would be a dying race of people. That’s why I have joined with seven other Torres Strait Islanders from across the region to take the Australian government to the UN over its inaction on climate change, as a violation of our human rights. We are demanding the government protect the island from the effects of climate change, and make sure that all steps are based on a full, proper study across the island of what is happening. And we need the government to sit down and consult with Masig people and listen to our local knowledge of the environment. And the government must look in its backyard at how it is contributing to the problem, and move away from coal, oil and gas. We filed our case with the UN in 2019, and in December they announced $25m for sea wall funding in the Torres Strait. This is a start, but it is only crumbs when you consider the scale of the problem and the fact that this will need to be split over 18 islands already experiencing major impacts. And it doesn’t address Australia’s ongoing contribution to climate change through our fossil fuel exports and domestic emissions. We have just seen the government’s response to the UN case, which will not be released publicly. The government is saying that the UN should dismiss the case as the threat to our human rights is in the future – but how can they say that when we have told them about the impacts we are seeing right now? The government also said that the case should be dismissed because Australia is not the only contributor to the problem. We know that the rest of the world is contributing, but Australia is one of the world’s biggest users of fossil fuels and we must start somewhere. We are Australian citizens and international law says that Australia must protect our human rights. We are warriors, and we are bringing our warrior spirit to this fight. We are joining with our Indigenous brothers and sisters across the many nations that make up Australia, and beyond our shores across the Pacific. Our Pacific family also faces similar threats but we will not drown in this fight. This is our time to rise as a quiver of arrows, stronger together, because our mothers gave birth to warriors. We’re all one black people and share the same pain. To lose an island of people is like an amputation because our histories and cultures are so interconnected that we feel the slightest loss. Right now, we are calling for solidarity from the Australian public as we fight to protect our island homes, our people, and our culture, kids and future generations. • Yessie Mosby is a Zenadh Kes Masig man, living in the Kulkalgal tribe area in the Central Torres Strait Islands.

"The assault on British coastlines by storm, flood and sea this winter is a taste of things to come. Rising sea levels and a greater risk of coastal flooding are a significant future threat. Britain is an island nation, and a great deal of important and expensive infrastructure, from ports and harbours to power stations and industry, lies along the coast. Roads and railway links are also vital – some entire coastal regions’ economies depend on key highways or rail links. The coastal section of the London-Penzance railway line that runs between Dawlish and Teignmouth in Devon is a perfect example. As the main railway connection for the southwest of England to the rest of Great Britain, it is a vital transport link for the Devon and Cornwall economy. Several sections of the line have just been washed into the English Channel by storms, leaving the tracks hanging suspended in space over the waves. Network Rail’s first repair estimates are 4-6 weeks work, with engineers calling it the “worst damage they’ve seen in their careers”. Lying so close to sea level, just a few metres above the waves, the line has been susceptible to frequent closure during high seas and storms ever since it opened in 1846. The past 30 years have seen the problem worsen, coinciding with rising sea levels, but the current damage is the most severe in its entire 178 years of service. It is currently estimated that sea-level will by 2020 have risen between 5-7cm from 2010 levels, which by my estimates could double the amount of disruption on the line. By 2050 services could be affected for several months of each year. It is not a case of if but when the railway will be lost completely to the sea. It is vital that the region prepares for this eventuality, and although Dawlish is arguably the most iconic coastal railway, there are others in North Wales, northwest England and in Scotland that will face similar problems in years to come. Coastal flooding is most likely when strong storms and low atmospheric pressure combine to drive storm surges towards the coast. Coupled with high tides the effects can be devastating, as shown by the destruction in East Anglia and the Netherlands during the record storm of 1953, when tide levels rose to two metres above the predicted high. So with sea levels set to rise over the next century, these extreme events could become more frequent. Hard-engineered sea defences such as sea walls, rock armour, and breakwaters have been built to protect coastal communities and the services upon which they depend. Around 1,200km of coastline is protected, around a third of the total coastline of England and Wales. This is particularly evident in southern England. Defence structures are built to a design standard based on the statistical chance of extreme water levels (such as one in 100 years). But it’s estimated that even small changes in sea level can produce a significant upwards trend to those chances. Other factors such as storminess and frequency of surges, and wave characteristics (known as wave climate) that cause coastal flooding are difficult to predict. Yet even with no changes in these factors the coastal threat, like the sea, is rising. And as tides rise, budgets shrink. Large cuts to national flood defences have been made and are expected to continue, raising serious fears for the funding of planned flood defence improvements along the coast. In the Southwest, plans to re-route the line have been dismissed as too costly. Taken from a purely transport economics or engineering perspective this may well be correct, but this evaluation does not take into account the wider socio-economic benefits of transport connectivity, such as access to employment, productivity gains, increased business opportunities and improved quality of life.  There is an urgent need to improve how the wider socio-economic benefits of transport can be translated into language that beancounters understand. Without investment, the future of Britain’s transport infrastructure services are at risk of failure and collapse, just as surely as the Dawlish-Teignmouth stretch of railway. The cost of clawing back from that eventuality will far outweigh the admittedly high costs of early intervention and adaptation.  While agenda-setting national plans like HS2 and Crossrail steal the limelight, the regional and local lines where infrastructure and services are dense, highly interlinked, and heavily relied upon (especially in rural areas) are slowly abandoned. We must invest in the regional networks to tackle the problems specific to them, such as the Southwest Mainline, as by doing so will improve the resilience of Britain’s transport infrastructure overall."
"The rate at which the world has warmed over the past 50 years and is likely to continue to do so in the future poses problems for life on land and in the ocean. Most species have a defined range of temperatures within which they can live – and when temperatures exceed the upper limit for a particular species in a particular location, that species will struggle to survive there. Likewise, places can become newly habitable when temperatures become warmer than a species’ lower limit. The complex patterns and distribution of these ecological niches with specific temperatures and the varying rates at which they are changing around the globe make it hard to predict where these changes will be felt, and what consequences they will have. Our study, published in Nature, has taken a new look at these changes and their likely effects on biodiversity. Our research group examined how fast and in which direction local temperatures have moved over the past 50 years. Based on the projections from current climate models we also looked projected forward oceanic changes to the year 2100 under two scenarios, one the “business-as-usual” scenario of largely unchanged greenhouse gas emissions and another modelling a global increase in temperature of 1.75°C. Assuming that species move toward areas that suit their preferences for heat or cold, our findings provide some insight into how species have migrated over time, and where they may end up after years, decades or even a century of changing, warming world. This is a big assumption. Some species may adapt to the change in temperature and not move, while others may not be able to disperse and colonise new habitats fast enough, and may die off.  But in general, shifts in temperature have proved to be a good predictor for past changes in species distributions. Around the coasts of North America, for example, Pacific cod in the Gulf of Alaska, big skate on the US west coast and American lobster in the north-east have all shifted in the direction and over the distance predicted from thermal shifts. Over the past few decades, numerous fish and invertebrate species have moved toward cooler regions, in some cases with important consequences for local biodiversity. For example, in the North Sea the areas where cod are found have shifted up to 100km northwards over the the 40 years between 1961-2001. In the same period, plankton in the North East Atlantic have similarly shifted 1,000km poleward. However, a key finding of this study is that geographic features such as coastlines create barriers for marine life that may be tracking shifting temperatures. By mapping where these barriers influence potential migrations around the globe it may be possible to identify places where the movement of species biodiversity might be blocked. These naturally existing blockages might cut some areas off from species migrating from warming seas. Blocked-off areas included the North Sea and the southern Mediterranean in the period since 1960, places without direct connections to warmer environments. In other places it might prevent migrating species from escaping, with potentially catastrophic results – blocked in to a region in which it cannot thrive, extinction becomes likely unless it can adapt to the new conditions. Knowing where vulnerable areas occur can help focus and inform conservation efforts. Areas where temperature shifts are slow may be better suited to protecting endemic species or long-lived structural species, for example those forming forests or land or coral reefs underwater. Moving species from those warming places  without cool refuges might be an option to prevent climate-driven extinctions, although care must be given to the potential negative ecological consequences of introducing these species to new places. For those species unable to move, conservations may need to find ways of enhancing species’ natural adaptation wherever possible. We are far from advocating that distribution shifts are the only issues for deciding what to do in the face of climate change. Biological factors such as a species’ capacity to adapt and disperse need to be considered. But in an unprecedented period of climate change, economic development and fast-growing demand on an already pressured planet, we need to act fast to make sure the world’s living resources survive that change."

[ **Samuel Alexander**](https://theconversation.com/profiles/samuel-alexander-102353), [University of Melbourne](https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-melbourne-722)



The reasons for choosing to go tiny range from reducing debt, inability to afford a conventional home, the search for sustainability, a life crisis, or even [preparing for an uncertain future](https://theconversation.com/architecture-of-doom-diy-planning-for-global-catastrophe-31836) in the face of climate change by going off-grid. Or perhaps a combination of these.



An important first step is to decide what type of tiny house you want. To many, the phrase “tiny house” brings to mind an archetypal tiny house on wheels, a miniature cottage on a trailer, often made of wood, with a pitched roof and dormer windows. 



Indeed, most tiny housers prefer some degree of mobility, whether a ready-made or DIY tiny house, converted caravan or bus/van. A survey by the [Australian Tiny House Association](https://australiantinyhouseassociation.org.au/) found most (78% of 109 respondents) lived in tiny houses on wheels, but a small but growing proportion live in converted caravans, vans or buses. 



First you need to evaluate your motives, which may differ according to your situation or stage of life. The most important question here is, how often do you want to move? 



Do you want to be ultra-mobile, and live like a digital nomad, perhaps in a “stealth van” in the city, changing parking spaces every night? Or do you want to travel around Australia like a “grey nomad”, staying in caravan parks or roadside camps for a week or so before moving on? 



Alternatively, do you want to be more settled, perhaps moving occasionally, to be closer to work, medical facilities or schools for children? (Yes, some tiny housers have children). Or do you want to travel between the houses of adult children or do petsitting, staying from weeks to months? 



Many off-the-shelf caravans are extremely well designed and are accepted everywhere, at caravan parks or roadside parking areas. On the other hand, a tiny house on wheels is less mobile, and not suited to frequent moving (they are also extremely heavy, not aerodynamic and large tow vehicles are costly). 



They’re also less accepted in caravan parks, and [most local councils consider them caravans](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07293682.2019.1632358), with restricted periods of occupancy and often onerous conditions. Vans and buses are the most flexible (in the “stealth van” or vanlife movement, people live rent-free by parking, mostly illegally, often in industrial estates, and using public or work/gym bathrooms). 



They are, however, extremely small and while it may seem glamorous to live in a van like celebrity rock climber [Alex Honnold](https://www.ft.com/content/d1ac7b02-34f8-11e9-bd3a-8b2a211d90d5), the reality may not be practical. 



Cost will likely be the next factor to consider. [Ready-built tiny houses range from around A$50,000 – $120,000](https://tinyrealestate.com.au/what-does-a-tiny-house-cost/); DIY are cheaper, especially if self-built, with some costing under $2,000. The higher end, architect-designed ones are more expensive. 



Converted caravans can be affordable, even under $10,000, but prices vary markedly, with some ultra-luxurious five-wheelers costing more than a typical suburban house (>$600,000). 



Converting old buses and vans is much cheaper, with the cost of the vehicle tending to be under $20,000. Of note, unless you are living [under the radar](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07293682.2019.1636837) or free camping, you are going to have to factor in the ongoing cost of renting someone’s backyard or caravan park space.



Sustainability is a more nuanced aspect of tiny house living; living small means less energy needed for heating and less room for superfluous stuff, encouraging or enforcing a minimalist lifestyle. 



Most tiny houses on wheels are off-grid to some extent, relying on [solar power, rainwater and composting toilets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07293682.2019.1634111). They are often built entirely out of sustainable or reclaimed materials. 



On the other hand, most caravans and vans are not particularly sustainable — they’re often built out of mass-produced material and may produce outgassing from carpets and paints. Vans and busses are generally no more or less sustainable than any similar vehicle. 



Tiny houses, whatever the type, are just that: tiny. Space is at a premium and living tiny requires reducing stuff, such as clothes, sporting and hobby equipment. Tiny houses on wheels, where parked more permanently, allow for decks and even sheds, but caravans and vans are self contained, unless in a permanent caravan park. 



If you are used to living in a very large space, it may take time to adapt to the practicalities of tiny living; people often complain about cooking smells and composting toilets. 



Despite the popularity of tiny houses however, very few people actually live in them. Nonetheless, the vast majority of people who live or have lived tiny, [view their experience positively](https://theconversation.com/life-in-a-tiny-house-whats-it-like-and-how-can-it-be-made-better-110495), and feel it has greatly enriched their lives, and helped them [re-evaluate their life choices, especially consumerism](https://theconversation.com/when-people-downsize-to-tiny-houses-they-adopt-more-environmentally-friendly-lifestyles-112485) even after moving to more conventional dwellings.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPhotovoltaic: Germany’s cost driver
By Michael Krueger 
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Germany’s Federal Ministry for Commerce And Energy (BMWi) presents a brochure every year with the feed-in act in figures. The brochure lists the costs of the Energiewende (energy transition) in detail. Germany’s EEG feed-in act total subsidy for supporting the Energiewende and expanding renewable energies in 2014 cost approx. 24 billion euros. In 2015 the cost is projected to be some 27 billion euros. From the BMWi figures, it is clear that the major cost driver in Germany’s Energiewende is photovoltaic power.
The following table lists the photovoltaic (PV) power produced in the years 2000-2015 (which was subsidized by the EEG), the average EEG subsidy per kilowatt-hour of solar energy 2000-2015, and the total EEG subsidy for solar energy for PV power ín billions of euros 2000-2015.
The total EEG subsidies paid for PV power rose from 0.015 billion euros in 2000 to almost 11 billion euros in 2015! This is increase is completely due to the installation of total PV capacity shown by the blue bars in the following chart.

The red bars in the above chart show the total subsidies paid each year for PV power. 2015 will see close to 11 billion euros paid in subsidies to support solar power. The heavy black line shows the amount of new installations. New PV installations have trailed off since subsidies for solar energy were scaled back in 2012.

Total installed photovoltaic capacity in Germany has risen from 1 GW in 2003 to almost 40 GW today. The average EEG subsidy for PV power has fallen from 50 cents per kilowatt hour to 30 cents today. Thus the addition of PV capacity continues to surpass the significantly reduced EEG subsidy for PV power, which means total subsidies doled out continue to rise.
With 11 billion euros, PV is the major cost driver of the Energiewende, and accounts for 40% of the total EEG subsidies of 27 billion euros to be paid out this year.
For the 11 billion euros in subsidies, about 1 billion euros of power is actually marketed. That means the subsidies cost a net 10 billion euros annually, which power consumers are forced to pay. That turns out to be about 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. For an average household that means about 90 euros per year in extra costs.
For the photovoltaic producers, it’s a great business: Many get 50 cents per kilowatt hour (guaranteed 20 years) while the same kilowatt gets sold for only 3 to 4 cents on the market.

"The controversial ban on neonicotinoid insecticides comes into effect across the EU this weekend. Neonicotinoids, or neonics, are powerful neurotoxins, killing insects with minute doses and impairing their behaviour at much lower doses still. This is desirable when the insect is a pest, not so good when it is a useful bee.  The origins of the ban lie in a series of scientific papers showing the doses bees are likely to receive in the field are enough to cause them significant harm, either killing them outright or interfering with their otherwise phenomenally impressive navigation and learning skills. As a result of these papers, the EU asked the European Food Standards Agency to conduct a review of the safety of these chemicals for bees. After a six-month review by a team of experts they concluded in January 2013 that neonics pose an “unacceptable risk” to bees. Hence the moratorium. The UK fought tooth and nail against this decision, siding with the agrochemical industry who claim the science is flawed. But eventually the moratorium was passed with 15 countries voting for and eight against. Hurrah for the bees! Or perhaps not. As I describe in A Sting in the Tale, the big picture is that pesticides are far from the only problem bees face. They have been declining for decades, with a loss of flowers and nesting habitats the biggest cause. Modern intensive farming generally leaves little room for bees or other wildlife.   On top of that, humans have foolishly spread bee diseases around the globe, so they are now suffering from foreign parasites and infections that they have little resistance to. Exposure to pesticides such as neonics may sometimes be the final straw that pushes them over the edge to oblivion. Removing the pesticides is not going to result in booming bee populations; they will still be hungry and diseased. In any case, bees will still be exposed to neonics, even with the moratorium. For starters, next year’s crops are already infused with them and the moratorium will only really begin to kick in in 2015. This is the same year that the moratorium expires, so there is precious little time to see any benefit. The moratorium only applies to flowering crops and crops sown in the spring and summer, so neonics will continue to be widely used on winter wheat, for example. They will also still be sprayed in private gardens and horticulture, because the moratorium only applies to the types of neonic used as seed dressings.  Finally, and perhaps most significantly, we know that neonics persist in the environment for years – so even if we stopped using them completely, it would be a long while before we saw any benefit. Many of us agree that the two-year moratorium was better than nothing, but it is clearly not a definitive solution. No programme of funding for further research after the two year period following the ban has been proposed by the EU. No monitoring of wild bee populations is planned either, so in the unlikely event that their numbers do increase in 2015 we won’t know about it.  At which point the agri-chemical industry is likely to declare that the moratorium has achieved nothing measurable and that therefore it should lapse. Of course this would not be a fair interpretation of the facts, but it is an argument that will certainly appeal to our current government, and which might prevail. Whatever the final outcome of the neonic debate, some of us would argue that there are some fundamental structural issues with the way that farming is carried out that need to be addressed. In the UK, many agronomists are employed by agrochemical companies. There are precious few sources of independent advice for farmers.  When I was at university nearly 30 years ago, I was taught that Integrated Pest Management (IPM), a system predicated on minimising pesticide use, was the only farming system that was sustainable in the long term. Under a new EU directive, European farmers are all supposed to use the system from January 2014. But as far as I can see, current arable farming has abandoned all the IPM principles in favour of maximising yield at all costs. Until this issue of the unsustainable overuse of virulent poisons is tackled, it is hard to imagine our countryside becoming a much better place for bees, or any other wildlife."

==========================================
The latest story on “green energy” here at the German online FOCUS weekly news magazine actually shocked me.
Europe’s energy policy is, under the bottom line, costing the lives of tens of thousands of citizens – all at the holy altar of “climate protection”. The title of the FOCUS article:
“The grand electricity lie”: Why electricity is becoming a luxury
One of the sickest things about Europe and its disconnected leaders is that often it takes a full-scale disaster to happen before policy gets corrected. Often the scale of the death and devastation becomes known only after the clean-up crews have come in and sifted through the rubble. Think, for example, of Nazism, the Holocaust – or Soviet communism.
In the above named examples the true scale of devastation left behind became clear only after the drunk-on-ideology tyrants were defeated and their legacy finally put in the spotlight.
FOCUS now cites a documentary film which is set to be broadcast this evening on European television station ARTE. The documentary presents how Europe’s electricity prices are spiraling out of control, and the horrible consequences this is having on the continent’s citizens.
40,000 dead from power being shut off
The situation, we are discovering, is far more disturbing than even the earlier worst case scenarios every imagined. FOCUS reports (emphasis added):
In 2014 in Europe there were about 40,000 winter deaths because millions of people were unable to pay for their electric bills – the so-called energy poverty currently impacts about ten percent of all Europeans. In the past 8 years the price of electricity in Europe has climbed by an average of 42 percent.”
7 million German households in energy poverty
FOCUS writes that the poor are the real victims of “socialist” Europe’s clean energy drive. In Bulgaria people see half of their income gobbled up by energy costs alone. In Spain 28 percent of the citizens live in “energy poverty”. In Germany, FOCUS writes, 7 million households are considered to be living in “energy poverty”.

The consequences of energy poverty are profound: tens of thousands of deaths every year, as millions lose their power.
Coming energy-caused mass die-off
Of course one needs to be very careful when describing disasters involving mass-death and bad science. History has seen so many over the 20th century alone. In the current century we have seen already tens of thousands die because they have been denied affordable energy, a product which in any advanced society is (or used to be) considered a fundamental human right, just as is clean water.
How much more unaffordable must energy become, and many more tens of thousands of wintertime deaths does Europe have to witness before the continent’s leaders wake up to the “green energy” folly? There are no longer any excuses. The facts and data are out there, and leaders need to take life-saving action. Refusing to do so at this point borders on gross negligence.
Rising tide of anger
The ARTE documentary reportedly shows how Europe’s citizens, including environmental activists, are becoming more worried and that electricity is now increasingly being called a “luxury product”. FOCUS adds:
Their anger is clearly palpable as indeed governments have deceived and disappointed many citizens, and they cannot cope with the protests.”
As electricity prices spiral out of control and mass, uncontrolled immigration of Arabians continues, Europe is keeping its social power kegs especially dry.
UPDATE: Price development of Germany power prices:

After the German market liberalization of the 1990s, electricity prices for consumers fell and became affordable. But after the enactment of the feed-in act prices rose strongly and now 7 million households are in “energy poverty”. Source: BDEW.

It’s true that disasters bring out the best in some people – and they also bring out the worst. Where’s there’s a disaster, there are always [looters and other opportunistic scum](https://www.9news.com.au/national/nsw-bushfires-three-men-charged-over-alleged-crimes-in-south-coast-communities/497cdd5a-dbe9-4c72-b2a5-752fb0236796). Then there are the green vultures who swoop on the first whiff of smoke.



Bullying left-wing thugs **GetUp** have already been exposed [soliciting donations for political campaigns](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/getup-hijacks-firefighters-to-kindle-its-funds-drive/news-story/83b5f7427f7993233965930c4b690824) on the back of Australia’s ongoing fire crisis. Shamelessly, they’ve gone even further.



The GetUp activist group is driving the campaign of some bushfire survivors who blame climate change for fires burning in southeast Australia and are calling for “100 per cent renewable energy for all”.



This should be no surprise. Shameless media tart, Tim “The Great Predicto” Flannery, likewise [cobbled together a muppet show of sock-puppets](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/experts-or-clueless-stooges/) to exploit the bushfire crisis for cheap political gain.



The bushfire survivors’ group gained national attention when it was launched in February with a personal endorsement from decorated former NSW Fire and Rescue commissioner **Greg Mullins**.



GetUp promoted the launch on its Twitter feed in advance, telling supporters Mr Mullins would join Bushfire Survivors for ­Climate Action at a press conference in Canberra.



Mullins, it should be noted, is top banana in Flannery’s climate muppet show. While his minders insist he has “no affiliation” with GetUp, it seems there is a lot more to the story.



The fire chiefs group led by Mr Mullins has no direct link to GetUp but some of the Climate Council’s supporters and contractors do have GetUp connections. The Mullins group, with Climate Council support, is pledging to hold a national summit after the fire season has ended early next year to devise a strategy on combating future fires that would take account of climate change.



This new GetUp astroturfing exercise is likewise fronted by a gallery of the activist group’s sock-puppets.



The GetUp website promoting Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action provides harrowing ­accounts of fire victims’ experiences. It seeks support for their cause and is authorised by GetUp’s ­national director, **Paul Oosting**.



The site says GetUp provides “in-kind support” while “ad hoc media support” comes from the Climate Media Centre…



Prominent among the group’s survival stories is **Lyn Trindall** ’s account of how she escaped her lower Blue Mountains home at Winmalee in October 2013. Ms Trindall, the local GetUp group co-ordinator and a former Blue Mountains councillor…Another survivor, ­retired teacher **Janet Reynolds** from Bega and a supporter of ­recent “school strike” protests over climate change…



Green opportunists really will exploit any tragedy to the hilt.

 ** _Congress should_**



• phase out farm subsidy programs because they are harmful to taxpayers, the economy, and the environment; and  
• eliminate trade protections on agricultural goods while working to pursue liberalization in global markets.



The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) spends $25 billion or more a year on subsidies for farm businesses. The particular amount each year depends on the market prices of crops, the level of disaster payments, and other factors. Most agricultural subsidies go to farmers of a handful of major crops, including wheat, corn, soybeans, and cotton. Roughly a million farmers and landowners receive federal subsidies, but the payments are heavily tilted toward the largest producers.



Some farm subsidy programs counter adverse fluctuations in prices, revenues, and production. Other programs subsidize farmers’ conservation activities, insurance coverage, product marketing, export sales, research and development, and other activities. Agriculture is no riskier than many other industries, yet the government has created a uniquely large welfare system for farmers.



In 1996, Congress enacted some pro‐​market reforms under the “Freedom to Farm” law. The law allowed farmers greater flexibility in planting and moved toward reliance on market supply and demand. But Congress reversed course in the late 1990s and passed a series of supplemental farm subsidy bills. As a result, subsidies that were expected to cost $47 billion over the seven years of the 1996 law ended up costing $121 billion. In 2002, Congress enacted a farm bill that further reversed the 1996 reforms. The law increased projected subsidy payments, added new crops to the subsidy rolls, and created a new price guarantee scheme called the “countercyclical” program. In 2008, Congress overrode a presidential veto to enact farm legislation that added further subsidies. The law created a permanent disaster program and added a revenue protection program for farmers to lock in profits from high commodity prices. It added a sugar‐​to‐​ethanol program to help keep sugar prices artificially high, and it added new subsidies for “specialty crops” such as fruits and vegetables.



In 2014, Congress passed yet another huge farm bill. The bill changed the structure of subsidies but did not cut the overall level of benefits. The law ended the direct payment program, the countercyclical program, and the Average Crop Revenue Election program. However, it expanded the largest farm subsidy program — crop insurance — and added two new subsidy programs, the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) program and the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program. When the 2014 farm bill was passed, supporters claimed that it would save taxpayer money, but the opposite has happened. The Congressional Budget Office now estimates that the ARC and PLC programs will cost billions of dollars a year more than originally promised. The cost of crop insurance is also rising.



All of these subsidies ensure that farm incomes are much higher than the incomes of most other Americans. Farm programs are welfare for the well‐​to‐​do, and they induce overproduction, inflate land prices, and harm the environment. They should be ended, and American farmers should stand on their own two feet in the marketplace.



 _1\. Insurance._ Crop insurance run by the USDA’s Risk Management Agency has become the largest farm program, with annual outlays of about $8 billion. Subsidized insurance protects against various business risks, such as adverse weather, low production, and low revenues. It covers more than 100 crops, but corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat are the main ones. It subsidizes both insurance premiums and the administrative costs of the 19 private insurance companies that offer policies to farmers. The companies receive the subsidies and earn excess profits from the high premiums they charge; but farmers also benefit because the USDA pays about 60 percent of their premium costs, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Indeed, economist Bruce Babcock finds that most farmers make money on insurance over time, receiving more in claims payouts than they pay in premiums. Congress channels the largest portion of farm subsidies through the insurance program to obscure the identities of the wealthy recipients. Under prior farm programs, news stories often identified the millionaires receiving farm subsidies, which was embarrassing to Congress. Insurance subsidies are less transparent and have no income limits, and so Congress has expanded the program over the years.



 _2\. Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC)._ This program pays subsidies to farmers if their revenue per acre, or alternatively their county’s revenue per acre, falls below a benchmark or guaranteed amount. Generally, the lower the prices and revenues are, then the larger the subsidies paid out are. More than 20 crops are covered, from wheat and corn to chickpeas and mustard. ARC subsidies fluctuate, but they were about $7 billion in 2016.



 _3\. Price Loss Coverage (PLC)._ This program pays subsidies to farmers based on the average national price of each particular crop compared with the crop’s reference price. The larger the fall in a crop’s price below its reference price, the larger the payout to farmers. PLC subsidies also cover more than 20 crops. PLC subsidies fluctuate, but they were about $2 billion in 2016.



 _4\. Conservation programs._ The USDA runs many farm conservation programs, which cost taxpayers more than $5 billion a year. The largest is the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers about $1.7 billion a year to keep millions of acres of their land out of production.



 _5\. Marketing loans._ This program was created during the New Deal. The original idea was to give farmers a loan at harvest time so that they could hold their crops to sell at a higher price later on. But the program has evolved into just another subsidy program that delivers higher payments to farmers when market prices are low. These subsidies cost about $400 million in 2016.



 _6\. Disaster aid._ The government operates various disaster aid programs for many types of farmers, from wheat growers, to livestock producers, to tree fruit producers. In addition to permanent disaster programs, Congress sometimes distributes additional aid after adverse events. Disaster and supplemental aid costs about $1 billion to $2 billion a year.



 _7\. Marketing and export promotion._ The Agriculture Marketing Service spends about $1.2 billion a year on farm and food promotion activities. The Foreign Agricultural Service spends about $1.4 billion a year on a range of activities, including marketing U.S. farm and food products abroad through 93 foreign offices.



 _8\. Research and other support._ Most American industries fund their own research and development, but the government employs thousands of scientists and other experts to aid the agriculture industry. The USDA spends about $3 billion a year on agriculture and food research at more than 100 locations. The department also provides many other services, such as loan programs for farmers, statistical services, and economic studies.



 _1\. Subsidies redistribute wealth upward._ Farm subsidies transfer the earnings of taxpayers to well‐​off farm businesses and landowners. USDA data show that farm incomes have soared far above average U.S. incomes. In 2014, the average income of farm households was $134,164, which was 77 percent higher than the $75,738 average of all U.S. households. The same year, the median income of farm households was $81,637, which was 52 percent higher than the U.S. median of $53,657.



Although farm programs are advertised as support for small farmers, most subsidies go to the largest farms. Economist Vincent Smith found that the largest 15 percent of farm businesses receive more than 85 percent of all farm subsidies. Over the years, many well‐​known billionaires have received farm subsidies because they are the owners of farmland. Prior to the 2014 farm bill, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) found that 50 people on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans received farm subsidies. The new farm bill channels the largest share of subsidies through insurance companies, making it hard to determine the identities of recipients. But in 2015, the GAO found that at least four recipients of crop insurance subsidies have a net worth of more than $1.5 billion.



 _2\. Subsidies damage the economy._ The extent of federal coddling and micromanagement of the agriculture industry is unique. In most industries, market prices balance supply and demand, profits steer investment, businesses take risks, and entrepreneurs innovate to improve quality and reduce costs. Those market mechanisms are blunted and undermined in U.S. agriculture, causing a range of economic harms, including overproduction, distorted land use, distorted choice of crops, inflated land prices, and inadequate cost control.



 _3\. Subsidies are prone to scandal._ Like all government subsidy programs, farm programs are subject to both bureaucratic waste and recipient fraud. One problem is that some farm subsidies are paid improperly as farmers create business structures to get around legal subsidy limits. Another problem is that Congress and the USDA distribute disaster payments in a careless manner, with payments going to farmers who do not need them. The EWG found another boondoggle: the “prevented planting” program covers losses if conditions during a season prevent farmers from planting some areas. EWG found that billions of dollars over the years have been paid to farmers who would not normally have planted the areas included in their USDA claims.



 _4\. Subsidies undermine U.S. trade relations._ Global stability and U.S. security are enhanced when less developed countries achieve economic growth. America can help by encouraging poor nations to adopt free markets and expand their international trade. However, U.S. and European farm subsidies and agricultural import barriers undermine progress on achieving open trading relationships. Federal sugar protections block freer trade within the Americas, for example, while enriching sugar growers and harming U.S. consumers and U.S. food companies that use sugar.



 _5\. Subsidies harm the environment._ Federal farm policies damage the natural environment in numerous ways. For example, subsidies cause overproduction, which draws lower‐​quality farmlands into active production. As a result, areas that might otherwise have been used for parks, forests, grasslands, and wetlands get locked into less efficient agricultural use. Subsidies are also thought to induce excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides. Producers on marginal lands that have poorer soils and climates tend to use more fertilizers and pesticides, which can cause water contamination problems. Sugar cane production has expanded in Florida because of the federal sugar program, for example, and the phosphorous in fertilizers used by the growers causes damage to the Everglades.



 _6\. Agriculture would thrive without subsidies._ If U.S. farm subsidies were ended and agricultural markets deregulated, farming would change. Different crops would be planted, land usage would change, and some farm businesses would contract while others would expand. But a stronger and more innovative industry would emerge with greater resilience to market fluctuations. Private insurance, other financial tools, and diversification would help cover risks, as they do in other industries.



An interesting example of farmers prospering without subsidies is New Zealand. In 1984, New Zealand ended its farm subsidies, which was a bold stroke because the country is four times more dependent on farming than is the United States. The changes were initially met with resistance, but New Zealand farm productivity, profitability, and output have soared since the reforms. New Zealand farmers cut costs, diversified land use, sought nonfarm income, and developed niche markets such as kiwi fruit. The Federated Farmers of New Zealand argues that that nation’s experience “thoroughly debunked the myth that the farming sector cannot prosper without government subsidies.” That myth needs to be debunked in the United States as well.

"In countries across the world, what can only be described as a bikesharing boom is taking place, with systems operating in 686 towns and cities worldwide, from Aspen, Colorado to Zhuzhou, China. Despite their apparent popularity however, they are not without their problems. The London scheme lost its main sponsor late last year when Barclays declined to renew its funding, and the biggest equipment provider for bikesharing programs in the US, the Canadian firm Public Bike System Company (PBSC), recently filed for bankruptcy protection. Individual schemes have specific problems, but these developments do prompt the question: what does it take for a bikesharing system to be economically viable, if indeed that’s possible? Whether a bikesharing system can stand financially on its own two wheels depends on a number of factors – and different markets have different needs. More than 50% of members from the publicly funded Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC use the system to access other forms of public transportation, according to a member survey from 2013. Yet data collected by Rui Wang and Chen Liu at the University of California, Los Angeles suggest that bikesharing can function as a viable means of public transit even without rail or bus networks.  As a mode of public transport, a bikesharing system would require public subsidy to support capital investment. The reality, however, is that public funding is not always available, which means many town councils and city authorities have left funding to the operators and equipment suppliers. In some cases, it may be possible that a bikesharing system could be supported entirely through private sponsorship and user fees. To date, very few programs have managed that, with few models generating sufficient income to be profitable across the service area. New York City’s Citi Bike, North America’s largest bikesharing system that launched in Summer 2013, has not turned a profit despite sponsorship of US$46m from Citibank and MasterCard and a turnover of millions of dollars in fees. But more time is needed to better understand its economic viability, since the system has only been in operation about seven months. The sponsorship-based bikesharing model still remains relatively unproven, but several other cities in the US have followed suit – largely due to dwindling city transportation budgets. Those cities include Portland, Oregon; Atlanta, Georgia; Providence, Rhode Island; and Orlando and Tampa, Florida – all expected to launch a service this year. Kansas City B-cycle, owned and operated by a not-for-profit company, recently turned to the internet for funding. The organisation used a crowdsourced funding page to raise cash to purchase more equipment to expand the system. And while a similar attempt last year fell short of its goal, the current round has managed to raise more than US$300,000. In Paris, the renowned Vélib’ system is powered by an advertising model. Funding for the service comes from the media giant JC Decaux, which in exchange is awarded advertising rights to all the city’s bus shelters. As the name suggests, the London Barclays Cycle Hire was funded through sponsorship from the bank, but its departure leaves the system’s future in question after the current contract expires in 2015. Outside of Paris and London, most European cities fund their bikesharing programs through public subsidy. On the other side of the world, bikesharing programs in Asia – and in China in particular – have been quietly outpacing the rest of the world. Such systems, also popular in Japan and South Korea, rely almost entirely on public subsidy. In China, all of the nation’s 164 schemes and estimated fleet of 358,000 bikes are publicly owned. The world’s largest schemes, in Wuhan in central China and Hangzou on the east coast, have around 90,000 and 70,000 bikes, respectively (compared to 20,000 in Paris). In Taiwan, the country’s premier recently encouraged cities to pursue bikesharing programs, but he cautioned that they could not all expect to enjoy government subsidy. And in other cities, like Pasig City in the Philippines, the Asian Development Bank has helped fund the country’s first bikesharing system, Tutubi (“dragonfly”). The economic viability of bikesharing programs is a question of circumstance and intent. A business model proven to work in Miami Beach or New York may not work in Minneapolis or Salt Lake City. Regardless of circumstance, if a city intends to create a bikesharing service that will add another layer to their public transport system for all to use, it will probably require some level of public subsidy. Programs that are entirely privately funded tend to deploy equipment in affluent neighbourhoods and tourist destinations where they will see plenty of use, but they may also exclude low-income parts of town. Having said that, any financial stake a local government authority has in a system through provision of public subsidy can also provide a greater say over where bikes and stations are set up, pricing levels, and how to most effectively integrate the bikes into existing public transportation networks to foster the public good."
"Kiribati will raise its islands above the ocean as part of its fight against sea-level rise, seeking help from its new diplomatic partner China to secure the archipelagic nation’s future, the country’s newly re-elected president has said. In his first in-depth interview since his resounding election win in June, Taneti Maamau told the Guardian international co-operation would be on Kiribati’s terms: he said he would not accept large loans “from any country”, and would not allow China to build a base on Kiribati’s strategically significant Christmas Island, south of Hawaii.  Maamau said his government’s strategy “identifies raising our islands” as a counter to climate change, and plans “to secure dredgers that will assist with these efforts”. “There are already plans to build up part of [the capital atoll] Tarawa through dredging fill materials from the lagoon. Kiribati in its 20-year vision has also included strategies to secure dredgers that will assist with these efforts as well as dredging channels in the outer islands,” he said. Dredging can impact coral reef ecosystems. “We are also working with New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research to develop a long-term coastal security strategy for Kiribati,” Maamau said. “The strategy is still in development but clearly identifies raising our islands as a way forward in our fight against climate change. This is also clearly demonstrated in our national climate change policy.” Maamau has enlisted the advice of Professor Paul Kench, dean of science at Simon Fraser University in Canada, and a leading researcher on the response of atolls to sea-level changes. To solve chronic flooding in the overcrowded capital, Tarawa, Kench has proposed replacing causeways – landfill between islands that supports the main road but which can cause beach erosion – with an elevated bridge road running the entire length of the atoll on the sheltered lagoon side. It is the sort of massive infrastructure project China might fund, and has the expertise to engineer. China recently built a long bridge between Male and its airport in the Maldives. “The idea of building an elevated road parallel to the coast is something that we would like to explore in future with our partners,” Maamau said. A former British colony made up of three archipelagos sprawled over an ocean area the size of India, Kiribati – pronounced Kiribahss – has acquired significant strategic importance in the era of US-China rivalry in the Pacific. The US military has flagged concerns that Kiribati might allow China to build dual-use – military and civilian – facilities on its largest island, Christmas, just 2,000km south of Hawaii, and home of the US Pacific Fleet. Kiribati is already developing fishing infrastructure on Christmas in partnership with a Chinese company. “There was never any intention or plan by this government to allow China an accessory base in Kiritimati [Christmas],” Maamau said. China has a record in small, vulnerable states of granting loans to build what Beijing wants – often not what the beneficiary country needs – through a combination of gifts and bribes, a process known as “elite capture”. Kiribati, a least developed country historically dependent on foreign aid for upwards of 40% of its budget, is seen as acutely vulnerable. But Maamau said Kiribati would safeguard its independence. “My government has no intention to acquire large loans from any country in the near future.” Besides the strategically located Christmas, Kiribati’s capital Tarawa is just 1,000km south-west of the US military installations in Kwajelein. A treaty between Kiribati and the US prohibits any other country from building military installations in Kiribati without “consultation” with Washington first. US and Australian concerns emerged last year after Maamau made a sudden and controversial decision in September last year to switch Kiribati’s diplomatic recognition back to China after 17 years allied to Taiwan. The decision caused the chairman of Maamau’s party to join the opposition – leaving Maamau with a minority in parliament – and run for president against him. June’s presidential election was seen, in part, as a referendum on the decision to switch from Taipei to Beijing. Maamau won comfortably, 26,053 to 17,866. Following his victory, several MPs crossed the floor to join the government, leaving Maamau with a 24-to-19 majority to pursue his agenda, developing tourism and fisheries while taking the adaptation measures that will allow Kiribati’s 110,000 people to remain in their homeland. The election was rife with accusations of corruption from both sides: all of which have been denied. But whether Maamau can deliver his promises, and keep Kiribati free from malign foreign influence, will be closely watched, domestically and internationally. Maamau’s predecessor as president, Anote Tong, had forecast widespread forced displacement from Kiribati because of rising seas, worsening salinity, and increased vulnerability to disasters. Tong’s administration even bought land in Fiji as a potential new homeland. Maamau has rejected migration as a strategy, arguing studies have shown the islands can survive with the right adaptation measures, and saying the people of Kiribati will not be forced to leave. Studies, by Kench and others, have found that waves rolling over narrow atoll islands every few years leave sand behind, raising islands in tandem with the sea. “Atoll islands are in a state of equilibrium with the sea, which is why most are at the same height,” Kench said in an interview. Kench argues the solution involves razing houses and large-scale sand dredging to raise the island, stretch by stretch, by half a metre to a metre, to secure the island’s safety for 50 or more years.

"Investment in large-scale renewable energy projects in Australia has slumped to its lowest level since 2017 due to uncertainty over federal policy and delays in grid connection, according to an industry body. The Clean Energy Council said $600m was invested in large-scale renewable projects in the second quarter this year, a drop of almost half from the previous quarter. Only three major projects reached financial close in the quarter and it had now been a year since a large-scale energy storage project had been commissioned.  One major windfarm developer, Tilt Renewables, told shareholders on Wednesday that “urgent reform” was needed to better manage the transition to clean energy. The Clean Energy Council chief executive, Kane Thornton, told Guardian Australia investments in the electricity transmission network had not kept pace with the rapid deployment of wind and solar farms. He said underinvestment in the energy network was creating congestion and causing delays in projects being connected. The council was talking to the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) about addressing the problem. “Investors don’t have a clear view on what the federal government’s long-term strategy and policies are – that’s challenging,” Thornton said. He said the council asked clean energy CEOs to name the biggest barriers to the industry developing large-scale projects. The coronavirus did not rate in the top five. “The industry here has been relatively un-impacted by Covid-19,” he said. “We have seen record levels of uptake in rooftop solar.” Thornton said suggestions by government advisers that gas infrastructure would be favoured over renewable energy in the economic recovery from the pandemic had created further uncertainty. “That’s not what was anticipated in the electricity market. Will we now see a wave of governments investing in gas projects? What does that mean for other commercial projects?” Investment in large-scale renewable energy has fallen since since the national renewable energy target of 23% of electricity coming from clean energy sources was reached last year. A planned new national energy policy, the national energy guarantee, was abandoned when Scott Morrison replaced Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister. A recent Aemo plan for what an optimal national electricity market would look like to 2040 found renewable energy could at times provide nearly 90% of electricity by 2035 and that there would need to be major investment in new transmission lines, with the cost of these connection projects having increased by 30%. A June report from financial consultants Ernst & Young, commissioned by environment group WWF-Australia, suggested economic stimulus programs that focused on clean energy would create three times as many jobs as fossil fuel projects. A separate analysis from the University of Sydney found up to 11,000 jobs could disappear from Australia’s renewable energy industry in the next two years under current government policies. Labor’s climate change and energy spokesman, Mark Butler, said the collapse in investment in large-scale renewables was “a direct result of the Morrison Government’s chaotic and continuing energy policy failure”. He said: “After seven years and 19 energy policy attempts, this government has no national energy policy and they continue an anti-renewables agenda, refusing to capitalise on the huge benefits that renewable energy can bring to Australian households and businesses.” Tilt Renewables finished construction of the $560m Dundonnell windfarm in Victoria’s west in July, including installation of Australia’s largest wind turbines – 80 towers with rotors 150 metres long. The company’s chief executive, Deion Campbell, told an annual general meeting on Wednesday the windfarm had not been able to connect fully to the power grid because of “unexpected” new Aemo requirements. He told shareholders urgent reforms were needed in Australia as the country managed the transition to a decentralised energy system as developers were “almost universally having significant challenges commissioning new renewables”. Guardian Australia approached the office of the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, for comment."

Butterflies heat up the field of solar research
The humble butterfly could hold the key to unlocking new techniques to make solar energy cheaper and more efficient, pioneering new research has shown.
A team of experts from the University of Exeter has examined new techniques for generating photovoltaic (PV) energy – or ways in which to convert light into power.
They showed that by mimicking the v-shaped posture adopted by Cabbage White butterflies to heat up their flight muscles before take-off, the amount of power produced by solar panels can increase by almost 50 per cent.

Crucially, by replicating this ‘wing-like’ structure, the power-to-weight ratio of the overall solar energy structure is increased 17-fold, making it vastly more efficient.
The research by the team from both the Environment and Sustainability Institute (ESI) and the Centre for Ecology and Conservation, based at the University of Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall, is published in the leading scientific journal, Scientific Reports.
Professor Tapas Mallick, lead author of the research said: “Biomimicry in engineering is not new. However, this truly multidisciplinary research shows pathways to develop low cost solar power that have not been done before.”
The Cabbage White butterflies are known to take flight before other butterflies on cloudy days – which limit how quickly the insects can use the energy from the sun to heat their flight muscles.
This ability is thought to be due to the v-shaped posturing, known as reflectance basking, they adopt on such days to maximise the concentration of solar energy onto their thorax, which allows for flight.
Furthermore, specific sub-structures of the butterflies’ wings allow the light from the sun to be reflected most efficiently, ensuring that the flight muscles are warmed to an optimal temperature as quickly as possible.
The team of scientists therefore investigated how to replicate the wings to develop a new, lightweight reflective material that could be used in solar energy production.
The team found that the optimal angle by which the butterfly should hold its wings to increase temperature to its body was around 17 degrees, which increased the temperature by 7.3 degrees Centigrade compared to when held flat.
They also showed that by replicating the simple mono-layer of scale cells found in the butterfly wings in solar energy producers, the could vastly improve the power-to-weight rations of future solar concentrators, making them significantly lighter and so more efficient.
Professor Richard ffrench-Constant, who conducts world-leading research into butterfly mimicry at the University of Exeter, said: “This proves that the lowly Cabbage White is not just a pest of your cabbages but actually an insect that is an expert at harvesting solar energy.”
The paper, White butterflies as solar photovoltaic concentrators, by Katie Shanks, Dr Senthilarasu Sundaram, Professor Richard ffrench-Constant and Professor Tapas Mallick from the University of Exeter, is available online.

"MELBOURNE, Australia  —   Serena Williams was utterly unaware that a victory on Saturday night would put her back at No. 1. Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, did all he could to keep her in the dark. But there was no hiding the other statistical stakes as Williams walked back into Rod Laver Arena, headphones around her neck and   in place, to play her older sister Venus Williams in the Australian Open final. The tennis circuit can be an echo chamber where the same questions and themes reverberate from week to week as the locations change, but the protagonists do not. So even if Serena Williams refused to entertain questions during the tournament about the possibility of winning her 23rd Grand Slam singles title and breaking her tie for the   record with Steffi Graf, there was no dodging that number in her own head. Now, after her     victory over her sister, she can celebrate No. 23 instead of fret over it. “I’ve been chasing it for a really long time,” Williams said. “When it got on my radar, I knew I had an opportunity to get there, and I’m here. It’s a great feeling. No better place to do it than Melbourne. ” She and her sister made their first visit to Melbourne in 1998. They were teenagers with braces on their teeth and braids in their hair and a clear sense that they were special, but no idea of just how far their talents and confidence would carry them. Much has changed in 19 years. Rod Laver Arena now has a wraparound digital screen at court level and electronic line calling. The court, once green, is now a deep blue. The beads and the braces are long gone, but the sisters’ power tennis remains. And though their father, Richard Williams, in one of the great sports predictions, saw the future clearly when he said the younger, fiercer Serena would turn out to be the better player, perhaps not even he realized how wide the gap would eventually grow. Serena Williams now has 23 major singles titles to her sister’s seven, and has won seven of their nine Grand Slam finals and eight of their last nine matches. Those figures brook no argument. Williams 2. 0 has the better operating system when it comes to locating the lines and creating the angles under the greatest pressure. She also has the purer service motion. But Williams 1. 0 certainly gave it her all Saturday night, throwing herself into the groundstrokes and displaying more emotion when a return struck the net or a rally failed than she has perhaps ever shown in a major final. “It was palpable how much Venus wanted it,” said Isha Price, the Williamses’ half sister. An   final is always an emotionally complex affair, which is all the more reason to admire how the older sister has so often handled the disappointments. “That’s my little sister, guys,” Venus Williams said, pointing at Serena during the   ceremony. She then spoke to her sister directly. It was quite a riff. “Congratulations, Serena, on No. 23,” Williams said. “I have been there right with you. Some of them I lost right there against you. I guess that’s weird, but it’s been an awesome thing. Your win has always been my win. I think you know that. And all the time I couldn’t be there, wouldn’t be there, didn’t get there, you were there. I’m enormously proud of you. You mean the world to me. ” Serena Williams is now within one victory of Margaret Court’s career record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles. “Good on her if she’s good enough to do it,” Court said during the week in Melbourne. Williams has closed in on Court with an unprecedented run of success at an age when most great women’s tennis players of the past had already retired. Graf, for example, was done by 30. But Williams has now won 10 major singles title since turning 30. On Saturday, she became the oldest woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in the Open era, breaking her own record set at Wimbledon last year. Venus, 36, was the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era. “There’s no way I would be at 23 without her there’s no way I would be at 1 without her,” Serena Williams said of her sister in the   ceremony. “There’s no way I would have anything without her. She’s my inspiration. She’s the only reason I’m standing here today, and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist. So thank you, Venus, for inspiring me to be the best player I could be and inspiring me to work hard. Every time you won this week, I felt like I’ve got to win, too. ” This final was edgy from the start, beginning with four straight breaks of serve and with Serena Williams angrily breaking a racket in just the third game after she lost her footing trying to change direction when one of her sister’s shots struck the net cord. The quality of play fluctuated considerably, but the match ultimately was determined by Serena Williams’s returns. Venus Williams had won over 50 percent of the points on her second serve in her surprise run to the final. She won just 29 percent Saturday. “Serena always expects a tough match against her sister, but I don’t think she expected it to be quite that tough from the start,” Mouratoglou said. At 35, Williams is back on top after playing little in 2016 except for the Grand Slam events and losing the No. 1 ranking to Angelique Kerber, who defeated her in last year’s Australian Open final. Williams looked shocked when it was announced after her victory that she would return to No. 1. Mouratoglou later explained, a tad sheepishly, that he had not answered truthfully when Serena had inquired about it. He said he wanted to avoid putting extra pressure on her at an already fraught moment. “Actually, I think she’s happy I did it now,” he said. The Open could easily have gone awry for Serena Williams. In her return to the circuit earlier this month at a tournament in Auckland, New Zealand, she was upset in her second match by Madison Brengle, making 88 unforced errors on a blustery day. But Williams has often proved that she can click into a higher gear without much match play, and she did not drop a set in seven matches as she won her seventh Australian Open singles title. Venus Williams, seeded 13th here, remains one of the great players of this era, but she has not won a major singles title since she beat Serena to win Wimbledon in 2008. In the intervening years, she received a diagnosis of Sjogren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disorder, that limited her training and contributed to her falling from the top 100 in 2011. But she has learned to manage her health problems and is having a   renaissance that might be a much bigger talking point if it were not for her younger sister’s   surge. Venus Williams will be at No. 11 in Monday’s WTA rankings. The sisters have become, through experience, adept at compartmentalizing, even if facing each other across the net is still not entirely natural. Their family members struggle with it, too. Their parents, Richard Williams and Oracene Price, did not make the long journey to Melbourne this year, but Isha Price did. And she decided that she preferred to watch the match at her hotel until it was nearly over instead of putting herself through the crucible of watching in person. “Long story short, I don’t think people actually understand the significance of what they see, these two players, who literally for generations have been able to transcend what they do,” Price said. “And it’s very difficult to watch, listen, hear commentary, all of that. We watch tennis on mute. It’s hard. To keep your body in optimal shape to be able to perform at this level consistently over 20 years is an incredible feat. But you still have the conversation where it’s not enough. ” It is becoming increasingly difficult to quibble with the record books, however. Serena keeps moving the bar higher, but the poignant part on Saturday night, was that despite all of Venus’s talent and staying power and eloquence, only one Williams sister has managed to win the singles championship at Melbourne Park."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA reader has brought my attention to more new papers. I haven’t found any mention of them at other sites like WUWT. Perhaps they aren’t able to get through the Gate of Willis.
At any rate, just because I choose to bring them up, it doesn’t necessarily mean that I agree with them. I do strongly feel, however, that these papers need to be brought to the public’s attention. They have, after all, gone through the peer-review process and appeared in respectable journals.
The latest paper NTZ wishes to present today is one lead-authored by Chantal Camenisch of the Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern in Switzerland, appearing in the Journal Climate of the Past bearing the title: “The early Spörer Minimum – a period of extraordinary climate and socio-economic changes in Western and Central Europe“.
Obviously, just as dozens of other papers have shown already, low solar activity has something to do with cooling climates, famine and socioeconomic collapse. So it’s probably a very good thing the 20th century saw high solar activity, but a bad thing that we may be starting an extended period of low solar activity.
The papers abstract:
Climate reconstructions from a multitude of natural and human archives indicate that, during winter, the period of the early Spörer Minimum (1431–1440 CE) was the coldest decade in Central Europe in the 15th century. The particularly cold winters and normal but wet summers resulted in a strong seasonal cycle that challenged food production and led to increasing food prices, a subsistence crisis, and a famine in parts of Europe. As a consequence, authorities implemented adaptation measures, such as the installation of grain storage capacities, in order to be prepared for future events. The 15th century is characterised by a grand solar minimum and enhanced volcanic activity, which both imply a reduction of seasonality. Climate model simulations show that periods with cold winters and strong seasonality are associated with internal climate variability rather than external forcing. Accordingly, it is hypothesised that the reconstructed extreme climatic conditions during this decade occurred by chance and in relation to the partly chaotic, internal variability within the climate system.
Again here climate science seems to have the chronic habit of blaming unexpected cold or warming pauses on “chance”, as the above paper does. Yet, under the bottom line, the paper is just the latest confirming that climate swings and fluctuations are indeed natural and have always happened in the past. Often solar activity is very much in the works.
Moreover, today’s possible 0.05°C of warming we may have seen over the past 2 decades is nothing compared to the stuff we’ve seen before.
It’s time to end the hysterics.

"Two years on from Greta Thunberg’s first solo school strike for the climate, she says the world has wasted the time by failing to take the necessary action on the crisis. Thunberg’s strike inspired a global movement, and on Thursday she and other leading school strikers will meet Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the European council. They will demand a halt to all fossil fuel investments and subsidies and the establishment of annual, binding carbon budgets based on the best science.  “Looking back [over two years], a lot has happened. Many millions have taken to the streets … and on 28 November 2019, the European parliament declared a climate and environmental emergency,” Thunberg said in an article for the Guardian with fellow strikers Luisa Neubauer, Anuna de Wever and Adélaïde Charlier. “But over these last two years, the world has also emitted over 80bn tonnes of CO2. We have seen continuous natural disasters taking place across the globe. Many lives and livelihoods have been lost, and this is only the very beginning.” They said leaders were speaking of an “existential crisis”, yet “when it comes to action, we are still in a state of denial. The gap between what we need to do and what’s actually being done is widening by the minute. Effectively, we have lost another two crucial years to political inaction.” Thunberg and her colleagues said fighting the climate emergency must involve rich nations stopping some of their polluting activities. “However, it’s a fact which most people refuse to accept. Just the thought of being in a crisis that we cannot buy, build or invest our way out of seems to create some kind of collective mental short-circuit. This mix of ignorance, denial and unawareness is the very heart of the problem,” they said. The trillions of dollars being spent by governments in response to the coronavirus pandemic are seen as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to put the world on course to halt global heating, with economists, scientists and health experts all saying the benefits would outweigh the costs. However, G20 governments’ rescue packages are giving significantly more support to fossil fuels than to low-carbon energy. Germany’s recovery plan includes €40bn for climate measures such as electric vehicles, public transport and energy efficiency, and has been praised by green groups. But elsewhere, too little is being done, Thunberg and colleagues said. “Even a child can see that the policies of today are incompatible with the current best available science,” they said. Scientists calculate that global carbon emissions must be cut by half by the end of this decade if humanity is to have a reasonable chance of keeping temperature rises to below 1.5C, the limit set in the Paris climate deal. Drops in emissions during coronavirus lockdowns are only a small blip in a long-term rising trend and will have a “negligible” effect on the climate crisis, researchers say. “We understand the world is complicated and that what we are asking for may not be easy or seem unrealistic,” said the school strikers. “But it is much more unrealistic to believe that our societies would be able to survive the global heating we’re heading for. We are inevitably going to have to fundamentally change, one way or another. The question is: will the changes be on our terms, or on nature’s terms?”"
"The Carbon Sense Coalition (“Carbon Sense”) based in Australia is supporting an International Conference on the Science of Global Warming in New York next week (2-4th March 2008).
This conference, sponsored by The Heartland Institute of Chicago, is co-sponsored by 19 other organisations all over the world including the Carbon Sense Coalition.

The Conference will feature internationally recognised speakers from Australia, New Zealand, UK, USA, Canada and Europe. Carbon Sense has registered 10 delegates from Australia and New Zealand and several other individual delegates and scientists from Australia and New Zealand will attend.
For more information on the Conference see: http://www.heartland.org/NewYork08/newyork08.cfm
The chairman Carbon Sense, Mr Viv Forbes, said that this conference would highlight the fact that a large number of eminently qualified scientists all over the world are rejecting the IPCC proposition that human emissions of carbon dioxide have caused or will cause dangerous global warming.
“We compliment Professor Garnaut for acknowledging that the science is not settled and for seeing value in expanding the global scientific effort beyond the IPCC. We urge Professor Garnaut, and Ministers Wong and Garret to attend the New York conference to see the powerful new scientific arguments and evidence that have emerged since the now outdated work supporting latest IPCC reports.”
According to Forbes, “Global warming hysteria will take a cold shower in New York next week”.
A copy of the submission by Carbon Sense to the Garnaut Review can be found at: http://carbon-sense.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/garnaut-submission.pdf
“There is definitely no “consensus” on man-made global warming even if this were relevant to determining a question of science. In fact, far more scientists have openly rejected the IPCC propositions than are publicly supporting it.
“The Carbon Sense Coalition, supported by the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition and other groups and individuals in Australia and New Zealand, recently called on the governments of Australia and New Zealand to set up an Australia New Zealand Royal Commission on the Science of Global Warming (to be known as “The ANZIG Royal Commission” – the Australia New Zealand Inquiry into Global Warming). We strongly believe that establishment of this enquiry should be a recommendation of the Garnaut Review.”
The submission by the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition to the New Zealand Parliament in 2006, calling for a Royal Commission can be found at: http://nzclimatescience.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=205&itemid=1
“The interim report released recently by Professor Garnaut makes it more urgent that this independent scientific enquiry should take place.
“Garnaut’s proposal that Australia should target a 90% cut in carbon emissions by 2050 is so extreme that Australians need to take notice what destruction is being proposed in such a cavalier fashion. At one stroke, he could destroy the value of the huge public assets in coal fired power stations, as well as causing a dramatic fall in food production, power shortages and the migration to Asia of much of Australia’s cement, steel, processing and manufacturing industries.
“These people have already brainwashed our children into a state of fear about the future, now Garnaut will guarantee them lives of shortages and poverty. Without coal and oil the world could not maintain the world population, or produce and transport its food.
“Coal fuelled the British Industrial Revolution, and coal-fired electricity cleaned the air of last century’s polluted cities in Europe and America. Coal is still the most reliable and economical source of energy for modern life and is now offering its magic to Asia.
“There is loose talk about how we can simply replace coal by non-carbon sources such as uranium, hydro, wind, solar, bio-energy or hydrogen.
“Of these, only nuclear power has the proven capacity to replace coal, but to do so would require more time, more capital, less political hurdles and cheaper supplies of uranium than are in prospect. There is almost zero prospect that Australia could virtually replace its total carbon based generating capacity with nuclear by 2050.
“Hydro is a good reliable source of energy, but all the best sites are taken or sterilised by World Heritage disease.
“Gas can generate significant power, but it is enormously wasteful to use gas for base load power. Gas should be used for peak power, for standby power for solar or wind energy toys, for transport fuel to reduce our dependence on unstable Arab supplies and as a chemical feedstock. It is too valuable to be wasted on base load power generation.
“Hydrogen does not occur naturally, and is thus not a source of energy – it can be used to store and transport energy if the considerable engineering and economic hurdles are overcome.
There are some ways that can help you, driving there are two or three activities known as Kegel exercise that helps you in managing the vaginal dividers usingv-tight gel review solution.
“Nowhere in the world is wind or solar energy contributing significant base load energy for the simple reason that it is impossible. Neither can supply energy continuously and both supply ZERO power for significant parts of their operating cycle. Both must be supplemented by conventional power sources (such as gas or hydro) ready to start up instantly the wind drops or a cloud passes in front of the sun. Such backup power needs to be the same capacity as the solar/wind facility, thus doubling total generating capacity and making this option an expensive, unstable and wasteful exercise.
“Wind power is useful for pumping water to storage ponds for other use, and solar is useful for heating and storing domestic hot water. Beyond these applications, they will never survive without costly subsidies or mandated shares. No one runs a big city or a steel works solely on solar or wind.
“The only efficient way to harvest the sun’s energy is to use plants such as grass, trees and algae. However, “Biofuel” is a costly con which does more harm than good to energy supplies, energy costs and the environment.”

"**A strategically important airport in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region has become a key battleground between opposing forces in the current conflict.**
Pro-government accounts say the Ethiopian military controls Aksum airport - but this does not appear to have prevented Tigray special forces mounting an attack and disabling the runway in the past few days.
With communications from the region largely cut, the situation has been unclear.
But we've taken a look at some footage put out about the attack, and satellite images of the airport, to try to piece together a timeline of events.
Ethiopian forces captured the airport on 11 November, according to pro-government social-media accounts.
Until that point, it had been in the hands of the Tigray regional forces (known as the TPLF).
But control of the airport and the surrounding region was clearly not settled on that date.
On Thursday, 19 November, the Tigray leader, Debretsion Gebremichael, told the Reuters news agency Aksum town was still in their hands - but it is unclear if that included the airport.
""Aksum is with us - but there is an army sent to control Aksum - but there is a fight,"" Mr Debretsion said.
On Friday, 20 November, the government announced it had captured Aksum town, but the TPLF had damaged infrastructure in the area.
And on Sunday, 22 November, state media published a video and images of bricks and rubble on the runway, as well as what appeared to be trenches dug into the surface, saying the TPLF had attacked ""ploughed and destroyed the airport, which has contributed a lot to the economy and the people of Aksum"".
To determine whether these images are genuine, we've looked at satellite imagery, provided by Planet Labs, from before and after the attack.
On Thursday, 19 November, the runway appeared to be free from rubble or damage.
But the image captured on Monday, 23 November, shows lines across the airport, which corroborate the previous day's state media reports that trenches had been dug across the runway to prevent planes landing.
Other investigations have led to similar findings.
The Tigray government is yet to comment on what happened at the airport.
Mr Debretsion has denied the TPLF destroyed the airport, but confirmed that obstacles had been put in place to stop the Ethiopian army from advancing.
With the internet and most mobile communications down in the Tigray region, getting an accurate picture of events is challenging.
Ethiopia's state-controlled media has near-monopoly access to the territory and social media has been littered with misleading images.
After it was reported the Ethiopian army had gained control of the airport, pro-government accounts shared images from old stories unrelated to the conflict, purporting to show Ethiopian military personnel at the airport.
Similarly, after Ethiopian media reported the TPLF had damaged the airport, social-media users began sharing images of the near-total destruction of a terminal building.
But the image being shared was in fact from an attack at a Libyan airport in 2014.
Human Rights Watch has called for the Ethiopian government to restore communications in the region.
Ethiopia is a vast country and keeping airports operating for supplies and personnel is important for the national military.
The Aksum region is also important for historical reasons.
Balsillie School of International Affairs director Prof Ann Fitz-Gerald said: ""It's hugely important because other northern airports at Bahir Dar and Gondar have also been damaged and airport security is crucial for mobilising troops and keeping physical lines of communication open.""
""If regional security forces were not going to have the airport itself, its tactic would be to disrupt the access to the airport.
""It would've been a last ditch tactic and possibly as they became threatened.""

Action needed now to end EPA deception, fraud, collusion, tyranny and destruction
Guest essay by Paul Driessen
Russian President Vladimir Putin is outraged that the United States has indicted 14 FIFA soccer officials, accusing them of corruption, racketeering, fraud and conspiracy, involving bribes totaling over $150 million in kickbacks for awarding tournament rights. He says the US is meddling in Russian affairs and plotting to steal the 2018 World Cup from his country. What chutzpah.
This is the same Mr. Putin who annexed Crimea and parts of Ukraine, and whose close cronies have been secretly channeling millions of dollars to US and EU environmentalist groups to oppose both American oil drilling in the Arctic and hydraulic fracturing – the game-changing process that is producing so much oil and gas that it’s slashed energy prices … and Russian revenues. 
The Justice Department indictments generated global applause. Now the DOJ needs to conduct an equally zealous investigation into corruption, fraud and collusion in the Obama Environmental Protection Agency. Of course, that will never happen – no matter how rampant or flagrant the abuses have been.
As Kimberly Strassel documents in May 14 and May 21 articles, EPA emails and other documents reveal that the agency had already decided in 2010 to veto the proposed Pebble Mine in Alaska on ideological grounds, “well before it did any science” on the project’s potential environmental impacts. Meanwhile, an EPA biologist was working with eco-activists to recruit Native Americans to oppose the mine. “It’s not much of a leap,” Strassel writes, “to suggest that the EPA encouraged [petitions against the mine] so that it would have an excuse to intervene, run its science as cover, and block a project it already opposed.”
At the same time the biologist was aiding the petition drive, he was also helping to write EPA’s “options paper” for the mine – and lobbying his co-authors and report contributors to veto the mine, Strassel notes. Now, contrary to newly discovered agency emails, EPA bosses are pretending they never saw the options paper and trying to put the blame on low-level functionaries, when they were deep in cahoots all the way.
This represents incredible collusion, deception, fraud and abuse of power – to impose agency edicts and appease environmental ideologues in and out of EPA. Moreover, it is just the latest in a long line of abuses and usurpations by this Obama agency, under a culture of corruption and secretive, manipulated science used to justify regulatory overkill that imposes extensive damages for few or no benefits.
On climate, EPA relies on computer models and discredited IPCC reports to predict global catastrophes that it insists can be prevented if the United States slashes its fossil fuel use, carbon dioxide emissions and living standards, even if China, India and other developing countries do nothing. Meanwhile, real-world temperatures, hurricanes, tornadoes, polar ice and sea levels continue to defy the fear-mongering. So now the rhetoric has shifted yet again, to alleged national security and asthma threats from climate change.
Just this week, EPA announced that it will henceforth regulate any ponds, puddles, creeks, ditches and other waters that have a “significant nexus” to navigable waterways, even if that ill-defined connection enjoys six degrees of separation from streams in which you can actually paddle a kayak. EPA itself recognizes that “science” does not support its new regime, so now it says its “experience and expertise” justify regulating virtually all “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) – and thus of all lands, land uses, and family, farm and industrial activities not already covered by its climate and other rules.
Homeowners, farmers and businesses will now have to apply for permits to do almost anything that might theoretically pollute or affect waterways. Even taking a shower is now subject to EPA regulation.
On mercury, EPA is shutting down coal-fired power plants that emit barely 3% of all the mercury in US air and water. It claims this will prevent “0.00209 points” in American IQ losses and protect nonexistent “hypothetical female subsistence consumers” who every day for 70 years eat a pound of fish that they catch themselves in US navigable or “nexus” waterways.
For fine particulates, EPA wasn’t satisfied with regulations that prohibited more than one ounce of soot spread evenly in a volume of air a half-mile square by one story tall. When illegal experiments on humans failed to demonstrate that these levels were not actually “dangerous” or “lethal,” it imposed tougher standards anyway, as part of its war on coal.
Before he landed in jail for fraud, high level EPA bureaucrat John Beale concocted the sue-and-settle tactic, under which agency lawyers meet with environmentalist groups behind closed doors, agree to new regulatory standards, and then settle a friendly lawsuit whereby a court orders EPA to adopt the rules. Parties actually impacted by the new regulations never find out about them until it’s a “done deal.”
As presidential candidate Obama promised, under his policies electricity prices would “necessarily skyrocket.” But this means poor families, small businesses, factories, school districts, hospitals and churches must pay far more to keep their lights, heat, air conditioning and equipment running. That means people get laid off, fewer jobs are created, living standards decline, people’s health and wellbeing suffer, stress, depression, and drug and alcohol abuse increase, more people die during heat waves, and far more die during much deadlier winter cold snaps.
However, EPA ignores all these cold, hard realities – as it cherry-picks research and pseudo-science to support its agenda, ignores contradictory studies, and pays advisory boards and activist groups like the American Lung Association millions of dollars annually to rubberstamp and promote its decisions.
What can be done to curb these abuses and usurpations, and rein in this renegade agency? 
Congress should cut EPA’s budget, to eliminate money that it routinely gives to activist and propaganda groups – and prevent the agency from spending any further taxpayer funds to regulate carbon dioxide, impose its new ozone, mercury and WOTUS rules, or participate in new sue-and-settle lawsuits.
Congress should also pass the Secret Science Reform Act, to ensure greater honesty and transparency in EPA rulemakings – and hold hearings on the Pebble Mine and other questionable agency actions, with EPA officials under oath and subject to penalties for perjury, malfeasance and criminality in office.
Presidential candidates must become well versed in these issues, discuss them during interviews and debates, and be prepared to amend, suspend and upend EPA decisions and regulations that were implemented in violation of transparency, integrity, and honest, robust science.
They should also examine how the federal EPA behemoth can be systematically dismantled and replaced with a “committee of the whole” of the 50 state environmental protection agencies – so as to balance and protect our needs for air and water quality, livelihoods, living standards, health and welfare.
State legislators, governors and attorneys general, companies and other aggrieved parties should continue to file lawsuits to block EPA excesses. However, they should stop relying on “abuse of discretion,” as courts almost always bow to government agencies. Instead, they need to demand that every agency decision is grounded in reliable, replicable, testable, peer-reviewed evidence, data and standards – as set forth in the Supreme Court’s Daubert, Joiner and Kumho decisions – and that the agencies demonstrate that they have fully accounted for the negative job, economic, health and welfare impacts of their rulings.
Meanwhile, as Charles Murray (author of By the People: Rebuilding liberty without permission) and others have suggested, states, communities, companies and individuals should engage in a new form of “systemic” civil disobedience: refusing to bow to harmful, nonsensical, tyrannical EPA regulations.
In short, we should take Dylan Thomas’s advice – and rage, rage against the dying of the light – due to regulations that are dimming the lights in our homes and the light of liberty and American exceptionalism.

That climate change is sneaky, it hides the ‘damage’ via ‘weather variations resulting from climate change’ in record high soybean yields, as seen in this graph I located from Kansas State University:
Color me unimpressed with this press release, which boils down to nothing more than a statement of “we could have had a better year if the weather was better”.

Climate change costing soybean farmers
Form the University of Wisconsin-Madison
MADISON – Even during a good year, soybean farmers nationwide are, in essence, taking a loss. That’s because changes in weather patterns have been eating into their profits and taking quite a bite: $11 billion over the past 20 years.
This massive loss has been hidden, in effect, by the impressive annual growth seen in soybean yields thanks to other factors. But that growth could have been 30 percent higher if weather variations resulting from climate change had not occurred, according to a study by University of Wisconsin-Madison agronomists published last month in Nature Plants.
“We are still making yield gains because of breeding and other strategies, but those numbers aren’t as big as they could be,” says lead author Shawn Conley, a UW-Madison agronomy professor and UW-Extension soybean and wheat specialist.
Averaging the data across the United States, researchers found that soybean yields fell by around 2.4 percent for every one-degree rise in temperature. In Wisconsin and most other northern states, including South Dakota and Minnesota, the changes in climate factors actually led to higher soybean yields. Wisconsin, for instance, saw an increase of 17.5 kilograms per hectare per year over the 20 years studied. However, most soybean-growing states farther south, including Ohio, Arkansas and Kentucky, experienced decreases in yields.
These divergent responses have to do with historical norms. In colder northern states, soybeans seem to be enjoying the new warmer weather, while in states farther south – where conditions had previously been fairly ideal – the additional heat is causing stress.
Conley’s team isolated the impacts of changing temperature and precipitation on soybean yields in a much more precise way than previously done. While earlier approaches relied on estimates, UW-Madison researchers gathered their own data field trials, giving them access to more reliable and consistent information about the genetics of the soybeans being grown, the management practices being used and the weather the fields saw throughout the growing season. Spyridon Mourtzinis, a post-doctoral fellow in Conley’s lab, then removed the effects of the management strategies and genetic improvements so the team could focus their analysis on the impacts of weather variability.
Because the states with the biggest yield losses are also the nation’s biggest soybean producers, the national impact comes out to a 30 percent yield loss overall.
Conley says that the next step is to help growers minimize this loss by starting or expanding practices such as earlier planting, no-till practices and growing later maturing soybeans. Researchers can help by producing region-specific suggestions that account for weather patterns at different times of the growing season.
Only then, says Conley, can the full potential of soybean yields be realized.

Retreating sea ice linked to changes in ocean circulation, could affect European climate
From the UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO
MODIS true-colour satellite image showing linear cloud patterns known as ‘cloud streets’ over the Greenland and Iceland Seas. These clouds are a signature of the transfer of heat and moisture that warms the atmosphere and cools the ocean resulting in a convective overturning of the water column, a process that plays an important role in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The island of Jan Mayen is in the center of the image and the flow around its topography results in the formation of spiraling cloud patterns known as ‘von Karman vortices’.

Retreating sea ice in the Iceland and Greenland Seas may be changing the circulation of warm and cold water in the Atlantic Ocean, and could ultimately impact the climate in Europe, says a new study by an atmospheric physicist from the University of Toronto Mississauga (UTM) and his colleagues in Great Britain, Norway and the United States.
“A warm western Europe requires a cold North Atlantic Ocean, and the warming that the North Atlantic is now experiencing has the potential to result in a cooling over western Europe,” says professor G.W.K. Moore of UTM’s Department of Chemical & Physical Sciences.
As global warming affects the earth and ocean, the retreat of the sea ice means there won’t be as much cold, dense water, generated through a process known as oceanic convection, created to flow south and feed the Gulf Stream. If convection decreases, says Moore, the Gulf Stream may weaken, thereby reducing the warming of the atmosphere, in comparison to today.
Their research, published in Nature Climate Change on June 29, is the first attempt to examine and document these changes in the air-sea heat exchange in the region — brought about by global warming — and to consider its possible impact on oceanic circulation, including the climatologically important Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.
Previous studies have focused instead on the changing salinity of the northern seas and its effects on ocean circulation.
Moore and his fellow researchers based their findings on wintertime data from 1958 to 2014 that was provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and model simulations.
Traditionally, the Gulf Stream moves warm water north toward western Europe, says Moore, where it loses heat and moisture to the atmosphere, acting to moderate the climate in this region. The resulting colder, denser water sinks and returns south at a great depth eventually rising to the surface in the tropics, where the cycle, known as the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation, begins all over again.
The Iceland and Greenland Seas are among the only places worldwide where conditions are right and this heat exchange is able to change the ocean’s density enough to cause the surface waters to sink. The largest air-sea heat exchange in these seas occurs at the edge of the sea ice.
In the past, this region of maximum heat exchange has coincided with the location where oceanic conditions are optimal for convection to occur. However, in recent years, the sea ice has retreated and with it the region of maximum heat exchange. As a result, there has been a reduction in the heat exchange over the locations where sinking occurs in the ocean. This has the potential to weaken oceanic convection in the Greenland and Iceland Seas.
“The heat exchange is weaker — it’s like turning the stove down 20 percent,” says Moore. “We believe the weakening will continue and eventually cause changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the Gulf Stream, which can impact the climate of Europe.”
The paper’s other authors are Kjetil V?ge from the University of Bergen, Robert Pickart from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Ian Renfrew from the University of East Anglia.

"**The fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray state may not only have drastic implications for the future of the country but could also seriously affect its neighbours.**
Seeking to calm tensions a day after fighting started, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that ""the stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region"".
With a population of more than 110 million and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, what happens in Ethiopia inevitably has a wider impact.
Despite this, the federal government has so far resisted calls for diplomatic intervention to end the hostilities with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which runs the state.
Instead it has launched a charm offensive aiming to persuade the world that this is an internal matter. The government has described the conflict as a ""law-enforcement operation"" against a ""clique"" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order.
This fighting may have been the result of long-standing tensions between the TPLF and the federal authorities, but the thousands of refugees crossing into Sudan indicates how this has spread beyond Ethiopia's borders, whether the government likes it or not.
""The war is already regional,"" says Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst.
""The Sudanese are involved and at some point it will involve other countries in the region, and also beyond, because it is a strategic region. The impact is huge.""
He also believes that the conflict has drawn in Eritrea, which shares a long border with Tigray.
Eritrea has a history of poor relations with the TPLF, with its own scores to settle, and its President, Isaias Afwerki, is an ally of Ethiopian Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed.
There is no doubt that attacking across Tigray's northern border would open up a new flank in the fighting, but so far the Eritrean authorities have denied involvement in the crisis.
There is also a danger that the federal government's focus on Tigray could weaken its involvement in backing the government in Somalia against al-Shabab militants.
Ethiopia has already withdrawn about 600 soldiers from Somalia's western border, though they were not tied to the African Union's mission in Somalia (Amisom), which Ethiopia also supports.
""If the situation deteriorates further and Mr Abiy is forced to pull out of Amisom, that would be catastrophic... it will create an opportunity for al-Shabab to regrow and regroup again,"" says regional analyst Mr Abdi.
The International Crisis Group agrees, saying that unless the conflict is urgently stopped, it ""will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa"".
Regardless of the current involvement of Ethiopia's neighbours, some argue that the conflict could weaken the Ethiopian state, which could have damaging regional consequences in itself, with other groups in the multi-ethnic country emboldened to take on the central government.
Mr Abdi told the BBC that ""what you will see essentially is the regions drifting away from the centre and the centre becoming weaker, unable to assert itself"".
But the director of Nairobi-based think-tank the Horn Institute, Hassan Khannenje, understands that Prime Minister Abiy needed to bring Tigray back in line with the federal government to avoid a situation where others could follow its example.
""Mr Abiy sees this as setting a bad precedent for the other regions... a unilateral movement towards a potential secession will mean the balkanisation of Ethiopia, which could mean the end of Ethiopia as a nation-state,"" he told the BBC.
""His endgame is to bring the state back into the fold and hopefully move into elections next year as a united country. Which is going to very hard to do in practice, but it is not impossible.""
In the meantime, the crisis could lead to thousands being forced from their homes either directly because of conflict, or because of the fear of conflict.
Growing numbers have been crossing into Sudan and on Friday the UN's refugee agency said that the speed of new arrivals risked ""overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid"", the Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman as saying.
The Sudanese government has agreed to the establishment of a camp for 20,000 people 80km (50 miles) from the border and more sites are being identified, the UN says.
Added to this is the spectre of food shortages, with the region being one of the worst-affected by a desert locust infestation, with threats of new swarms arriving in the coming weeks, according to a recent UN humanitarian report.
About 600,000 people in Tigray - about 10% of the population - already rely on food aid and across the country around seven million people face food shortages, the UN says.
If the fighting does continue, the numbers of people needing assistance would increase rapidly in a region already under pressure on other fronts.
The UN adds that the threat ""of uncontrolled diseases and desert locust infestation"" reaching other parts of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries ""is high"".
Ethiopia's size and strategic position in the region means that what happens in the country cannot necessarily be isolated, whether that is the fighting itself or the humanitarian fall-out.
The prime minister is confident that this will be a short conflict and insists that it is a purely Ethiopian issue, but if it is prolonged then it could have serious repercussions for many of its neighbours."

"Calling your local lawmaker to express your opinion is generally seen as more effective than sending emails. But legislators have been experiencing such a high volume of calls from constituents recently that their voice mail inboxes have been filled to capacity. High on the agendas of callers: President Trump’s cabinet nominations and the flurry of actions taken in his first week in office. J. P. Freire, a spokesman for Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said on Friday that the office had doubled its voice mail capacity in the past few months when it became clear that, with the new administration, “we were going to play an even larger role. ” “Certainly we have a high call volume,” Mr. Freire said. While he declined to comment on the topics discussed with constituents, he attributed some of the high volumes to Senator Hatch’s position on several congressional committees. With votes scheduled to take place on Jan. 31 on his nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and his pick for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, online campaigns promoting telephone activism are also picking up steam. Constituents and political activists are organizing to try and influence lawmakers’ votes on the nominations, and are tagging them on Twitter or Facebook if they are unable to reach staff members by telephone. On Thursday, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, took note of the feedback in her home state, California, with notes tacked onto her Twitter timeline by people trying to reach her and blaming telephone backlogs. At 10:17 Eastern on Friday morning, for example, no one picked up the telephone at the main number for the senator’s office in Washington. Two minutes later, when a call was placed to Ms. Feinstein’s San Francisco office, a recording said the voice mail box was full. The mailbox was still full at 1:17 p. m. But someone did pick up the phone at her office in San Diego, referring a reporter to a spokesman, said they were aware of the heavy call volume and were working on it. “All office lines in California and Washington are being answered, and voicemails are being taken down as quickly as possible,” the spokesman, Tom Mentzer, said in an email on Friday. “When phone lines are overwhelmed, we also encourage constituents to use the senator’s website to contact her online. ” This week, Concerned Student 1950, a student group  named in honor of the year the first black students were admitted to the University of Missouri, promoted a telephone campaign to oppose Mr. Sessions’s nomination. It published on Twitter a register of phone numbers for key legislators whose votes could be pivotal, along with advice on who was picking up the phone and who was not. People urged others on Twitter to use the   fax machine, to send emails or to reach out to their local legislators’ offices if phone lines on Capitol Hill were not being answered or if voice mail messages were no longer being accepted. Sometimes, residents expressed their displeasure about the jammed lines. Senator Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican, was the subject of protests in his home state this week by some constituents over what they said was their inability to contact their elected official by phone, The Durango Herald reported. “I just don’t understand why Cory Gardner is not responding to the people he’s supposed to represent,” said Gail Harriss, a Durango resident who was one of about 50 protesters who converged on the senator’s office. “Especially when time is of the essence with Trump’s nominees,” the newspaper quoted her as saying. Alex Siciliano, a spokesman for Senator Gardner, said in a telephone interview on Friday that in the past week or two, the senator’s office had switched over to a system that has a “virtually unlimited” capacity that sends voice mail messages digitally to an email inbox that make it easier for staff members to work through the calls. Mr. Siciliano said later in an email: “Nothing is more important to Senator Gardner than providing the best constituent service possible to all Coloradans. Since January 1st, our office has received a large volume of emails and phone calls, and we have responded to more than 25, 000 letters and fielded thousands of phone calls. ” The Twitter timeline of Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, was littered with messages on Friday saying her phone lines were jammed. Ms Murray replied with an announcement telling people to send emails, instead. Taylor Haulsee, a spokesman for Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, said on Friday that the office was busy fielding a high volume of calls from constituents with opinions about the nominees. Bryan Watt, a spokesman for Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington State, said in a telephone interview that the office has received about 6, 000 calls this week and 5, 000 more voice mail messages, between the Washington, D. C. offices and the Seattle office. “Most of them are coming in about the nominees,” he said. “We have seven phone lines. If they are currently busy, then that person will be kicked to voice mail. ” He added, “For the most part, we are able to keep up and listen to as many people as possible. ” Perhaps the calls had some effect. Senator Cantwell announced on Thursday that she would not back Ms. DeVos’s nomination for education secretary."

THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
Climate and Health – Lancet: The British medical journal Lancet released what is billed as the most comprehensive study on the relationship between temperature extremes and human mortality. According to the abstract: “Although studies have provided estimates of premature deaths attributable to either heat or cold in selected countries, none has so far offered a systematic assessment across the whole temperature range in populations exposed to different climates. We aimed to quantify the total mortality burden attributable to non-optimum ambient temperature, and the relative contributions from heat and cold and from moderate and extreme temperatures.

“Methods: We collected data for 384 locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and USA. We fitted a standard time-series Poisson model for each location, controlling for trends and day of the week. We estimated temperature-mortality associations with a distributed lag non-linear model with 21 days of lag, and then pooled them in a multivariate metaregression that included country indicators and temperature average and range. We calculated attributable deaths for heat and cold, defined as temperatures above and below the optimum temperature, which corresponded to the point of minimum mortality, and for moderate and extreme temperatures, defined using cutoffs at the 2·5th and 97·5th temperature percentiles.
“Findings: We analysed 74?225?200 deaths in various periods between 1985 and 2012. In total, 7·71% (95% empirical CI 7·43-7·91) of mortality was attributable to non-optimum temperature in the selected countries within the study period, with substantial differences between countries, ranging from 3·37% (3·06 to 3·63) in Thailand to 11·00% (9·29 to 12·47) in China. The temperature percentile of minimum mortality varied from roughly the 60th percentile in tropical areas to about the 80-90th percentile in temperate regions. More temperature-attributable deaths were caused by cold (7·29%, 7·02-7·49) than by heat (0·42%, 0·39-0·44). Extreme cold and hot temperatures were responsible for 0·86% (0·84-0·87) of total mortality.
“Interpretation: Most of the temperature-related mortality burden was attributable to the contribution of cold. The effect of days of extreme temperature was substantially less than that attributable to milder but non-optimum weather. This evidence has important implications for the planning of public-health interventions to minimise the health consequences of adverse temperatures, and for predictions of future effect in climate-change scenarios.”
The study was financed by the UK Medical Research Council.
These results (that about 20 times more deaths are associated with cold weather than hot weather) are not particularly surprising. For years independent scientists, such as those who participate in the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), have questioned mortality forecasts arising from the work presented by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and its claims of ever increasing temperatures.
The study focused on the temperate regions of the world, where most people live. Also of interest is that sub-optimal temperatures kill far more people than extreme temperatures. This indicates that the government focus on extreme events is misplaced. It is periods of cold or heat that should be the focus of public health officials.
No doubt, some Western governments are not pleased. They have placed enormous resources in “fighting global warming”, now called climate change due to the lack of 21st century warming. The study undermines the existence of many government programs and departments. Without the fear of increased mortality from global warming, taxpayers may begin to question those with political power, who exploit the fear of global warming/climate change.

SEPP’S APRIL FOOLS AWARD
THE JACKSON
The voting for SEPP’s annual April Fools Award is over. We thank all those who participated with nominees and votes. The winner of this close race will be announced at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness in Ontario, CA, from July 31 to August 2, 2015.
Climate and Health – USGCRP: As discussed in the April 18 and May 16 TWTWs, the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) released a draft for public review of its upcoming Climate & Health Assessment. The entire document has significant issues, including it is based on forecasts from climate models that have not been validated and it ignores the importance of public health measures in controlling infectious diseases. The study published in Lancet, discussed above, exposes further weaknesses of the assessment by USGCRP.
Figure ES7 of the report gives an estimated ten year (2004 to 2013) fatalities from extreme weather events in the U.S, as prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of the thirteen government entities comprising the USGCRP. The ranking of estimated deaths over the 10 year period from the listed weather events are as follows: Heat Wave, a little greater than 1200; Tornado, about 1100; Hurricane, about 1100; Floods between 700 and 800; Wind Storm, about 500; Lightning between 350 and 400; Cold waves less than 250; and Winter storms less than 250. The USGCRP findings on cold weather deaths are opposite to those in Lancet.
Those who have studied mortality tables for the US would recognize that the reported deaths from cold weather events make no sense – even before the publication of the Lancet report. Lightning kills more people in the US than Cold Waves or Winter Storms? The USGCRP and the thirteen government entities involved should immediately withdraw the report and publicly apologize for its publication, which, of course, will not happen. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy.

Respect: Using a graduation ceremony of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy as the venue, President Obama asserted an “urgent need to combat and adapt to climate change.” There is no issue with the need to adapt to climate change, which has been ongoing for well over a billion years, long before the advent of multi-cell creatures, much less humanity.
In spite of spending at least twenty billion dollars on climate science, this Administration has not significantly advanced our knowledge of the natural influences on climate, as reflected in government publications, such as those by the USGCRP. In short, the Administration is demanding we fight an enemy without understanding it. Yet, one of the maxims of military strategy is: “Know your enemy.”
Given to those who are about to become military officers, trained to be respectful of the Commander in Chief, the speech was more fitting for a political fund-raising event. The President, and his aides, are apparently unaware that respect must be mutual. Such ceremonies should not be considered as political opportunities. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy.

Return of the Iris? A 2001 hypothesis by Richard Lindzen, et al. is making its way back into the literature. The hypothesis was quickly dismissed by the authoritarian Climate Establishment, without being fully considered. The hypothesis suggests that there is a natural response in the atmosphere to a warming, whatever the cause, which reduces the warming – a negative feedback. Such a negative feedback would lessen fears of “run-away” global warming, etc.
The return of the Iris indicates that the Climate Establishment can no longer authoritatively dismiss hypotheses that are contrary to its own beliefs – an advancement in Climate Science. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – The Iris?

Flash-in-the-Pan – Missing Hot Spot Found? Based on highly manipulated data, a paper published in Environmental Research letters asserted that its authors found the missing “hot spot” – an area centered over the tropics at about 10 km in which a warming trend, whatever the cause, is more pronounced than at the surface. [Note: this is different than the temperatures being greater than at the surface.] Like the original hot spot, declared in the IPCC Second Assessment Report, it appears that no one, other than the authors, can find this recently re-discovered hot spot.
What is amusing about the entire affair is that few in the Climate Establishment bothered to report that the “so-called” distinct human fingerprint was missing, at least, until it was re-discovered. Now, will it remain unnoticed and missing, again? See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Measurement Issues.

In the march to Paris for the 2015 (the 21st) Conference of Parties (COP) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) starting on November 30, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) used very creative accounting techniques to declare that fossil fuel subsidies amount to about $5,000,000,000,000 per year.
Of course, there is no accounting of the enormous benefits fossil fuel use provide Western Civilization and humanity. These appear to be beyond the imaginative accounting capabilities of the IMF. See links Communicating Better to the Public – Make things up.

1. Notable & Quotable: President Obama
‘Around the world, climate change increases the risk of instability and conflict.’
WSJ, May 20, 2015
http://www.wsj.com/articles/notable…
From President Obama’s commencement address Wednesday at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn.:
Around the world, climate change increases the risk of instability and conflict. Rising seas are already swallowing low-lying lands, from Bangladesh to Pacific islands, forcing people from their homes. Caribbean islands and Central American coasts are vulnerable, as well. Globally, we could see a rise in climate change refugees. And I guarantee you the Coast Guard will have to respond. Elsewhere, more intense droughts will exacerbate shortages of water and food, increase competition for resources, and create the potential for mass migrations and new tensions. All of which is why the Pentagon calls climate change a “threat multiplier.”
Understand, climate change did not cause the conflicts we see around the world. Yet what we also know is that severe drought helped to create the instability in Nigeria that was exploited by the terrorist group Boko Haram. It’s now believed that drought and crop failures and high food prices helped fuel the early unrest in Syria, which descended into civil war in the heart of the Middle East. So, increasingly, our military and our combatant commands, our services – including the Coast Guard – will need to factor climate change into plans and operations, because you need to be ready.

2. The Real Denialism
“Climate change” has become an all-purpose excuse.
By James Taranto, WSJ, May 21, 2015
http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rea…
[SUMMARY: The author brings up some of the key points in the President’s address to graduates of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, in asserting “”the urgent need to combat and adapt to climate change.”
He rehearsed the litany of weather disasters supposedly caused by climate change: “more extreme storms,” “deeper droughts and longer wildfires,” flooding of streets in coastal cities. And he went further, blaming global warming for geopolitical problems:
Understand, climate change did not cause the conflicts we see around the world. Yet what we also know is that severe drought helped to create the instability in Nigeria that was exploited by the terrorist group Boko Haram. It’s now believed that drought and crop failures and high food prices helped fuel the early unrest in Syria, which descended into civil war in the heart of the Middle East. So, increasingly, our military and our combatant commands, our services – including the Coast Guard – will need to factor climate change into plans and operations, because you need to be ready.
Even if one assumes all these assertions are true, they do not advance a case for urgent action. As the president acknowledged with that initial disclaimer, the chain of causation is just too weak. Global climate change contributes somehow to local droughts, which contribute somehow to instability, which contributes somehow to the rise of Boko Haram and rebellion in Syria (a rebellion, let us recall, for which the president briefly urged U.S. military support back in 2013). The vagueness of the hypotheses make it impossible to evaluate any proposed climate policy as a remedy for the Nigerian or Syrian conflicts.
The most telling assertion in the president’s speech was meant as a throwaway line. Immediately after setting up his some-folks-back-in-Washington straw man, Obama allowed as how “on a day like today, it’s hard to get too worried about it,” the antecedent being “climate change.” It was a cool spring day in New London, Conn.
But of course he does not. As with the weather, he presents “climate change” as a cause of all manner of bad effects but no good ones. In the geopolitical realm, it is an all-purpose excuse when things go wrong. It is logically little different from saying of a disaster, whether natural or man-made, “It was God’s will.” That statement is true if one accepts the underlying metaphysical theory, and it may provide comfort to those who do. But it is not an empirical explanation. It isn’t science.
Now of course weather isn’t the same thing as climate, as global warmists are quick to point out in fair weather. But that’s true of all weather. It is fallacious to attribute bad weather but not good weather to “climate change,” as if every day was idyllic everywhere on preindustrial Earth.
Similarly, if “climate change” is contributing to war and instability, it must also be contributing to peace and stability. Obama boasts of various foreign-policy achievements, such as the “end of the war” in Iraq and the diplomatic openings to Iran and Cuba. Stipulating for the sake of argument that these are in fact favorable developments, the logic of the president’s Coast Guard speech is that he must share the credit for them with all humans whose activities have contributed to climate change.
Obama’s denunciation of those who persist in “denying” global warmism is especially objectionable in light of his own denialism with regard to Islamic extremism. As we noted last August, the president insisted that the Islamic State, which is among the combatants in the Syrian war, “speaks for no religion. . . . No faith teaches people to massacre innocents.” Presumably he would say the same of Boko Haram (whose name means, roughly, “non-Islamic education violates Islamic law].

3. Schoolroom Climate Change Indoctrination
In one assignment, students measure the size of their family’s carbon footprint and suggest ways to shrink it.
By Paul Tice, WSJ, May 27, 2015 [H/t William Readdy]
http://www.wsj.com/articles/schoolr…
SUMMARY: After discussing the framework of kindergarten to 12th grade science education, approved by the National Research Council, the author discussed the ideological nature of the program: “by the end of Grade 5, students should appreciate that rising average global temperatures will affect the lives of all humans and other organisms on the planet. By Grade 8, students should understand that the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels is a major factor in global warming. And by Grade 12, students should know that global climate models are very effective in modeling, predicting and managing the current and future impact of climate change.”
Apparently, the Council is not bothered by the fact that temperatures have not been rising for over a decade, and there has been no empirical relationship established between atmospheric CO2 and global temperatures. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Energy Department have their own Climate Literacy & Energy Awareness Network, or CLEAN.
According to the author: Relying on a climate-change curriculum and teaching materials largely sourced from federal agencies – particularly those of the current ideologically driven administration – raises a number of issues. Along with the undue authoritative weight that such government-produced documents carry in the classroom, most of the work is one-sided and presented in categorical terms, leaving no room for a balanced discussion. Moreover, too much blind trust is placed in the predictive power of long-range computer simulations, despite the weak forecasting track record of most climate models to date.
This is unfortunate because the topic of man-made global warming, properly taught, would present many teachable moments and provide an example of the scientific method in action. Precisely because the science of climate change is still just a theory, discussion would help to build student skills in critical thinking, argumentation and reasoning, which is the stated objective of the new K-12 science standards.
For instance: Why has the planet inconveniently stopped warming since the late 1990s even as carbon dioxide levels have continued to rise? How reliable are historical measurements of average global temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels when, before the 1950s, much of the data are interpolated from such diverse sources as weather balloons, kites, cloud observations, primordial tree rings and Antarctic ice bubbles?
How statistically significant is a 1.4-degree Fahrenheit increase in average global surface temperatures since 1880 for a 4.6 billion-year-old planet with multiple ecosystems and a surface area of some 200 million square miles? How dangerous is the current level of carbon dioxide in the world’s atmosphere, when 400 parts per million expressed as a percentage of the volume of the atmosphere would equate to only 0.04% or approximately zero?
Employing such a Socratic approach to teaching climate change would likely lead to a rational and thought-provoking classroom debate on the merits of the case. However, that is not the point of this academic exercise – which seems to be to indoctrinate young people by using K-12 educators to establish the same positive political feedback loop around global warming that has existed between the federal government and the nation’s colleges and universities for the past two decades.

4. Slaking California’s Thirst – if Politics Allows
Israel solved its water woes in five years by desalination. A CEO explains why it took him 10 years to build a single plant near San Diego.
By Allysia Finley, WSJ, May 15, 2015
http://www.wsj.com/articles/slaking…
SUMMARY: The author compares the water situation in southern California with that of Israel, which, by the end of the year will complete “three massive desalination plants in Ashdod, Hadera and Sorek that combined are capable of producing 100 billion gallons of potable water each year from the sea. More such projects are in the works. Next year desalination will provide about half of Israel’s water – not including the roughly 80% of recycled wastewater that goes mainly to agriculture – up from zero in 2004 and about 10% in 2009. The drought ended in 2012, and Israel doesn’t need to worry much about the next one. In a mere five years, desalination has turned a scarce resource into a commodity that may soon be exportable.”
The bureaucratic effort in California is going to cutting consumption, and environmental groups are fighting efforts to build addition desalination plants, even as first plant in Carlsbad is nearing completion.

5. The Hole in the Rooftop Solar-Panel Craze
Large-scale plants make sense, but panels for houses simply transfer wealth from average electric customers.
By Brian Potts, WSJ, May 17, 2015
http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hol…
Link to report: Going Solar in America: Ranking Solar’s Value to Consumers in America’s Largest Cities
By Jim Kennerly and Autumn Proudlove, NC Clean Energy Technology, No date
http://nccleantech.ncsu.edu/wp-cont…
SUMMARY: The author asserts that” Large-scale solar-power prices are falling because the cost to manufacture solar panels has been decreasing and because large solar installations permit economies of scale. Rooftop solar, on the other hand, often involves microinstallations in inefficient places, which makes the overall cost as much as 3½ times higher.”
The reasons for these inefficiencies are multiple, but “well-meaning – but ill-conceived – federal, state and local tax incentives for rooftop solar give back between 30% and 40% of the installation costs to the owner as a tax credit. But more problematic are hidden rate subsidies, the most significant of which is called net metering, which is available in 44 states. Net metering allows solar-system owners to offset on a one-for-one basis the energy they receive from the electric grid with the solar power they generate on their roof.”
“Increasingly, utilities across the country have been calling attention to the problems with rooftop solar. They’ve been urging the pursuit of large-scale solar and other renewables, the moderation of rooftop-solar subsidies, and a restructuring of electric rates to encourage new technologies. They’ve been vilified by armies of PR consultants armed with sound bites about how utilities want to kill solar.”
The cited study, financed by the Department of Energy, claims that in 46 of America’s 50 largest cities, a typically sized solar PV system is a better investment than the stock market. The rating system used in the study ranks New York City and Boston as # 1 and #2 in the US as places to “invest in” solar PV, well ahead far sunnier Oklahoma City (# 48) and Tulsa, OK, (# 49).

I also wonder how this paper would have fared if it had been submitted to Nature Climate Change (consensus enforcing), rather than Nature Geoscience (which seems to do a good job editorially).”

"Type the word refugees into Facebook and some alarming “news” will appear about a refugee rape crisis, a refugee   disease epidemic and a   risk of female genital mutilation  —   none of it true. For the months leading up to the presidential election, and in the days since President Trump took office, ultraconservative websites like Breitbart News and Infowars have published a cycle of   stories with misleading claims about refugees. And it is beginning to influence public perception, experts say. That shift was evident on Friday, as many Americans heralded the news that the Trump administration intended to temporarily curb all refugee resettlement and increase the vetting of Syrians. “There really is a kind of cultural battle going on,” said Cecillia Wang, the deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union. “There’s no question that kind of xenophobic or   bias is infecting our political discourse about refugees. ” In speaking to pollsters about refugee resettlement, Americans tend to cite concerns about the country’s national security and economic health as their biggest worries, but they have also begun to point to disease or rape, experts say. “This is something where the fear outruns the fact by a factor of 100 to 1 or even 1, 000 to 1,” said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has tracked American sentiment about refugee resettlement over years. Mr. Galston said the reaction to misleading coverage of refugees was reminiscent of the wave of measures introduced in state legislatures in recent years to stop the spread of Islamic law, despite scant evidence that it has been promoted anywhere. And while he doubted that alarmist stories about refugees were powerful enough to change people’s minds, he said the coverage played to existing fears and pushed mere differences of opinion into hyperpartisan outrage. “I think their opinions are being intensified because the intensification of contrary sentiments is increasing polarization,” Mr. Galston said. Outside his job as a police officer in Kansas, Okla. Mike Eason begins and ends his day with the television news  —   first CBS, then Fox, but never CNN, which he hates. Then, he scrolls through Facebook, where he’s read stories about refugees who commit violent crimes against women. “It’s one of them Facebook things where you see Muslim men are attacking women, and stuff like that, and having no respect for them at all. I’ve got a real issue with that,” he said. “I see story after story after story, and I don’t know how true it is. ” Mr. Eason said he was skeptical of stories by unfamiliar websites like American News, but he reads them anyway. He commented on one that was posted to Facebook: The post, which was shared 14, 000 times, linked to a story about a case in which the authorities have not described the immigration status of the suspect, or said that he was a noncitizen. They have also discredited the claim that the man yelled “Allahu akbar” during the episode. Nevertheless, the comment that Mr. Eason posted on the site, which he later said he could not remember making, garnered 87 likes. “If Muslims are taught hate by their religion,” he wrote, “then all Muslims are potential terrorists and should be treated accordingly. TRUMP will stop this kind of stuff. ” Sgt. Timothy Briggeman of the Cass County Sheriff’s Office in North Dakota, which is investigating the case, said such stories and responses often appeared on social media when a person in his jurisdiction with an   name is charged with a crime. “To be honest,” he said, “it’s embarrassing and it’s disheartening when anyone with a name of such ends up in the news  —   the comments that get thrown around. That seems to be the No. 1 remark: ‘Send them back and get rid of them,’ and, ‘We don’t need them. ’” Worries that refugees might be radicalized have also been amplified on the internet. This story was shared at least 1, 400 times: And this one, posted by The Daily Caller, was shared more than 3, 000 times, despite linking to a story with no evidence of a  : The actual number of refugees who have become extremists in the United States has been estimated at between three and 12  —   out of the more than 800, 000 who have resettled here since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The online stories about refugees range from outright fake news to those based on a grain of truth and then stretched out of proportion. For example, the Breitbart article about genital mutilation was based on a study that estimated that a   women currently living in the United States have had their genitals mutilated. But most of them were immigrants who had fled here because of such treatment in their home countries. Mr. Eason, the police officer in Oklahoma, said that part of the challenge for him in evaluating stories on the internet is that many are written with headlines that appeal to common sense. He pointed to the vetting of Syrian refugees, for example, which is currently under review as part of Mr. Trump’s executive order. As The New York Times has reported, the process involves dozens of layers of evaluation and can last up to two years. But Mr. Eason has read stories that suggest the conditions in Syria are so bad that it is impossible to verify refugees’ stories, which has made him worry that no level of scrutiny will be sufficient. “They were saying with them coming from these areas, it’s hard to vet them,” Mr. Eason said. “And it makes sense. ”"
"**A conflict between the government of Ethiopia and forces in its northern Tigray region has thrown the country into turmoil.**
Fighting has been going on for almost two weeks, destabilising the populous country in East Africa, with reports of hundreds dead.
A power struggle, an election and a push for political reform are among several factors that led to the crisis.
Here, we've broken them down to explain how and why this conflict has flared.
In simple chunks of 100, 300 and 500 words, this is the story of the crisis so far.
The conflict started on 4 November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray.
He said he did so in response to an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray.
The escalation came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy's government and leaders of Tigray's dominant political party.
For almost three decades, the party was at the centre of power, before it was sidelined by Mr Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests.
Mr Abiy pursued reforms, but when Tigray resisted, a political crisis ensued.
The roots of this crisis can be traced to Ethiopia's system of government.
Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions.
Remember that powerful party from Tigray? Well, this party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - was influential in setting up this system.
It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power.
Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy.
Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister.
Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression.
Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.
These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray.
Tigray's leaders see Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system.
The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election. The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal.
The rift grew in October, when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray. Tigray's administration said this amounted to a ""declaration of war"".
Tensions increased. Then, in what the International Crisis Group termed a ""sudden and predictable"" descent into conflict, Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a ""red line"".
He accused Tigrayan forces of attacking an army base to steal weapons.
""The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,"" Mr Abiy said.
Ethiopia, Africa's oldest independent country, has undergone sweeping changes since Mr Abiy came to power.
A member of the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, Mr Abiy made appeals to political reform, unity and reconciliation in his first speech as prime minister.
His agenda was spurred by the demands of protesters who felt Ethiopia's political elite had obstructed the country's transition to democracy.
The Tigrayan politicians that led the ruling coalition for 27 years were deemed to be part of the problem.
In the 1970s and 1980s their party, the TPLF, fought a war to wrest control of government from a military junta known as the Derg. The party succeeded, becoming a leading member of the coalition government that took power in 1991.
The coalition gave autonomy to Ethiopia's regions, but retained a tight grip on central government, with critics accusing it of repressing political opposition.
Now the party finds itself in opposition.
In 2019, it refused to participate in Mr Abiy's new government and merge with his Prosperity Party.
This snub was followed by further escalations.
Tigray's decision to hold its own election in September, for example, was an unprecedented act of defiance against the central government.
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate"".
Tigray argues that the central government has not been tested in a national election since Mr Abiy's appointment as prime minister.
Tigray has also called out the prime minister for his ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
There has long been animosity between Tigray and the government in Eritrea, which shares a border with the region.
A dispute over territory along this border was the cause of a war fought between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 1998 until 2000.
You may remember this dispute making headlines in 2018.
That year, Mr Abiy signed a peace treaty with Eritrea's government, ending the territorial spat.
A year later, Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize. Now it is war, not peace, that is drawing attention to Ethiopia.
Thousands of civilians have been displaced since 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered his military to strike forces in Tigray. Hundreds more are reported to have died, with reports of a civilian massacre.
With the communications largely cut in Tigray, the exact number of casualties is not clear.
The Ethiopian government has announced a six-month state of emergency in Tigray. A full-blown civil war could last far longer.
""Given the strength of Tigray's security forces, the conflict could well be protracted,"" International Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation, says. ""Tigray has a large paramilitary force and a well-drilled local militia, thought to number perhaps 250,000 troops combined.""
As Africa's second-most populous country, Ethiopia is pivotal to stability in the Horn of Africa.
If the conflict intensifies, there are fears it could spill over into neighbouring countries. There have already been reports of missiles fired into Eritrea and 27,000 refugees fleeing to Sudan.
There is also a concern that the conflict could exacerbate ethnic tensions elsewhere in Ethiopia."

The U.S. economy is slowing down. Trends for all the major components of growth are now uniformly unfavorable: labor participation is falling, the pace of human capital accumulation is slackening, the rate of investment is in long‐​term decline, and growth in total factor productivity has been low for three of the four past decades. A sudden turnaround is always possible, but there are strong reasons for believing that U.S. economic growth in the coming years will fall well short of the long‐​term historical trend.



Progressives, conservatives, and libertarians have a strong common interest in reversing this growth slowdown. They may have different ideas about what to do with the extra money yielded by higher growth, but all sides have a stake in getting a chance to fight it out.



Agreement on ends, however, need not translate into agreement on means. Indeed, the U.S. political debate today is beset by intractable ideological conflicts over tax and budget policy, financial regulation, health care financing, and many other issues with a strong bearing on the climate for economic growth.



Despite today’s polarized political atmosphere, it is possible to construct an ambitious and highly promising agenda of pro‐​growth policy reform that can command support across the ideological spectrum. Such an agenda would focus on policies whose primary effect is to inflate the incomes and wealth of the rich, the powerful, and the well‐​established by shielding them from market competition. A convenient label for these policies is “regressive regulation”—regulatory barriers to entry and competition that work to redistribute income and wealth up the socioeconomic scale. This paper identifies four major examples of regressive regulation: excessive monopoly privileges granted under copyright and patent law; restrictions on high‐​skilled immigration; protection of incumbent service providers under occupational licensing; and artificial scarcity created by land‐​use regulation.



Although there are vigorous debates about proper policy in all of these areas, the contending sides are not divided along left‐​right or Republican‐​Democratic lines. And it’s not simply the case that one can find policy experts on both sides who favor reform. Rather, it’s very difficult to find disinterested experts anywhere on the political spectrum who support the status quo. Such support is largely confined to the well‐​organized lobbies that profit from the current rules.



Hence the title of this paper. For all who are interested in better long‐​term U.S. economic performance, rolling back regressive regulation is the low‐​hanging fruit. Reforming these policies is something we know will make a positive difference, and by “we” I mean the vast majority of disinterested experts. Unfortunately, though, this lowhanging fruit is guarded by “dragons”—the powerful interest groups that benefit from the status quo, all of which can be counted upon to defend their privileges tenaciously.



Although opposition to progress would be formidable, pursuing an agenda of curbing regressive regulation would open up a new front in the ongoing policy fight. Instead of another left‐​right conflict, the contest could be framed as a choice between the public interest and vested interests. With an unprecedented deterioration in the long‐​term growth outlook now looking likely, this novel approach is well worth trying.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a weekly feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
  
  
The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is set to release its _Fifth Assessment Report_ (AR5) of the physical science of climate change at the conclusion on its editorial meeting in Stockholm scheduled from September 23-26th.   
  
A version of its Summary for Policymakers (SPM)—perhaps the most influential portion of the report as it is the widest read—has been “leaked” to generate media interest in the upcoming release. It certainly has, but perhaps not in the manner intended. The leaked SPM has revealed a document so flawed and removed from current science that it has been described as not only being “obsolete on the day that it is released, but that it will be dead wrong as well” (okay, we wrote that).   
  
Examples already abound as to the problems evident in the leaked SPM. Here we add another—this one having to do with the recent rate of sea level rise.   
  
In the Summary for Policymakers section of its _Fourth Assessment Report_ (published in 2007) the IPCC had this to say about the rate of sea level rise:   




Global average sea level rose at an average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3] mm per year over 1961-2003. The rate was faster over 1993 to 2003: about 3.1 [2.4 to 3.8] mm per year. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variability or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear.



Since then, we have highlighted numerous findings in the scientific literature that present strong evidence that the increase in the rate of sea level rise since 1993 is largely _not_ an increase in the longer-term trend (or at least not from human-caused climate change which is the IPCC’s implication) and that the short-term rate of sea level rise has been slowing, and returning back towards the long-term average.   
  
But the IPCC’s heart remains hardened.   




The leaked version of the AR5 SPM includes this description of sea level rise:   




It is _very likely_ that the mean rate of global averaged sea level rise was 1.7 [1.5 to 1.9] mm yr–1 between 1901 and 2010 and 3.2 [2.8 to 3.6] mm yr–1 between 1993 and 2010. Tide-gauge and satellite altimeter data are consistent regarding the higher rate of the latter period. It is _likely_ that similarly high rates occurred between 1920 and 1950.



Notice that they dropped any statement wondering whether the recent rate of rise was an increase in the longer-term trend or the result of short-term variability or other non- climate-change-related factors—even though the difference between these cases has implications for our understanding of sea level rise and how it may evolve into the future.   
  
We repeat— _recent scientific findings argue that rate of sea level rise since 1993 is little different than the long-term (20th century) rate of sea level rise once natural variability and non-climatic influences are accounted for_.   
  
Here are two papers demonstrating this fact.   
  
The first was published by a research team led by Yoshide Wada and which we covered last summer. Wada and colleagues examined how much of an influence human pumping of groundwater for irrigation etc.—water which eventually finds its way into the global oceans—was having on the sea level. They found the impact to be quite significant, concluding:   




[O]ur results compare well with independent estimates for the present groundwater depletion rates… and show that groundwater depletion is likely to be the major component of terrestrial contribution to sea-level change in the coming decades.



The data that they compiled on ground water depletion and surface impoundments (dams) show that for the period from 1993-2011, the net contribution (termed “dewatering” of the continents) has resulted in a sea level rise of about 0.44 mm/yr (+/- 0.1mm/yr)—and they predict this rate to increase by mid-century.   
  
This 0.44 mm/yr (of the observed 3.2 mm/yr) of sea level rise since 1993 is not related to anthropogenic climate change as a result of greenhouse gas emissions.   
  
A second relevant paper was published a few weeks ago. In this one, a team led by University of Colorado’s Ben Hamlington examined how large an influence multi-decadal natural oscillations of an important Pacific Ocean climate state—called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)—has on global sea level. Since the PDO oscillation is pretty slow, approximately 60 years or so, the researchers note that it is “difficult to assess the contribution of decadal to multi-decadal climate signals to the global trend” using a record that only begins in 1993. By attempting to identify the influence of the PDO, Hamlington and colleagues could then estimate the PDO’s effect on the global mean sea level (GMSL) trend. They write:   




We estimate the PDO contribution to the GMSL trend over the past twenty years to be approximately 0.49 ± 0.25 mm/year, and find that removing the PDO contribution reduces the acceleration in GMSL estimated over the past sixty years.



As the PDO is a natural phenomenon, that’s another 0.49 mm/yr (of the 3.2 mm/yr since 1993) not caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.   
  
A quick review of the math shows us that of the IPCC’s 3.2 mm/yr of sea level rise from 1993 only 2.27 mm/yr is left after accounting for natural oscillations in the Pacific and the “dewatering” of the continents.   
  
Color us jaded, but 2.27 mm/yr doesn’t sound all that much different from the long-term 1.7 mm/yr, especially when the confidence intervals of the calculations are all included.   
  
In other words, had the IPCC accurately reported the extant science on the factors behind the reported increase in the rate of sea level rise since 1993, the reader of the SPM would have been left with a much different impression of its evolution—one which the current situation is not that much different from the past (and to which we have largely adapted), instead of one in which the reader is left to think that anthropogenic climate change has resulted in a near doubling of the long-term rate of sea level rise.   
  
Isn’t the IPCC supposed to be giving the _best_ scientific explanation of what it taking place, not one which is colored by trying to support a fracturing consensus?   
  
As Georgia Tech’s Judith Curry points out in an astute op-ed published in the _Australian_ over the weekend (paywalled, but Judy discusses her piece here), that doesn’t seem to be the case at all.   
  
We think it is high time for the IPCC to end its charade (and save the global tax-payer huge sums of money in the process).

"Addressing the conference on illegal wildlife trafficking in London,  Prince Charles said it “broke new ground”, while Prince William said it represented an “unprecedented gathering” that has “never before happened”. This suggests a case of dynastic forgetfulness in the House of Windsor, as it was Edward, Prince of Wales in 1933 who enrolled prime minister Ramsey Macdonald into convening a London Conference on African Wildlife. There are some striking similarities between these two conferences. Both respond to the fear that treasured species will become extinct. Both were small affairs bringing together governing elites (40 delegates in 1933 and 46 in 2014) and both were dominated by experts from the UK and US. Both meetings were premised on the belief that endangered wildlife can be saved if heads of state, royalty, and celebrities use their influence. But there are also intriguing differences between the two meetings. In 1931, Richard Hingston published in The Geographical Journal an independent analysis of wildlife threats and solutions which remains a model conservation assessment. It specifies values and assumptions, summarises issues at stake, discusses cultural perspectives, and sets out clear policy criteria, targets and management principles. Hingston doubted whether, without action, the elephant, rhinoceros and hippopotamus would survive 50 years. He identified the spread of agricultural cultivation, demand for animal products, hunting, and disease as the main threats. In contrast, the evidence base for the 2014 conference consisted largely of news reports of organised crime and rebel militias butchering wildlife to feed a multi-billion dollar black market in Asia. The few scientific assessments focused on modelling illegal killing and population declines: an in-depth independent assessment of the how those markets functioned was missing. A second notable difference was rhetoric. Last week’s conference sounded distinctly militaristic: Prince Charles said “Africa is at war to save its wildlife,” framing the illegal wildlife trade as a “battle” against a villainous enemy, the criminal networks supplying ignorant consumers in the Far East. In contrast the tone of 1933 was less accusatory, emphasising instead the constellation of forces causing the problem. A few days after the conference, Prince Leopold of Belgium told the African Society, “The history of mankind has been marked by periods of indifference towards Nature,” arguing that society was returning to the idea that when we experience and contemplate nature it enriches lives. “The economic advantages due to the protection of nature are apparent to everyone,” he said. In short, responsibility for the decimation of wildlife lies with humankind. It is not something we can or should pin on one group. The marked difference between these two conferences 80 years apart is the outcome. The first resulted in the International Convention for the Fauna and Flora of Africa which established a system of National Parks and nature reserves. The convention also included articles to protect species at high risk of extinction, to stop the trafficking and trading of articles manufactured from trophies, and to respect native rights. Adopted in British colonies outside Africa such as India and Indonesia, the convention established the foundations and institutional architecture for wildlife conservation over the next century. And it succeeded, in that none of the listed mammals in Africa have gone extinct. In contrast the declaration arising from last week’s conference is more modest in status and scope. It calls upon the international community to eradicate demand and supply for illegal wildlife products, passing laws if necessary, improve enforcement, destroy seized contraband such as ivory caches, and address corruption and money laundering issues. Given the growth and complexity of international environmental frameworks since 1933 it’s unrealistic to expect anything more than this. But we might have expected a more progressive, inventive approach: national parks introduced by the 1933 convention were still a novel idea outside the US. By accident or design, the fact they were introduced worldwide through the empire before its subsequent decline has been beneficial. In contrast the proposed measures from last week – of enforcement, corruption crack-downs and demand reduction – are all top-down techniques of “big government”. Leaders of the future will need a broader range of approaches, with which to approach the modern world’s messy, networked, multi-polar nature. Writing 80 years ago, Hingston insightfully wrote, “The one great hope [for African wildlife] lies in converting the living animal into a commercial asset.” Sustainable use and wildlife farming was marginalised at last week’s meeting, dismissed by John Robinson of the World Conservation Society as “often untested” and “while academically intriguing, unlikely to be feasible in the short term”. This is a statement of ideology rather than evidence. Market-based approaches to governing supply-chains (for example FSC forest certification and crocodile farming) have been around for 20 years and subjected to detailed academic and policy scrutiny. South Africa and other African countries promoting sustainable use have made a compelling case, based on experience, for a legal trade in rhino horn, and have cautioned against mass destruction of ivory stocks. It’s telling that the South African perspective was granted only 20 minutes, with no South African delegates at the highest level meeting. Prince William’s pledge to continue the Royal family’s tradition of supporting the wildlife conservation movement provides a publicity boost. His initiative in forming conservation NGO collaboration United for Wildlife demonstrates a willingness to lead. And the alignment of global security concerns, through the involvement of armed groups with trafficking, with conservation efforts is potentially beneficial. But the fact remains that prohibition of drugs, alcohol and other natural products have a poor record of success. In order to achieve his vision of a truly effective conservation collaboration, all concerned will need to bring together a broader range of insight, expertise, experience and ideas than that."

Guest essay by C. R. Dickson
If the Pope really knows his chemistry, then the people at ClimateProgress better hope he doesn’t read their June 18 article entitled “What Did Actual Scientists Think of the Pope’s Climate Encyclical?” which discusses the scientific accuracy of the Pope’s passages relevant to climate. The article’s picture of a chalkboard used as a background to a bible contains a very incorrect structural formula for an organic molecule. Obviously, scientific accuracy is not very important in their article about scientific accuracy.
Students taking basic high school and college chemistry courses always learn how to draw Lewis structures for molecules. Each “stick” in a molecule represents two shared valence electrons forming a covalent bond. Every element in a molecule (except hydrogen) strives to obtain the stable noble gas configuration of eight electrons or four sticks. Although they are an outdated way of representing molecules, Lewis structures remain in use today because they are so simple.
The organic molecule in question is re-drawn to the right of the stock picture with some colored arrows to highlight some of the problems.

There are ten unwritten carbon atoms in this molecule, one at each vertex of the two hexagons. The red arrow points to a carbon atom that has five sticks or ten electrons on the carbon atom, which is incorrect. The green arrows point to ambiguities that may or may not be incorrect depending upon whether there are additional unwritten hydrogen atoms present. The yellow arrow shows the stick unattached to the hexagon and several ambiguities result. Finally, the OH group should be attached to the molecule with a stick or it should have a minus sign or a dot to indicate whether it is either a negative ion or a free radical.
Climate news articles often have pictures of chalkboards displaying equations, and almost invariably they contain major errors. Next time a chalkboard appears, check it out for the accuracy of the formulas and equations. Most legitimate scientists immediately question the accuracy of an article when they see pictures with incorrect equations. That’s how good scientists work. Wouldn’t it be nice if journalists did the same?

"The destruction and looting of cultural heritage has been intertwined with conflict for thousands of years. To steal an enemies’ treasures, defile their sacred places and burn their cities has been part of war throughout history. And sadly, in the modern battlefields of the ancient world, in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Egypt, and elsewhere, it continues to this day. The Colosseum in Rome, for example, was built using spoils from the sack of the Temple of Jerusalem in AD 70. Many of the Louvre’s collections were “acquired” by Napoleon while rampaging through Europe (albeit later returned). In fact, much of Napoleon’s collection of war booty – acquired during his failed campaign in Egypt – was declared forfeit by the British victors and given to the British Museum under the Treaty of Capitulation of 1801. The Rosetta Stone, which famously enabled the deciphering of the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic script, was acquired through this treaty and is still on display there today. Although antiquities gained widespread public interest throughout the 19th and early 20th century, it was not until the Second World War that the idea of preserving them in conflict finally took hold. As Hitler’s armies advanced across Europe, he saw an opportunity to conquer not only the land and the people, but the cultures of defeated nations. Millions of artistic works and important cultural objects were seized and sent back to Germany, where Hitler took a personal interest in selecting the very best. His new Führermuseum was to be the most spectacular art museum ever built, culled from the cultural riches of the western world. Those in command of the Allied forces were faced with a historical and cultural loss of unprecedented scale. Declaring his support for the protection of the past, the supreme Allied commander, Dwight Eisenhower, said: Inevitably, in the path of our advance will be found historical monuments and cultural centres which symbolise to the world all that we are fighting to preserve. It is the responsibility of every commander to protect and respect these symbols wherever possible. In 1943, the Allied forces approved the formation of a new unit: the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Commission (MFAA). For the first time in history, armies went into the field with officers dedicated to protecting art and monuments during the conflict. It was going to be a tough job. Entire historic quarters in cities such as Warsaw were demolished in days and the artistic treasures of Europe were vanishing.  Just 345 men and women, with no dedicated resources, were tasked with protecting historic buildings, monuments, libraries and archives across the whole of Europe and North Africa. Most were museum staff, art historians, scholars and university professors, yet their success was incredible. They found and returned more than five million stolen objects and artworks and ensured the protection of numerous buildings, often using no more than their own ingenuity. A part of their story is told in the new film, Monuments Men, based on author Robert Edsel’s book of the same name, by the Monuments Men Foundation, and also in the book and ensuing film The Rape of Europa.  In 1951, the MFAA was disbanded as politicians drafted the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, followed by the First Protocol in 1954 and the Second Protocol in 1999 (which extended and clarified the original tenets). The convention protects places and objects “of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people” during conflict. It argues the heritage of all sides should be protected and that warring sides should not use it or its immediate surroundings, nor direct assaults against it. It also granted suitable authority and units for its protection. Crucially, it separates the principles of military necessity from military convenience. Unfortunately, it is not widely adhered to and many of the lessons learned by the MFAA have been forgotten. The Monument Men of today are almost all volunteers. Some are local people, such as the Syrian Association for Preserving Heritage and Ancient Landmarks, who work in Aleppo (a UNESCO World Heritage city) to try and save its monuments and buildings. Individual organisations monitor the situation. Some countries have formed voluntary national Committees of the Blue Shield.  The Blue Shield network was suggested in the Hague Convention and is the cultural equivalent of the Red Cross. It is a group of non-governmental organisations working to protect monuments, sites, museums and archives during and after conflict and natural disasters. Members are drawn from universities, museums and heritage organisations, with advisors from the Red Cross, UNESCO, the military and others. Their objectives are to formulate and lead national and international responses to emergencies that threaten cultural property. They encourage respect for, and protection of, cultural heritage, providing training and advice. Despite the Hague Convention’s mandates, often the only military personnel who engage with cultural heritage protection do so voluntarily. Today, 126 countries have ratified the Hague Convention, although the necessary work is rarely funded and not all the tenets are enforced. The UK has not ratified it, despite the destruction caused by the coalition invasion of Iraq in 2003. In August 2013, chemical weapons were used in Syria and intervention was discussed. Had it happened, the British military is under no obligation to protect, or even consider, any of the thousands of significant sites throughout the country, many of which date back to the earliest achievements of mankind. Protecting cultural property is about more than old books, buildings and fine paintings. Our cultural heritage stands as the symbol of everything humanity has achieved: our finest moments and even our worst atrocities. It is the physical reminder of our past and inspiration for our future. While not every site can be saved, its loss should be a matter of necessity and never convenience. As Eisenhower stated 70 years ago, to fight without even considering it is to sacrifice everything for which we are fighting."

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
A US judge in Anchorage has slapped a massive accumulating fine on Greenpeace of $2500 per hour, rising to $10,000 / hour, for every hour Greenpeace activists block Shell Oil ship MSV Fennica from leaving Portland, to sail for Alaska.
According to Sky News;
A US judge has slapped a $US2,500 ($A3,426.77) fine on Greenpeace for every hour its activists continue to block a Shell Oil ship headed for Alaska on a drilling expedition.
The activists have been hanging from ropes since Wednesday from a bridge in Portland, Oregon’s main city, to prevent the departure of the MSV Fennica, a Shell icebreaker that was in town for repairs.
But federal judge Sharon Gleason in Anchorage, Alaska’s biggest city, ruled in the oil giant’s favour on Thursday, imposing the hourly fine until the protesters withdraw, a court official told AFP.
The fine will increase the longer the protest continues, according to the local KGW News.
Starting at 10am on Friday (0300 AEST on Saturday), Greenpeace will be fined $US5,000 an hour, increasing to $US7,500 an hour on Saturday and $US10,000 an hour from Sunday.

Greenpeace is a massive multi million dollar international organisation, with assets in the 10s of millions, so in principle they could laugh off even a $10,000 / hour fine for at least several weeks before feeling the financial strain. My guess is there may be some interesting discussions occurring now in Greenpeace HQ, about how much money they should burn to make their point.
Update
The MSV Fennica made it past the protestors at 6pm Thursday, according to Oregon Live.
Just before 6 p.m. Thursday, the controversial icebreaker MSV Fennica threaded through a hole cut by law enforcement in the wall of protesters suspended from the St. Johns Bridge.
…
A police Special Emergency Response Team officer rappelled over the bridge and cut the lines connecting the protesters dangling from the bridge. Then Portland Fire Bureau technical rescue teams moved in, with some firefighters going over the bridge’s edge and asking the protesters to voluntarily ease themselves down to waiting boats.
The first two protesters came down on their own but the third wouldn’t communicate. Firefighters connected two rope lines to his lines, removed his anchor and lowered him on their attached lines to a boat.
Their work opened a gap just wide enough for the Fennica’s safe passage.

"Over a month’s worth of rain could fall within two hours on parts of Britain this week, causing flash flooding, while an ongoing heatwave is set to break records. Police and the coastguard issued warnings over the weekend as two people died – a woman after a collision between a jet ski and a boat in north Wales, and a man believed to have drowned in a lake at a Norfolk beauty spot.  Yellow thunderstorm warnings are in place across the country between Monday and Thursday, with the Met Office saying areas affected by potential severe thunderstorms could see “torrential downpours”. “Even in just a couple of hours we could see 80mm of rain falling. That amount of rain in a short amount of time especially when the ground is hot can lead to flash flooding,” the Met Office said, adding that the average rainfall for England during the month of August is around 70mm. While the national weather service said the hot and muggy conditions across the country were perfect for thunderstorms, it added that countrywide warnings had only been put in place because it was not yet possible to predict precisely where they would occur. It was also unable to say whether areas already affected by flooding this year, such as parts of Yorkshire and the Midlands, could fall victim to the downpours. Meanwhile, it added, the country would probably face three days in a row of 35C temperatures – among the longest periods of such heat recorded in the UK. On Friday, a high of 36.4C – the hottest August day in 17 years – was recorded at Heathrow, while the spokeswoman said 36C had been recorded on Saturday and was expected again on Sunday, with Kent, Sussex and parts of London expected to see the highest temperatures. “Seeing temperatures of 35C or more in the UK is rare, but what’s also rare is seeing them lasting for a couple of days or more, and that’s what we’re seeing at the minute,” they added. The phenomenon has occurred three times before – twice during the 1976 heatwave, where three consecutive days of 35C heat were recorded in both June and July, and in August 1990. People flocked to beaches as temperatures soared this weekend, with images on social media showing traffic jams and packed car parks in the UK’s coastal towns. Many people also took to the water. In north Wales, a woman died after a collision between a jet ski and a boat, police said. Emergency services were called to the incident in the area of Menai Bridge, Anglesey, at about 7.30pm on Saturday. A spokesman for North Wales police said: “Officers received a call from the Welsh ambulance NHS trust at 19.29hrs yesterday. One female casualty was transferred to hospital following the incident but has sadly since passed away.” Officers appealed for any witnesses to the incident to contact North Wales Police on 101 quoting reference number Y114906. In Norfolk, police recovered a body from the water at Bawsey Pits – a series of disused sand pits and quarries which has been opened up as a country park – near King’s Lynn, following reports of a man getting into difficulty in the water. Also in Norfolk, a woman died in the sea near Waxham on Sunday afternoon. Supt Jason Broome said: “A woman, aged in her 30s, was recovered from the water and she was sadly pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Her death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious.”  People in Dorset were urged to avoid Lulworth and Durdle Door due to large numbers already in the coastal areas, and officials said they are closing roads to manage traffic. On Saturday, HM Coastguard dealt with 340 incidents across the whole of the UK – the highest number of call-outs in a single day for over four years. The coastguard coordinated search and rescue responses to a wide range of incidents, including people being cut off by the tide and children swept out to sea on inflatables. In total, the service rescued 146 people and assisted a further 371. Thanet district council said Ramsgate Main Sands beach in Kent was “extremely busy”, with high tide likely to make social distancing difficult. Blackpool police also reported local beaches being busy and said they had seen a “larger than usual” number of children going missing. South East Water urged its customers to put away hosepipes, garden sprinklers and garden water toys as it said that a spike in demand had left some people with low water or no water. A leading health expert warned yesterday that it would become highly dangerous to be outdoors if nothing were done to curtail the climate emergency. Ilan Kelman, a professor of disasters and health at University College London, warned that the weather seen through the mini-heatwave, which poses a serious risk to vulnerable people, would become more regular unless action was taken. The Met Office spokeswoman also voiced concerns over the more frequent occurrence of record-breaking temperatures. “The top 10 highest temperatures for the UK have all occurred since 2002,” she said. “It does feel like temperatures are becoming more extreme in the UK – that is likely a result of climate change.” She added that the heat experienced in parts of the UK over the weekend could be particularly difficult for patients recovering from Covid-19, as hot weather can worsen respiratory conditions."
"**Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization (WHO), is something of a superstar these days.**
The entire planet hangs on his every word as he explains, during regular press conferences at WHO headquarters in Geneva, just how widespread the Covid-19 pandemic now is and what countries must do to defeat it.
A who's who of world leaders joined him, virtually, at one of those meetings last month - France's President Emmanuel Macron, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa - all pledging support for the WHO's efforts to end the pandemic, and find a vaccine.
Pop star Lady Gaga turned up a week before that, announcing an online music festival One World Together at Home - with a host of big names from Billy Eilish, to Elton John, to the Rolling Stones.
No other senior UN official, not even the UN Secretary General himself, has ever received so much attention.
Dr Tedros, as he likes to be known, is the first African head of the WHO.
He took office two-and-a-half years ago promising to reform the organisation, and to tackle the illnesses that kill millions each year: malaria, measles, childhood pneumonia, and HIV/Aids.
A certain political wiliness has become apparent too as Dr Tedros faces down more than just the virus itself.
He has weathered bitter criticism - most notably from the US - of his handling of the pandemic, which the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January.
A PHEIC is the WHO's highest level of health emergency. That means it requires 24-hour monitoring, deployment of medical staff, equipment and medicines, daily discussions with affected countries and countries who might be affected, and of course, a steady stream of reliable information for an anxious world desperate for immediate answers.
A huge task for the ""charming"" and ""unassuming"" 55-year-old at the organisation's head.
At his first press conference as WHO director general, the Geneva-based journalists quickly realised Dr Tedros' style would be very different.
He strolled in smiling, sat down and chatted in a very relaxed way, his voice sometimes so quiet it was difficult to hear him. That was a very big change from his more formal predecessor, Margaret Chan.
And yet, behind that quiet manner, there lies a very determined man.
Before becoming head of the WHO, he climbed through the ranks of Ethiopia's government, becoming health minister and then foreign minister. He could not have risen that far by being self-effacing.
Dr Tedros was born in 1965 in Asmara, which became Eritrea's capital after independence from Ethiopia in 1991, and grew up in northern Ethiopia's Tigray region.
One formative, and now motivating experience, was the death of a younger brother, who was around four years old at the time, he told Time magazine in November. Later, as a student, Dr Tedros came to suspect it was measles that killed him.
""I didn't accept it; I don't accept it even now,"" he was quoted as saying, adding that it was unfair that a child should die from a preventable disease just because he was born in the wrong place.
""All roads should lead to universal health coverage. I will not rest until we have met this,"" he told the World Health Assembly shortly before his election as WHO chief.
As the coronavirus pandemic exposes the fragility of even the richest countries' health sectors in a crisis, Dr Tedros and his supporters believe it's the best argument there is for a radical global commitment to universal health coverage.
Dr Tedros became a member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was in the vanguard of the 1991 overthrow of Ethiopia's Marxist dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam.
As a government minister from 2005, he was seen as more approachable and friendly than some of his more austere TPLF comrades.
He has been praised for reforming the health sector and improving access to health care in Ethiopia, Africa's most populous state after Nigeria.
But when he was in charge, his ministry was known to discourage journalists from reporting about suspected cholera cases in the country.
During his highly efficient and ultimately successful campaign to lead the WHO, Dr Tedros' supporters dismissed allegations that he had covered up cholera outbreaks.
That is why ""persuasive"" and ""political"" are also words which crop up regularly when discussing his leadership of the WHO.
He knows that the WHO's success tackling global health crises depends on the co-operation of the organisation's 194 member states.
During the current Ebola outbreak in DR Congo which is also a PHEIC, he has travelled there several times, not just to see the situation but to also talk to government leaders. And he moved quickly to visit Beijing when news of the coronavirus outbreak emerged.
""His strategy is to coax China to transparency and international co-operation rather than criticising the government,"" says Lawrence Gostin, Professor of Global Health Law at Georgetown University.
But has that actually worked?
Some WHO watchers have criticised the effusive praise heaped on China for its containment measures.
After his trip to Beijing, Dr Tedros said China had set ""a new standard for outbreak control"".
A few days later, he told world leaders meeting at the Munich Security Conference that China's actions had ""bought the world time"".
Such comments sit uneasily with the knowledge that China arrested health workers who first raised the alarm about the outbreak.
The US, with President Donald Trump leading the way, has cut its funding to the WHO, saying the organisation botched its efforts to control the pandemic.
Dr Tedros knows very well just how serious the US funding cut is, not just on an immediate financial level, but to the whole UN system, based as it is on a multilateral approach to the world's biggest threats.
He has been careful to say that he ""regrets"" the US decision, and his only mention of Mr Trump was to say he thought the president was handling the US' virus outbreak well.
But that all-star line up of world leaders, in which the US was conspicuous by its absence, was a political masterstroke.
It laid the groundwork for an accelerated development of treatments and vaccines, and promised the resulting medicines would be fairly priced, and available to all.
At the same time it sent a signal to Washington: Look, we're all here getting on with this crisis together, where are you?
So is there any foundation to the US charge that the WHO waited too long to declare a PHEIC?
""I was one of the first to ask him to call a PHEIC,"" says Prof Gostin. ""Having said that, it was only a short delay and I don't think the timing had any impact on the trajectory of Covid-19.""
""I do worry quite a bit however that his effusive praise for China could in the long term tarnish the WHO's reputation as a trusted scientific authority willing to speak truth to power.""
Meg Davis, a global health specialist at Geneva's Graduate Institute, views the WHO's position as an awkward one.
""All my sympathies go to [them], they were in a tough spot,"" she says. ""China was the place where we first saw the outbreak. They [WHO] sent a team to China, wrote generally an accurate report about the things China was doing well.
""But they didn't talk about censorship, or repression of whistleblowersâ¦ and because they didn't do that, they are now having to pay a ridiculous price.""
Now is not the time, says Dr Davis, to start cutting funding.
""At this moment we really need the WHO more than ever. We need a functional well-resourced organisation, to analyse the data and gather evidence of what works.""
So while Dr Tedros may be political, a lot of that political effort seems to be spent reassuring authoritarian, opaque governments, in a bid to get them to work with the WHO to tackle diseases which threaten global health.
When it comes to perceiving how that effort may be viewed by governments in Western democracies, his political skills may not be quite so sharp.
Shortly after taking office he proposed Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president at the time, as a WHO goodwill ambassador, saying he had worked to make Zimbabwe ""a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies"".
Only after days of outrage, not just from governments, but from human rights groups, who pointed to the deprivation that Mr Mugabe's regime had inflicted on its people, did Dr Tedros decide to withdraw his proposal.
It is not the first time the WHO has been in the spotlight for allegedly handling a disease outbreak badly.
Dr Tedros' predecessor Margaret Chan was criticised for a perceived overreaction to the 2010 swine flu outbreak, over which she declared a pandemic and advised countries to spend millions on medicines most did not, in the end, need.
Then she was seen to react far too slowly to West Africa's catastrophic Ebola outbreak, which claimed at least 11,000 lives.
""Damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" is a phrase you often hear at WHO headquarters.
Prof Gostin believes Dr Tedros has become ""the symbol of leadership"" in the course of the coronavirus crisis. But, he warns, the WHO's ""fundamental weaknesses are still there, including pitiful funding"".
The success of Dr Tedros, and the WHO as a whole, at handling the coronavirus will not be really clear until the crisis is over.
For now, he will keep on advising countries to prepare, to diagnose, to trace, and to contain.
And so he continues with his press conferences. He knows they are being watched around the world, in every time zone. He begins each with the words ""Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening"".
Despite the pressure to come up with answers, and despite the constant media spotlight, he remains quiet and friendly.
His only flash of passion came when he was asked, for the umpteenth time, what his response was to the personal criticism of him.
""I don't have extra energy for that,"" he said. ""My focus is on saving lives."""
"From the isolation of entire villages in the flood-hit Somerset Levels to coastal rail tracks falling into the sea at Dawlish in Devon, the economic, social and emotional damage to those hit by extreme weather is likely to be severe and far-reaching. But stormy weather will strike again – perhaps even more frequently and intensely. The effects of extreme weather and storms are part of the natural course of the evolution of coastlines. We should expect that cliffs will retreat, estuaries and low-lying rivers will silt up, and beach ridges of sand and shingle will move. We may intervene to try slow this process, but such efforts come with a high price, both economically and socially. Nobody wants to see communities suffering because of flooding. But decisions taken during emergencies are often only remediation, short-term solutions which attend only to immediate needs. These include dredging rivers, improving pumping stations, piling on sandbags or adding rocks or concrete as coastal defence. But these will not prevent coastal erosion or flooding in the future. Flooding is the most frequently occurring and damaging natural hazard worldwide. In 2010, it affected 178m people and caused losses exceeding US$40 billion. While the risk of death from flooding has declined over the last two decades, the exposure of people and economic assets to natural hazards is increasing. In the UK, for example, more than 2m properties were estimated to be at risk from flooding in 2004. In 2009, the Environment Agency estimated that 5.2m properties were at risk from flooding in England alone. This increase is due to both increased occupation of flood-prone areas and improved risk assessment methods. Climate change and poor urban planning are likely to increase flood risk in the future. The first by affecting local rainfall patterns and enhancing the potential for extreme weather events, and the latter by placing people and critical infrastructure in areas prone to flooding and erosion. Policies have been implemented to regulate how development takes place in flood risk areas, but with an unrelenting pressure for an increase in housing, local authorities are often more keen to build than they are to reduce flood risk. In light of climate change and the predictions of further bad weather, it’s time to rethink priorities and consider the long-term consequences of planning decisions. Flood defences are in urgent need of upgrading to cope with urban development, higher sea levels and more frequent and intense extreme weather. But irrespective of how much money is spent, it is impossible to protect everyone at all times in high-risk areas. If you don’t want to be at risk from flooding, you should start thinking about moving out from the floodplain or low-lying coastal areas. If you don’t want to be affected by cliff retreat, you should move away from the cliff top. The ultimate consequence of climate change to society is that we cannot continue living the way we did in the past. If you live in an environment that is changing, you need to adapt to these conditions and adopt measures that will make you more resilient. This inevitably involves changing attitudes and taking responsibility for the way we live. Many will blame climate change for the extreme events, and the government for not doing enough to reduce the extent and impact of flooding. But most of us will not consider what each one of us can do to become more resilient to the impact of similar, or more intense, weather in the future. Unfortunately, we only question what could have been done better or differently during major crises. This distorts the debate and clouds the real issues, more often than not leading to rushed decisions and ineffective, short-term emergency works. Human interventions have changed our coasts, rivers and landscape immensely and these impacts are far more significant than what can be attributed to climate change. You can blame the government for development in flood plains and high-risk coastal areas, but ultimately where you live is your decision."

Shane Jones is a bit of a rascal, and it is hard to fault him when he attacks Greenie Wombles. He’s given them a serve over opposition to a Wairarapa dam proposal:



[…] my colleague, the deputy leader of our party Fletcher Tabuteau the secretary – he’s been in Wairarapa doing something that’s overdue – announcing the seven-odd million dollar contribution to water storage and water proofing the Wairarapa.



Now this has attracted a great deal of criticism from Greenpeace. **I’ve had a gutsful of these aphid lovers. They don’t seem to understand in the hierarchy of economic, social, customary and environmental interests – human beings are never, ever going to play second fiddle to aphids.** I just really despair. This lobby with their well-organised, well-funded attacks on rural industries are getting worse and they seem to misconstrue where the Kiwi spirit is actually heading.



We all realise that the climate is changing and weather is becoming more difficult to manage, but unless we future-proof and start to store water and adapt to changing circumstances then it’s difficult to see how I as a politician can assist rural New Zealand.



So **every time Greenpeace bellows, I tend to do the opposite.**



Onya Jonesy, keep slapping the “aphid lovers”. He doesn’t hold back on Mike Joy either when asked about him by Hamish Mackay:



Look, I personally have never met this character Mike Joy. I know that he fell out with Prime Minister John Key. But he has no mandate to continue to stigmatise and demonise rural New Zealand. **He strikes me as some sort of Jerry Springer character. Some faculty fusspot who wants to enjoy the celebrity side of constantly being interviewed.**



I say to Mike Joy, **if you want politics, hang up your academic spurs and join the fray. Other than that, stop auditioning as some sort of university-orientated Jerry Springer character.** I don’t know the chap, but I like my scientists in the dispassionate form. Kind of like friends of the court.



 **The reason I’m losing confidence in a lot of the scientific commentary on environmental matters is they’ve become far too shrill and their agenda is to close down rural industries** – and **until my dying political breath, I will stand against them.**



So I don’t know the chap but **he certainly is a killjoy isn’t he** in terms of economic development.



There can be no misunderstanding there. But Jonesy continues against academics:



[…] look our ancestors created dams, obviously the Benmore Dam, that’s why we’re able to boast internationally that we’ve got clean, green energy in a huge proportion. So if we took his view, we would continue to allow all the water to flow down the rivers and into the Pacific Ocean.



Look the man is entitled to his view, but **his view in my view has no credibility in terms of future-proofing and boosting the sustainability of rural New Zealand**. I thoroughly understand that he’s got an academic background but **I find that a lot of academics – they’re not practical people.**



Spot on. Academics these days tend to be vocal against almost anything. They certainly seem to be a bunch of lemon-sucking negative people.



Dams have their place, but they have to make both economic and environmental sense. Jonesy is right, if Benmore was attempted today it would never get past the Resource Management Act. Ruataniwha in the Hawkes Bay was also different. That project never made economic sense, it also didn’t make environmental sense and worse still was going to require the stealing of a good part of protected Conservation land to benefit a small commercial group.



The one thing Greenpeace, **Mike Joy** and other politically active academics never tell us is what they would approve of. They always demand taxes, or bans or other miserable potential solutions to the worst things their fevered imaginations dream up. They almost always ascribe negative and pejorative descriptions of the people they oppose and the actions that are proposed. Mark my words, **Greenpeace** and Mike Joy will come out and label Shane Jones as being in the pockets of “Big Dairy”. They always use ‘Big’ to slander their opponents because usually, their ‘small’ ideas are simply to oppose for the sake of opposing. 



Occasionally it’s good to see them get a beat down.

[PA Pundits – International ](https://papundits.wordpress.com/2020/01/03/green-civil-war-in-germany/)



The stage is set for a big fight between two green Titans — the Green Party of Germany and Greenpeace Germany. They sound similar and used to be so, but no longer. When it comes to climate change, Greenpeace is a leading Action Now! radical group, while the Green Party is becoming ever more moderate. This is clearly a prescription for political conflict.



These are two big outfits. Germany is the fourth biggest national economy in the world and by far the greenest major. In the last national election, the Green Party got almost 10% of the vote and recent polls suggest this could get much bigger, more than double in some cases. So the Greens are seen as an emerging political powerhouse.



Greenpeace Germany is also politically powerful, with annual revenues on the order of 100 million dollars. They rival Greenpeace International, which has the rest of the world, in size. Both Greenpeaces are leading hysterics in the Action Now! radical political movement. Both are calling for disruption and Germany reportedly has seen more and bigger Greta Thunberg marches than anywhere else.



The Green Party is becoming progressively more moderate for the fundamental political reason; they want more votes. There is even speculation that Robert Habeck, the personable Green Party co-boss, might be the next Chancellor of Germany. He would replace Angela Merkel, who has been known as “the Climate Chancellor.” After all, Merkel’s ruling coalition is crumbling and the Green Party is coming on strong, at least in the polls. (The new German anti-green populist party is also growing in power, so some of this speculation may be well off.)



In recent weeks, Habeck has gone so far as to explicitly renounce key policies of the Action Now! radicals. For example, he has said that people should be free to fly or eat meat if they want to. He knows perfectly well that these radical demands are vote killers.



Up to now the Green Party and Greenpeace Germany seem each to pretend that the other does not exist. The Party’s visible slide to moderation has been well discussed in the press but I have yet to see an article on it that mentions Greenpeace. Habeck certainly does not, lest he goad the radical green beast into action. Greenpeace could easily denounce Habeck, but have not yet done so.



Perhaps they have a political understanding. Greenpeace Germany may well think that the Green Party’s victory is more important than the extreme climate actions it espouses. They probably figure that they will get a big place in the new green government if there ever is one. If so they are sitting on a powder keg of hypocrisy



2020 is set to be the year of heated, even violent, rhetorical battles over climate policy, including in Germany. It may well be that at some point Greenpeace Germany will have to draw the line against the Green Party’s growing moderation. As Greenpeace said in Madrid when COP 25 collapsed: “Getting no deal is better than getting a bad deal.” They rejected the moderates then and they can do it again.



In fact, rejecting moderation is central to the Action Now! mission. Greta Thunberg does it repeatedly. After all, this is precisely what “Action Now!” means, no more slow moving moderate action on climate change.



If and when this Green versus Green breakup occurs, it should be spectacular. Given the German situation, the Green Party will be fighting for its political life, while Greenpeace will be fighting for its dearly held principles. Both sides are powerful and well entrenched.



Germany could be where the most spectacular battle between the climate radicals and the climate moderates takes place. Sort of like Northern Virginia in the U.S. Civil War, where Grant and Lee hammered it out, except in Germany both sides could lose (to the sceptics).



If the misguided climate action movement is going to tear itself apart, which seems increasingly likely, Germany could be where it happens most definitively, and most publicly. That will be truly fun to watch.



The stage is set; let the show begin. Stay tuned to CFACT for coverage.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s annoying enough watching green-preaching, limousine liberals go public and demand ordinary people scale back their lives to protect the environment and climate, and then scoot away on a private jet – or mega-yacht. For example, see here, here, here, here, here and here.

But what is really infuriating is seeing billionaires recklessly and senselessly rip up and destroy coral reef as they indulge in the forbidden profligacy. Coral reefs, after all, are said to be crucial for the very survival of the world’s ecosystem – or something like that.
Democrat Jeff Greene
Back in 2010, while reporting on John Kerry’s environmental hypocrisy, NTZ mentioned how billionaire Democrat Jeff Greene’s three-story, 145-foot luxury yacht, Summerwind, maneuvered above the famous barrier reef along the coast of Belize and dropped anchor, causing irreparable damage. Despite all the (little people) witnesses, Greene denies the incident. Read about it here as well.
The tampabay.com reports that Greene’s Summerwind had a fuel consumption of 50 gallons an hour, adding:
Greene bought Summerwind in 2003, registering it in the Marshall Islands, a well-known tax haven. The yacht has traveled across the world, hosting Greene, family members and celebrities including Lindsay Lohan.

Now, just days ago, Reuters here reports that Greene may be not alone in the suspected, ultra-exclusive billionaire mega-yachting coral reef destruction club. Hat-tip DirkH.
Paul Allen’s yacht alleged rips up 14,000 sq. ft.
Allegedly joining Greene is billionaire Microsoft Corp co-founder Paul Allen, whose “massive luxury yacht…destroyed most of a protected coral reef during a visit to the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean earlier this month”.
And why on earth was the yacht on its way to the Cayman Islands? Gee, what a mystery. That aside, Reuters reports on the yacht belonging to the environmentally active Allen:
An anchor chain from the vessel damaged nearly 14,000 square feet (1,300 square meters), or about 80 percent, of reef near two scuba diving sites in the West Bay”.
According to the report, Allen’s yacht is a 300+ foot 5-deck unit, with helicopter pads for ferrying passengers and guests.
Environmental cheapskates
You’d think the deep-pocketed billionaires would feel a bit beat up about the damage and simply pay out the pocket-change dimensioned fines and be done with it. But Reuters writes that the billionaires are also environmental cheapskates: “…the Cayman government has been unable to collect fines after a number of similar incidents over the last few years.”

There’s no bow too long for the screeching ninnies of climate alarmism to draw. Climate change has already been blamed for everything from a surplus of prostitutes to a shortage of maple syrup.



Worse, though, is the unseemly haste with which green zealots rush to exploit any tragedy. The smoke from Australia’s bushfires is yet to clear, but already Tim Flannery’s climate muppet show is Chicken-Little screeching that “You’re all gonna die!”



But, like almost everything that spews from the donations-desperate Climate Council, that’s egregious, uninformed nonsense.



You may have read several articles recently about the effects of bushfire smoke on your body.



Health experts have warned that smoke particles can aggravate conditions like asthma, and even trigger heart attacks or strokes.



Others compare the exposure to smoking several cigarettes a day.



This is precisely the kind of shrieking nonsense [being peddled by the Climate Council](https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/federal-governments-burning-silence-threatening-australians-health/).



But is that comparison fair and accurate?



The Australian Institute of Sport’s chief medical officer, David Hughes, does not think so.



“It is really about the concentration of particulate matter, particularly PM 2.5s, which are the particles which have the most detrimental effect in smoky air,” he said.



“There is a mathematical equation which says that, if that [pollution] is at a certain level, it can be the equivalent to smoking a certain number of cigarettes.



“But those sorts of measures and comparisons are imprecise.”



The chemicals inhaled when smoking a cigarette are much more toxic and harmful than what is found in bushfire smoke.



Also, when you smoke a cigarette, you deliberately suck its chemical cocktail deep into your lungs.



So, typical of the sort of Flannery flim-flam we’ve so sadly become used to, it’s a farrago of bad science and egregious scaremongering.



Dr Hughes said the smoke levels in south-east Australia were dangerous, but they would not cause the same long-term health problems as air pollution in countries like India and China.



“Generally speaking, the smoke from burning, even though it is not good for our health, is less harmful than industrial pollution,” he said.



Dr Hughes said most of the harm caused by bushfire smoke would be short-lived…”Generally, most healthy people will recover without any long-term effects.”



In fact, as we see repeatedly in these sort of disasters, green scare-mongering is by far the deadliest threat.



Nonetheless, the fire crisis’s ill effects are not limited to physical health.



Canberra mother Louise Grace said the weeks of thick smoke stoked deep fears about her eight-month-old son, Eric…”I’ve been lying awake until midnight worrying about how he’s coping.”



The ACT’s chief psychiatrist, Denise Riordan, said this type of anxiety could be traumatic, but was manageable.



For a start, stop listening to zealous idiots like the Climate Council and the left-media.

What’s going in Europe? Are we witnessing another historic retreat into scientific barbarism?



How else to explain three disturbing irrationalities in recent times: distortion of genetic science resulting in massive African starvation; perseveration on a global warming treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, which Europe knows will have no effect on climate; and the public show trial of Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg, for writing a book that reveals what they already knew about Kyoto.



A glance at a world map shows Europe to be a pretty small place compared to the rest of the world that is chomping genetically engineered corn and soybeans or their by‐​products (like that plate of ribs) with reckless abandon. On Kyoto, Europe lost a critical referendum last year when radical green Robert Watson was voted out as head of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. On Lomborg, well, Denmark is even smaller than Europe.



Each of these stories merits elaboration, as each represents a triumph of irrationality in the face of some pretty obvious science‐​all with disastrous consequences.



In response to pressure from the European Community, and in the face of a terrible famine, Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa refused to allow the distribution of 27,000 tons of genetically modified corn. Mwanawasa chose to starve his people because Europe was afraid that some of the corn would be planted, and the genes would “escape,” contaminating subsequent corn that could then not be exported to the Continent. Never mind that “outbreeding” is extremely rare and that it doesn’t matter anyway. Europe eschews genetically engineered corn to protect its own, more inefficient varieties, propping up the local price. 



U.S. trade representative Robert Zoellick minced no words, calling Zambia’s action “immoral” and “Luddite.” Not being diplomatic, I’ll add another: “murder.” The main genetic modification is the insertion of genetic material from Bacillus thuringensis, which is lethal to the European Corn Borer, requiring much less use of much more expensive (and, to some, distasteful) pesticides. Organic gardeners in the United States sprinkle this bacterium everywhere as a natural pest control. 



While genetic scare stories abound, hyped by European greens, the experiment has already been run. American agriculture and consumers prosper because of genetic engineering, with no demonstrable negative effect (except lower corn and soybean prices because of abundant production).



The Kyoto and Lomborg stories are related. In his book, “The Skeptical Environmentalist,” Lomborg demonstrated that planetary warming is likely to be at the low end of projections, and that Kyoto wouldn’t do anything measurable to stop it. Every serious scientist knows the basis of his argument: Kyoto really doesn’t reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide much, observed increases in this gas are falling far beneath the dire predictions made only 10 years ago, and warming has been modest. Because the tendency of most sophisticated climate models is to produce a constant (not increasing) rate of warming, we therefore have a good idea of how much it will warm, a mere three‐​quarters of a degree Celsius in the next 50 years. Variants of this calculation have been repeated in at least three separate instances in the refereed scientific literature.



In response, the Danish “Committees on Scientific Dishonesty” accused Lomborg of “scientific dishonesty.” Did they cite one fact that he had gotten wrong? No. His crime? He failed to endorse the pro‐​Kyoto insanity. He refused to act irrationally.



One Kyoto would reduce U.S. GDP by about 2 percent per year, depending upon assumptions. The 20‐​or‐​so Kyotos that European greens say are necessary? Do the math. U.S. capital is precisely what is required for investment in the miserable, starving, death‐​ridden world of Africa. As an example, the less we invest in things like clean power plants and water treatment facilities, the more they die from the complications of indoor smoke inhalation from cooking fires and water‐​borne diseases. Together, these kill millions‐​while Kyoto does nothing and takes away that capital. 



The Danish “Committees” cited not one scientific finding against Lomborg. Instead, they referred to four anti‐​Lomborg essays published in Scientific American by known environmental ideologues, which themselves have been heavily criticized. Lomborg was allowed no defense. 



He’s got an issue now. He’s been blackballed. No more government research money for him. The Danish “Committees” citing Scientific American as evidence have irrevocably damaged his reputation. 



Should Lomborg sue Scientific American as the ultimate cause of this damage? The result would be a highly publicized trial that would reveal for all the descent of Europe into yet another scientific Dark Age, as well as the bullyboy tactics that are now rising in America to quash rational scientific dissent. He may have a case.

"As a parallel to fuel poverty, where the cost of heating and lighting accounts for 10% of a household’s income, the RAC Foundation has suggested a similar idea of transport poverty. And while Britain’s rate of fuel poverty is high – at five million households, only Estonia is higher – this is dwarfed by the 21m households that spend more than 10% of their income on transportation. In fact, for the average household transport is the single biggest cost. According to research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, this issue is particularly heightened in rural areas, where a lack of transport can be a serious problem. Here, public transport provision is piecemeal, so restricted as to be inadequate, frequently expensive, and a major barrier to accessing public services, employment – even social contact. At the same time, many essential services are spread out in such a way that walking or cycling is arduous or impossible – running a vehicle is all but essential. In the face of all this, the study found that the more remote the location, the greater the expense of running a car. A minimum standard of living is said to cost £14,400 a year in cities, £15,600 in a rural town, £17,900 in a village and £18,600 in the most remote hamlets or countryside. A recent report from Sustrans suggests residents of rural areas in at least half the UK’s local authorities are at high risk of being cut off from jobs, healthcare and leisure facilities. So transport poverty leaves behind those who cannot afford to run a car; social mobility requires automobility. According to the RAC, in rural areas 79% of journeys are by car, compared with 65% nationally, with rural mileage reaching on average 8,450 miles per year, compared to an average of 5,551 miles per year overall. Being so dependent on it, those in the country will persist with their cars for longer in the face of rising costs – because they have to, in many cases for the most essential work and shopping. Urban drivers on the other hand feel much more able to jettison the car if they feel it over-stretches their finances, given their city advantages of frequent buses, or journeys within range of walking or cycling, and all without loss of services. Faced with cost that can’t be met, rural drivers are faced with a Hobson’s choice of uprooting and moving to the city, or putting themselves in financial dire straights. These facts makes it all the more satisfying that this month the pioneering rural car club run by Talybont-on-Usk Energy reaches its fourth birthday. The group, which has been involved since 2006 in local sustainability projects such as hydro-electricity generation, calculated that personal transport accounted for 40% of their carbon footprint. Because of the isolated location of the village and the distances that must be travelled to do pretty much anything, they found nearly every household owned a car (and many ran two or more). It is generally assumed that car sharing schemes operate in urban areas where it is a means to reduce traffic and pollution. But using money generated from the community hydro-electric scheme, the group bought two vehicles to set up their own, countryside service: an electric van, christened Huelwen (“sunshine”), and a diesel car nicknamed Mr Chips, on account of how it can be run on recycled vegetable oil collected from local cafes and pubs. In a village of fewer than 300 households 15 households are taking part, with charges set to ensure the vehicles’ insurance, maintenance, fuel and electricity costs are covered. While costs may be roughly comparable to running a privately owned car for the same journey, that it can be hired by the journey and without the additional risks and responsibilities of long-term ownership gives access to people that could not otherwise afford to buy and maintain one themselves. Though no users have yet been able to give up running a car, the potential of such a scheme is clear. With an electric car, the club also provides a form of sustainable mobility typically considered prohibitively expensive to buy. While not an answer to rural transport poverty, this model provides residents with a socially sustainable, environmentally sustainable, affordable access to transport and the benefits that come with it. This is a straightforward model that could be adopted in more rural communities, provided adequate funding sources can be drawn upon, as has happened in other Welsh regions such as Pembrokeshire. These are grassroots projects, showing that approaches to sustainability often emerge from ordinary people working together. There are other models that include roles for commercial operators and the public sector. Car hire schemes are increasingly popular, with firms such as Zipcar reaching the UK, and new players such as E-Car with providing entirely electric fleet. Though typically located in big cities, these firms have recognised the demand from isolated rural residents. Also in Wales, car pooling has seen huge growth, measured by the success of services such as carpooling.co.uk. The RAC Foundation has called for more support from the public sector. Subsidies would recognise that car hire is typically used by the more affluent while the less well off need it most. But also public involvement could properly integrating hire schemes with public transport. When local stories about rural bus cuts make the national press, it’s clear there’s a problem. Imaginative solutions such as the on-demand bus service are promising but need to be complimented by some form of shared car scheme, at least for the time being. It’s important that this issue rises up the agenda. Like fuel poverty, transport poverty should not be allowed to blight people’s lives. The automobile was supposed to liberate, not enslave us, so we must work harder to ensure that the system of cars and roads we appear wedded to works for the benefit of all."
"**Ethiopia's prime minister has given forces in the northern region of Tigray 72 hours to surrender as government troops advance on the capital, Mekelle.**
Abiy Ahmed told Tigrayan leaders they were ""at a point of no return"".
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the mountainous region, has vowed to keep fighting.
The conflict has reportedly killed hundreds and displaced thousands in recent weeks. The UN has warned it could trigger a humanitarian crisis.
Earlier the Ethiopian military warned Mekelle's 500,000 residents that the army would ""encircle"" the city and attack it with artillery fire.
""There will be no mercy,"" a spokesman said.
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters news agency that his forces had managed to stall advancing federal troops.
""They [are] sending waves after waves but to no avail,"" he told Reuters news agency.
The government said its troops took over some key towns last week. However, information is difficult to confirm and claims cannot be independently verified because phone and internet connections have been down since the beginning of the conflict.
In a statement on Sunday aimed at the TPLF leadership, Mr Abiy said: ""Your journey of destruction is coming to an end, and we urge you to surrender peacefully within the next 72 hours, recognising you are at a point of no return. Take this last opportunity.""
Mr Abiy said TPLF forces should ""surrender peacefully"" and that the population of Mekelle should support government forces ""in bringing this treasonous group to justice"".
On Friday, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the African Union chairman, announced the appointment of three former presidents to broker talks to end the conflict.
But Ethiopia has rejected the offer because it sees the operation as an internal ""law enforcement"" mission.
""We don't negotiate with criminals... We bring them to justice, not to the negotiating table,"" Mamo Mihretu, a senior aide to Mr Abiy, told the BBC.
""Our African brothers and sisters would play a more significant role if they put pressure on TPLF to surrender and for that, you know, nobody needs to go to Tigray or Mekelle to make that point clear to them.""
Mr Mamo said that former leaders from Mozambique, Liberia, and South Africa - who are due to arrive in the country in the coming days - would not be able to visit Tigray because of the ongoing military operation.
Communication and transport services has been severely hampered since fighting broke out.
Mr Mamo said that the government was doing its ""utmost"" to allow UN agencies to provide assistance to people in Tigray.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, tensions escalated. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing that Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate.
On 4 November the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle.
The TPLF has rejected the claims.
Its fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number 250,000.
Aid agencies have no access to the conflict zone, but they fear that thousands of civilians may have been killed since fighting erupted at the beginning of November.
At least 33,000 refugees have already crossed into Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
On Friday, the TPLF was accused of firing rockets into the city of Bahir Dar in the neighbouring Amhara region. The Amhara government said there were no casualties and no damage caused.
But the reported incident in Amhara, which has a long-running border dispute with Tigray, has raised concerns that the conflict could extend into a wider war after regional forces were sent to support federal troops.
Meanwhile, the UN has raised concerns about the influx of refugees into Sudan, which it says could destabilise a nation already supporting about a million people displaced from other African countries.
Many of the refugees arriving in Sudan are believed to be children. Aid agencies say an immediate ceasefire would allow them to help thousands of civilians still trapped inside Ethiopia.
Aid agencies are appealing for $50m (Â£38m) for food and shelter for the new arrivals.
**1\. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region.** Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires.
**2\. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site.** The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant.
**3\. Most people in Tigray are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.** The region's Christian roots stretch back 1,600 years.
**4\. The region's main language is Tigrinya** , a Semitic dialect with at least seven million speakers worldwide.
**5\. Sesame is a major cash crop** , exported to the US, China and other countries."

A scientist / journalist shares his story of a sting operation on the scientific publishing process with frightening results.
Howard Booth writes:
An interesting sting was done on scientific publishing to show how remarkably easy it is to get published despite doing a poor research project (in this case on purpose).  John Bohannon, a PhD chemist and science journalist, was contracted to do a documentary for German television on the poor research in nutrition that produces outlandish claims about diet and dietary supplements.  They conspired to create a research study intended to produce fantastic results, and see how often their poor research would get called out through the entire publishing process.
The study had a terrible sample size, poor quality control, and zero peer review.  They managed to produce factually correct results that made an outlandish claim, write it up, get it published (with their choice of venues as many offered to pick it up), and get it splashed into the media with virtually no challenge to their methodology.  It was picked up by several noteworthy outlets and on track to get picked up by Men’s Health magazine, but no doubt John’s confession of the sting will forestall that.
I know that WUWT is primarily concerned with CAGW, but I thought this was an interesting peek into the terrible state of the scientific publishing process, and the media’s inability to hold scientists accountable.

avoid using tariffs and other trade barriers to encourage the repatriation of medical supply chains;



avoid adopting “Buy American” rules to limit government procurement of medical supplies and equipment to domestic sources;



avoid subsidizing businesses to produce items that are already being produced domestically or abroad;



avoid legislation and regulations that give preferences to domestically produced over foreign produced goods and services;



avoid legislation and regulations that restrict exports;



recognize that diversification is the optimal response to uncertainty and that forced supply chain repatriation is its antithesis;



recognize that international trade makes us richer by allowing us to specialize and that restrictions on trade, investment, and migration make us poorer; and

twitter #CatoCOVID



Beyond its severe toll on human life, public health, and people’s livelihoods and aspirations, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in routines that we have long assumed were reliable and safe. Out of necessity, we are reconsidering how we work, learn, transact, collaborate, and socialize.



This kind of stock‐​taking may point us toward new and better ways of doing things—provided we succeed at purging bad ideas in the process. Among the ideas most in need of purging is that the pandemic laid bare the intolerable risks of globalization, which must be reined in once and for all.



Proponents of retrenchment see cross‐​border trade, investment, and migration not as liberating, life‐​enhancing, and wealth‐​creating but as vectors across which a local outbreak became a global pandemic. Moreover, they argue that the pandemic revealed the dangers of relying on foreigners. When the time came for global supply chains to show their mettle by getting protective gear and medical equipment to where it was needed as quickly as possible, foreign governments encouraged hoarding and imposed export restrictions, which created supply shortages in the United States.



There is no denying that contracting and spreading novel viruses is easier in an interconnected global economy. After all, COVID-19 originated abroad and was brought to the United States by visitors and returning Americans engaging in various forms of international trade. But it is also true that the international collaboration that is very much needed to contain and subdue SARS‐​CoV‐​19, the virus that causes COVID-19, is made possible by that same interconnectedness.



International trade and cross‐​border investment produce some degree of reliance and risk, but in policymakers’ rush to indict trade and globalization, they dismiss the enormous benefits that Americans get from participating in the global economy as workers, consumers, producers, and investors. Those benefits would be casualties of a protectionist overreaction that would make us poorer, more vulnerable, and less resilient.



Americans are easily deluded into thinking we can go it alone because the U.S. economy is the world’s largest.



While most Americans favor trade and trade agreements, we have a tendency to assume that we can be self‐​sufficient and that the United States is big enough to provide everything we need—all our commodities, food, manufactured goods, and services. Americans are easily deluded into thinking we can go it alone because the U.S. economy is the world’s largest. In fact, so big is the U.S. economy that the United States can be the world’s largest trading nation but still be the world’s third least dependent on trade. The value of U.S. goods and services trade (imports plus exports) in 2019 amounted to $5.9 trillion, which was 27.5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) of $21.4 trillion. That ratio for China was 38.2 percent last year, and the world average was 59.5 percent.



Indeed, the U.S. economy is big enough that Americans could probably endure autarky longer than people in other countries, but the experience would be profoundly costly and immiserating—something that holds true regardless of the size of the economy. The costs would not purchase more jobs or more security. They would only make us poorer by forcing us to divert resources to produce things that we can currently import more cost effectively. This is the case for small, medium, and large economies. Moreover, 95 percent of the world’s consumers and potential supply chain collaborators live outside the United States. We haven’t come close to realizing the potential benefits of deeper and broader global integration.



Yet, policymakers from both sides of the aisle dangle the goal of national self‐​sufficiency in response to the alleged scourge of globalization. Many seem amenable to top‐​down edicts to promote self‐​sufficiency by making international trade and collaboration more expensive. The Trump administration, the Biden campaign, and congressional leadership all support proposals to repatriate supply chains, restrict government procurement spending to goods and services produced domestically, impose tariffs to prevent reliance on imports, and subsidize domestic production of everything from pharmaceutical ingredients to personal protective equipment to semiconductors. Those are all mistaken policy pursuits.



The _economic_ case for free trade has stood strong for nearly two and a half centuries. When individuals are free to focus their productive efforts on what they do best, aggregate output is greater than it would be if everyone attempted to produce all the goods and services each needs or wants. We each specialize so that we can produce more collectively, but specialization is feasible _only if_ people are free to exchange their output.



Without knowing the first thing about making clothing, building houses, growing crops, or treating illnesses, a software engineer can focus exclusively on developing, writing, and debugging code—producing software—and then use some of his output (monetized in the form of a salary) to purchase clothes, food, medical care, and housing. If exchange were not possible, there would be no scope for specialization because everyone would have to allocate their time into suitable increments to try to produce as much of the things they need or want to consume. Imagine how much poorer we would be—in terms of unmet needs and wants—if we had to toil in the tasks of self‐​sufficiency every day.



Pandemic or not, these facts make the irrefutable economic case for free and inclusive trade. We trade to enable us to specialize. We specialize so that we can produce more in the aggregate. We produce more so that we can consume and save more. Expanding trade across international borders to include more people and enable economies of scale in production is the wellspring of wealth creation and higher living standards.



Trade is an economic endeavor; trade policy—in contrast—is very much a political exercise. The latter is more concerned with how the larger pie created through trade gets divided. Sometimes those political efforts lead to trade barriers, which end up reducing the size of the pie.



Of course, expanding trade isn’t entirely risk‐​free. Trade means interdependence, which implies reliance on others for certain goods and services. Protectionists and nationalists rarely pass on the opportunity to portray imports as constituting a dangerous reliance on foreign sources—a risk to national security. The pandemic has provided them a fresh excuse for an old argument.



When we restrict trade, we specialize less, produce less, and consume and save less. We become poorer.



In cases where trade may present legitimate risks to public health or our security, it may be prudent to consider measures that may reduce the risk, including trade restrictions. But we must remember that in addition to the immediate costs of those measures are the unseen, longer‐​term costs. When we restrict trade, we specialize less, produce less, and consume and save less. We become poorer.



COVID-19 hit when international trade and other aspects of globalization were already under sustained attack from the ideological left and right. The left sees globalization as multinational businesses gaming the system, running roughshod over democratic governance, and limiting the scope for domestic policy and regulatory experimentation. The right sees globalization as an invitation to overreaching global government to bleed America’s national sovereignty. In both cases, the concern is about loss of local control. Sometimes that concern is disingenuous. After all, blaming imports, outsourcing, and foreigners for the country’s home‐​grown economic and social problems is a time‐​tested tactic of U.S. politicians. It’s a tactic that’s been elevated to an art form in President Trump’s nationalist “America First” gospel, which borrows heavily from the protectionist hymnals of the left.



Our COVID-19 experience counsels that we develop proactive and prudent public health measures to reduce the likelihood of massive transmissions of deadly viruses, but it makes no case for global retrenchment. If the risks of relying on foreign firms for critical medical supplies and equipment are too much to bear, then diversification of sourcing may be a reasonable response. Diversification is the optimal response to uncertainty. That said, claims that the United States is too dependent on China or anyone else for items necessary to secure public health and national security are vastly overblown. Regardless, using laws and regulations to compel repatriation of supply chains is not diversification. It is a textbook example of putting all eggs in one basket.



Protectionists and nationalists have seized upon the pandemic as an opportunity to portray globalization as the culmination of years of promiscuous policies—comeuppance for U.S. internationalists who sold out America and “shipped jobs overseas.” The pandemic, in this telling, is the final straw and a ripe opportunity to right the wrongs of the past few decades. Central to their story are fallacies and misunderstandings about the nature of trade and whom it benefits.



Protectionists and nationalists portray trade as a zero‐​sum competition between “Us” and “Them” and argue that we are losing the game. They see exports as Team America’s points, imports as the foreign teams’ points, the trade account as the scoreboard, and the deficit on that scoreboard as proof that the United States is losing at trade.



Of course, trade is not a zero‐​sum game. National trade statistics reflect the aggregated daily decisions of millions of people, who exchange on terms that both parties find acceptable: the definition of win‐​win. But protectionists claim that purchasing imports constitutes leakage in the economy. They say that dollars that could have been spent domestically to support U.S. workers and the U.S. economy are instead diverted abroad at great cost. Cheaper foreign goods, they argue, may provide some short‐​term satisfaction to the consumer, but they subvert the U.S. economy.



Buying cheap T‐​shirts, they moralize, may save you a couple dollars but cannot be justified when it causes fellow Americans to lose their jobs. But that logic reflects an attenuated understanding of how trade works. Lower prices are not the objective of international trade. Rather, lower prices are the transmission mechanism through which trade’s benefits are delivered. When consumers can buy cheaper T‐​shirts, they have more resources to purchase other products and services or to save, which funds innovation and entrepreneurship and underpins economic growth and wealth creation. The process explains how a new business in Texas gets a loan and begins operating some 6–18 months after a T‐​shirt factory shutters in Georgia, even though the resources for the startup aren’t easily traced to the elimination of tariffs on clothing. Meanwhile, the dollars sent abroad to purchase imports always find their way back into the U.S. economy via foreigners’ purchases of U.S. exports and assets, which both underpin economic growth and job creation in the United States.



Without access to output from the rest of the world, Americans would suffer lower real incomes and consume and save less. Before long, the reduced spending and savings would retard innovation and the emergence of new, dynamic firms to challenge incumbents, which is essential to replenishing the economy. It is this creation that justifies the destruction of the T‐​shirt jobs.



Another article of faith among those who argue for supply chain repatriation and import substitution is that trade and globalization killed U.S. manufacturing. Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, they say that requiring the production of pharmaceutical ingredients and critical medical supplies stateside would give U.S. manufacturing the shot in the arm it needs. But that idea is wrong.



U.S. manufacturing has thrived during recent decades of increased openness to trade and cross‐​border investment. Excepting cyclical and pandemic‐​induced recessions, real manufacturing output reaches new heights almost every year. In 1953, when the manufacturing sector’s share of U.S. GDP was at its highest (28.1 percent), total manufacturing value‐​added amounted to $110 billion. Today, manufacturing’s $2.4 trillion in value‐​added accounts for only 11 percent of U.S. GDP. In other words, the manufacturing sector is creating more value—six times more value in real terms—today, when it is much less important to the economy, than it did when manufacturing was the driver of the economy. And it is achieving that level of output with a manufacturing workforce that is 60 percent its 1979 peak size of 19.4 million workers.



Another commonly invoked myth is that trade disproportionately benefits big business and the rich, widening the gap between large and small businesses and between higher‐ and lower‐​income households. However, the facts show the opposite. Trade—and measures that liberalize trade—disproportionately benefit small over large businesses and lower‐​income over higher‐​income consumers.



The burdens of tariffs, regulations, and other protectionist measures are greater on small businesses than on large ones. The cost of absorbing tariffs and having internal procedures and personnel to deal with such administrative burdens constitutes a higher share of a small company’s total operating costs. What may be a minor speed bump for large companies can be a significant imposition on small firms. This burden impairs the ability of small companies to gain footholds to effectively challenge large incumbents. For capitalism to function properly, new, small, dynamic enterprises must be able to challenge entrenched behemoths and their old ways of doing business. Today’s startups are tomorrow’s national champions.



Meanwhile, lower‐​income households spend higher proportions of their budgets on goods than do higher‐​income households, whose consumption spending tilts more toward services. Not only do people with lower incomes spend more on goods, but they also spend more on imported goods. And, although U.S. tariffs are relatively low on average, they are especially high on life’s basic necessities—food, clothing, shoes, housewares, and building materials. Trade protectionism is a deeply regressive form of taxation, so the pain of global retrenchment is felt especially deeply by people at the lower end of the income and wealth scales.



A lot of anti‐​globalization sentiment has been directed toward the rules‐​based international trading system. At the core of this system is the World Trade Organization (WTO), with a growing number of bilateral and regional trade agreements spiraling around it. Complaints about the system range from assertions that it is too powerful and intrudes too much into areas of national autonomy to arguments that it is hopelessly ineffective and has been unable to accomplish much in recent years. It gets criticized for doing too much and too little. Much of the criticism reflects widespread misunderstanding about what the system does and does not do.



Some critics call the system “hyperglobalization” run amok, asserting that trade rules tie the hands of domestic policymakers. Many on the left allege that national and local governments are forced to adhere to pro‐​market global rules that require openness, encroach into domestic “policy space,” and cause a “regulatory chill.”



Similar complaints about loss of domestic sovereignty come from the right. But criticisms of the global trading system from people such as Pat Buchanan, Jeff Sessions, and Josh Hawley tend to focus not on the crowding out of domestic capacity to engage in regulatory experimentation but on its alleged anti‐​American bias and its abiding, ultimate objective to ensnare the United States in global government.



Whether starting from the left or the right, reaching that conclusion requires a fundamental misunderstanding of the existing international trade rules. The WTO system of adjudication has only limited power over domestic laws and regulations, with the ultimate decision about how to respond to findings that a law or regulation violates WTO rules being left up to national governments, leaving them plenty of sovereignty over domestic policy.



Unfortunately, even WTO proponents who understand how the system works sometimes contribute to the backlash against globalization by advocating the extension of “trade rules” into areas where they don’t belong. They figure that the rules have worked elsewhere so why not apply them here? But insisting on rules that bridge every cultural difference and address every social ill is inevitably going to foment opposition. One can push too far and too fast, as the European Union found with Brexit.



Another bipartisan myth holds that outsourcing hurts the U.S. economy and its workforce. By “shipping jobs overseas,” businesses are depriving U.S. workers of opportunities, the U.S. economy of value‐​added, and the federal and local governments of tax revenues. However, outsourcing typically augments domestic production. Rather than a substitute for domestic production—a zero‐​sum game in which a factory shutters in Ohio and relocates to Mexico to produce for export back to the United States—outsourcing is usually a complement to domestic production. By outsourcing, businesses free up new resources that often lead to new investment, job creation, and output at home.



Just as competition empowers consumers to spend less on products and services, which frees up resources that create wealth, businesses availing themselves of alternative production models are empowered to produce at lower costs, which likewise frees up resources that create wealth. Detractors assert that this outsourcing of production follows the pattern of a “race to the bottom” in which U.S. investment seeks out locations where wages are cheap and labor, environmental, product‐​safety, and other regulations are weak or nonexistent. But reality doesn’t hew to this cliché.



Globalization wasn’t preordained. Nor was it the product of some binary decision. Nobody consciously flipped on the globalization switch. Globalization happened gradually, as the aggregate sum of millions of individual decisions enabled and shaped by technological, political, economic, and demographic changes.



Innovations leading to dramatic declines in the costs of communication and transportation, the fall of the Soviet Union, China’s economic reforms, the worldwide easing of restrictions on trade and capital flows, improvements in educational attainment, the proliferation of manufacturing skills, and democratization and other forms of political liberalization all served to create new opportunities for international cooperation and collaboration. Globalization happened as the world’s producers responded to the growing demand of the world’s awakening consumer classes, who sought more choices, better quality, and lower prices. Producers, likewise, sought better options and explored new, more cost‐​effective ways to meet that growing demand. The global supply chains that emerged were the result of a confluence of factors shaping millions of investment and production‐​location decisions.



Among those factors are indeed wages and the regulatory environment but also skills of the workforce, access to transportation infrastructure, quality of communications infrastructure, tariffs, customs clearance procedures, other trade barriers, proximity to domestic and foreign markets, stability of the economic and political climates, risk of asset expropriation, respect for the rule of law, public health, and so on. It is the total cost—from a product’s inception to its consumption—that matters.



The decades‐​long trend toward increasing production in accordance with the supply chain model indicates that businesses in many different industries find the benefits to outweigh the costs. It stands to reason that the risk of supply chain disruption due to public health crises will be assigned a higher probability and weighted more heavily going forward than was the case in the past. In other words, businesses and individuals don’t need governments to artificially raise the costs of particular options to signal higher risks when those risks—and their costs—are already taken into account.



Less risk averse businesses likely will make modest adjustments to their calculations and subsequent investment and production decisions, while more risk averse entities may repatriate their supply chains entirely. Risk, risk tolerance, and the array of available options to mitigate risk vary by industry and firm. Overriding the diversity of production decisions of thousands of businesses with different risk tolerances by compelling the repatriation of supply chains through legislation or executive fiat would be enormously shortsighted and costly.



The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted some of the risks that Americans face in an interdependent global economy. Longtime critics of globalization and trade have exploited these risks and fears to recycle their arguments against the world trading system. But their arguments are no more compelling now than they were before.



Despite current threats of a protectionist overreaction, prospects for a deeper and broader form of globalization look strong. The pandemic has actually _facilitated_ globalization by encouraging us to find new reasons and ways to stay in touch. Cooperating in the development of procedures and techniques; sharing research, insights, and technology; and collaborating with people in other countries who are working on the same problems are intuitively preferable to working on these matters in isolation. The proven dependability of broadband connectivity and communications technologies means that face‐​to‐​face contact may not be as important as it once was, which is likely to translate into reduced demand for domestic and international travel, public transportation, office buildings, schools, other structures meant to accommodate large gatherings, and many other traditional activities that entail close personal contact. But that means that the time may be now for a dramatic shift in the supply and demand for international trade in services that can be delivered over the internet. Services in high demand that can be performed remotely and are ripe for competition, such as education and medicine, are likely to become much more popular.



We may be on the cusp of a new era of global interconnectedness with vast possibilities for experimentation in how we collaborate, exchange services, and transact. International cooperation will be more important—and may prove more rewarding—than ever.



Developing, testing, and implementing more targeted methods of detecting and mitigating public health risks are essential to avoiding the excessive costs of extreme responses to health crises, such as travel and trade bans. Diversification is the optimal response to uncertainty. But banning travel, forcing repatriation of supply chains, restricting government procurement to domestically produced goods and services, and imposing tariffs to dissuade the use of imports are not diversification but its antithesis. And those measures would leave U.S. producers, consumers, workers, investors, and the economy both prone to economic shocks and deprived of cutting‐​edge products, technologies, and methods.

If bullshit were rain, then Australia’s bushfires would be doused in an instant by the tidal wave of effluent pouring out of legacy media and social media alike. Much of the most egregious verbal sewage is spewing from the mouthpieces of the green-left, but the right aren’t immune, either, unfortunately.



Take for instance, the response to this report from 7News in Australia.



Police are now working on the premise arson is to blame for much of the devastation caused this bushfire season. A strike force will investigate whether blazes were deliberately lit, and bring those responsible to justice.



This is true. There have been hundreds of arrests for arson, including in some of the areas most devastated by fire.



Unfortunately, **Paul Joseph Watson** takes this fact and runs just a little too far with it.



Authorities in Australia are working on the premise that arsonists and lightning strikes are to blame for bushfires that have devastated numerous areas of the country, not “climate change” as many global warming alarmists have claimed.



In fact, the police are saying nothing here about climate change. They are simply saying that arsonists are to blame for actually igniting many fires. Whether or not climate change created the conditions that made so much of the country a tinderbox is not something that the police have addressed at all. Certainly, several scientists (including some well situated within the anthropogenic climate change camp, such as Prof. Andy Pitman), have discredited claims that the fires can be blamed on climate change.



But, as Watson rightly observes, that hasn’t stopped many on the green-left from shooting their fool mouths off.



Despite the fact that bushfires are not uncommon in Australia, the severity of the damage led numerous climate change alarmists to blame the disaster on man-made global warming.



Earlier this week, **Bernie Sanders** blamed those who were “delaying action on climate change” for “the blood-red sky and unbreathable air in Australia because of raging forest fires.”



However, according to those tasked with investigating the fires, climate change has nothing to do with it.



But, they haven’t said that at all. Whether or not it’s true, Jones is drawing a bow too far.



Other causes for the fires include lightning strikes and a natural weather phenomenon called Dipole, again neither of which have anything to do with man-made climate change.



What Watson is referring to here is the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Like El Niño in the Pacific, the IOD is a natural phenomenon – but one which some claim is being exacerbated or made more frequent by the current period of climate change. There is indeed some evidence that “positive” IODs (which are bad news for Australia) may be becoming more frequent and coinciding more often with El Niño events.



That, of course, does not mean that human activity is responsible. But it’s certainly **not** nothing to do with climate change.



In many ways, Watson is probably right: so-called “green tape” (in conjunction with a rare, but naturally-occurring mega-drought), is most likely the proximate cause of the unusual scale and ferocity of these fires, while arsonists are directly responsible for igniting many of them. Just don’t go attributing to “authorities” things that they didn’t actually say.



As Nietzsche said, “He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster”. Just because the legacy media is lying through its teeth doesn’t mean new media can be any more careless with facts.

Guest essay by Matt Manos
Skepticism has had an amazing impact on climate science given its size and persecution. Yet it still languishes as a social pariah in the green room of society. To grow, skeptics need to find a group of people that can be influenced.
Skeptics have benefited greatly through their association with Conservatives. Unfortunately, skepticism among the Conservative population has been maximized. Future growth has to come from the political middle.
According to 2014 survey by Pew, 61% of Americans believe
“…there is solid evidence that Earth’s average temperature has been getting warmer over the past few decades.”
What’s amazing is that 35% are willing to admit that they don’t believe the Earth has been warming in the past few decades (the remaining 4% don’t take a position). That 35% has resisted more than a decade of bellwether pushing and government campaigns. Skeptics have been out-grouped and Othered by their friends and even family members. And yet they still don’t accept CAGW or possibly even AGW. These are some stubborn people.
Are most of the 35% scientifically literate? Have they researched AGW and come to a contrary conclusion? Many scientists have reluctantly followed a lonely path to skepticism. Others in the 35% have detected a disconnect between the rhetoric of climate change and the reality on the ground. When the sky doesn’t fall for years, skepticism grows all by itself. Still, a majority of the 35% are probably skeptical because of the culture war.
Conservative leaders rally support against climate change not because they’ve done a survey of the scientific literature but because they find the policy outcomes of climate change undesirable. The association is so strong that skepticism has become linked to the Conservative movement by the general public. This linkage drives away many moderate and independent minded people before a discussion about CAGW can ever occur.
I’m not suggesting Conservative leaders temper their views and I am not trying to blame them. What I’m suggesting is that the way to grow skepticism is to engage other segments of the political sphere. Libertarians in the US are a good example. They often partner with Conservatives on policy issues but not so much on climate change. Libertarians have Othered skeptics. One way to change that is through direct lobbying by skeptic experts. Not just with Libertarians but any civic group that will host a debate. Scientific, non-partisan, debate.
That is a good message for all skeptics to have. My first post on WUWT led to some interesting rabbit holes in the comments. When I wrote about rational ignorance, I didn’t expect discussions from Truthers and anti-vaxxers. I’m not trying to pick a fight with those groups. What I am humbling suggesting is that for CAGW to become accepted by moderates and independents, skeptics need to appear above reproach on all other controversial topics. Skeptics are being lumped into a guilt by association with groups that are even more out of the mainstream than they are. Skeptics need to become single issue communicators untarnished by other controversial topics.
Skeptics need to know what they stand for and what they don’t. Skeptics get painted as deniers and conspiracy theorists and changing that perception won’t happen overnight. But it won’t happen at all if it’s not communicated. What skeptics need is a strong spokesperson. Preferably a young, charismatic, non-partisan scientist to go on daytime TV, YouTube and TV news shows. This would be a true skeptic of CAGW who could point to their belief that CO2 is a greenhouse gas as a defense against being labelled a denier. The skeptic spokesperson would be trying to reach low information viewers. The types of viewers that are most prone to rational ignorance on climate change.
I’m not calling out Conservatives or the other groups I mentioned. I’m addressing the specific topic of how I think skepticism can grow. I don’t claim these are the only ways to grow skepticism or that they’re even original. It’s easy to see what needs to happen and a lot harder to get things done. Personally, I think skepticism could grow if skeptics could get the science presented to more people. The pause is amazing stuff. To effectively communicate the pause requires different skills then influencing the scientific debate. To grow, skepticism needs a playbook and a face.

As already[ reported in The BFD](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/the-green-vultures-swoop-pt-1-a-firestorm-of-astroturf/), the political jackals of the green-left are pouncing on Australia’s bushfire crisis before the ashes are even cool. First, there was [**Tim Flannery** ’s climate muppet show](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/climate-muppet-show-gets-a-gong-from-firies/), the “Emergency Leaders for Climate Action”. There being no show without Punch, **GetUp** have quickly got in on the act, too, touting its own activists as “Bushfire Survivors for ­Climate Action”.



But nothing else draws green scavengers like the scent of money.



While many around the nation mourn lives lost in bushfires still raging, others have sought to profit from the tragedy.



Enter GetUp.



The eco-activists have used the bushfires to ask for $12 donations to fight the “cashed-up mining lobby” they blame for the fires.



Many people, from pop stars to businessmen to kids washing cars have shown extraordinary generosity in raising funds for bushfire victims. Not GetUp. They’re not asking for money for bushfire victims.



 **These disgusting jackals are putting their hands out for themselves only.**



Families have lost everything. Loved ones, homes, communities.



Some have broken down in tears after escaping with just the shirts off their back.



But rather than asking for donations to help these people, GetUp wants you to finance its propaganda outfit which is short on cash after being banned from living off foreign donations.



On Saturday, a few hours after the woman found in Wytaliba died, GetUp national director **Paul Oosting** wrote this email.



“As bushfires rage across the east coast, people are taking climate action in unprecedented numbers – protesting the inaction of our government and climate wrecking corporations,” he said.



“But with Morrison now actively working with the cashed-up mining lobby – now, more than ever, we need to stand united.



“Can you chip in $12 to a fighting fund to defeat Scott Morrison’s authoritarian climate crackdown?”



The timing of such a request is sickening.



It’s not just GetUp, either.



 **The Wilderness Society** are also touting for donations, using the bushfires as a stump for their shameless opportunism.



For the last several weeks, Australia has been on fire. Beyond the devastating human cost, these fires are game-changing for Australia’s iconic nature […]Will you help to reach our end of the year fundraising goal of $200,000?



These people really have no shame at all.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the latest on plans by some overly overzealous German government leaders to get the country to commit economic suicide through de-carbonization, at least that’s what German industry believes.
Online German national daily Die Welt has a piece by Daniel Wetzel titled: German Economy Fears Eco-Dictatorship.

Screen shot of Die Welt report
In the wake of the lofty declarations made at the Paris Conference to roll back global CO2 emissions, a number of high level Environment Ministry bureaucrats in Germany’s government have been eagerly concocting a “radical bill” dubbed “Climate Protection 2050” – designed to make Germany almost carbon-free by 2050.  Already the bill’s extremism and disconnect from reality are coming under heavy fire.
High costs would devastate the poor
In the wake of Paris, Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks has put together a “catalogue of measures” which she and her Ministry hope will be passed into law by early summer.
Should the proposals be enacted, Wetzel writes that it would mean “higher rental prices for apartments, higher taxes, mandatory renovations by building owners, speed limits and massive cost hikes for industrial enterprises“.
The proposals call for the mandatory, comprehensive renovation of buildings that owners would be forced by law to carry out. Such huge costs of course would have to be passed on to the occupants who rent or lease the buildings.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Wetzel writes that Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks is moving rapidly to get the bill enacted before summertime. Industry warns of “catastrophic consequences” should the CO2 restricting proposals be adopted. The catalogue of measures designed to lead Germany to a near zero-carbon society by 2050 has the industry spooked. Wetzel writes of an “urgent letter” by leading industry trade groups addressed to the Environment Ministry – one that uses uncharacteristically harsh terms such as “threatening ecology or climate dictatorship“. Copies of the letter were also sent to the heads of other German federal ministries, such as the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry Of Commerce.
“Poison list of draconian measures”
According to Wetzel some of the proposals include severe tax penalties for owners of “energy inefficient” buildings should they refuse to implement costly renovation works. The catalogue also calls for excruciatingly high taxes on heating oil and natural gas. Wetzel quotes Andreas Lücke of the German Heating Industry Association (BDH) who calls the “Climate Protection Plan 2050” a “poison list of draconian measures.”
The catalogue of climate measures also calls for the heavy taxation of coal power plants, which thus would put tens of thousands of coal mining and power sector jobs in jeopardy. Also the catalogue calls for a speed limit of 120 km/hr on the country’s famed autobahns and a snail-like speed of 30 km/hr. within all city limits.
The proposed climate protection bill also calls for eliminating fossil fuel combustion engines in motor vehicles by 2050, which means no internal combustion engine cars will be sold after 2030. Already today Germany’s plan to get one million cars onto the streets by 2020 is only some 2% fulfilled, as no one is interested in electric cars. Wetzel writes:
When the German government foresees the death of the combustion engine within the next 14 years, even though electric cars have failed to sell so far, it shows us the newly acquired level of radicalism that their climate-political demands and expectations have taken on”.
When examining the catalogue of measures proposed in the Environment Ministry’s bill, one has to wonder if the German government has any remaining connection left to reality. If this bill does not get watered down severely – very severely, then Germany may find itself needing a wall to keep the citizens and companies in – and not refugees out. It’s mind-boggingly radical and extreme. Germany’s Ministry Of Environment obviously does not have a balanced panel of advisors, but rather one likely made up of only extreme environmental activists.
Wetzel writes of requests being made by the WWF, which is calling for a transition over to the full electrification of the entire transport sectors, industrial processes and heating, and away from fossil fuels altogether. This, the WWF feels, can be accomplished with sun and wind. They also call for the end of coal power by 2035. However, the WWF gave no specifics how this should be accomplished.
From an energy engineering standpoint, little of what is proposed by the catalogue can be done without major sacrifice. So, it’s little wonder the government has already realized this and rightly scaled back on renewable energies over the past couple of years. But when the bill reaches Parliament in early summer, nothing can be excluded. Yet, we should give them the benefit of the doubt. Expect the highly corrosive measures to be severely watered down.

 **Professor Nerilie Abram**



 **ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes**



Dear Professor,



I refer to your article, “[Australia’s Angry Summer: This Is What Climate Change Looks Like](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/australias-angry-summer-this-is-what-climate-change-looks-like/?fbclid=IwAR17MIDkfc-hPRIV6rCoNb5C3_HyHv4lYY3IhSmX8lkUKZDNczT1SrEZ3MM%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)”.



No doubt like most people who are drawn to your article, I am interested in solutions or effective preventative actions, especially during this tragic time, and it is in this context I refer to your article.



You state:



The catastrophic fires raging across the southern half of the continent are largely the result of rising temperatures […] Of course, unusually hot summers have happened in the past[…]



[Apparently they were hotter in the past](https://jennifermarohasy.com/2019/03/hottest-summer/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). 



[…] so have bad bushfire seasons. But the link between the current extremes and anthropogenic climate change is scientifically undisputable.



The fires raging across the southern half of the Australian continent this year have so far burned through [more than 5 million hectares](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/25/factcheck-why-australias-monster-2019-bushfires-are-unprecedented%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). To put that in context, the catastrophic 2018 fire season in California saw nearly 740,000 hectares burned 



Why do you feel it is more appropriate to compare it to California fires rather than [the 1851 Australian fire](https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/resources/bushfire-black-thursday-1851/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) which also burnt out 5 million hectares?



[…]Climate change is making Australian wildfires larger and more frequent because of its effects on dryness and fire weather […] The current summer has presented the perfect storm for wildfire. Long-term climate warming, combined with years of drought, colliding with a set of climate patterns that deliver severe fire weather […] In the tropical Indian Ocean, one of the most severe positive [Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/iod/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) events on record [played out this year](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-11/indian-ocean-dipole-fuels-dry-australia-bushfires-africa-rain/11787874%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). 



The unusually cold sea-surface temperatures in the eastern Indian Ocean cut off one of Australia’s critical moisture sources, adding to the ongoing drought in southern parts of the country […] Again, climate change is part of the story, because anthropogenic warming is causing positive IOD events to become [stronger and more frequent](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13327%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) […]The role of climate change in the unprecedented fires gripping Australia is also [well understood by our emergency services](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-15/scott-morrison-should-listen-to-fire-chiefs-on-climate-change/11707096%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). Sadly, though, this summer has occurred against a backdrop in which the Australian government has [argued, on the world stage](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-accord-australia/australias-climate-stance-sparks-anger-at-u-n-summit-idUSKBN1YH1QC%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), to scale back our greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction targets. Our leaders are literally fiddling while the country burns.



The fundamental question here is: are you referring to human-caused climate change or to **natural climate change?** In other words, are you suggesting you have scientific evidence which confirms lowering emissions will prevent or lessen bushfires? **If so, could you please supply that evidence?**



You further claim:



Increasing temperatures cause increased evaporation that dries the soil and fuel load. More than a decade ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that ongoing anthropogenic climate change was [virtually certain to increase in intensity and frequency of fires in Australia](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/wg2/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). This assessment of the science evidence has been [repeated in countless reports](https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/not-normal-climate-change-bushfire-web/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), including the IPCC’s [Climate Change and Land report](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank), released in August 2019 […]



One of the factors driving this long-term loss of winter rainfall is the [positive trend](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2235%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) in the [Southern Annular Mode (SAM)](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/sam/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). This change is causing the westerly winds that circle the Southern Ocean to shift southward toward Antarctica, causing rain-bearing winter cold fronts to pass south of the Australian continent. The [role of anthropogenic climate change](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1296%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) in driving this trend in the SAM is also clear in the science.



You cite the [IPCC Climate Change 2007 report](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/ar4_wg2_full_report.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) as stating “ _anthropogenic climate change was_[ _virtually certain to increase in intensity and frequency of fires in Australia_](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/wg2/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) _.”_ Could you please state your page reference for this citation? When I examined this report I could find **nothing** to support your claim. According to the report:



[ **Climate Change 2007**](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/ar4_wg2_full_report.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)



 ** _Australia and New Zealand_**



The region is already experiencing impacts from recent climate change […]Since 1950 there has been a 0.3 to 0.7°C warming in the region, with more heat waves, fewer frosts, more rain in north-western Australia and south-western New Zealand, less rain in southern and eastern Australia and north-eastern New Zealand, an increase in the intensity of Australian droughts, […]



The climate of the 21st century is virtually certain to be warmer, with changes in extreme events (medium to high _confidence)._



In summary, the IPCC state in their 2007 report _: “Increased fire danger is likely with climate change; for example, in south-east Australia the frequency of very high and extreme fire danger days is likely to rise 4 to 25% by 2020 and 15 to 70% by 2050”_



What you **neglected** to mention however, is that the IPCC specifically define the term ‘climate change as including **natural** (irreversible) climate variability. In other words, rewriting the above conclusion in accord with the intended definition utilised by the IPCC, we see the following:



“ _Increased fire danger is likely if there are natural &/OR human induced climatic changes”._



Clearly, your assertion that the report states “ _anthropogenic climate change was_[ _virtually certain to increase in intensity and frequency of fires in Australia_](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar4/wg2/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)”, is contradicted by the report itself; unless of course, you can supply more evidence. 



**Why did you fail to explain these facts to readers? Were you genuinely unaware of the facts?**



You further cite the _IPCC’s_[ _Climate Change and Land report_](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank) _, released in August 2019,_ but here again **you fail** to point out that the IPCC specifically **includes natural climate variability** and does **not** separate this from human induced changes when it comes to fires.



According to the [report:](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/4/2019/11/03_Technical-Summary-TS.pdf)



Technical Summary, 2019. In: Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems



Climate change is playing an increasing role in determining wildfire regimes alongside human activity (medium confidence), with future climate variability expected to enhance the risk and severity of wildfires in many biomes such as tropical rainforests (high confidence). Fire weather seasons have lengthened globally between 1979 and 2013 (low confidence). Global land area burned has declined in recent decades, mainly due to less burning in grasslands and savannahs (high confidence). While drought remains the dominant driver of fire emissions, there has recently been increased fire activity in some tropical and temperate regions during normal to wetter than average years due to warmer temperatures that increase vegetation flammability (medium confidence). The boreal zone is also experiencing larger and more frequent fires, and this may increase under a warmer climate (medium confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2}



I also draw your attention to the IPCC’s assertion that _“drought remains the dominant driver of fire emissions”,_ which again contradicts your claim that _“The catastrophic fires raging across the southern half of the continent are largely the result of rising temperatures_ _”._



The connection between droughts and fires is of particular interest since scientists have indicated that there is **no reliable evidence humans are causing droughts** ([I recently reviewed the evidence](https://saltbushclub.com/2019/11/26/droughts-fires-climate/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)) and, in fact, [the IPCC has acknowledged that earlier claims droughts were caused by human induced climate change were false or exaggerated](http://www.galileomovement.com.au/docs/gw/HowToRecogniseVol2RevDroughts.pdf%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank). 



Once again, however, you failed to communicate these vitally important facts to your readers. **Why?**



You have failed to substantiate your claim that _“the link between the current extremes and anthropogenic climate change is scientifically undisputable”_



If you have evidence of this could you please provide it?



I think you will agree with me, especially at this tragic time with so many people suffering, what is needed is accurate and useful information.



To this end, I look forward to a clarification, or alternatively, a retraction.

Scientific claims are only worth the data they’re based on. In turn, that data is only as good as the methodology by which it’s collected. Among other things, experimenters should absolutely rigorously compare apples with apples. Measuring two different things, however similar they might be, and pretending that they’re the same is not good science. Using such flawed data to construct a strong claim – especially a startling or catastrophic claim – is junk science.



Once again, we are seeing that a key claim of climate change alarmism – the alleged “death” of the Great Barrier Reef – is based on flawed methodology, and may well turn out to be junk science.



Rebel marine scientist Peter Ridd has thrown down a challenge to reef scientists to test whether or not human actions have caused a collapse in the growth rate of coral­s on the Great Barrier Reef.



Dr Ridd said despite published claims of a collapse in coral growth rates between 1990 and 2005 due to stress from human pollution, there was no data for the past 15 years. “We don’t know how the Great Barrier Reef has fared since 2005,” he said.



If the Reef really was under such threat, then surely it would be continuously monitored?



He has proposed a new program­ of drill core sampling to bring the record up to date and test whether assumptions about a collapse in growth rates because of warmer temperatures can be believed­. Like tree trunks, drill cores from old corals can reveal growth rings that show age and growth rates. Writing in The Australian on Thursday, Dr Ridd says a properly supervised program would be an “acid test of the trustworthiness of our major science institutions”.



When similar problems emerged with the proxy measurements (such as bristlecone pines) used to support claims of global warming, the alarmists simply refused to go back and re-do the measurements. “Too hard,” they whined.



Sure: when you’re proposing unprecedented, trillion-dollar social and economic upheavals, trudging a few kilometres carrying a piece of boring equipment really is just **too** hard.



Far easier to stick with the alarmist narrative, and not risk inconvenient facts getting in the way.



The foundation of claims about a dramatic decline in reef growth is contained in a 2009 paper by Glenn De’ath from the Australian Institute of Marine Science that is still widely quoted.



The Great Barrier Reef Outlook­ Report 2019 cites the De’ath report in claims that reef calcification declined by 14 per cent between 1990 and 2005…



Dr Ridd challenged the research­, claiming a change in methodology had resulted in the apparent drop in coral growth rates from 1990.



The authors accepted criti­cisms that there had been incorrect measurement of near-surface coral growth rings on most of the corals that were giving data from 1990 to 2005 and printed a correction to the paper. However, AIMS rejected criticisms by Dr Ridd that much smaller and young­er corals had been sampled for the 1990-2005 data compared with the mostly very large and old corals­ of the pre-1990 data.



This all highlights some common, and growing, problems with modern science. First, the “reproducibility crisis”: in recent years, it has become more and more obvious that many scientific studies are impossible to reproduce. They’re scientifically worthless, in other words. This is modern science’s shameful secret, and why, when a headline claims that “science says…”, you should immediately assume that it **doesn’t** , until otherwise proven.



Secondly, the deplorable media-tarting of many scientists. Outlandish claims are rushed to print in the mass media, often ahead of publication in the scientific literature (this is, in fact, a key characteristic of pseudo-science). Quite often, the same studies are either rejected by scientific publishers (for instance, Gergis, et al, 2012) or later withdrawn (Resplandy, et al, 2018). Yet, these facts are **never** reported in the mass media, certainly not with the same shrieking headlines with which their alarmist (and, as it turned out, utterly false) claims were originally trumpeted.



The “IFL Science” crowd won’t admit it, but we are smack in the middle of a full-blown crisis in modern science. Rigorous scientific practise is being trashed by activist, junk science. As we see, too, climate science is frequently among the worst offenders.

"**Ethiopia has issued arrest warrants for 76 army officers accused of being linked to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).**
Forces loyal to that party are fighting the government in the restive Tigray region.
Ethiopia's prime minister has said that his army is advancing on its capital, Mekelle.
Hundreds have reportedly died and tens of thousands have fled the area after two weeks of clashes.
Verifying information from Tigray is hard because of a blackout on most communications.
The conflict is rooted in long-standing tension between powerful regional party the TPLF and Ethiopia's central government.
When Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, tension escalated between the two groups. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate to lead the country.
The government accused the TPLF of attacking a military base to steal weapons, which the TPLF denied. In response, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive, accusing the TPLF of treason.
On Wednesday federal police announced arrest warrants for 76 army officers, some of whom are reportedly retired. They are accused of conspiring with the TPLF and ""committing treason"", according to AFP news agency.
Speaking to the BBC, Billene Seyoum - a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed - denied reports that Tigrayans elsewhere in the country were being arrested on the basis of their ethnicity. But she admitted many had been detained for membership of what she called criminal networks.
The news came after government forces seized the towns of Shire and Raya after a three-day deadline given by Prime Minister Abiy to Tigray's forces to surrender expired on Tuesday.
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael, who was born in Shire, confirmed to a local TV station that his soldiers had lost control of the towns in the south and west of Tigray. However he called their victory temporary, and vowed to defeat Mr Abiy's forces.
Sudan says some 36,000 people have fled over the border from Tigray amid the ongoing fighting. The UN has warned of a ""full-scale humanitarian crisis"".
""There may be massive displacement inside Tigray and that is of course a concern and we try to prepare the best way possible,"" Jens Laerke, spokesman of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said.
The UN fears the numbers fleeing Ethiopia may be just a fraction of those forced from their homes by the fighting, but for the moment aid agencies have no access to the Tigray region.
Regional powers Kenya and Uganda have called for negotiations to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The Ethiopian government has, however, ruled out talks with the TPLF.
**1\. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region.** Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires.
**2\. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site.** The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant.
**3\. Most people in Tigray are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.** The region's Christian roots stretch back 1,600 years.
**4\. The region's main language is Tigrinya** , a Semitic dialect with at least seven million speakers worldwide.
**5\. Sesame is a major cash crop** , exported to the US, China and other countries.
_ **Correction 20 November 2020: This story has been corrected to say the government has taken the town of Raya, not Aksum.**_"
"In 2004, France banned vending machines from schools. In 2011, it limited servings of french fries to once a week in school cafeterias. A year later, it imposed a “soda tax. ” On Friday, the government said no  restaurants can offer free refills of sodas and other sugary drinks.  The new regulation is the latest attempt to tackle what the government called a relentless rise in the national obesity rate.   restaurants, usually foreign chains, are expected to be targeted under the new law. The law, which takes effect immediately, said it aimed to “limit, especially among the young,” the risks of obesity and diabetes. The move by France is in line with recommendations by the World Health Organization, which has urged countries to impose a tax on sugary drinks to battle an increase in obesity, presenting data in 2016 on the beneficial health effects of such a tax. The French are, on average, less overweight than other Europeans and Americans. The share of obese adults (age 18 and older) in France was 15. 3 percent in 2014, just below the European Union average, 15. 9 percent, according to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. Malta has the highest share of adult obesity of European nations, 26 percent. In the United States, it is 36. 5 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the overall adult obesity rate in France appears to be relatively low, 57 percent of men and 41 percent of women 30 to 60 years old were overweight or obese, according to a report released in October by Bulletin Épidémiologique Hebdomadaire, the French medical journal. France has been at the forefront of tackling the issue, along with countries like Japan, where a national law requires companies and local governments to measure the waistlines of people between the ages of 40 and 74, and to encourage them to exercise. Mexico added a 10 percent surcharge on sugary drinks in 2014 to reduce alarming levels of diabetes there. After one year, sales of such beverages fell as much as 12 percent, while bottled water purchases rose 4 percent, a study found. Similar efforts are underway in the United States. Philadelphia became the first major city this year to introduce a tax on soda and other sugary drinks, provoking public outrage. In 2012, the New York City health board approved Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s plan to ban the sale of large sugary drinks in restaurants and other venues. But a court struck down the proposal in 2013. The Bloomberg administration appealed and lost. The new law has divided the French, who consume fewer soft drinks per capita than residents of most other countries. “Each person has to take responsibility,” a    man told the newspaper Le Parisien. Restaurants “might as well put scales in front of each   joint. ”"

The Middle East has turned hostile to Christians and other religious minorities. The Iraqi Christian community has been devastated. Syria’s civil war loosed the murderous Islamic State on Christians and others. Libya’s disintegration opened the nation to IS fighters bent on killing anyone of the wrong faith.



Also at risk are Egypt’s Copts, who make up about ten percent of that country’s population. Coptic Christians predate Islam and played an important role in Egypt’s development. But they long suffered from discrimination and persecution.



Under dictator Hosni Mubarak the U.S. State Department called the status of religious liberty “poor” and noted that Christians and Baha’is faced “personal and collective discrimination, especially in government employment and their ability to build, renovate, and repair places of worship.” Moreover, explained State, the government “sometimes arrested, detained, and harassed” those “whose beliefs and/​or practices it deemed to deviate from mainstream Islamic beliefs and whose activities it alleged to jeopardize communal harmony.”



At times state‐​controlled media and -funded mosques encouraged violence. Attacks on Copts were common and perpetrators rarely were prosecuted. Indeed, victims sometimes were arrested too. The government also failed to respond seriously to the kidnapping of Christian girls who were forced to marry Muslims.



Even when the authorities did not actively persecute Copts, observed Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “a prejudicial legal framework has created a permissive environment that allows Egyptian officials and private individuals to discriminate against Christians freely and with impunity.” As elsewhere in the Middle East, converts and Baha’is tended to be most at risk. Reported William Inboden of the Strauss Center for International Security and Law: “Egyptian converts from Islam to Christianity, though very few in number, suffered particularly heinous treatment—including imprisonment and sadistic torture.” Dina Guiguis of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy blamed Mubarak’s regime “for creating the fertile ground on which pernicious and egregious sectarian violence has become routine.”



Understandably, Mubarak’s overthrow led Copts to hope for a freer and safer Egypt. But President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood failed to accept checks on executive authority, accommodate political opponents who feared centralization of power, and reassure those who feared the Brotherhood was determined to Islamicize Egyptian society. Indeed, violent attacks on Copts increased.



Morsi was not the only culprit. Responsible for many incidents were Salafists, who emerged as allies of the army against the Muslim Brotherhood. Moreover, reported the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, after the revolution “military and security forces reportedly have used excessive force and live ammunition targeting Christian places of worship and Christian demonstrators.” In one infamous case the military, then headed by Gen. Abdel Fattah al‐​Sisi, shot down more than a score of Coptic protesters. As a result, USCIRF recommended that Egypt be designated a Country of Particular Concern.



Three years ago al‐​Sisi overthrew Morsi and eventually became president. While the previous Coptic Pope Shenouda III was controversially connected to Mubarak, Pope Tawadros II publicly supported the coup and subsequently called al‐​Sisi a “hero.” Coptic film critic Joseph Fahim said the revolt “was a renewal of hope, a promise of a secular Egypt where political Islam will never have a say again. The then‐​field Marshall Sisis was no mere military leader; he was the great savior.”





Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East have few good options.



Alas, secular saviors rarely keep faith with Christians. This case was no different. The military used extreme brutality—killing hundreds of demonstrators on the streets of Cairo—to maintain control. But the church remained as vulnerable as it was visible, and found itself targeted by angry Islamists because of its high profile support for the military. Dozens of churches were destroyed. A priest at the Church of Two Saints in Alexandria, Father Mina Adel, told Breitbart that “Most of our people are afraid” and many were leaving.



In January al‐​Sisi celebrated Christmas at a Coptic service and promised to rebuild churches that had been destroyed. He apologized for past inaction: “This year everything will be fixed,” he said. Some Copts, including in the U.S., appeared to take al‐​Sisi at his word and believed he would act as defender of the church.



So far, however, the government has delivered more promises than actions. Mina Thabet of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms complained that al‐​Sisi was no liberal and “doesn’t care about religious freedom.” Certainly he evidenced no interest prior to assembling support for the coup.



Nor is the only problem attacks on churches (which have diminished). Egypt’s blasphemy law is frequently deployed against Christians. In fact, the government never stopped targeting Copts. Fahim pointed out in July 2014: “Copts, too, are not safe from the new government’s oppressive measures. Two weeks ago, a 23‐​year‐​old Coptic teacher was sentenced to prison for six months for insulting Islam. On June 23, a Christian convert reporter was sentenced to five years in prison for allegedly reporting false information about discrimination against Copts. The following day, a 29‐​year‐​old Copt from Upper Egypt was given a five‐​year prison sentence for liking a Facebook page put up by a group of Christian converts—so much for the secular utopia we conjured in our imagination.”



The State Department’s most recent religious freedom report, from 2014, noted that Egypt’s government did not recognize conversion from Islam, prosecuted people for religious defamation and blasphemy, and failed to respond to attacks on Christians. “Accountability for previous sectarian crimes was uneven,” noted State. Moreover, “The government failed to prevent, investigate, or prosecute crimes targeting members of religious minority groups, which fostered a climate of impunity.”



Last year’s USCIRF annual report concluded: “the Egyptian government has not adequately protected religious minorities, particularly Coptic Orthodox Christians and their property, from periodic violence. Discriminatory and repressive laws and policies that restrict freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief remain in place. Egyptian courts continue to prosecute, convict, and imprison Egyptian citizens for blasphemy, and new government initiatives to counter atheism emerged during the year.”



Those who commit sectarian violence generally are not convicted, leaving conditions for Copts “precarious.” Baha’is and Jehovah’s Witnesses are banned, while anti‐​Semitism is rife. Blasphemy cases are on the upswing. Most cases are brought against Sunni Muslims but, noted the Commission, “the majority of those sentenced by a court to prison terms for blasphemy have been Christians, Shi’a Muslims, and atheists, mostly based on flawed trials.” In February four teenage Copts were sentenced to five years in prison for a video directed against the Islamic State but treated as an attack on Islam. At the end of March the court upheld a three‐​year sentence against the poet Fatma Naoot for “contempt of religion” and “insulting Islam.”



Indeed, al‐​Sisi may be consciously using ostentatious state piety to maintain power in a society in which social hostility runs high against religious minorities. In reporting on the conviction of Naoot, who, ironically, had supported al‐​Sisi, the _Washington Post’s_ Sudarsan Raghavan explained: “there have been more religious‐​based convictions during President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi’s time in office than under the Islamist government the former general replaced two years ago.” Film director Ama Salama argued that “What happened with Fatma Naoot would have never happened under the time of Mubarak, or under the time of the revolution, or under Morsi.”



Even if Copts believe they remain safer under al‐​Sisi, they may have sold their liberty birthrate for what turns out to be a mess of security pottage. With the al‐​Sisi government instituting its own reign of terror, the Coptic Church appears to be on the side of the oppressors. Fahim contemplated Cairo’s urban massacre, which was bloodier than Tiananmen Square: “The Coptic Orthodox Church watched the bloodshed and did nothing.” And that was just the beginning.



Copts live in the same unfree society as everyone else. Fahim wrote two years ago: “more than 40,000 arrests have been made since Morsi’s overthrow, journalists have been prosecuted, artists have been censored, opposition voices have been violently silenced, dissented politicians have been witch‐​hunted, the Mubarak regime has successfully reassembled itself, institutional corruption has grown more rampant, the country has descended into further chaos and fear has become the prevailing sentiment of the day.”



Today the government targets all critics, including many who opposed Mubarak. In fact, the regime outlawed the April 6 democracy movement which organized protests against the previous dictator. Some activists received lengthy terms for participating in similar demonstrations against al‐​Sisi. TV host Wael al‐​Ibrashi originally supported the military but recently told the _Wall Street Journal_ that the Mubarak “apparatus” is using violence to return to power.



The State Department’s 2015 human rights report on Egypt is a depressing read: “The most significant human rights problems were excessive use of force by security forces, deficiencies in due process, and the suppression of civil liberties. Excessive use of force included unlawful killings and torture. Due process problems included the excessive use of preventative custody and pretrial detention, the use of military courts to try civilians, and trials involving hundreds of defendants in which authorities did not present evidence on an individual basis. Civil liberties problems included societal and governmental restrictions on freedoms of expression and the press, as well as on the freedoms of assembly and association.”



The human rights group Freedom House recently judged Egypt to be “not free” and getting worse. The group cited “the complete marginalization of the opposition, state surveillance of electronic communications, public exhortations to report critics of the government to the authorities, and the mass trials and unjustified imprisonment of members of the Muslim Brotherhood.” In the name of fighting terrorism journalists who contradict the government face fines and arrest.



Many people simply disappear. Explained Khaled Mansour, a writer and former executive director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights: “Security officers kidnap individuals they believe are activists, force them to provide information or testify to wrongdoing, and deny for days, weeks or months that they are keeping them in custody. Some of those kidnapped are then taken to court—or released—while the whereabouts of others remain unknown.” The security forces appear to be largely unaccountable, perhaps even to the government.



To be so detained is said to be going “behind the sun,” a phrase dating back to the dictatorship of Gamal Abdel Nasser, since anyone looking for you may go blind. Last year Human Rights Watch documented several cases of “enforced disappearances.” Public attention in Egypt focused on student Esraa al‐​Taweel, who was kidnapped along with two male friends and taken to the headquarters of state security, where the two men were tortured into confessing to violent activity.



The latest case to embarrass the government involves 28‐​year‐​old Italian graduate student Giulio Regeni, who was investigating Egyptian labor unions. He disappeared in January; his mutilated body, which sustained the sort of torture typically inflicted by the security forces, was discovered several days later. The government initially blamed his death on a car accident, but later claimed he was murdered by a newly discovered criminal gang, whose members all happened to be killed at a police checkpoint.Finally, Cairo currently is engaged in a systematic campaign to shut down organizations which simply report on government abuses. Scores of domestic and international NGOs engaged in documenting human rights violations reportedly are under criminal investigation. Last month the government sought to freeze the personal assets of Hossam Bahgat and Gamal Eid, founders respectively of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and Arabic Network for Human Rights Information.



Another human rights advocate, Negad al‐​Borai, had been detained and threatened with criminal charges. The regime also launched legal attacks on the women’s organization Nazra for Feminist Studies and the anti‐​torture Nadeem Center. The Working Group on Egypt, whose members include leading neoconservatives such as Robert Kagan and Elliott Abrams, warned that these efforts are part of the “Egyptian authorities’ campaign to crush the last remnants of Egypt’s independent civil society and human rights community.”



Two years ago I was a member of a delegation of lawyers who visited the Nadeem Center. We met with co‐​founder and psychiatry professor Aida Seif al‐​Dawla, who told us that torture was more pervasive then than at any point during the Mubarak era. Security personnel acted with complete impunity. Last year, reported the organization, the government abducted 464 people, caused the death of nearly 500 detainees, and tortured at least 676 people. Since February the government has been attempting to shut down the center. Seif al‐​Dawla told the Associated Press: “The problem now is that you cannot predict what can put you in jail or not.”



In short, Egypt is scary for anyone who dissents. People disappear and die. Prison conditions are harsh. Judicial verdicts reflect political demands. Journalists are punished for expressing independent opinions. Academic freedom is restricted. Human rights organizations are harassed and closed. Official corruption has spread. Security forces act with impunity.



Unfortunately, sustained repression has only encouraged radicalization and more terrorist attacks. Which raises questions about the stability of al-Sisi’s rule. In April public protests erupted over the gifting of two islands to Saudi Arabia, apparently in exchange for financial “aid” received. Egyptians unwilling to turn out on behalf of democracy demonstrated against this public prostration before Riyadh. Rumors of military dissatisfaction with al‐​Sisi abound.



In the end Coptic Christians could end up more vulnerable than ever. The al‐​Sisi dictatorship does little to protect them and his promises of aid remain unfulfilled. Yet the Coptic Church has tied itself to his rule, which grows ever more repressive. If he falls, Copts again could find themselves targeted, but this time by a much wider proportion of the population.



Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East have few good options. Unfortunately, Coptic reliance on Egypt’s al‐​Sisi increasingly looks like a bad deal. He is delivering little of the secularism that was supposed to accompany his dictatorship. Worse, his brutal repression violates Christian principles and risks triggering another revolution, one in which Copts might find themselves to be targets. Now is the time to search for a new approach that doesn’t sacrifice national liberty for sectarian security.

"The climate crisis is presenting increasing challenges for rail safety, senior transport figures have warned, as family and friends paid tribute to three people who died in a derailment in Aberdeenshire following thunderstorms and torrential rain. The train’s driver, Brett McCullough, and conductor, Donald Dinnie, died along with a passenger, Christopher Stuchbury, when the 6.38am Aberdeen to Glasgow service came off the tracks and slid down an embankment near Carmont, just west of Stonehaven, on Wednesday. A further six people were injured, two of whom remain in hospital, both in a stable condition. McCullough, 45, was described as a devoted family man who moved from Bromley in Kent to north-east Scotland to marry his wife, Stephanie, and switched careers after a conversation with an Aberdeen train driver in 2011. Friends and colleagues described Dinnie, 58, as “an absolute gent” who “always had a smile”, while Stuchbury, 62, was remembered as “an adored husband, son, dad, stepdad, grandad, brother and uncle”. Visiting the site of the accident on Thursday, the Scottish transport secretary, Michael Matheson, said it was reasonable to presume the weather had had an impact on events, adding he hoped investigating authorities would advise whether efforts to address the challenges posed by extreme weather events should be stepped up. “[Network Rail] are well aware of our views about the need to make sure that we are taking forward the right types of mitigations that help to manage a challenge of these types of localised, intense weather events,” he said. “I think one of the things we will see from the investigation is whether the pace of that type of mitigation work needs to be stepped up; that’s not just a challenge across Scotland, it’s across the whole of the UK.” Network Rail’s chief executive, Andrew Haines, announced a series of immediate additional safety measures, including inspections of dozens of sites with similar trackside slopes and risk profiles to the Stonehaven line, as he too visited the scene. Haines said: “I will not pre-empt the outcome of the investigation into this awful event, but it is clear the weather was appalling and there were floods and landslips in the area. I have asked my teams to put extra measures in place, from immediate, heightened inspections to medium-term work with meteorologists to improve information and forecasting.” Kevin Lindsay, Aslef’s organiser in Scotland, said McCullough, who had three children and lived not far from the scene of the crash, was working as a gas fitter when he started to talk about the railways while servicing the boiler of an Aberdeen train driver. “Brett was fascinated by what he heard, successfully applied for a job, did his driver’s training for a year to earn his key, and entered service with ScotRail in December 2013,” said Lindsay. “He was a dedicated train driver, who loved his job, and was very popular at the depot with his colleagues.” McCullough’s family described him as “the most decent and loving human being we have ever known” in a statement. “Words cannot describe the utterly devastating effect of Brett’s death on his family and friends. We have lost a wonderful husband, father and son in the most awful of circumstances.” Dinnie’s family said he was “a loving and proud dad, son, partner, brother, uncle and friend”, adding: “It is so heart-warming to see how many people have fond memories of Donald and I am sure they have plenty of happy and funny stories to tell. He was a kind, caring and genuine person who was never found without a smile on his face.” In their own tribute, Stuchbury’s family said Christopher, who volunteered at Roxburghe House, a palliative care unit in Aberdeen, was also “a treasured and loved friend to many, including the Targe Towing Team where he was an integral and valued member of staff”. Investigators, which include the British Transport Police, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) and the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), will establish the exact timeline – which remains uncertain – including the length of delay between the derailment and emergency services being alerted at 9.40am. The ScotRail train had turned back after encountering a landslip near Carmont on its way from Aberdeen to Glasgow. The driver requested permission from signallers to return along the track, and walked through the train to the rear locomotive to head back north. The train derailed before it reached nearby Stonehaven. The crash occurred in a rural area with poor mobile reception. According to some reports, a member of the public alerted emergency services before a crew member contacted signallers using Network Rail’s trackside fixed phone line. Speaking after a visit to the scene on Thursday morning, the UK transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said he had asked Network Rail to carry out a quick resilience check and compile a more comprehensive check of its network. “We absolutely must make sure we learn every possible lesson from a tragedy like this,” he said. At her daily coronavirus briefing, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, thanked the emergency services for “immense professionalism and dedication to duty”. She added: “Of course, I’m thinking particularly of the bereaved families who face an experience that all of us dread – coming to terms with the sudden and tragic loss of a loved one. No words can ease their pain nor the awful reality that they are now forced to confront. But the hearts of a nation are with them today.”"

 **[PA Pundits – International](https://papundits.wordpress.com/2020/01/01/consumer-victory-trump-pulls-plug-on-plans-to-kill-the-lightbulb/)**



As the year came to a close, the nanny state took it in the chin. Plans by the usual suspects – environmentalists, Capitol Hill know-it-alls, and other assorted busybodies — to regulate the incandescent lightbulb out of existence were tossed aside by the Trump Energy Department (DOE).



In 2007, the Democrat-controlled Congress and the Bush White House teamed up to impose tighter energy efficiency standards for “general service” lightbulbs. The goal was to set federal energy efficiency standards so high that traditional incandescent lightbulbs would disappear from store shelves and be replaced by compact fluorescent and LED bulbs. People were assured this would save them zillions in electricity bills while saving the planet from catastrophic climate change.



Lightbulb manufacturers were given several years to comply with the government-mandated transition. For those pushing the scheme, consumer choice was never a consideration. Yet eleven days before stricter energy efficiency standards were to begin, effective Jan. 1, 2020, DOE announced the regulations “are not economically justified.”



 **Innovation and Technology, Not Government Overregulation**



“Today the Trump Administration chose to protect consumer choice by ensuring that the American people do not pay the price for unnecessary overregulation from the federal government,” Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said in a statement. “Innovation and technology are already driving progress, increasing the efficiency and affordability of lightbulbs, without federal government intervention. The American people will continue to have a choice on how they light their homes.”



The new rule affects pair-shaped bulbs and a range of other forms of lighting, including three-way bulbs, cone-shaped reflector bulbs used in recessed and track lighting, candle-shaped bulbs used in chandeliers and sconces, and round globe-shaped bulbs used in bathroom fixtures.



People who use dimmers in their homes and offices should also be pleased, because all incandescent lightbulbs are dimmable. LED lightbulbs also work on dimmers, but only if you have dimmable LED bulbs.



DOE said in its analysis that bringing traditional incandescent lightbulbs up to higher efficiency standards would triple the cost of bulbs.



“The increase is not economically justified because the bulbs do not last long enough for the energy savings to surpass the higher upfront price,” DOE noted.



 **Undoing Past Mistakes with Toilets and Dishwashers**



Americans have already paid dearly for government meddling in household appliances and fixtures. Under previous administrations, the Energy Department mandated low-flow toilets that don’t flush properly, wasting an enormous amount of water. It also issued “energy efficiency” standards for dishwashers. And how did that work out? Today’s dishwashers don’t clean dishes properly, forcing many people to run the machines a second time to get them clean. That wastes both water and electricity, driving up utility bills for consumers. The Trump administration is now undoing DOE’s screwing up the nation’s dishwashers by considering new, more sensible standards.



So, we begin 2020 with a tip of the hat to Thomas Edison, who gave us the first fully functional incandescent lightbulb in 1879. A constant tinkerer, his persistence and creativity improved the lives of millions of people the world over.

I have never known of a person who does so little and yet gets so many accolades. Jacinda Ardern, our laziest and most ineffective prime minister of all time has now been given yet another award. She has been named [‘Pacific Person of the Year’](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/face-of-the-day-110/)… although exactly what she has done for the Pacific to actually deserve this title is not exactly clear.



New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been named ‘Pacific Person of the Year’ by regional publication _Islands Business_ magazine. 



The magazine’s editor Samisoni Pareti said each year his publication attempted to look at the person, people or organisations that had made an impact on the Pacific. 



Pareti said Ardern was given the 2019 title because of [her work at the Pacific Islands Forum](https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/115010777/australia-has-to-answer-to-the-pacific-on-climate-change-pm-ardern) to bring consensus around the issue of climate change. 



Ah right. She has been given the award for virtue signalling. She talked a lot about climate change at the Pacific Island forum but as we all know, she has done very little to actually help the islands. Well, I guess we give them a lot of money, but so does Australia. However, it would be a cold day in hell before they would have given that award to Scott Morrison, as he is – in their view – an evil promoter of fossil fuels.



So is China, with whom some of the islands are negotiating significant loans, but hey… what is that to do with anything? Let’s just hammer Australia, shall we?



“It was Prime Minister Ardern’s skills at negotiation, diplomacy and her charisma […] that saved the day for Pacific Island countries, Pacific Island leaders. 



Saved the day? How did she ‘save the day’? What exactly has she done to improve the lot of the Pacific Islands? Nothing, of course. It was merely ‘her charisma’. Yes, of course. The forum was a fashion shoot.



Pareti said her handling of the [Christchurch terror attacks](https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2019/03/end-of-our-innocence/) was also commendable. 



Nothing to do with the Pacific Islands though.



“That really drew our attention to Prime Minister Ardern and from then on we started watching how she performed, not only in parliament but in her dealings with crisis and her own electorate and country.”



They have been watching her in parliament, protected by her henchmen, failing to answer any of the questions? That is when she is there. She is usually at some primary school, talking to children who don’t ask any difficult questions. They did well to find her in parliament at all.



PARETI SAID ARDERN HAD BEEN A BREATH OF FRESH AIR IN TERMS OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN THE ISLANDS.



“SHE IS A YOUNG PERSON, SHE IS A WOMAN, SHE IS A MOTHER. SHE HAS GOT EVERYTHING THAT I GUESS ONE WOULD WISH UPON A PACIFIC ISLAND LEADER.



So there you have it. She got the award, not for doing anything remarkable, or for improving people’s lives, but because she is young, a woman and a mother. That’s it.



Just like all of her other accolades really. I hear she has been nominated for an Oscar this year too.

A new federal report on school choice has just been released, and it is full of good news about private schooling, except for one thing: its market share is small, and getting smaller. In large part this is because private institutions are competing against schools for which people must pay taxes and are “free” to users: public schools, including charter schools that people often see as private (minus pesky tuition, plus state testing and, often, other intrusive government rules). Still, chartering is better than simply being assigned to a school based on your home address. Which brings us to some highlights:



 **Decreased Government Assignment to Schools**



Add together all the homeschooling, private schooling, charters, and choice among district public schools, and the percentage of families attending an assigned public school has dropped from 74 percent in 1999 to 69 percent in 2016. Still way too high for a free country, but moving in the right direction.





**Private Schools are Safer and Kinder Than Public**



We’ve seen this studied before, but this report again shows that private schools as a whole are safer and have better climates than public schools. As the charts below indicate, private schools are the sites of less gang activity, hate‐​related graffiti, hate‐​related utterances, and bullying than public schools.





**Private Schools are Far More Satisfying on Many Measures**



Whether it’s teachers, academic standards, discipline, staff interactions, or the school overall, parents using private schools are much more likely to be “very satisfied” even than parents who have chosen a public school.





These results would change, at least somewhat, were we to adjust them for family income, race, or other variables. But it is hard to spin this as anything but a positive report for the ability to choose among private schools.

"Northern Ireland’s transition from intractable division to peaceful co-existence has been remarkable. In a conflict that has claimed the lives of 3,529 people, any attempt at building an enduring peace settlement is rightly heralded as significant. But Northern Ireland, and Belfast particularly, is scarred by a 40 year legacy of violence. The city’s deep cultural and political divisions between Catholic and Protestant communities are reinforced by a network of oxymoronically named “peace walls” – physical barriers erected to “keep the peace”. Proposed by the British Army in 1969 as a temporary solution to keep warring factions apart, they have become an expanding network of around 100 semi-permanent barriers more than 34km long and reaching, at their highest point, 7.5m tall. Often referred to as “interfaces”, these barriers range from solid concrete walls to corrugated or chain-link metal fence, erected where sporadic inter-community violence remains. Earlier research from Shirlow and Murtagh in 2006 revealed that these peace walls tend also to appear in areas of higher socio-economic deprivation. This adds a further dimension to the legacy of the Troubles that highlights the link between community conflict and deeply embedded inequality. These peace walls are closely linked to issues of territory and identity by helping to define boundaries along sectarian lines. The physical segregation maintained by the walls creates an environment in which daily life involves interactions solely with members of one’s own community, further entrenching community divisions. Children and young people growing up in this “new” Northern Ireland experience not the sectarian violence of the Troubles, but  comfortable separation supported by physical barriers. A remarkable peace, then, but at what cost? Community organisations and NGOs have sought to address these issues of de facto segregation and division. Some focus on violence and security at the flashpoints. Others organise events to strengthen cross-community contact “across the lines”. To some extent, their success is limited. Growing up in segregated communities breeds suspicion meaning that, for many children growing up in Northern Ireland’s divided communities, their understanding of each other is derived from past narratives from parents or elders. Without removing the peace walls, the situation is unlikely to improve. As it is, this sort of interaction is a minimum required to alleviate potentially explosive suspicion and distrust.  Taking advantage of this rather unsatisfactory outcome, a growing tourism industry has blossomed that offers overseas visitors the chance to see the legacy of the conflict through a tour of Belfast’s peace walls. This seems as good a signal as any that the time has come to remove these barriers, but making it happen has proven complicated. In January 2012 the International Fund for Ireland launched a £2m million initiative to bring down the walls and promote cross-community contact and shared community space. Recent research conducted by the University of Ulster found that, some 15 years after the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, 76% of the public wanted to see the walls come down. Professor William JV Neil referred to Belfast’s “twin-speed transition”, where despite the segregation and entrenched division embodied by the peace walls, the absence of daily violence has allowed the city to break from its former routine and move toward a typical consumerist culture as found in other European capitals. But far fewer of those living on or near an peace wall are as receptive to their immediate removal. Many value the feeling of safety that they bring. And without their support, it is hard to see how the walls could ever be anything other than a semi-permanent feature of the Belfast landscape. My research leads back to the longstanding, structural, economic inequalities within the communities living around the walls. There needs to be a greater emphasis on creating an environment where there is a sense of opportunity, not “quick fix” cross-community contact. The study, Growing up on an Interface, focuses on the experiences of children and young people growing up alongside the peace walls. It is of paramount importance to ensure good cross-community relations. But only sustained economic investment within the separated communities – communities with often alarming levels of deprivation, inequality, and childhood poverty – can deliver the better living conditions that are necessary to create an atmosphere in which cross-community relations can be improved. Only then will it truly be possible to begin dismantling the walls, this final reminder of our as yet incomplete peace."
"**Ethiopia's human rights commission has said it will send a team to investigate reports of mass killings of civilians in the northern Tigray state.**
The commission, appointed by the government but independent, said it was aware of reports of ""ethnic profiling"" being undertaken in the area.
PM Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre. Its officials have denied involvement.
The UN human rights chief warned the killings could amount to war crimes.
Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera), a town in the South West Zone of Tigray.
There have been long-standing tensions between Ethiopia's government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state.
Prime Minister Abiy ordered a military operation against the TPLF earlier this month after he accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops - claims the TPLF also deny. There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray.
The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
The human rights group Amnesty International, said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"" on 9 November.
It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from.
Witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"", Amnesty said.
Getting independently verified information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down.
Mr Abiy said that fighters backing the TPLF went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra.
Some witnesses also said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"".
In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings.
It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
**By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya**
Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut.
There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed.
In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped.
Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders.
On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region.
I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.
As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible."
"The Carbon Sense Coalition today claimed that all government efforts to stop global warming and cut carbon dioxide emissions were anti-life and against the interests of mankind.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that this generation of foolish politicians are the first in history to complain about the beneficial effects that have always accompanied the periodic but short warm eras that punctuate earth’s history.
“The human story is intimately tied to the grand cycles of climate and the Chicken Littles should study these before squawking.

“Distant climate history is well recorded in rock strata, ice cores, tree rings, ancient shore lines, marine sediments, pollen distribution, fossil occurrences, coral reef growth, and carbon isotope ratios. More recent history is abundantly supplemented in clay tablets, cave paintings, rock art, ancient scrolls, inscriptions, historical events and records, monuments and epitaphs, the rise and fall of empires and direct records of temperature, sun spots, river levels, rainfall, droughts, floods, heat waves and bone chilling blizzards.
“Anyone who studies these records will see that eras warmer than today are periodic but short chapters in the earth story. The most recent major ice age ended a mere 11,500 year ago, when the Modern Interglacial commenced. Since then, earth has experienced five warm eras.
“In the first warm era starting about 4300 BC, the Sahara bloomed with plants, forests spread over Northern Europe and Canada and there was sufficient water for irrigation in Arabia. This era ended when blizzards and ice returned for nearly 1,000 years. Another short warm era started about 1450 BC, but was ended by another bout of cold dry weather that caused depopulation in Greece and Turkey and hardship everywhere.
“In the Roman Warm era, starting about 250 BC, the world smiled again and populations grew. But the warmth was cut short by the return of the snows which forced Vikings and Norsemen out of their frozen North to pillage and then colonise warmer southern lands.
“Then we had the Medieval Warm Period, starting about 800 AD, a time of great achievement and prosperity. Farmers moved back into Scotland and Norway, Greenland was colonised and corn was grown. Vineyards produced wine near Manchester, in East Prussia and Norway. Even Tasmania warmed up. Trade and industry flourished and people had surpluses for culture and education. Cambridge, Oxford and Bologna Universities were founded and cathedrals and temples were built at Westminster Abbey, Notre Dame, Canterbury, Cologne, Florence, Castile and Angkor Wat.
“But Jack Frost returned with the Little Ice Age starting about 1300 AD. Famine, food riots and disease again stalked Europe. Glaciers advanced, ice caps expanded, droughts and blizzards became more common and gales wracked Europe (and destroyed the Spanish Armada). Frosts killed orchards, North Sea cod moved south, food prices soared and farms were abandoned. In Scotland and Norway the capitals moved south and villages were abandoned. The Greenland colony perished. During the frigid years of the Dalton Minimum (1790 – 1820 AD) Napoleon’s Grand Army perished in a bitter Russian winter.
“Then in 1860, with no help from men burning coal or oil, earth started to warm again. This continued until 1942. A cooling spell from 1942 to 1976 had the Alarmists worried that the ice was about to return, but warming resumed from 1976 to 1998. Temperatures have been cooling slightly since then, despite the boom in burning of coal and oil.
“Even a casual glance at climate and human history will show that the warm eras like today are far more beneficial for all life than the cold dry eras.
“People prefer warm climates. They do not flock to Alaska, Archangel or Antarctica for winter – they head for Bermuda, the Black Sea or Bali. All over the world, the human race is migrating towards the sun belts – Florida, the Riviera, and Capricornia – very few volunteer to live in Siberia or Patagonia. President Putin voiced what many Russians must think – “a bit of warmth would be welcome here”.
“Moreover, a bit of warmth would vastly increase the land suitable for growing food and fibres. On the other hand, a slight cooling would take much of the farmlands of Canada, Northern Eurasia and New Zealand out of production, and parts of Tasmania and Victoria may have to convert from producing wheat and dairy products to farming caribou or reindeer.
“Warm eras also provide more rainfall because of the additional evaporation from oceans, lakes, snow and ice.
“When warmth and moisture are combined with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the beneficial effects on plant life are multiplied. A doubling of the CO2 content of the air would have insignificant effect on global warming but would have marvellous effects on plant (and then animal) life:

Growth rate of herbaceous plants would increase 30%
Growth rate of forest plants would increase 50%
All plants would be more tolerant of drought and heat
Food production would need less land and less artificial fertiliser
“All of this magic can be achieved by allowing man’s activities to recycle more CO2 and water to the atmosphere. Why then are politicians taxing carbon and encouraging people to waste money on foolish schemes such as trying to bury valuable carbon dioxide in artificial and expensive carbon cemeteries?
“The whole animal kingdom, including mankind, relies totally on plants to survive. Without grasses and cereals on land and plankton in the sea, most of mankind would starve.
“All plants need moisture, warmth, and carbon dioxide to grow and flourish. Why then are we having hysterics because the earth is currently blessed with more than average of these three magic life sustainers?
“Even the dumbest sheep in Australia knows that being warm, watered and well fed is better than being cold, thirsty and starving.”
“Maybe we should give sheep a vote?”

Federal spending is on a tear. The February budget deal hiked discretionary spending by $300 billion over two years, and rapid growth in entitlement programs continues unabated. The government will spend $1 trillion more next year than it collects in revenue, and rising amounts after that. The gusher of red ink is remarkable given that we are in the ninth year of economic expansion.



Republican control of the House, the Senate, and the White House is failing the test of fiscal sanity. Another trial for policymakers will be a new farm bill, which is on the agenda because some current farm programs expire in September. In his latest budget, President Trump proposed cuts to farm subsidies, but congressional agriculture committees may try to move ahead on legislation devoid of any reforms.



After the 1996 farm bill made reforms, every farm bill since — 2002, 2008, 2014 — went in the opposite direction and increased subsidies. The 2008 bill was so bad that even big‐​spending President George W. Bush vetoed it, although he was overridden by Congress.





Agricultural subsidies distort markets, harm the environment, line the pockets of the rich, and cost billions of dollars.



The 2014 bill ended one major subsidy program but added two new ones — called ARC (Agriculture Risk Coverage) and PLC (Price Loss Coverage) — that have ended up costing billions of dollars more than promised. And the largest subsidy program — crop insurance — now costs $8 billion a year, or double the average cost during the Bush years. All in all, farm subsidies cost taxpayers more than $20 billion a year.



Each farm bill rejiggers the subsidy structure, but the programs have not become any more sensible. Farm subsidies are welfare for the well‐​to‐​do. The average income of farm households in 2016 was $117,918, or 42 percent higher than the $83,143 average of all U.S. households.



Those figures are for all farmers, but federal subsidies are tilted toward the largest and wealthiest farmers — mainly growers of corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, and rice. New estimates by scholars at the American Enterprise Institute find that 60 percent of subsidies from the three large crop programs (insurance, ARC, and PLC) go to the largest 10 percent of farms. Politicians claim to support small farmers, but the opposite is true.



Many billionaires have received farm subsidies. Looking from 1995 to 2014, the Environmental Working Group found that 50 people on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans have received farm subsidies. But today the largest pot of subsidies is laundered through crop‐​insurance companies, a practice that hides the identities of the recipients. However, the Government Accountability Office found that at least four current recipients of these subsidies have a net worth of more than $1.5 billion.



Farm subsidies are unfair to the taxpayers who pay the bills, but they also harm the broader economy. By interfering with market mechanisms, subsidies can induce overproduction, distort crop choice, undermine cost control, and inflate land prices.



To an extent, federal subsidies are capitalized in higher values for farmland, which in turn raises prices for renting farmland. So the ultimate beneficiaries of subsidies are landowners as much as farmers, who are often different people because half of all U.S. cropland is rented.



Farm subsidies harm the environment. They draw marginal lands into production, so areas that might have been used for forests, grasslands, and wetlands are used instead for crops. Since marginal lands tend to have poorer soils or climates, they may require more intense use of fertilizers and pesticides to be productive.



The upshot is that fiscal conservatives, liberals concerned about income inequality, and environmentalists should all line up against another big farm bill. Politically, President Trump does not want to lose support in the farm states, so it is not surprising that his budget promised to “maintain a strong safety‐​net for farmers,” even as it proposed cuts. But why can’t farmers create their own safety nets?



Farming is risky because crop prices and yields fluctuate. But businesses in other industries face big risks as well. Think about the fast pace of change in technology industries, or the large price swings in the mining and energy industries. Businesses in those industries prosper or sink depending on their own skill, planning, and luck without a federal subsidy cushion.



Farmers know they face risks, so they should save when times are good to weather the tougher years when they come along. When corn prices are high, corn farmers should save their excess profits so that when prices fall they can tap their savings. Farmers can also borrow, buy market‐​based insurance, and use financial tools to hedge their risks, such as futures contracts. The problem is that the gusher of farm subsidies has replaced, or crowded out, greater use of such market financial tools.



Diversification is another strategy to reduce risks. Farmers can diversify their crop plantings to reduce risks from fluctuating yields and price changes, and they can diversify their planting locations to reduce risks from adverse weather.



Farm households can, and do, diversify their sources of income to include both farm and off‐​farm revenues. Department of Agriculture data show that three‐​quarters of farm‐​household income today comes from off‐​farm sources. That statistic has been rising over the years, which has promoted greater financial stability. Even though crop prices have been down in recent years, farms continue to generally have low levels of debt and lower bankruptcy rates than other industries.



Farmers do not need federal welfare, and the Trump reforms would cut some of the waste, as would reforms proposed by AEI, Cato, and the Heritage Foundation. Republicans must decide whether to pass another bloated farm bill or stand up to the farm lobbies and extract needed cuts.

The Warmunists are fond of stating that the warming in the late twentieth century was unusual and unprecedented, and could only have been caused by rising CO2. They refuse to recognize that the early twentieth century warming was just as rapid. Of course that statement is also based on the lack of data for earlier times.
But there ARE data for earlier times. The Central England Temperature (CET) data set extends all the way back to 1659 and has been maintained to this day. Here is a window into an early 90-year section of that data set, overlaid with the last 90 years.

Figure 1 is CET and GHCN temperatures from 1925 to the present, compared to CET temperatures from 1660 to 1750. The 45-year span from 1692 to 1737 is highlighted in red.
If the trends for all three 90-year data sets are compared, they are nearly identical, from 0.084 to 0.091°C per decade warming.
But the 45-year span from 1692 to 1737 was warming at nearly five times that rate, 0.4°C per decade. This warming rate is more than twice as fast as the late twentieth century rate, for twice as long.
Central England warmed by two degrees, three degrees if one measures from the coldest year to the warmest in that interval. For comparison, here is the GHCN data for the modern period.

Figure 2 is the modern era from GHCN with the modern warming in red and the early twentieth century warming in green. 
Please note that I have picked the time period with the most warming in that interval, including from the bottom of the 1976 La Niña to the top of the 1998 El Niño. The early twentieth century warming began with the 1914-15 El Niño. If the El Niño and La Niña events are removed, both warming periods have a trend of about 0.16°C per decade. The 0.4°C/decade warming period from 1692 to 1737 must have been very scary for the eighteenth century climatologists.
It all came to an abrupt end, however, in 1739 and 1740. The temperature dropped three degrees practically overnight in climate terms. See figure 1. What caused that? A volcano!
On the southern end of Hokkaido, in Japan, there is a large caldera called Shikotsu. It is now filled with a lake. This caldera was formed about 35,000 years ago. On the edge of the caldera three volcanic vents have been intermittently active since then. One of those, Tarumai, (or Tarumae) is active to this day, including four VE5, very large eruptions in 6950 BCE, 800 BCE, 1667, and 1739. Though both the 1667 and 1739 eruptions were classed as VE5, the 1739 event pushed enough gas into the stratosphere to affect global climate.
“In the northern hemisphere density of yearly tree ring [sic] have changed in AD 1740 (Briffa et al., 1998) suggesting the eruption of 1739 affected global climate.”
Sheveluch, on Kamchatka, is also implicated, but that eruption was only a VE3.
The resulting cold caused the “Great Irish Frost” of 1740, where Irish harbors and rivers froze over, preventing import of grain, frost killed the potato crop, and 20 to 30% of the Irish population died of cold and famine. The cold affected all of northern Europe, but was a disaster for Ireland due to the politics of the time. For a scholarly treatise on it see The Irish famine of 1740–1741: famine vulnerability and “climate migration”, here. The implication is that the good years prior to 1740, made Ireland in particular, vulnerable to a cold snap. This is the thing to be feared in our future rather than continued warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo warming in Andes Mountains since 1950
By Dr.Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German translated by P Gosselin)
The unpopular hiatus just keeps coming up. But climate activists are remaining defiant and continue to deny it exists. They continue to claim that temperature is rising. Yet, the scientific community has long since accepted the pause and has written a series of papers on the phenomenon. For example Vuille et al. 2015:
Impact of the global warming hiatus on Andean temperature
The recent hiatus in global warming is likely to be reflected in Andean temperature, given its close dependence on tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). While recent work in the subtropical Andes has indeed documented a cooling along coastal areas, trends in the tropical Andes show continued warming. Here we analyze spatiotemporal temperature variability along the western side of the Andes with a dense station network updated to 2010 and investigate its linkages to tropical Pacific modes of variability. Results indicate that the warming in tropical latitudes has come to a halt and that the subtropical regions continue to experience cooling. Trends, however, are highly dependent on elevation. While coastal regions experience cooling, higher elevations continue to warm. The coastal cooling is consistent with the observed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) fingerprint and can be accurately simulated using a simple PDO-analog model. Much of the PDO imprint is modulated and transmitted through adjustments in coastal SST off western South America. At inland and higher-elevation locations, however, temperature trends start to diverge from this PDO-analog model in the late 1980s and have by now emerged above the 1σ model spread. Future warming at higher elevation is likely and will contribute to further vertical stratification of atmospheric temperature trends. In coastal locations, future warming or cooling will depend on the potential future intensification of the South Pacific anticyclone but also on continued temperature dependence on the state of the PDO.
65 years without warming
Take a look at Figure 2b of this paper. The blue curve is the temperature development in the extra-tropical Andes. Clear to see: No warming since 1950! That’s a full 65 years without warming. The scientists found a strong influence by the 60-year Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

Share this...FacebookTwitterTo understand today’s Green Movement, it is necessary to go back almost a thousand years in history. Prominent television producer and director Martin Durkin does precisely just that in his outstanding recent essay: NAZI GREENS – An Inconvenient History, where he writes of the movement’s “gushing idealization of ‘Nature’”.
Makes us wonder why the current Pope has hitched the Vatican wagon to the green movement. Could he be so misled, or cunning?
Some excerpts:
How can anyone read the Nazi Heidegger, or the writers of the Volk movement, or indeed Mein Kampf, and say, with a straight face, that environmentalism started with Rachel Carson?
And:
Like Nietzsche and the Volkists, Hitler and the Nazis hated the Enlightenment.  They rejected its humanism just as they spurned the human-centered morality of the Judeo-Christian tradition.”
And:

In short, the Volkists and Nazis were green.  In 1934, a year after the Nazis took power, as Professor Thomas Lekan describes, they ‘declared that the Third Reich had ushered in a new era of environmental stewardship … They foresaw a new era of ‘organic’ land use planning that stressed long-term sustainability over short-term profitability.’  The leading Nazi Walther Schoenichen declared that the German countryside was to be purified of the ‘un-German spirit of commerce.’  The same year they passed a law ‘Concerning the Protection of the Racial purity of Forest Plants’, and the following year the wide-ranging Reichsnaturschutzgesetz (Reich Nature Protection Law). “
And:
Of course the green policies of the Nazis, like the policies of the greens today, were riddled with contradictions.”
One of these horrendous contradictions is the large-scale blighting of Germany’s idyllic landscape heritage with industrial wind turbines – now numbering close to 25,000.
Durkin advises:
We should heed the warning of Lukács, that, ‘fascist demagogy and tyranny was only the ultimate culmination of a long process which initially had an “innocent” look’.”
Great essay, one that will certainly rattle the green ideologues to the core. Here we see what these people really are. When we look at some of the German scientists behind the movement (won’t mention names) it’s all crystal clear.

"**""Scores and probably hundreds"" of civilians have been massacred in the growing conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia, Amnesty International says.**
Witnesses blamed forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) for Monday's killings but Tigrayan officials have denied that pro-TPLF troops were involved.
Fighting between government forces and the TPLF broke out last week.
Getting information is hard, with phone lines and the internet down.
This would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the conflict.
There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state, and it has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces.
As a result, thousands of civilians have crossed the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
In a statement it said it could confirm that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town in the South West Zone of Ethiopia's Tigray region on the night of 9 November"".
It had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict.
Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's director for East and Southern Africa, called it a ""horrific tragedy"" and urged the government to restore communications and allow monitors access.
Amnesty said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
In a video statement on Thursday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said his forces had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray from TPLF control.
He also accused TPLF-aligned fighters of ""cruelty"", and said when the army took control of the town of Sheraro they ""found bodies of executed defence force personnel whose hands and feet were tied"".
The prime minister ordered government forces to engage forces loyal to the TPLF on 4 November after he said military camps had been attacked.
There have been a number of clashes and air strikes since. Mr Abiy said government forces had made major gains.
The TPLF was the most powerful member of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018 and the TPLF refused to join a unified party.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run."
"As a businessman, Donald J. Trump was a serial fabulist whose   boasts about everything he touched routinely crumbled under the slightest scrutiny. As a candidate, Mr. Trump was a magical realist who made fantastical claims punctuated by his favorite verbal tic: “Believe me. ” Yet even jaded connoisseurs of Oval Office dissembling were astonished over the last week by the torrent of bogus claims that gushed from President Trump during his first days in office. “We’ve never seen anything this bizarre in our lifetimes, where up is down and down is up and everything is in question and nothing is real,” said Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity and the author of “935 Lies: The Future of Truth and the Decline of America’s Moral Integrity,” a book about presidential deception. It was not just Mr. Trump’s debunked claim about how many people attended his inauguration, or his insistence (contradicted by his own Twitter posts) that he had not feuded with the intelligence community, or his audacious and   claim that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote only because millions of people voted for her illegally. All week long, news organizations chased down one Trump tall tale after another. PolitiFact, a website devoted to checking the veracity of claims by public officials, published 12 “of the most misleading claims” Mr. Trump made during his first White House interview. The Chicago Tribune found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he claimed two people were shot and killed in Chicago the very hour President Barack Obama was there delivering his farewell address. (There were no shootings, police records showed.) The Philadelphia Inquirer found that Mr. Trump was incorrect when he said the city’s murder rate was “terribly increasing. ” (The murder rate has steadily declined over the last decade.) The indefatigable fact checkers at The Washington Post cataloged 24 false or misleading statements made by the president during his first seven days in office. But for students of Mr. Trump’s long business career, there was much about President Trump’s   ways that was familiar: the mystifying false statements about seemingly trivial details, the rewriting of history to airbrush unwanted facts, the branding as liars those who point out his untruths, the deft conversion of demonstrably false claims into a semantic mush of unverifiable “beliefs. ” Mr. Trump’s falsehoods have long been viewed as a reflexive extension of his vanity, or as his method of compensating for   insecurities. But throughout his business career, Mr. Trump’s most noteworthy deceptions often did double duty, serving not just his ego but also important strategic goals. Mr. Trump’s habitually inflated claims about his wealth, for example, fed his   image of a business genius even as they attracted lucrative licensing deals built around the Trump brand. Nearly 30 years ago, in his   book “The Art of the Deal,” Mr. Trump memorably extolled the advantages of “truthful hyperbole,” which he described as “an innocent form of exaggeration  —   and a very effective form of promotion. ” It is one thing when the hyperbole comes from a reality TV star exaggerating his ratings to a roomful of television critics. The stakes are infinitely higher when it comes from the leader of the free world, and this reality is provoking alarm from many across the political spectrum. Steve Schmidt, who helped manage Senator John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s cascade of falsehoods was “a direct assault on the very idea of representative democracy” in the United States. Mr. Schmidt said that when he heard Mr. Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway defend the Trump administration’s “alternative facts” on NBC’s “Meet the Press” last Sunday, he thought of George Orwell’s “1984,” in which the Ministry of Truth is emblazoned with three slogans: “War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. ” “In a democratic government, there must be truth in order to hold elected officials accountable to their sovereign, which is the people,” Mr. Schmidt said. “All authoritarian societies are built on a foundation of lies and alternative facts, and what is true is what the leader believes, or what is best for the state. ” Mr. Lewis argued that the president’s untruths were a deliberate strategy to position the nation’s leading news organizations as the enemy of his administration. “  becomes an act of war by the media,” he said. Indeed, last Saturday, on Day 2 of his administration, Mr. Trump told hundreds of C. I. A. employees that he had “a running war with the media” and called journalists “among the most dishonest human beings on earth. ” The next day, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, accused the news media of trying to “delegitimize” the new president and promised, “We are not going to sit around and let it happen. ” By Wednesday, Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist, was referring to the news media as “the opposition party” during an interview with The New York Times. “It feels like this was part of the plan all along,” Mr. Lewis said. Doris Kearns Goodwin, a Pulitzer   historian who has written about Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s brazen willingness to deny “objective reality” had, if nothing else, succeeded in diverting public attention from matters of more lasting consequence, like his flurry of executive orders. “I don’t know that he is doing it strategically,” she said, “but it certainly had the impact of a magician’s sleight of hand. ” Deception, dissembling, exaggeration  —   what Fortune magazine called his “astonishing ability to prevaricate”  —   has deep roots in Mr. Trump’s business career. In innumerable interviews over the years, Mr. Trump glibly inflated everything from the size of his speaking fees to the cost of his golf club memberships to the number of units he had sold in new Trump buildings. In project after project, he faced allegations of broken promises, deceit or outright fraud, from Trump University students who said they had been defrauded, to Trump condominium buyers who said they had been fleeced, to   contractors who said Mr. Trump had fabricated complaints about their work to avoid paying them. In the early 1980s, a New York City housing court judge ruled that Mr. Trump had filed a “spurious” lawsuit to harass a tenant into vacating a Trump building. In the early 1990s, a federal judge ruled that despite Mr. Trump’s denials, there was “strong evidence” he and his subordinates had conspired to hire undocumented workers and deprive them of employment benefits. In the case of Trump University, Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that he had “handpicked” each of the instructors who were hired to teach students the secrets of his real estate investing strategies. Yet during a deposition, Mr. Trump struggled to identify a single instructor, even after he was shown their photographs. The price Mr. Trump paid for this record of prevarication was modest and manageable. His lawyers quietly settled cases when necessary, almost always after binding plaintiffs to secrecy. Some major banks and law firms quietly pulled back from doing or seeking business with the Trump Organization. Skeptical judges turned away his libel suit against a journalist who wrote a book calling into question the amount of his wealth. But usually, by the time the truth caught up, Mr. Trump had moved on to the next big thing. Once he stepped into the political arena, however,   operations began cataloging his false statements in ways he never experienced during his years as a real estate developer and reality television star. PolitiFact, for example, has scrutinized 356 specific claims by Mr. Trump and found that more than   of the claims were “mostly false,” “false” or, in 62 cases, “Pants on Fire” false. “Trump is a different kind of figure than we’ve ever seen before in our 10 years of ” Bill Adair, the creator of PolitiFact and a journalism professor at Duke University, said in an interview. “No one has come close to Trump in the high percentage of falsehoods. ” Mr. Trump’s election alone is evidence he did not pay a high price for his plethora of false claims on the campaign trail. Nor are there many signs that his loyal base of supporters is troubled by the misstatements he has made in the first week of his presidency. “There’s no question that the messages and the actions of the first week are deeply resonating with tens of millions of Americans,” Mr. Schmidt said. And even if some Republican leaders in Washington view the president’s behavior as “strange” or “worrisome,” he said, they are for now more focused on the tax cuts and deregulation they hope to achieve under his administration. Mr. Trump has given conflicting signals about whether he understands the difference between fallacies uttered by the president of the United States and promotional puffery from a real estate developer boasting of his latest hotel or golf course. In Mr. Trump’s first interview as president, David Muir of ABC News asked, “Do you think that your words matter more now?” “Yes, very much,” Mr. Trump said. Yet then Mr. Muir asked, “Do you think that talking about millions of illegal votes is dangerous to this country without presenting the evidence?” “No, not at all,” he replied. “Not at all because many people feel the same way that I do. ” As if to prove the point, Mr. Trump then doubled down on his lie about millions of illegal votes. “Believe me, those were Hillary votes,” he said. “And if you look at it, they all voted for Hillary. They all voted for Hillary. They didn’t vote for me. ” For Ms. Goodwin, Mr. Trump’s week of reality distortions brought to mind Lincoln’s address to the Young Men’s Lyceum of Springfield, Ill. on Jan. 27, 1838, where he made an appeal to Enlightenment values as the best antidote to what he called the “mobocratic spirit. ” “Reason  —   cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason  —   must furnish all the materials for our future support and defense,” he said. “He was worrying about authoritarian behavior,” Ms. Goodwin said."
"President Trump’s target for economic growth just got a little more distant. The government reported Friday that the economy grew by only 1. 6 percent last year, shy of what experts had estimated and well below the 4 percent rate that Mr. Trump has vowed to deliver  —   a pledge now cited on the White House website. There are plenty of signs of life in the economy. Consumer spending is healthy, and an index of consumer sentiment just hit a   high. Stocks have been surging, and the jobless rate is near what the Federal Reserve considers full employment. But however solid, the recovery under President Barack Obama never reached exuberance. It is the second longest recovery in American history but the first in the postwar era in which growth for a full year did not hit 3 percent. Mr. Trump made that data point a focus of his campaign, citing factories that closed during the recession but never reopened and workers who gave up looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force. And economists, even if they disagree with his policy prescriptions, acknowledge that many areas have been left behind. While Friday’s report will provide more support for Mr. Trump’s argument, the lackluster pace of economic growth may also complicate the new administration’s plans. Indeed, some of the headwinds in 2016  —   like a widening trade deficit and cautious spending by businesses  —   could persist into 2017 and beyond. In particular, lower exports and higher imports also hurt growth in the fourth quarter, which fell to an annual rate of 1. 9 percent from 3. 5 percent in the prior quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. In 2016, personal consumption  —   which accounts for a majority of economic activity  —   slowed from 2014 and 2015. In addition, the sharp plunge in oil prices over the same period prompted steep cuts in energy production and exploration, contributing to a drop in business investment. All of this underscores why analysts say that Mr. Trump’s growth rate target of 4 percent is audacious at best and fanciful at worst, especially given broader factors like an aging population and the growth rate of 2 percent or so that has prevailed since the recovery began in 2009. “It would defy gravity,” Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago, said. Four percent growth would require big gains in the size of the work force and productivity, but neither is in the offing, Ms. Swonk said, adding, “It’s simple math. ” At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it is ready to raise interest rates a few times this year, and a faster expansion would only accelerate the Fed’s plan to tighten monetary policy to head off inflation. Whatever the growth trajectory is in 2017, Fed officials will have a tricky time navigating the political and economic currents under Mr. Trump. Not only did he criticize the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, during the campaign, but his assessment of the current economy is more downbeat than the Fed’s. One week into the Trump administration, there are many other economic wild cards for policy makers and private forecasters to contemplate, including the impact of congressional efforts to reshape the corporate tax code, trade tensions with Mexico and China, and the proposed repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. Tax cuts could open the way for new spending and investment. But more expensive imports from Mexico could be painful for many consumers, for example, while a trade war with China would hurt American companies like Apple, General Electric and Caterpillar. What is more, although the Commerce Department report focused on the last three full months of Mr. Obama’s second term, anemic economic activity could add to the revenue shortfall the federal government will most likely face from the personal and corporate tax cuts Mr. Trump has discussed. “It’s difficult to see how we would get to 4 percent growth given the current structure of the economy, especially demographics and productivity growth,” said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. “That would be true no matter who is the president. ” The retirement of the baby boomers will limit the size of the labor force, he said, while productivity gains from technology are not expected to accelerate from the current level, as they did with the adoption of the internet or mobile phones in the 1990s. Weak growth does strengthen arguments for a federal program to fortify the nation’s infrastructure  —   an approach Mr. Trump has advocated that could provide an economic stimulus. Since Mr. Trump’s victory in November, many economists have been raising their projected growth rates for the latter half of 2017 and for 2018. That is not necessarily because they feel Mr. Trump’s policies will prove beneficial in the long run. Instead, it is because the tax cuts and infrastructure investments he has called for could bolster the economy in the short term. Mr. Faucher lifted his growth forecast to 2. 4 percent in 2017 and 2. 7 percent in 2018. Previously, he expected output to expand by 2. 25 percent in each year. “Tax cuts and infrastructure spending represent a much more expansionary fiscal policy than we’ve had in some time,” he said. But Mr. Faucher cautioned that increasing the federal deficit, which stood at $587 billion in 2016, by hundreds of billions more in the coming years could increase interest rates, which were already moving higher. Rates, including mortgage rates for home buyers, are already up more than half a percentage point since the election, on expectations of more borrowing and faster growth. But in economics, as in life, everything cuts both ways. The rise in interest rates has also strengthened the dollar relative to other currencies. While that has been good news for American tourists, a stronger currency is bad news for American exporters, with imports becoming cheaper while the price of   products abroad rises. The prospect of a stronger dollar also makes it more difficult to achieve another of Mr. Trump’s economic goals: a revival of the American manufacturing sector. Manufacturers are more dependent on foreign sales than many other businesses, but a rising dollar makes their products less competitive overseas. On Friday, the White House announced a manufacturing jobs initiative, naming chief executives like Andrew N. Liveris of Dow Chemical and Elon Musk of Tesla to the as part of the effort, along with labor leaders from the A. F. L. . I. O. The dollar is rising on expectations of faster growth in the United States and because of the jump in domestic interest rates, which make American financial assets like bonds more appealing to global investors than   debt in Europe and Asia. “Mr. Trump can’t control the dollar, and that will be a big factor this year,” Mr. Faucher said. “Trade is likely to be a drag on growth. ”"
"WASHINGTON  —   Few companies have been as intimately tied to the Democratic Party in recent years as Google. So now that Donald J. Trump is president, the giant company, in Silicon Valley parlance, is having to pivot. The shift was evident a day after Congress began its new session this month. That evening, about 70 lawmakers, a majority of them Republicans, were feted at the stately Smithsonian Arts and Industries Building, where they clinked champagne and bourbon glasses and posed for selfies with the 600 guests assembled in their honor. The event’s main host was not from the Republican establishment. Instead, the party was primarily financed and anchored by Google. “We’ve partnered with Google on events before, but nothing like this party,” said Alex Skatell, founder of The Independent Journal Review, a news   with a   millennial audience, which also helped host the event. The event was emblematic of an   by Google. Over the last eight years, the company was closely associated with former President Barack Obama. Google employees overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama’s presidential campaigns, and some later took roles in his administration. Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company,  advised the Obama White House. And last year, Google employees gave $1. 3 million to Hillary Clinton’s campaign to succeed Mr. Obama, compared with $26, 000 to the Trump campaign, according to federal filings. Now, the tech giant is scrambling to forge ties with Mr. Trump’s new administration and to strengthen its relationship with a   Congress. Most important, Google is trying to change the perception that it is a Democratic stronghold. That has led to events like the party at the Smithsonian, which the institution said had cost at least $50, 000. Mr. Schmidt has embarked on an East Coast charm offensive of Republican political leaders, including twice visiting Mr. Trump and his advisers at Trump Tower. Last month, Google also posted an opening to fill a position for a “conservative outreach” employee in its Washington office. “Google has a target on its back because it is fundamentally viewed as a Democratic company,” said Gigi Sohn, a former senior adviser to Tom Wheeler, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. “Even though it has reached out to Republicans, it can’t shake the image. ” Google said it had long had Republican lobbyists and had not changed its strategy. “We’ve worked with both Republicans and Democrats for over a decade, advocating policies to encourage economic growth, innovation and entrepreneurialism,” the company said in a statement. “We’ll continue to do exactly that. ” A spokesman for Mr. Schmidt added, “Eric has a long record of working constructively and energetically on important technology issues with American and world leaders across the political spectrum. ” Other Silicon Valley tech companies, like Facebook, are in a similar predicament. The perception is that they lean left and their executives backed Mrs. Clinton. Many are now also pledging to work with Mr. Trump and paid court to the new president at a December tech summit meeting. One week into the administration, Google and other tech companies began to push back, criticizing Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration bans. The company said an estimated 187 employees were affected by the order and it urged any of those employees who were abroad to work with the company to return safely to the United States. ”It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,” Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, said in a memo to employees over the weekend. “We’ve always made our views on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so. ” Google has much at stake as it repositions itself. During the Obama years, Google avoided American antitrust charges, even as European regulators accused the firm of antitrust violations in search and in its mobile business. Google also successfully pushed a policy agenda that included the creation of net neutrality rules in 2015 and the defeat of online piracy laws in 2012. Now warning shots against Google have been fired by those in Mr. Trump’s circle. Some of the president’s advisers have debated whether the tech behemoth deserves more antitrust scrutiny, according to two people briefed by the new administration’s transition team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and Trump transition adviser, also compared the power that Google had under Mr. Obama to that which the oil giant Exxon Mobil had under President George W. Bush. Under President Bush, the administration largely agreed with Exxon’s skeptical stance on climate change policy. Mr. Trump’s team is particularly wary of one Google executive  —   Mr. Schmidt  —   who has been allied with Democrats. During last year’s presidential campaign, Mr. Schmidt counseled Mrs. Clinton on strategy. A photo of him wearing a staff badge at her   party circulated widely in the conservative media. Mr. Trump’s advisers, including his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, have complained about Mr. Schmidt’s funding of a   called the Groundwork, which provided data and other technology for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. They also suspected Google was skewing search results in favor of Mrs. Clinton, said Barry Bennett, a former senior adviser for Mr. Trump’s campaign. “Mr. Schmidt spent millions and millions of his personal money to defeat Donald Trump,” Mr. Bennett said. “It takes a particular amount of gumption to pretend that never happened. ” Google has denied it tweaked its search results, which are determined by algorithms, and the company declined to comment on Mr. Schmidt. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment. For many years, Google’s support of Democrats was plain. Google’s political action committee and employees ranked third in all donations to Mr. Obama’s 2012 campaign at $804, 240, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2008, Google’s PAC and employees were sixth with $817, 855. The company did not rank in the top 20 for donations to Mr. Obama’s Republican opponents in either of those elections. About five years ago, Google began diversifying its bets. The company forged ties with the   House of Representatives and started addressing the beginning of an antitrust investigation into whether the company was using its search dominance to suppress competing travel, map and restaurant sites. In 2011, Google hired Stewart Jeffries, a former member of the House Judiciary Committee, to lobby Republicans on Capitol Hill. That same year, it quadrupled its number of outside lobbying firms  —   including many with Republican lobbyists  —   to 24, from six in 2010. In 2012, Google named a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari of New York, to lead its Washington office. Google also sponsored conservative think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. The company has hosted Republican lawmakers including the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, and Darrell Issa of California at its headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Google’s Washington office is now roughly split between Republican and Democrats. The company spent $15. 43 million in lobbying in 2016, according to federal lobbying documents, making it among the top dozen firms in lobbying spending last year. For the first time last year, Google’s PAC gave more to Republican congressional candidates than to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Even so, Google’s Republican ties got little notice because of the company’s strong relationship with Democrats. Several Google employees joined the Obama administration while dozens of government bureaucrats were employed by the tech company. Google’s head of global public policy, Caroline Atkinson, was Mr. Obama’s former national security adviser. A former Google executive, Megan Smith, became the nation’s chief technology officer. During his presidency, Mr. Obama also repeatedly supported proposals backed by Google, including net neutrality in 2015 and cable   box reforms last year. “Google was very much treated as the golden child by the Obama administration,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, which has been critical of Google for privacy policies. Since the election, Google has accelerated efforts to win over the Republican White House and Congress. Before his visits to Trump Tower, Mr. Schmidt met with Mr. McCarthy and Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, who is chairman of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Days after Mr. Trump’s victory, Google also contacted The Independent Journal Review, which it had worked with on events during the Republican campaign debates. Google told the news   that it would provide the main funding for the party at the Smithsonian. Google said the event was open to both parties. But pairing with the conservative site sent a clear message to attendees. “We definitely helped draw Republicans and people from across the spectrum,” said the site’s founder, Mr. Skatell. At the party, several Republican lawmakers were positive about their tech host, brushing off questions about the company’s heft and power. “When I think of technology and Google, I don’t think of dominance,” said Representative Bradley Byrne, a Republican from Alabama. “I think of innovation. ”"
"**Ethiopia has urged the international community to refrain from ""unwelcome and unlawful acts of interference"" in its affairs following calls to end the conflict in the northern Tigray region.**
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has called the military offensive a ""law-enforcement operation"".
His deadline to Tigray fighters to surrender will lapse on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed and thousands have been forced from their homes.
Aid groups fear the conflict could trigger a humanitarian crisis and destabilise the Horn of Africa region.
The UN has said it was alarmed by the threat of major hostilities if the Ethiopian army advanced on Tigray's capital, Mekelle, home to about 500,000 people.
In a statement released on Wednesday morning, Mr Abiy said when it came to help from outside ""the international community should stand by until the government of Ethiopia submits its requests for assistance"".
On Tuesday, a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the fighting in Tigray ended without a statement, according to AFP news agency, with African countries reportedly requesting more time to allow for diplomatic efforts by the African Union to continue.
Meanwhile, the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell met with Ethiopia's foreign minister to discuss the conflict.
""I expressed my great concern regarding increasing ethnic-targeted violence, numerous casualties and violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law,"" Mr Borrell said after their Tuesday meeting.
On Sunday, Mr Abiy issued a 72-hour ultimatum to Tigray's forces, telling them to surrender as they were ""at a point of no return"".
But Tigray's forces have vowed to keep fighting, with their leader Debretsion Gebremichael saying they are ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
Meanwhile, Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a youth group from the Tigray region of being behind a massacre earlier this month in which it says more than 600 civilians were killed.
The commission says the group stabbed, bludgeoned and burned to death non-Tigrayan residents of the town of Mai-Kadra with the collusion of local forces.
Human rights group Amnesty International first highlighted reports of a massacre in Mai-Kadra but was unable to confirm who was behind it, or exactly how many died.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party which controls Tigray, denied involvement, and called for an independent international investigation into the killings.
The conflict started after Ethiopia's central government accused the TPLF of holding an illegal election and attacking a military base to steal weapons.
In response, Mr Abiy - a former Nobel Peace Prize winner - ordered a military offensive against forces in Tigray, accusing them of treason.
The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing Mr Abiy does not have a mandate to lead the country after postponing national elections because of coronavirus.
Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed ""alarm at reports of a heavy build-up of tanks and artillery around Mekelle"".
She called on all sides to give ""clear and unambiguous orders to their forces"" to spare civilians.
""The highly aggressive rhetoric on both sides regarding the fight for Mekelle is dangerously provocative and risks placing already vulnerable and frightened civilians in grave danger,"" Ms Bachelet said. ""I fear such rhetoric will lead to further violations of international humanitarian law.""
The rhetoric has been ramped up in recent days. On Sunday, the Ethiopian army said there would be ""no mercy"" for Mekelle's residents when its soldiers ""encircle"" the city.
Such talk could constitute a war crime, Ms Bachelet said.
Mr Abiy has repeatedly said the Ethiopian army would protect civilians in its campaign against forces in Tigray.
But Ms Bachelet said a virtual communications blackout in Tigray was making it difficult for the UN to monitor the human rights and humanitarian situation.
""Reports continue to emerge of arbitrary arrests and detentions, killings, as well as discrimination and stigmatisation of ethnic Tigrays,"" the UN said.
At least 40,000 refugees have already crossed into neighbouring Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
A couple sit looking pensive by the wall of the UN building in Hamdayit in eastern Sudan's Kassala region.
Smoke rising from a charcoal burner partially blurs their faces. The woman lines up tiny cups as she waits for coffee to boil in an earth kettle.
A traditional coffee ceremony is performed even in the worst of circumstances.
They've recently arrived at the transit camp, having fled from Tigray.
A young man interrupts this moment when he walks up to me. He worked as a customs official in the Tigray town of Humera but fled three days ago, he tells me.
I ask why he hasn't yet moved to the refugee camp further away from the border. ""I am waiting for my family,"" he says.
They are still trapped inside Tigray. Families have been torn apart by the conflict.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the TPLF, the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations deteriorated.
The TPLF said the central government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election.
In September the party held its own election, which the central government said was ""illegal"".
Then, on 4 November, the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle.
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000. Analysts believe the conflict could be long and bloody given the strength of Tigray's forces."

The federal government spends more than $20 billion a year on subsidies for farm businesses. About 39 percent of the nation’s 2.1 million farms receive direct subsidies, with the lion’s share of the handouts going to the largest producers of corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, and rice.1



The current farm law — enacted in 2014 — added new crop programs that have turned out to be more costly than promised. The law expires this year, and subsidy proponents are eager for Congress to pass another expensive bill. But farm subsidies impose a burden on federal taxpayers, and they harm the economy. President Donald Trump proposed cuts to farm programs in the 2019 federal budget, but the longer‐​term goal should be to fully repeal all farm subsidies.



This report provides background for the upcoming farm bill debate. It suggests that agriculture is no riskier than other industries and that it does not need an array of federal subsidies. The government protects farmers against fluctuations in prices, revenues, and yields. It subsidizes their conservation efforts, insurance coverage, marketing, export sales, research, and other activities. Federal coddling of the agriculture industry is deep and comprehensive.



Farm subsidies are costly to taxpayers, but they also harm the economy and the environment. Subsidies distort the decisions made by farm businesses. They encourage overproduction, which pushes down prices and creates political demands for more subsidies. Subsidies discourage farmers from innovating, cutting costs, diversifying their land use, and taking other actions needed to prosper in the competitive economy.



Agriculture has long attracted federal support. The Morrill Act of 1862 established the land‐​grant colleges to teach agriculture and other subjects. The Hatch Act of 1887 funded agricultural research, and the Smith‐​Lever Act of 1914 funded agricultural education. The Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 created cooperative banks to provide loans to farmers. That developed into today’s Farm Credit System, which is a government‐​sponsored financial system with more than $280 billion in assets.



The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929 created the Federal Farm Board, which tried to raise crop prices by buying up and stockpiling production.2 That did not work, and after spending $500 million this early agricultural boondoggle was abolished in 1933.



Congress enacted many farm programs during the 1930s, including commodity price supports, supply regulations, import barriers, and crop insurance. These programs have been expanded, modified, and added to over the decades, but the central planning philosophy behind farm programs has not changed. U.S. farm policies remain stuck in the past, despite the ongoing economic harm and taxpayer costs.



Between the 1940s and the 1980s, Congress considered farm policy reforms occasionally, usually when commodity prices were high, but then reverted to subsidy expansions when prices were lower.3 In the 1980s the Reagan administration proposed cuts to farm subsidies, but farm finances took a bad turn, and that prompted Congress to increase farm aid, not reduce it.



Farm subsidies have never made economic sense, but farm interests have held sway in Congress. While farmers are a small share of the U.S. population today, the farm lobby is still strong. One reason is that farm‐​state legislators have co‐​opted the support of urban legislators by including food‐​stamp subsidies in farm bills. Other legislators support farm bills because of the inclusion of conservation subsidies.



In 1996 Congress enacted reforms under the “Freedom to Farm” law, which allowed farmers greater flexibility in planting and increased reliance on market supply and demand. But Congress reversed course in the late 1990s, and it passed a series of supplemental farm subsidy bills. As a result, subsidies over the seven years of the 1996 farm bill ended up costing more than double what had been promised.4



In 2002 Congress enacted a farm bill that further reversed the 1996 reforms. The law increased projected subsidy payments, added new crops to the subsidy rolls, and created a new price guarantee scheme called the countercyclical program. The 2002 law increased projected farm subsidy payments by 74 percent over 10 years.5



In 2008 Congress overrode a presidential veto to enact farm legislation that added further subsidies. The law created a permanent disaster aid program and added a revenue protection program for farmers to lock in profits from high commodity prices. It added a sugar‐​to‐​ethanol program to keep sugar prices artificially high, and it added new subsidies for “specialty crops” such as fruits and vegetables.



In 2014 Congress passed another huge farm bill. The bill changed the structure of subsidies, but it did not cut the overall level of benefits. The law ended the direct payment program, the countercyclical program, and a couple of other smaller programs. But it expanded the largest farm subsidy program — crop insurance — and it added two new subsidy programs, the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) program and the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program.



When the 2014 farm bill was passed, supporters claimed that it would save money, but the opposite has happened. The ARC and PLC programs have cost almost double what the Congressional Budget Office originally estimated.6 Meanwhile, the cost of crop insurance has soared over the past 15 years.



All of these subsidies ensure that farm incomes are much higher than the incomes of most Americans. Farm programs are welfare for the well‐​to‐​do, and they induce overproduction, inflate land prices, and harm the environment. They should be repealed, and farmers should support themselves in the marketplace.



The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) runs more than 60 direct and indirect aid programs for farmers. This section summarizes the major ones.



Most of the direct aid goes to producers of a handful of field crops, not to livestock producers or fruit and vegetable growers. In the three largest farm subsidy programs — insurance, ARC, and PLC — more than 70 percent of the handouts go to farmers of just three crops — corn, soybeans, and wheat.7



The Trump administration’s budget for 2019 proposes to cut farm subsidies by tightening limits on the maximum payments to each farmer and ending subsidies for farmers with incomes above $500,000 a year.23 The budget would also cut insurance subsidies and conservation subsidies. The reforms would save about $6 billion a year when phased in.



Studies from various think tanks have also proposed reforms. Heritage Foundation experts propose repealing the ARC and PLC programs and trimming crop insurance.24 American Enterprise Institute (AEI) experts have found that modest limits on payments to large farms would produce major savings.25 For example, a cap on insurance subsidies of $40,000 per farm would affect only 5 percent of farmers but save $2 billion a year.



Ultimately, Congress should end all farm subsidies. Businesses in other industries face many risks and market fluctuations, yet they prosper or fail depending on their own skill and planning without a federal subsidy cushion. Farm businesses face some unique risks, but so do other businesses. Consider, for example, the fast pace of change in technology industries, or the large price fluctuations in the mining and energy industries.



The following sections discuss why farm subsidies make little sense.



A number of major farm programs expire at the end of September 2018, which provides Congress a chance to rethink its costly farm policies. Policymakers should look to the Trump administration’s 2019 budget, which includes a number of sensible reforms to farm programs.



For Republicans in Congress, farm subsidy cuts would signal that the party is concerned about fiscal responsibility at a time of rising budget deficits. The GOP has sought cuts to low‐​income welfare programs, and it makes sense to combine those with cuts to farm subsidies, which are welfare for the well‐​to‐​do.



As the Heritage Foundation has argued, Congress this year should at least repeal the crop subsidy programs added in the last farm bill, ARC and PLC.74 Over the longer term, all farm subsidies should be ended. American farmers should stand on their own two feet in the marketplace, as do businesses in nearly all other industries.

Guest Opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
Every time a serious threat to IPCC climate science appears, whether scientific or political, diversions and counterattacks are implemented. It usually involves people and agencies at the highest levels, with dissemination and support through major media outlets. One of the earliest examples involved changes to the 1995 IPCC Report Chapter 8 comments agreed on in committee. The response is proportional to the political damage they perceive. Avery and Singer noted about Chapter 8 changes,
“Santer single-handedly reversed the ‘climate science’ of the whole IPCC report and with it the global warming political process! The ‘discernible human influence’ supposedly revealed by the IPCC has been cited thousands of times since in media around the world and has been the ‘stopper’ in millions of debates among nonscientists.”
The misleading item is then defended and substantiated by a cover-up and later cited as evidence that nothing was wrong. In that case, an article was quickly produced and published in Nature within a year (July 1996). The problem was it used a selected portion of a graph to show a trend that was not evident in the full record. See below:
John Daly recreated Santer et al’s graph (Figure 1) of the upward temperature trend in the Upper Atmosphere.

Figure 1
Then Daly produced a graph of the wider data set in Figure 2 and explains, “we see that the warming indicated in Santer’s version is just a product of the dates chosen” (Daly’s bold).

Figure 2
In addition, articles appeared in the New York Times attacking the credibility of Professors Fred Singer and Frederick Seitz. The attack on Singer began the now familiar connection of climate deniers as equal to the tobacco deniers because he had written a critique of the bad science in an article on second-hand smoke. His critique was later shown to be correct, but it was used to suggest he was supporting “big tobacco.”
A more challenging cover up was required after the 2009 release of emails from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. Recently, Elizabeth May, leader of the Canadian Green Party claimed official investigations exonerated the activities revealed by the emails. I responded that the investigations were corrupted, but did not have time to elaborate. May suggested my comments indicated I was looking for another lawsuit, referring to the lawsuits against me by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) members Michael Mann and Andrew Weaver. The latter is currently an elected Green Party member of the British Columbia legislature.
Michael Mann also claims these investigations exonerated him and the CRU activities in his lawsuits with Mark Steyn.
One of Mann’s arguments is that his work has been “exonerated” by a number of investigations, including that of EPA. As our reply brief shows, that is simply untrue. But one thing that EPA did examine was Mann’s own claim that the work of certain opposing scientists was a “fraud”. In EPA’s view, “fraud” is an “entirely acceptable and appropriate” term in scientific debate. (CEI Reply Brief at p.11.)
In short, EPA didn’t exonerate Mann, but it may well have exonerated the defendants.
The greatest threat to IPCC science came with the release of 1000 emails from the CRU in November of 2009. A further 6000 released in November of 2011 expanded and elaborated on the extent of activities and actions taken to produce a specific scientific claim. The emails provided evidence of the methods used to pursue what they referred to as “the cause” by key players in the IPCC Science and Summary for Policymakers reports. In their words, they tell us how they created the ‘scientific’ evidence to support the political agenda. CRU Director Phil Jones dismissed the material as normal scientific banter and added in a classic understatement to the UK Parliamentary Science and Technology Committee,
“I have obviously written some pretty awful emails.” 
It was no surprise that skeptics understood the significance of the emails because they confirmed what they were thinking and saying. A more accurate measure of their significance was the reactions of mainstream media who had pushed the IPCC AGW line. Andrew Revkin resigned from the New York Times and George Monbiot of The Guardian wrote,
“It’s no use pretending that this isn’t a major blow. The emails extracted by a hacker from the climatic research unit at the University of East Anglia could scarcely be more damaging. I am now convinced that they are genuine, and I’m dismayed and deeply shaken by them.
People like Monbiot were rattled, but some, possibly unaware of the implications of the emails, shrugged off the problems. Others, including a few politicians began to ask questions. It appears politicians spot scandals better than others as they are steeped in them directly or indirectly throughout their careers. Pressure to restore confidence in the IPCC and the CRU scientists was intense and growing. Both leaks achieved their objective of stunting advance of climate politics through the Conference of the Parties (COP) at Copenhagen, and ending support for the Kyoto Protocol while blunting the effectiveness of any substitute.
Response to Damage of Leaked CRU Emails
To salvage the entire IPCC process, it was essential to begin by restoring the credibility of the scientists exposed in the emails. Apparently the decision to pursue a cover-up was taken by major agencies directly involved, either because of political commitment, funding or both. They initiated five inquiries, apparently all orchestrated to mislead and cover up what the emails exposed.
Andrew Montford provided an excellent analysis of what went on in “The Climategate Inquiries.” The piece opens with a quote from Professor of Climatology Hans van Storch.
“We have to take a self-critical view of what happened. Nothing ought to be swept under the carpet. Some of the Inquiries—like—in the UK—did exactly the latter. They blew an opportunity to restore trust.”
The reason an insider like van Storch thinks they missed an opportunity is because he wanted explanations. Those carrying out the inquiries wanted to fool the public. Comments by Elizabeth May and Mann’s use of them in a court indicate their success. Disconnects between what “insiders” know and what the public perceive are central to other major deceptions. As David Wojick, IPCC expert reviewer, explained about the biggest deception, the Summary for Policymakers (SPM)
Glaring omissions are only glaring to experts, so the “policymakers”—including the press and the public—who read the SPM will not realize they are being told only one side of a story. But the scientists who drafted the SPM know the truth, as revealed by the sometimes artful way they conceal it.
Systematically omitted from the SPM are the uncertainties and positive counter evidence that might negate the human interference theory. Instead of assessing these objections, the Summary confidently asserts just those findings that support its case. These actions are advocacy, not assessment.
Leaked Email Inquiries
Lord Turnbull summarized the serious allegations in the Foreword to Montford’s report:

That scientists at the CRU had failed to give a full and fair view to policymakers and the IPCC of all the evidence available to them;
That they deliberately obstructed access to data and methods to those taking different viewpoints for themselves;
That they failed to comply with Freedom of Information requirements;
That they sought to influence the review panels of journals in order to prevent rival scientific evidence from being published.

Three United Kingdom Inquiries:
1. The UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee investigation was required because of the involvement of the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) and its links with the CRU. A former Director of the UKMO, John Houghton was appointed the first head of the IPCC.
This inquiry seems pointless, other than as an opportunity for politicians to be able to say they had considered the issue of the leaked emails. They initially canceled their inquiry when the University of East Anglia said they were investigating. Apparently because of pressure or because some saw political opportunities they sought input from the public, but only received 58 submissions. They effectively deferred to the UEA. Sir Muir Russell, Chair of one of the UEA investigations appeared before them to explain what he was doing.
Four other panels were questioned, but nobody qualified or knowledgeable about climatology was included, knowledge essential to understanding what the emails were saying. They did not finish their work because of an election. They assumed the Oxburgh and Russell inquiries would resolve the matter. Attempts to strongly admonish the CRU for their actions were all defeated.
2. The Oxburgh panel was appointed and directed by UEA. It was likely the most compromised of the inquiries so much so that its findings are meaningless except as evidence of a cover-up.
There were no written terms of reference. UEA said Oxburgh was going to investigate the science. He didn’t. Oxburgh and his committee of six were recommended by the Royal Society, which was directly involved in promoting the IPCC and CRU. A recent article by the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) exposed the Royal Society’s activities in distorting and misrepresenting climate science.
Oxburgh was compromised because he is a Fellow of the Royal Society, but more important, he is CEO of Carbon Capture and Storage Association and Chairman of Falck Renewable Resources that benefit from the claim that human CO2 is causing warming. He also promoted the warming claim as UK Vice-Chair of GLOBE International, a consortium of Industry, NGOs’ and Government that lobbies for global warming policy.
• The Oxburgh Inquiry was directed to examine the CRU science, but failed. The other failures;
• There were no public hearings:
• There was no call for evidence.
• Only 11 academic papers were examined; a list vetted by Phil Jones, Director of the CRU, the agency central to the investigation.
• Only unrecorded closed interviews with CRU staff were held.
• There were no meetings with CRU critics.
• UEA had effective control throughout the Inquiry.
• The UK House of Commons Select Committee grilled Oxburgh on the shallowness of his study and report and its failure to review the science as promised.
3. The Independent Climate Change Emails Review (ICCER), more commonly called the Muir Russell Inquiry, was also created by the University of East Anglia.
It was compromised from the start by the conflict of interest of members. One appointment was Philip Campbell, editor of Nature. He resigned when his bias was revealed. Another appointee, Geoffrey Boulton, had two major problems. He had signed a petition from the UK Met Office declaring full support for the CRU and IPCC science. He had been employed at UEA when the Inquiry said members had no links to the university. He said he was not a climate expert when a CV sent to a Chinese University stated the opposite.
There was a call for public submissions on February 11, 2010 with a virtually impossible deadline of March 1, 2010 (17 days). They did not hold public hearings and only interviewed CRU and UEA staff. Those items alone are sufficient to indicate the bias of the inquiry to a preconceived result. In a commentary on the Muir Russell Report, Fred Pearce of the UK Guardian, a paper long known for its strong support of the IPCC wrote,
“Secrecy was the order of the day at CRU. “We find that there has been a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness,” says the report. That criticism applied not just to Jones and his team at CRU. It applied equally to the university itself, which may have been embarrassed to find itself in the dock as much as the scientists on whom it asked Russell to sit in judgment.”
Montford’s report showed all three Inquiries and their reports had serious flaws. Lord Turnbull summarized Montford’s findings as follows.
· These inquiries were hurried
· The terms of reference were unclear
· Insufficient care was taken with the choice of panel members to ensure balance and independence
· Insufficient care was taken to ensure the process was independent of those being investigated, eg., the Royal Society allowed CRU to suggest the papers it should read
· Sir Muir Russell failed to attend the session with the CRU’s Director Professor Jones, and only four of fourteen members of the Science and Technology Select Committee attended the crucial final meeting to sign off their report.
· Record keeping was poor.
Turnbull concludes,
“But above all, Andrew Montford’s report brings out the disparity between the treatment of the incumbents and the critics. The former appeared to be treated with kid gloves and their explanations readily accepted without serious challenge. The letter [sic] has been disbursed denied adequate opportunity to put their case.”
One North American Inquiry at Penn State:
1. Penn State University appointed an inquiry because of involvement of Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at that university. Penn State University has procedures for Inquiry and also Investigation of Academic wrongdoing. In the leaked emails case, they carried out an Inquiry. The rules require five (5) tenured professors with competency, but no conflict. The committee appointed included one tenured professor, one untenured with an MS in Psychology, and an administrator. The untenured professor left during the Inquiry and was replaced by another administrator.
There was no call for evidence or public hearings. They only interviewed three people. Michael Mann was asked about questions for which he had prior notice. Gerald North of Texas A & M and Donald Kennedy of Stanford were interviewed. Neither was involved with the emails, but were publicly sympathetic to the IPCC work.
Comments by Clive Crook about the Penn State Inquiry provide an excellent summary:
“The Penn State inquiry exonerating Michael Mann—the paleoclimatologist who came up with the hockey stick—would be difficult to parody. Three of four allegations are dismissed out of hand at the outset: the inquiry announces that, for lack of credible evidence, it will not even investigate them. (At this, MIT’s Richard Lindzen tells the committee, “It’s thoroughly amazing. I mean these issues are explicitly stated in the emails. I’m wondering what’s going on?” The report continues: “The Investigatory Committee did not respond to Dr. Lindzen’s statement. Instead his attention was directed to the fourth allegation.”) Moving on, the report then says, in effect, that Mann is a distinguished scholar, a successful raiser of research funding, a man admired by his peers- so any allegation of academic impropriety must be false.”
Steve Milloy, the founder of the web page JunkScience, explains why Crook was so dissatisfied and did a similar analysis of the Penn State Inquiry as Andrew Montford did for the UEA Inqurieis:
· “The review apparently extended little further than the Climategate e-mails themselves, an interview with Mann, materials submitted by Mann and whatever e-mails and comments floated in over the transom. Not thorough at all.
· Comically, the report explains at length how the use of the word “trick” can mean a “clever device.” The report ignores that it was a “trick… to hide the decline.” There is no mention of “hide the decline” in the report.
· The report concludes there is no evidence to indicate that Mann intended to delete e-mails. But this is contradicted by the plain language and circumstances surrounding Mann’s e-mail exchange with Phil Jones — See page 9 of Climategate & Penn State: The Case for an Independent Investigation.
· The report dismisses the accusation that Mann conspired to silence skeptics by stating, “one finds enormous confusion has been caused by interpretations of the e-mails and their content.” Maybe there wouldn’t be so much “confusion” if PSU actually did a thorough investigation rather than just relying on the word of Michael Mann.
· Although PSU is continuing the investigation, its reason is not to investigate Mann so much as it is to exonerate climate alarmism. On page 9 of the report, it says that “questions in the public’s mind about Dr. Mann’s conduct… may be undermining confidence in his findings as a scientist… and public trust in science in general and climate science specifically.”
One International Inquiry:
The Inter Academy Council (IAC) is a UN group designed to act as a public relations panel for national academies of science. It was commissioned by the IPCC to investigate their procedures. It is very limited because of previous close and conflicting connections with IPCC Chair, Rajendra Pachauri.
Brief Overview of the Inquiries:
A brief analysis of each inquiry explains why Clive Crook, Senior editor of The Atlantic wrote:
“I had hoped, not very confidently, that the various Climategate inquiries would be severe. This would have been a first step towards restoring confidence in the scientific consensus. But no, the reports make things worse. At best they are mealy-mouthed apologies; at worst they are patently incompetent and even wilfully wrong. The climate-science establishment, of which these inquiries have chosen to make themselves a part, seems entirely incapable of understanding, let alone repairing, the harm it has done to its own cause.”
George Monbiot as a fierce advocate of the IPCC and the CRU wrote on his personal blog,
Yes, the messages were obtained illegally. Yes, all of us say things in emails that would be excruciating if made public. Yes, some of the comments have been taken out of context. But there are some messages that require no spin to make them look bad. There appears to be evidence here of attempts to prevent scientific data from being released, and even to destroy material that was subject to a freedom of information request.
Worse still, some of the emails suggest efforts to prevent the publication of work by climate sceptics, or to keep it out of a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. I believe that the head of the unit, Phil Jones, should now resign. Some of the data discussed in the emails should be re-analysed.
Overall Summary of the Investigations
There was a distinct pattern to the process used in each inquiry, which was clearly dictated by the cover up objective.

The people appointed to the inquiries were either compromised through conflict or had little knowledge of climatology or the IPCC process.
They did not have clearly defined objectives and failed to achieve any they publicized.
Interviews were limited to the accused.
Experts, who knew what went on and how it was done, that is understood what the emails were saying, were not interviewed.
Validity of the science and the results obtained as published in the IPCC Reports were not examined, yet the deceptions were to cover these problems.
All investigations were seriously inadequate in major portions so as to essentially negate their findings. It appears these inadequacies were deliberate to avoid exposure of the truth.
They all examined only one limited side of the issues, so it was similar to hearing only half of a conversation and what you hear is preselected.

The mock inquiries achieved their objective because the media stopped asking questions. People, like Elizabeth May, accepted their findings as legitimate. It also allowed those people identified in the emails to claim they were absolved of any wrongdoing.
Emeritus Professor Garth Paltridge said:
“Basically, the problem is that the research community has gone so far along the path of frightening the life out of the man in the street that to recant publicly even part of the story would massively damage the reputation and political clout of science in general. And so, like corpuscles in the blood, researchers all over the world now rush in overwhelming numbers to repel infection by any idea that threatens the carefully cultivated belief in climatic disaster.”
But it is more than that. It was a political agenda driven by an ideology that believes the end justifies the means, even if it requires misusing science or protecting the people who misuse science. It is an ideology that requires cover-up of evidence or actions necessary to advance the agenda.

Recently I posted here on about 250 papers published in 2015. That post was shared or liked a few thousand times.
Well, the number of skeptic papers seems to be accelerating as already this year there have been almost 50, and it’s only February!
The following lists 48 scientific papers listed show that CO2 climate science is exaggerated and that natural factors are indeed dominant climate forces that will not be tamed by man emitting a trace gas.
These newest findings of course are no surprise to skeptics.
The list below includes the abstracts, where the special points have been emphasized. Two of the papers have been discussed already at NTZ here and here. The papers have been sorted according to categories.
Again do feel free to bring this newest list to the attention of your lawmakers, and ask them if there might be much better things to do with the billions of dollars spent on junk climate measures. It’s becoming crystal clear as to who the real deniers really are.

Solar Influence on Climate

The various techniques have been used to confer the existence of significant relations between the number of Sunspots and different terrestrial climate parameters such as rainfall, temperature, dewdrops, aerosol and ENSO etc. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can explore the information about the related variables. This study uses a Markov chain method to find the relations between monthly Sunspots and ENSO data of two epochs (1996–2009 and 1950–2014). Corresponding transition matrices of both data sets appear similar and it is qualitatively evaluated by high values of 2-dimensional correlation found between transition matrices of ENSO and Sunspots. The associated transition diagrams show that each state communicates with the others. Presence of stronger self-communication (between same states) confirms periodic behaviour among the states. Moreover, closeness found in the expected number of visits from one state to the other show the existence of a possible relation between Sunspots and ENSO data. Moreover, perfect validation of dependency and stationary tests endorses the applicability of the Markov chain analyses on Sunspots and ENSO data. This shows that a significant relation between Sunspots and ENSO data exists. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can help to explore the information about the related variables. This study can be useful to explore the influence of ENSO related local climatic variability.

Here, we use diatom assemblages from a marine sediment core collected from the West Greenland shelf to reconstruct changes in sea-ice cover over the last millennium. The proxy-based reconstruction demonstrates a generally strong link between changes in sea-ice cover and solar variability during the last millennium. Weaker (or stronger) solar forcing may result in the increase (or decrease) in sea-ice cover west of Greenland.

The comparison between MDVM reconstructed temperature and the variation of external forcing (solar activity and volcanic activity) is shown in Fig. 5. The smoothed MDVM reconstruction exhibited a general agreement with the variation of the reconstructed total solar irradiance (TSI), and the correlation between the two series during the common period 849–2000 AD was significant (r = 0.498, edf = 34, p<0.01). Specially, the records shared high correlation coefficients in the epochs of the solar maximum (i.e. during the Medieval and Modern age), but poor correlation around 1500–1700 AD when the Spörer Minimum and Maunder Minimum occurred. It was similar to some other dendrochronological researches concerning the relation with solar activity. The relatively cold conditions between the two warm peaks around AD 1000 and 1100 seemed to be related to the Oort Minimum.
Therefore, the temperature reconstructions based on the MDVM method agreed well in general with the characteristic variations of the solar and volcanic forcings. It is quite plausible that the long-term climate variations in the past millennium have been largely linked to the periodical solar activity, and people usually look at the Maunder Minimum to explain the LIA. However, some researchers argued that solar forcing probably had a minor effect on the climate change over the past 1000 years, and volcanic eruptions seemed to be an important driver for the climate particularly during the LIA. It was also reported that the abrupt onset of the LIA was likely triggered by a succession of strong volcanic eruptions and sustained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks. According to mainstream opinions, the LIA type events were probably attributed to a combination of solar minima and volcanic eruptions.

Tree-ring-based reconstruction of temperature variability (1445–2011) for the upper reaches of the Heihe River Basin, Northwest China
Spectral analyses suggested that the reconstructed annual mean temperature variation may be related to large-scale atmospheric–oceanic variability such as the solar activity, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

The impact of solar activity on tropical Pacific convection during the boreal summer (June-July-August, JJA) has been examined using reanalysis data, revealing a significant lagged (1–2 years) correlation between outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) over the tropical western Pacific and the F10.7 index. The OLR anomaly over the tropical western Pacific and the maritime continent shows a dipole pattern during the 1–2 years following high solar (HS) years. Furthermore, the first mode of the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis on the OLR with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal removed is similar to the distribution of correlation coefficients between the JJA mean F10.7 index and the OLR with ENSO signal removed. The correlation and composite analyses of the OLR, velocity potential and vertical velocity reveals that this convection dipole pattern shows an eastward shift of the central position of deep convection, as related to the influence of solar activity over the tropical western Pacific. Further analyses show that the evolutionary process of the solar signal in the ocean-atmosphere system over the tropical western Pacific is consistent with the analyses of OLR, velocity potential, and vertical velocity. By modulating vertical air temperature, the solar signal in the tropical sea surface temperature (SST) may contribute to the triggering of a lagged convection dipole pattern.

The reconstructions show a large glacier readvance corresponding with the 8.2-ka cold event and a sequence of eight distinct glacier advances and retreats during the Neoglacial time period bracket between 4300 ± 40 cal. yr BP and AD 1900. … [W]e suggest that deviations in ELA fluctuations between Scandinavian maritime and continental glaciers around 7150, 6560, 6000, 5150, 3200 and 2200 cal. yr BP reflect the different response of continental and maritime glaciers to drops in total solar irradiance (TSI).

[W]e reconstructed the history of typhoon and storm-rain activity only for the interval AD 1400–1900. The record indicates that typhoon frequency throughout the Korean Peninsula varied in response to the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. Typhoon variability was likely modulated further by the state of the East Asia summer monsoon (EASM) pattern, associated with variation in the magnitude of solar irradiance. During periods of minimum solar activity, such as the early Maunder Minimum (AD 1650–1675), typhoons struck the east China coast and Korean Peninsula more frequently because of a strengthened EASM.

A significant correlation between the solar wind speed (SWS) and sea surface temperature (SST) in the region of the North Atlantic Ocean has been found for the Northern Hemisphere winter from 1963 to 2010, based on 3-month seasonal averages. The correlation is dependent on Bz (the interplanetary magnetic field component parallel to the Earth’s magnetic dipole) as well as the SWS, and somewhat stronger in the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) west phase than in the east phase. The correlations with the SWS are stronger than those with the F10.7 parameter representing solar UV inputs to the stratosphere. SST responds to changes in tropospheric dynamics via wind stress, and to changes in cloud cover affecting the radiative balance. Suggested mechanisms for the solar influence on SST include changes in atmospheric ionization and cloud microphysics affecting cloud cover, storm invigoration, and tropospheric dynamics. Such changes modify upward wave propagation to the stratosphere, affecting the dynamics of the polar vortex. Also, direct solar inputs, including energetic particles and solar UV, produce stratospheric dynamical changes. Downward propagation of stratospheric dynamical changes eventually further perturbs tropospheric dynamics and SST.

Three factors affect substantially the radiation balance in polar regions: surface albedo, surface air temperature, and cloudiness. The surface albedo controls the shortwave energy budget; surface air temperature determines the incoming longwave radiation; cloudiness alters both the solar and the infrared radiative components.

Climate reconstructions from a multitude of natural and human archives indicate that, during winter, the period of the early Spörer Minimum (1431–1440 CE) was the coldest decade in Central Europe in the 15th century. The particularly cold winters and normal but wet summers resulted in a strong seasonal cycle that challenged food production and led to increasing food prices, a subsistence crisis, and a famine in parts of Europe. As a consequence, authorities implemented adaptation measures, such as the installation of grain storage capacities, in order to be prepared for future events. The 15th century is characterised by a grand solar minimum and enhanced volcanic activity, which both imply a reduction of seasonality. Climate model simulations show that periods with cold winters and strong seasonality are associated with internal climate variability rather than external forcing. Accordingly, it is hypothesised that the reconstructed extreme climatic conditions during this decade occurred by chance and in relation to the partly chaotic, internal variability within the climate system.

We present a multi-proxy record (pollen, microscopic charcoal, carbon-isotopic composition [δ13C], organic content, and particle size) of the late-Holocene climate change and human impact from central-eastern South Korea. The Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA), the most recent major climate events, have not been accurately investigated by paleolimnological studies in Korea, mainly due to a lack of undisturbed sediments and indifference to the past climate change. Our pollen records show late- Holocene centennial climate variations characterized by the successive solar minimums of the Oort, Wolf, Spörer, Maunder, and Dalton. We find paleoenvironmental evidence for shifting cultivation associated with serious droughts and consequent famines during the early 19th-century Dalton minimum. Our interpretation of human activities is well supported by Korean historical documents describing socioeconomic suffering induced by LIA climate deteriorations.

Climatic changes during the first half of the Common Era have been suggested to play a role in societal reorganizations in Europe and Asia. In particular, the sixth century coincides with rising and falling civilizations, pandemics, human migration and political turmoil. Our understanding of the magnitude and spatial extent as well as the possible causes and concurrences of climate change during this period is, however, still limited. Here we use tree-ring chronologies from the Russian Altai and European Alps to reconstruct summer temperatures over the past two millennia. We find an unprecedented, long-lasting and spatially synchronized cooling following a cluster of large volcanic eruptions in 536, 540 and 547 AD, which was probably sustained by ocean and sea-ice feedbacks, as well as a solar minimum. We thus identify the interval from 536 to about 660 AD as the Late Antique Little Ice Age. Spanning most of the Northern Hemisphere, we suggest that this cold phase be considered as an additional environmental factor contributing to the establishment of the Justinian plague, transformation of the eastern Roman Empire and collapse of the Sasanian Empire, movements out of the Asian steppe and Arabian Peninsula, spread of Slavic-speaking peoples and political upheavals in China.

The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is characterized by a horseshoe pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and has a wide range of climatic impacts. While the tropical arm of AMO is responsible for many of these impacts, it is either too weak or completely absent in many climate model simulations. Here we show, using both observational and model evidence, that the radiative effect of positive low cloud and dust feedbacks is strong enough to generate the tropical arm of AMO, with the low cloud feedback more dominant. The feedbacks can be understood in a consistent dynamical framework: weakened tropical trade wind speed in response to a warm middle latitude SST anomaly reduces dust loading and low cloud fraction over the tropical Atlantic, which warms the tropical North Atlantic SST. Together they contribute to appearance of the tropical arm of AMO. Most current climate models miss both the critical wind speed response and two positive feedbacks though realistic simulations of them may be essential for many climatic studies related to the AMO.

Introduction: The surface climate of the UK and northern Europe is up to 9 degC warmer than it would be if the North Atlantic Ocean did not transport a large quantity of heat northwards to our shores. This unusual warming has been known since sea temperature records were established in the late nineteenth century and was probably well known to the early seafarers in the last two millennia.
Summary: This article has indicated that the North Atlantic Ocean is showing changes in its circulation as represented by the MOC at 26°N in the last 10 years. The changes in the MOC are associated with heat transport which has a direct effect on the upper ocean heat storage northwards of the RAPID array. The event in 2009 caused a cooling of the subtropical ocean between 20 and 40°N but did not appear to influence the region poleward of 50°N. The role of the atmosphere in the changes in the MOC in this region, in particular on interannual and decadal timescales, is still not well understood.

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the leading mode of atmospheric circulation variability in the North Atlantic region. Associated shifts of storm tracks, precipitation and temperature patterns affect energy supply and demand, fisheries and agricultural, as well as marine and terrestrial ecological dynamics. Long-term NAO records are crucial to better understand its response to climate forcing factors, and assess predictability and shifts associated with ongoing climate change. A recent study of instrumental time series revealed NAO as main factor for a strong relation between winter temperature, precipitation and river discharge in central Norway over the past 50 years. … Conditioned on a stationary relation between our climate proxy and the NAO we establish a first high resolution NAO proxy record from marine sediments covering the past 2800 years. The [NAO proxy record] shows distinct co-variability with climate changes over Greenland, solar activity and Northern Hemisphere glacier dynamics as well as climatically associated paleo-demographic trends. The here presented climate record shows that fjord sediments provide crucial information for an improved understanding of the linkages between atmospheric circulation, solar and oceanic forcing factors.

Conclusions: The temperatures observed from the different locations within Nigeria between 1980 and 2010 (1983–2010 for Abuja) are compared with the SST from the Niño 3 and Niño 4 regions of the Tropical Pacific while a further comparison of the temperature with the rainfall in Nigeria is also done. This is necessary so as to establish the connections between an ENSO event and the climate patterns in Nigeria. The outcome shows good link between the ENSO events and the Nigerian climate with the strongest agreement coming from the Niño 3 region of the Tropical Pacific. The finding indicates that the primary driver of climate like the south-westerlies that brings monsoon into the country from South Atlantic Ocean, the north-easterlies that lead to Tropical dry climate in the North and the ITCZ, which is sandwiched between the air masses, could be affected by changes in ENSO events. According to the results, the major link between an ENSO event and changes in the temperature and rainfall in Nigeria is associated with shifts in the ITCZ position. An El Niño (La Niña) induced southward (northward) shift in the ITCZ mean position is accompanying by reduction (increase) in the intensity of the mean rainfall in the country while the corresponding mean temperature after an El Niño (La Niña) event will rise (reduce). This is similar to other studies where El Niño induced drought have been reported in Nigeria

Most of flood periods coincided with the warm phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The flood period of 1940–1944 was as long as the most recent one (2007–2011). Wavelet analysis found flood periodicities of 2.5, 52 and 83 years, but only the last one was statistical significant and their occurrence was in phase with the AMO. Logistic regression showed that AMO index was the most correlated index with flood events. In fact, the odds ratio showed that floods were 1.90 times more likely to occur when AMO index was positive. This regression model predicted correctly 64.70 % of flood occurrences during twentieth century using its flood information only as validation data.

The climate variability on Earth is strongly influenced by the changes in the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical oceans. More specifically, the inter-annual climate variability in the tropics as well as extra-tropical areas has large impact due to the anomalous SSTs in the tropical Pacific coupled with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) through atmospheric teleconnections. … It is observed that during El Niño years the peninsular region receives more rainfall through enhanced moisture transport associated with anomalous westerly winds from adjoining Seas. The Rossby wave energy propagation in the atmosphere underlies important teleconnections involving ENSO. It is also noticed that there exist a distinct change in the phase of the Rossby wave pattern during El Niño and La Niña years which further causes the shift in the position of the jet stream over the Middle East.

Furthermore, since the end of the 19th century, we find an increasing variance in multidecadal hydroclimatic winter and spring, and this coincides with an increase in the multidecadal North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) variability, suggesting a significant influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. However, multidecadal NAO variability has decreased in summer. Using Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis, we detect multidecadal North Atlantic sea-level pressure anomalies, which are significantly linked to the NAO during the Modern period. In particular, a south-eastward (south-westward) shift of the Icelandic Low (Azores High) drives substantial multidecadal changes in spring. Wetter springs are likely to be driven by potential changes in moisture advection from the Atlantic, in response to northward shifts of North Atlantic storm tracks over European regions, linked to periods of positive NAO. Similar, but smaller, changes in rainfall are observed in winter.

In 2012 the most severe United States drought since the 1930’s occurred, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the climate factors driving droughts. Spatial-temporal analysis of United States precipitation data from 1900 to 1999 indicates that the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) primarily modulates drought frequency. … Using this transfer function, a 954-year tree-ring drought record was extended to ca. 3000 BP. Changes in the extended drought record correspond with timing of the Roman Climate Optimum, Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, and changes in the AMO as recorded in a proxy record derived from North Atlantic ice-rafted debris. These results indicate that lacustrine-derived XRF element data can be used as a quantitative tool to reconstruct past drought records, and suggest that AMO modulated drought in southern Texas for the last 3000 years. Additional studies using XRF-derived element data as a drought proxy are needed to determine the utility of this proxy in non-playa lacustrine systems.

Multiscale evolution of surface air temperature in the arid region of Northwest China and its linkages to ocean oscillations 
The global climate has experienced unprecedented warming in the past century. The multiscale evolution of the warming is studied to better understand the spatial and temporal variation patterns of temperature. In this study, based on the yearly surface air temperature from the gridded CRU TS 3.22 dataset and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition method (EEMD), we investigated the multiscale evolution of temperature variability in the arid region of Northwest China (ARNC) from 1901 to 2013. Furthermore, the possible influences on the ARNC temperature change from the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and dipole mode index (DMI) were also discussed. The results indicated that in the past century, the overall temperature in the ARNC has showed a significant non-linear upward trend, and its changes have clearly exhibited an interannual scale (quasi-2–3 and quasi-6–7-year) and an interdecadal scale (quasi-14, quasi-24, and quasi-70-year). Compared with the reconstructed interannual variation, the reconstructed interdecadal variability plays a decisive role in the ARNC warming and reveals the climatic pattern transformation from the cold period to the warm period before and after 1987. Additionally, there were also regional differences in the spatial patterns of change trend in the ARNC temperature at a given time. We also found that the AMO and PDO had significant impacts on the ARNC temperature fluctuation at an interdecadal scale, whereas the DMI had a more important role in warming at the annual scale, which suggests that the importance of oceans cannot be ignored when considering climate change. Our findings deepen the understanding of the temperature changes all over the ARNC in the context of global warming.

Identifying predictability sources of heat wave variations is a scientific challenge and of practical importance. This study investigates the summertime heat wave frequency (HWF) over Eurasia for 1950–2014. … Further analysis suggests that mega-ENSO variations can incite a Gill-type response spreading to Eurasia, while the AMO changes cause eastward-propagating Rossby wave trains toward Eurasia. These two teleconnection patterns together contribute to the large-scale circulation anomalies of the ID mode, and those related to the IA mode arise from the teleconnection pattern excited by mega-ENSO. A strong mega-ENSO triggers subsidence with high pressure anomalies, warms the surface and increases the HWF significantly over northeastern Asia particularly. Likewise, the warm AMO-induced circulation anomalies engender surface radiative heating and HWF growth in most of Eurasian continent except some localized Siberian and Asian regions. The situation is opposite for a weak mega-ENSO and AMO. Those models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) which realistically capture the features of the ID mode can reproduce the AMO-like sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs), while signals resembling mega-ENSO are found in those with favorable capability of simulating the IA mode. On the contrary, these relevant SSTAs linked to the respective modes vanish in the models with little skills. Thus, mega-ENSO and the AMO might provide two critical predictability sources for heat waves over Eurasia.

Forced atmospheric teleconnections during 1979-2014 are examined using a 50-member ensemble of atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) simulations subjected to observed variations in sea surface temperatures (SST), sea ice and carbon dioxide. … A trend in the leading forced mode is related to ENSO-like decadal variability and dominates the overall observed 500 hPa height trend since 1979. These model results indicate that the trend in the first mode is due to internal variability rather than external radiative forcings.

Time series of US daily heavy precipitation (95th percentile) are analyzed to determine factors responsible for regionality and seasonality in their 1979-2013 trends. …. Analysis of model ensemble spread reveals that appreciable 35-yr trends in heavy daily precipitation can occur in the absence of forcing, thereby limiting detection of the weak anthropogenic influence at regional scales.
Analysis of the seasonality in heavy daily precipitation trends supports physical arguments that their changes during 1979-2013 have been intimately linked to internal decadal ocean variability, and less to human-induced climate change. Most of the southern US decrease has occurred during the cold season that has been dynamically driven by an atmospheric circulation reminiscent of teleconnections linked to cold tropical east Pacific SSTs. Most of the northeast US increase has been a warm season phenomenon; the immediate cause for which remains unresolved.

On the interannual time scale, ENSO and SAM are important, but a large fraction of sea ice variance can also be explained by Rossby wave–like structures in the Drake Passage region. After regressing out the sea ice extent variability associated with ENSO, the observed positive sea ice trends in Ross Sea and Indian Ocean during the satellite era become statistically insignificant. Regressing out SAM makes the sea ice trend in the Indian Ocean insignificant. Thus, the positive trends in sea ice in the Ross Sea and the Indian Ocean sectors may be explained by the variability and decadal trends of known interannual climate modes.

Glaciers and small ice caps respond rapidly to climate perturbations (mainly winter precipitation, and summer temperature), and the mass-balance of glaciers located in western Norway is governed mainly by winter precipitation (Pw). … Complete deglaciation of the Ålfotbreen [glacier] occurred ∼9700 cal yr BP, and the ice cap was subsequently absent or very small until a short-lived glacier event is seen in the lake sediments ∼8200 cal yr BP. The ice cap was most likely completely melted until a new glacier event occurred around ∼5300 cal yr BP, coeval with the onset of the Neoglacial at several other glaciers in southwestern Norway. Ålfotbreen was thereafter absent (or very small) until the onset of the Neoglacial period ∼1400 cal yr BP. The ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) ∼650–50 cal yr BP was the largest glacier advance of Ålfotbreen since deglaciation, with a maximum extent at ∼400–200 cal yr BP, when the ELA [equilibrium-line-altitude] was lowered approximately 200 m relative to today.

Here, we present evidence for glacial retreat corresponding to the MWP [Medieval Warm Period] and a subsequent LIA [Little Ice Age] advance at Rothera Point (67°34′S; 68°07′W) in Marguerite Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula. Deglaciation started at ca. 961–800 cal. yr BP or before, reaching a position similar to or even more withdrawn than the current state, with the subsequent period of glacial advance commencing between 671 and 558 cal. yr BP and continuing at least until 490–317 cal. yr BP. Based on new radiocarbon dates, during the MWP, the rate of glacier retreat was 1.6 m yr−1, which is comparable with recently observed rates (~0.6 m yr−1 between 1993 and 2011 and 1.4 m yr−1 between 2005 and 2011). Moreover, despite the recent air warming rate being higher, the glacial retreat rate during the MWP was similar to the present, suggesting that increased snow accumulation in recent decades may have counterbalanced the higher warming rate.

European Middle Ages were an extended period of fluctuating but mostly above-average warm temperatures that by the tenth century had melted the ice sheet of the Arctic Ocean and brought about Viking marine exploration of, and temporary settlement on the eastern shores of North America. Medieval warm climate was punctuated by two short, but extremely cold events. The first was the cold event of 535–6, possibly due to a volcanic catastrophe in the tropics that yielded extensive atmospheric dust veil, followed by a major crop failure through Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, and a subsequent terrifying pandemic of the years 541–2, the Plague of Justinian. The second cold event coincided with a prolonged series of major volcanic eruptions on the Southern Hemisphere during 1315–1322. Extensive crop failure during the years 1315–1317 had led, at the same time, to the Great Famine throughout much of Europe.

Centennial to millennial scale changes in the wider North Atlantic region were accompanied by variations in the West Greenland Current (WGC). During periods of relatively warm WGC, increased surface air temperature over western Greenland led to ice sheet retreat and significant meltwater flux. In contrast, during periods of cold WGC, atmospheric cooling resulted in glacier advances.
We also identify potential linkages between the palaeoceanography of the Disko Bugt region and key changes in the history of human occupation. Cooler oceanographic conditions at 3.5 ka BP support the view that the Saqqaq culture left Disko Bugt due to deteriorating climatic conditions. The cause of the disappearance of the Dorset culture is unclear, but the new data presented here indicate that it may be linked to a significant increase in meltwater flux, which caused cold and unstable coastal conditions at ca. 2 ka BP. The subsequent settlement of the Norse occurred at the same time as climatic amelioration during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and their disappearance may be related to harsher conditions at the beginning of the Little Ice Age.

Compared to single records, this stack represents the mean δ18O signal for northern Greenland that is interpreted as proxy for temperature. Our northern Greenland δ18O stack indicates distinctly enriched [warm] δ18O values during medieval times, about AD 1420 ± 20 and from AD 1870 onwards. The period between AD 1420 and AD 1850 has depleted [cold] δ18O values compared to the average for the entire millennium and represents the Little Ice Age. The δ18O values of the 20th century are comparable to the medieval period but are lower than that about AD 1420. …. The solar activity and internal Arctic climate dynamics are likely the main factors influencing the temperature in northern Greenland. In contrast, we could not find a general cooling effect of volcanic eruptions in our data.

The climate evolution over the last 1400 years was marked by alternating warm and cold phases. Two main climate periods can be highlighted: the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). The MWP is characterized by relatively high temperatures associated with low variability (0.34 C ± 0.37). This period occurred between ca. AD 750 and ca. AD 1200. The LIA constitutes a cold period (-0.11 C ± 0.49) from ca. AD 1200 to ca. AD 1900. The end of the LIA seems late using this study, but it is still agree with several references (Millet et al. 2009; Magny et al. 2011; Luoto 2012). In the climate reconstruction provided by Guiot et al. 2010), two particular phases can be identified in this zone. The first (from ca. AD 1200 to ca. AD 1600) is clearly colder than the second. An abrupt warming appears to occur at AD 1600 during the LIA cold period. Before AD 750, the climate appears to correspond to a cold period, whereas after AD 1900, the climate corresponds to a warming period (0.04 C ± 0.49).

Press release (sciencedaily): “Extreme climate changes in the past Ice core records show that Greenland went through 25 extreme and abrupt climate changes during the last ice age some 20,000 to 70,000 years ago. In less than 50 years the air temperatures over Greenland could increase by 10 to 15 °C. However the warm periods were short; within a few centuries the frigid temperatures of the ice age returned. That kind of climate change would have been catastrophic for us today. Ice core records from Antarctica also show climate changes in the same period, but they are more gradual, with less severe temperature swings.”

The stability of modern ice shelves is threatened by atmospheric and oceanic warming. The geologic record of formerly glaciated continental shelves provides a window into the past of how ice shelves responded to a warming climate. …. The timing of ice-shelf breakup is constrained by compound specific radiocarbon ages, the first application of this technique systematically applied to Antarctic marine sediments. Breakup initiated around 5 ka [5,000 years ago], with the ice shelf reaching its current configuration ∼1.5 ka. In the eastern Ross Sea, the ice shelf retreated up to 100 km in about a thousand years. Three-dimensional thermodynamic ice-shelf/ocean modeling results and comparison with ice-core records indicate that ice-shelf breakup resulted from combined atmospheric warming and warm ocean currents impinging onto the continental shelf.
 
Climate Model Uncertainties and the Pause
http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0191.1
The authors demonstrate that model estimates of climate sensitivity can be strongly affected by the manner through which cumulus cloud condensate is converted into precipitation in a model’s convection parameterization, processes that are only crudely accounted for in GCMs. In particular, two commonly used methods for converting cumulus condensate into precipitation can lead to drastically different climate sensitivity, as estimated here with an atmosphere–land model by increasing sea surface temperatures uniformly and examining the response in the top-of-atmosphere energy balance. The effect can be quantified through a bulk convective detrainment efficiency, which measures the ability of cumulus convection to generate condensate per unit precipitation. The model differences, dominated by shortwave feedbacks, come from broad regimes ranging from large-scale ascent to subsidence regions. Given current uncertainties in representing convective precipitation microphysics and the current inability to find a clear observational constraint that favors one version of the authors’ model over the others, the implications of this ability to engineer climate sensitivity need to be considered when estimating the uncertainty in climate projections.

Global mean surface temperature (GMST) rising has slowed down since late 1990s, which is referred to as the global warming hiatus. There was another global warming hiatus event during 1940s–1960s. The roles of the external forcing and the natural variability in both global warming hiatuses are explored, using EOF analysis. The first two leading EOF modes of the 5-year running mean global sea surface temperature (SST) reflect the global warming scenario (EOF1) and the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO)-like natural variability (EOF2), respectively. In observation, PC2 was in its positive phase (eastern Pacific cooling) during 1940s–1960s, which contributed to the previous warming hiatus. In addition, GMST trends are found to be negative during late 1950s and 1960s in most of the CMIP5 historical runs, which implies that the external forcing also contributed to the pause in the GMST rising. It is further demonstrated that it is the natural radiative forcing (volcanic forcing) that caused the drop-down of GMST in 1960s. The current global warming hiatus has been attributed to the eastern Pacific cooling/enhanced Pacific trade winds. It is shown that the PC2 switched to its positive phase in late 1990s, and hence the IPO-like natural variability made a contribution to the slowdown of GMST rising in the past decade. It is also found that the EOF1 mode (global warming mode) of the observed SST features a smaller warming in tropical Pacific compared to the Indian Ocean and the tropical Atlantic. Such inter-basin warming contrast, which is attributed to the “ocean thermostat” mechanism, has been suggested to contribute to the intensification of Pacific trade winds since late 1990s as well. Global warming hiatuses are also found in the future projections from CMIP5 models, and the spatial pattern of the SST trends during the warming-hiatus periods exhibits an IPO-like pattern, which resembles the observed SST trends since late 1990s.

The Greenland ice sheet has become one of the main contributors to global sea level rise, predominantly through increased meltwater runoff. The main drivers of Greenland ice sheet runoff, however, remain poorly understood. Here we show that clouds enhance meltwater runoff by about one-third relative to clear skies, using a unique combination of active satellite observations, climate model data and snow model simulations. This impact results from a cloud radiative effect of 29.5 (±5.2)Wm 2. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, the Greenland ice sheet responds to this energy through a new pathway by which clouds reduce meltwater refreezing as opposed to increasing surface melt directly, thereby accelerating bare-ice exposure and enhancing meltwater runoff. The high sensitivity of the Greenland ice sheet to both ice-only and liquid-bearing clouds highlights the need for accurate cloud representations in climate models, to better predict future contributions of the Greenland ice sheet to global sea level rise.
Clouds are known to play a pivotal role in regulating the local SEB [Surface Energy Balance], with competing warming and cooling effects on the surface. … The satellite-based cloud observations allow to estimate the cloud impact on the SEB [Surface Energy Balance]. … The annual mean CRE [Cloud Radiative Effect] of 29.5 (±5.2) W m 2 provides enough energy to melt 90 Gt of ice in the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] ablation area during July and August. … The snow model simulations, which capture the evolution of the GrIS SMB [Surface Mass Balance] from 2007 to 2010, indicate that clouds warm the GrIS [Greenland Ice Sheet] surface by 1.2 (±0.1) C on average over the entire period [2007-2010]. … These results further indicate that not only liquid-bearing clouds but also clouds composed exclusively of ice significantly increase radiative fluxes into the surface and decrease GrIS SMB [Greenland Ice Sheet  Surface Mass Balance]

Future changes in aerosol concentrations will influence the climate system over the coming decades. In this study we evaluate the equilibrium climate response to aerosol reductions in different parts of the world in 2050, using the global climate model EC-Earth. .. Reductions in aerosol concentrations lead to an increase in downward surface solar radiation under all-sky conditions in various parts of the world, especially in Asia where the local brightening may reach about 10 Wm−2. The associated increase in surface temperature may be as high as 0.5 °C. This signal is dominated by the reduced cooling effect of sulphate which in some areas is partially compensated by the decreased warming effect of black carbon. According to our simulations, the mitigation of BC may lead to decreases in mean summer surface temperature of up to 1 °C in central parts of North America and up to 0.3 °C in northern India. Aerosol reductions could significantly affect the climate at high latitudes especially in the winter, where temperature increases of up to 1 °C are simulated. In the Northern Hemisphere, this strong surface temperature response might be related to changes in circulation patterns and precipitation at low latitudes, which can give rise to a wave train and induce changes in weather patterns at high latitudes. Our model does not include a parameterization of aerosol indirect effects so that responses could be stronger in reality. We conclude that different, but plausible, air pollution control policies can have substantial local climate effects and induce remote responses through dynamic teleconnections

A climate study of the incidence of downward surface global solar radiation (SSRD) in the Iberian Peninsula (IP) based primarily on ERA-40 reanalysis [atmospheric radiance data] is presented. NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and ground-based records from several Portuguese and Spanish stations have been also considered. … [G]round-based measurements in Portuguese stations during the period 1964–1989 show a tendency to decrease until the mid-1970s followed by an increase up to the end of the study period, in line with the dimming/brightening phenomenon reported in the literature. … [T]he ERA-40 reanalysis shows a noticeable decrease until the early 1970s followed by a slight increase up to the end of the 1990s, suggesting a dimming/brightening transition around the early 1970s, earlier in the south and centre and later in the north of the IP. …. The results show that part of the decadal variability of the global radiation in the IP is related to changes in cloud cover (represented in ERA-40).

Most regions of the world ocean are warmer in the near-surface [0-700 m] layer than in previous decades, by over 1° C in some places.  A few areas, such as the eastern Pacific from Chile to Alaska, have cooled by as much as 1° C, yet overall the upper ocean has warmed by nearly 0.2° C globally since the mid-twentieth century.

During the past five million yrs, benthic δ18O records indicate a large range of climates, from warmer than today during the Pliocene Warm Period to considerably colder during glacials. Antarctic ice cores have revealed Pleistocene glacial–interglacial CO2 variability of 60–100 ppm, while sea level fluctuations of typically 125 m are documented by proxy data. … Our model shows CO2concentrations of 300 to 470 ppm during the Early Pliocene [5 million years ago]. Furthermore, we simulate strong CO2 variability during the Pliocene and Early Pleistocene. These features are broadly supported by existing and new δ11B-based proxy CO2 data, but less by alkenone-based records. The simulated concentrations and variations therein are larger than expected from global mean temperature changes. Our findings thus suggest a smaller Earth System Sensitivity than previously thought. This is explained by a more restricted role of land ice variability in the Pliocene. The largest uncertainty in our simulation arises from the mass balance formulation of East Antarctica, which governs the variability in sea level, but only modestly affects the modeled CO2 concentrations.

Attributing the observed climate changes to relevant forcing factors is critical to predicting future climate change scenarios. Precipitation observations in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) indicate an apparent moistening pattern over the extratropics during the time period 1979 to 2013. To investigate the predominant forcing factor in triggering such an observed wetting climate pattern, precipitation responses to four climatic forcing factors, including Antarctic ozone, water vapour, sea surface temperature (SST), and carbon dioxide, were assessed quantitatively in sequence through an inductive approach. … Quantified differential contribution with respect to those climatic forcing factors may explain why the observed austral extratropical moistening pattern is primarily driven by the Antarctic ozone depletion, while mildly modulated by the cooling effect of equatorial Pacific SST and the increased greenhouse gases, respectively.

Recent peripheral thinning of the Greenland Ice Sheet is partly offset by interior thickening and is overprinted on its poorly constrained Holocene evolution. On the basis of the ice sheet’s radiostratigraphy, ice flow in its interior is slower now than the average speed over the past nine millennia. Generally higher Holocene accumulation rates relative to modern estimates can only partially explain this millennial-scale deceleration. The ice sheet’s dynamic response to the decreasing proportion of softer ice from the last glacial period and the deglacial collapse of the ice bridge across Nares Strait also contributed to this pattern. Thus, recent interior thickening of the Greenland Ice Sheet is partly an ongoing dynamic response to the last deglaciation that is large enough to affect interpretation of its mass balance from altimetry.

In late winter-early spring 2012, the second Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystems Experiment (SIPEX II) was conducted off Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, onboard R/V Aurora Australis. The sea-ice conditions were characterized by significantly thick first-year ice and snow, trapping the ship for about 10 days in the near coastal region. The deep snow cover was particularly remarkable, in that its average value of 0.45 m was almost three times that observed between 1992 and 2007 in the region. … Based on these results, we deduce that lower loss of snow into leads was probably responsible for the extraordinary snow in 2012. Statistical analysis and satellite images suggest that the reduction in loss of snow into leads is attributed to rough ice surface associated with active deformation processes and larger floe size due to sea-ice expansion. This highlights the importance of snow-sea ice interaction in determining the mean snow depth on Antarctic sea ice.

We present climate and surface mass balance (SMB) of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) as simulated by the global, coupled ocean–atmosphere–land Community Earth System Model (CESM) with a horizontal resolution of ∼1∘ in the past, present and future (1850–2100). CESM correctly simulates present-day Antarctic sea ice extent, large-scale atmospheric circulation and near-surface climate, but fails to simulate the recent expansion of Antarctic sea ice. The present-day Antarctic ice sheet SMB equals 2280±131 Gtyear−1, which concurs with existing independent estimates of AIS SMB. When forced by two CMIP5 climate change scenarios (high mitigation scenario RCP2.6 and high-emission scenario RCP8.5), CESM projects an increase of Antarctic ice sheet SMB of about 70 Gtyear−1 per degree warming. This increase is driven by enhanced snowfall, which is partially counteracted by more surface melt and runoff along the ice sheet’s edges. This intensifying hydrological cycle is predominantly driven by atmospheric warming, which increases (1) the moisture-carrying capacity of the atmosphere, (2) oceanic source region evaporation, and (3) summer AIS cloud liquid water content.

Prydz Bay is one of the largest embayments on the East Antarctic coast and it is the discharge point for approximately 16% of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. … The compiled geological data extend the relative sea-level curve for this region to 11,258 cal yr BP and include new constraints based on abandoned penguin colonies, new isolation basin data in the Vestfold Hills, validation of a submarine relative sea-level constraint in the Rauer Islands and recalibrated radiocarbon ages at all sites dating from 12,728 cal yr BP. The field data show rapid increases in rates of relative sea level rise of 12–48 mm/yr between 10,473 (or 9678) and 9411 cal yr BP in the Vestfold Hills and of 8.8 mm/yr between 8882 and 8563 cal yr BP in the Larsemann Hills. The relative sea-level high stands of ≥ 8.8 m from 9411 to after 7564 cal yr BP (Vestfold Hills) and ≥ 8 m at 8563 and 7066 cal yr BP (Larsemann Hills) are over-predicted by some of the glacial isostatic adjustment models considered here, suggesting that assumptions relating to the magnitude and timing of regional ice loss since the Last Glacial Maximum may need revising. In the Vestfold Hills and Rauer Islands the final deglacial sea-level rise was almost exactly cancelled out by local rebound between 9411 and 5967 cal yr BP and this was followed by a near exponential decay in relative sea-level.

Near the vent site, the urchins experienced large daily variations in pH (> 1 unit) andpCO2 (> 2000 ppm) and average pH values (pHT 7.73) much below those expected under the most pessimistic future emission scenarios. Growth was measured over a 17-month period using tetracycline tagging of the calcareous feeding lanterns. Average-sized urchins grew more than twice as fast at the vent compared with those at an adjacent control site, and assumed larger sizes at the vent compared to the control site and two other sites at another reef near-by. … Thus, urchins did not only persist but actually ‘thrived’ under extreme CO2 conditions.

Elevated CO2 as a driver of global dryland greening
While recent findings based on satellite records indicate a positive trend in vegetation greenness over global drylands, the reasons remain elusive. We hypothesize that enhanced levels of atmospheric CO2 play an important role in the observed greening through the CO2 effect on plant water savings and consequent available soil water increases. Meta-analytic techniques were used to compare soil water content under ambient and elevated CO2 treatments across a range of climate regimes, vegetation types, soil textures and land management practices. Based on 1705 field measurements from 21 distinct sites, a consistent and statistically significant increase in the availability of soil water (11%) was observed under elevated CO2 treatments in both drylands and non-drylands, with a statistically stronger response over drylands (17% vs. 9%). Given the inherent water limitation in drylands, it is suggested that the additional soil water availability is a likely driver of observed increases in vegetation greenness.

"WASHINGTON  —   The F. B. I. had a job offer for Nick Young, a veteran Washington transit officer: Become an undercover informant for the bureau and gather information at local mosques on fellow Muslims who might pose a terrorism threat. The clandestine work would be “a lot sexier” than his current job, Mr. Young remembered an agent named Ryan telling him. And it could pay him a lot of money if the intelligence was good. Mr. Young turned him down. But it would not be the last time he would see the F. B. I. agent. Last August, five years later, Mr. Young was summoned to the headquarters of the transit agency, Metro, where Ryan and other agents were waiting for him. “You probably don’t recognize me, do you?” Ryan, whose beard was now thicker, asked him. “Oh, I recognize you,” Mr. Young said. This time, the agent handcuffed Mr. Young on a charge of supporting the Islamic State  —   a case built, in a twist, by an informant who posed as a   terrorist fighter. The prosecution of Mr. Young, the only law enforcement officer among more than 100 Americans who have been accused of helping the Islamic State, offers a revealing look at the F. B. I. ’s shadowy    efforts to identify possible Islamic extremists. President Trump has vowed to intensify the effort as part of a campaign to “annihilate” the militant group. Mr. Young’s case also poses a challenge to the F. B. I. ’s expanding use of undercover operations to identify Islamic State sympathizers inside the United States who might travel overseas to help the terrorist group or commit “lone wolf” attacks at home. His lawyer claims that the F. B. I. entrapped him, with undercover operatives popping in and out of his life for at least six years. To law enforcement officials, however, Mr. Young represents one of their worst fears: a longtime officer, with access to sensitive facilities, who they suspect was “radicalized” to support Islamic extremism. He is charged with providing “material support” to the Islamic State, in the form of $245 worth of Google Play gift cards. The authorities say he gave the gift cards to a Muslim friend named Mo  —   in reality, an undercover informant  —   to support recruitment for the terrorist group. Before now, very few American suspects linked to the Islamic State have spoken out. But in three and a half hours of interviews from jail, Mr. Young, a convert to Islam, portrayed himself and many other American Muslims under investigation as victims of religious persecution. He accused an “overzealous” F. B. I. of “manufacturing” the case. “I know for sure I wouldn’t have been targeted if I was an evangelic Christian or a Sikh or a Hindu or something,” said Mr. Young, 37. “I’m not a terrorist,” he added. “Seeing these horrible allegations and the way they’re trying to paint me, it’s just a nightmare. ” Officials at the F. B. I. and the Justice Department declined to comment on the case. In general, the F. B. I. said in a statement, the investigative techniques used in such national security cases “are subject to vigorous oversight and require us to use the least intrusive means possible. ” The F. B. I. has moved aggressively since the rise of the Islamic State in 2014 to identify suspected extremist supporters inside the United States, opening hundreds of investigations and generating convictions from Brooklyn to Southern California, often against young Muslim men. Mr. Trump has declared that the country must do more to confront what he calls “radical Islamic terrorism,” including the possibility of expanding surveillance and intelligence operations, creating a “registry” of American Muslims, and reviving torture as an interrogation technique. While Mr. Trump has sent mixed signals on some of those proposals, they have worried some civil liberties advocates, who say they are eager to see whether the Justice Department and the F. B. I. seek to expand their investigative powers still further in domestic terrorism cases. Mr. Young sees himself as a pawn in that broader fight. He acknowledges holding passionate views about the Middle East and the “slaughter” of Syrians by the government of President Bashar  . On breaks from the transit agency, Mr. Young traveled to Libya twice in 2011 with body armor to join rebels fighting the Qaddafi regime. “I didn’t kill anyone while I was there,” he said, laughing, but “I got shot at a lot. ” He insisted that he had never supported terrorists. He plans to take the witness stand at his trial, an unusual tactic for a terrorism suspect. “Nick doesn’t have anything to hide,” said Nicholas D. Smith, one of his lawyers. As he waits for his trial date, he sits in a rural jail in Warsaw, Va. reading science fiction occasionally, with “The Jerry Springer Show” sometimes playing on a television in the background. “My brain’s turning to mush,” he said. He said the jail had denied him access to Muslim prayer sessions. But the conditions are far better, he added, than the solitary confinement he was placed in for 23 hours a day for months after his arrest. That ordeal, he said, has caused lingering panic attacks and other problems. Unlike the bulk of the Americans charged with supporting the Islamic State, Mr. Young is not accused of plotting violence or trying to travel to the Middle East to fight with the group. He said he was under investigation for so long, it was almost inevitable that the authorities would find a way to charge him. “At the end of the day, the crime I’m being accused of  —   a crime of sending gift cards  —   it would be laughable if it wasn’t really happening,” Mr. Young said. He declined to explain the gift cards, citing a pretrial order that restricts what he can say about documents in the case. But he said his explanation would come out at his trial. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, dozens of terrorism defendants caught in undercover stings have claimed in court that they were illegally entrapped into saying or doing incriminating things. None have succeeded. Judges have given the Justice Department wide latitude in using undercover stings in terrorism cases. “You almost need a perfect case” to prove entrapment, said Seamus Hughes, a terrorism expert at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, “and that’s difficult to find. ” Still, several legal analysts said Mr. Young might have a legitimate shot, because of the unusual elements of the F. B. I. ’s yearslong undercover investigation. They point out that even an    charge that Mr. Young faces is based on his statements to agents about a fictional F. B. I. investigation into the whereabouts of a   Islamic State fighter who never existed. Mr. Young apparently first came onto the F. B. I. ’s radar around 2010 because he knew a fellow student at George Mason University, Zachary A. Chesser, who, like him, was a white convert to Islam from Northern Virginia and attended the same mosque. The F. B. I. interviewed Mr. Young that year as part of an investigation into Mr. Chesser, who ultimately pleaded guilty to   charges after he was accused of threatening the creators of “South Park” over the show’s depiction of the Prophet Muhammad. Mr. Young does not appear to have been an F. B. I. target at the time, even as undercover informants began giving the bureau reports about the activities of him and some of his associates. He continued working as an armed officer patrolling   subways and bus lines. He said F. B. I. agents  —   Ryan and a second agent  —   had met with him twice in 2011 to recruit him as an informant. Mr. Young said he found the idea of becoming an informant distasteful. The F. B. I. said in a court affidavit that he had used stronger language in a conversation with one of the bureau’s undercover informants, saying that if he were ever betrayed by one, “that person’s head would be in a cinder block” at the bottom of a lake. Based on wiretaps and statements from informants, the F. B. I. reported that Mr. Young had made a number of other incendiary and perhaps even threatening comments over the years about Muslim informants, F. B. I. investigators and “kaffirs”  —   or nonbelievers. Mr. Young acknowledged that he could have used “a little  ” in some of his private remarks. But he said he had never meant them to be taken literally. “Everyone’s capable of saying stupid, blustery things,” said Mr. Smith, his lawyer. Some F. B. I. officials pressed to bring criminal charges against Mr. Young years ago, but the Justice Department rebuffed them because of an apparent lack of evidence that he was involved in supporting terrorism, according to law enforcement officials. It was not until 2014 that Mr. Young crossed the line into supporting terrorism, the Justice Department now alleges. That was when he first met Mo, a Middle Easterner who said he was a military reservist, at a mosque where he prayed. Mr. Young said he had suspected early on that Mo might be an informant because of his strange mannerisms. But his concerns eased, and the two became friends, meeting at a Starbucks or elsewhere. Mo later told Mr. Young that he was thinking of traveling to Syria to join the Islamic State, prosecutors said. While Mr. Young sometimes appeared to offer Mo advice on how best to avoid government scrutiny if he went to the Middle East, he also told him at times that he did not need to join the terrorist group  —   at least not then, according to the F. B. I. ’s account. “There is no one with a gun to your head that is counting down,” he told Mo in a conversation recorded in October 2014. Such statements, said Mr. Smith, his lawyer, show that “the government is really grasping at straws here. ” Prosecutors are acting on “really more of a hunch that he might commit crimes in the future,” he said, “and they can’t prove it. ”"

As the Australian media-elite relentlessly hammers its “climate emergency” narrative during Australia’s bushfire crisis, many citizen journalists have been [digging through Australia’s available old newspapers](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/how-the-australian-government-created-a-treasure-trove-for-citizen-journalists/), turning up story after story to debunk hyperbolic media claims. The Green-left have been doing some digging, too.



The Green-left, immediately and enthusiastically echoed by the luvvies in the taxpayer-funded media, seized on a single sentence in the 2008 Garnaut report, to claim that “they knew” these fires were going to happen.



 **But did they really?**



Firstly, the Green-left’s soothsayer didn’t “know” anything: he repeated a projection. Projections are not “knowledge” in the sense of being certain that something will happen. Climate modellers typically make dozens of projections. Most of them do not eventuate. Seizing on just one apparently successful projection, while ignoring the others, is the sort of fallacious reasoning that convinces gullible rubes that John Edwards really does talk to dead people.



As it happens, when cherry-picked from Garnaut’s voluminous report, without any context, that single sentence **might** appear eerily prophetic.



“Recent projections of fire weather suggest that fire seasons will start earlier, end slightly later and generally be more intense. This effect increases over time, but should be directly observable by 2020.” (Page 118).



Talk about Nostradamus! Except…



Even with Garnaut’s (more credible) bushfire prediction, it is important to drill into the detail of what was said (something the ABC/Fairfax/Guardian climate change cheer squad failed to do). The 2008 report relied on a bushfires study commissioned by the Climate Institute of Australia. The four authors (Lucas, Hennessy, Mills and Bathols) wrote of how:



“Bushfires are an inevitable occurrence in Australia. (In the South-East) the winter and spring rains allow fuel growth, while the dry summers allow fire danger to build. This normal risk is exacerbated by periodic droughts that occur as a part of natural inter-annual climate variability.”



At no point did they say bushfires would be caused by climate change. Their main conclusion was to point to an increase in the number of ‘fire danger days’ on the Australian mainland, marginally increasing the length of our bushfire seasons by 2020. That looks about right.



But Garnaut wasn’t “predicting” anything. Much less fingering climate change as the dastardly culprit.



Elsewhere, Garnaut was sceptical about linking climate change to specific weather events and outcomes. “Single events, such as an intense tropical cyclone or a long-lived heatwave”, he wrote, “cannot be directly attributed to climate change.” (Page 106) Presumably this also applies to a dry spell and a bad bushfire season.



Garnaut is also no friend to the [Klimate Kult](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/be-very-afraid-of-the-new-kkk/)’s other favourite impending climate catastrophes. Aren’t we all gonna die, our economies and societies wiped off the face of the planet by a vengeful Gaia?



Re-reading the Garnaut Report is like an antidote to Green-Left hysteria. Are you worried about heat-related deaths due to global warming, people literally frying alive? Garnaut forecast, “In NSW, the number of annual temperature-related deaths is expected to decrease by 30 percent” (Page 126)



What about the Australian economy being destroyed, sector by sector, with mass unemployment from the impact of climate change? Garnaut said, “Australians will be substantially wealthier in 2100 in terms of goods and services, despite setbacks from climate change.” (Page 127) It hardly sounds like the end of the world.



Elsewhere, Garnaut’s projections are as off the mark as a TV psychic guessing that they’re being contacted by some whose name starts with L, no, A, or is that C? E, anyone? Anyone?



He predicted sea level rises of up to 59 cms, which are not occurring. He said Pacific nations such as Kiribati, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands would be submerged, which hasn’t happened. (Page 149) He forecast, “climate refugees could constitute the fastest growing proportion of refugees globally”, which is ludicrous.



Garnaut wasn’t completely wrong, but he wasn’t infallibly right, either. Cherry-picking a single sentence that appears to pander to your hysterical doom-mongering is the sort of irrational blindness that keeps frauds, shonks and psychics in business.

The dreadful Australian bushfires have recently demonstrated how dangerous Green policies can be. Hopefully, this will result in a review of some of their most dangerous policies, but in the meantime, their zeal and stupidity still raises its head in many places. In the last week, it has been announced that hospitals in this country are planning to introduce **‘meat free Mondays’** , as all patients will be fed vegetarian or possibly even vegan meals every Monday.



Making sick people eat a vegan diet? What could possibly go wrong?



Patients’ health will suffer if hospitals cut down on meat and dairy in meals, the country’s former chief education health and nutrition adviser warns. 



However, another researcher has backed the push for plants to replace meat and dairy in meals, saying our meat consumption seriously harms health **and the planet.**



The guidelines have been criticised by Grant Schofield, professor of public health at Auckland University of Technology. 



“Hospital food is generally of a pretty poor quality anyway, it is generally pretty highly processed. If you wanted to improve hospital meals you would look at the quality of the food, and meat would be my last possible target, because it is one of the best sources of nutrition, protein, good quality fat and vitamins and minerals. To take that out of it seems objectionable.” 



Most of the dietary advice available these days to promote good health tells us to limit carbohydrates, particularly sugar. While I have no problem with vegetarian options being available in a hospital, deliberately reducing patients’ allocation of healthy protein seems contra to the idea that being in hospital is supposed to help patients get well.



Schofield, who advocates a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet and quit his Government advisory role over a lack of action on obesity, said cutting meat and dairy in hospital meals to counter climate change was “nonsense”.



“I think we have unfairly demonised meat and got it into our heads that it is somehow ruining the planet.”



So the Greens slavishly insist, but the evidence that a meat-free and dairy-free diet is not a healthy way to live is well and truly out there. Many vegans and vegetarians are not particularly healthy. You have to be a really good cook and nutritionist to get all of your daily vitamins and minerals from a vegetarian, and particularly a vegan diet. Some people do it well; many do not.



I have a vegan friend who is not a particularly good cook. She lives on chips and 2-minute noodles. It is good to stand by your principles, but not if it risks damaging your health. Still, at least this is her choice. Hospital patients don’t have that luxury.



Associate Health Minister and Green Party MP Julie Anne Genter championed the guidelines. DHBs are expected to make appropriate and responsible decisions about food menus that consider both the nutritional requirements of patients, staff and visitors, as well as the environmental impact of those choices,” Genter said in a statement. 



The Greens in Australia prefer people and animals to be burnt to death rather than to deliberately cut down a single tree. **Greens in New Zealand don’t care if sick people are undernourished** , so long as they consider the environmental impact of what they eat. What absolute garbage.



After the guidelines were released Dietitians NZ, the professional body for dietetics, labelled the meat and dairy recommendation disappointing and not appropriate for those in hospital, **who are often malnourished.**



Some of them are probably vegans…



That position drew a response from Professor John Potter of the Centre for Public Health Research at Massey University, who wrote in a blog post that even if some patients needed more protein, this could be sourced from plants. Hospitals should go further and initiative meat-free Mondays and stop serving all processed meats .



What he neglects to mention is how very little protein can be obtained from plants. Not all protein is equal. It would take a couple of kilos of mung beans and 7 kilos of kale to get the protein a patient could obtain from one small steak. Also, protein from meat is much more satisfying than kale, so the only way a patient can end up without hunger pangs is for them to eat lots of carbohydrates – bread, pasta, potatoes or the like. Yep. Very healthy.



I did wonder if this might be a bit like the plastic bag issue, where supermarkets all jumped on the virtue-signalling gravy train, while dramatically improving their bottom lines. But to get the same nutritional value from plants as from meat would be an expensive exercise, and I doubt if it will happen. I am guessing that it will be baked beans on toast for dinner every Monday, take it or leave it. 



Of course, all the virtue signalling in the world will not get around human behaviour. How much do you want to bet that there is a surge of family members visiting their relatives in hospital on Mondays, and bringing them KFC. Yep, that will really help their recovery. And the planet.

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The Conversation has published a gem of an article, aimed at people suffering climate “guilt”, to help them philosophically come to terms with the fact that they are experiencing emotional distress, about events which haven’t happened
According to The Conversation;
Do you suffer from climate guilt? A dose of philosophy can help
People cannot engage in something they cannot see or feel. We need concrete reasons to care and act. In this way, climate change presents a threefold intangible challenge:
1. we can perceive the weather, but the climate system is something rather abstract, a statistical construct
2. we now know climate change is anthropogenic, or man-made, but how can we understand this? One way is to say: mankind is the reason, but this becomes also very abstract. Who actually is represented with mankind? Another way is to say: China or the US is to blame, as if we are speaking of subjects and not concepts. We cannot grasp how you and I contribute to climate change, not by doing something extraordinary, but with our everyday lives
3. we cannot perceive how we as individuals can contribute to mitigating climate change. Eighteenth-century philosopher George Berkeley stated that “To be is to be perceived.” If we can’t see the change in the climate system, nor the reason why it is actually occurring, does it exist in our daily lives?

Read more: http://theconversation.com/do-you-suffer-from-climate-guilt-a-dose-of-philosophy-can-help-43522
My favourite takeaway soundbite is the following;
… Furthermore, climate is not here and now. Its only possible way to be perceived is through recognition of patterns, by computer modeling and, most importantly, through representations. …

 _Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others…But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret – Matthew 6:1-4_.



While the bushfire crisis in Australia has seen Australians respond with their [characteristic generosity](https://www.countriesnow.com/which-country-gives-the-most-charity/), it has also sparked an unseemly game of one-upmanship, especially among the media-elite and in the sewers of social media. Like the hypocrites in the Bible, too many people are jumping on their little social-media stumps to trumpet their own moral virtue and smear and belittle others – who, oddly enough, seem invariably to be the standard targets of the left-elite.



What should be a unifying moment has become yet another platform for the left-elite’s Two Minutes of Hate.



Philanthropists Andrew and ­Nic­ola Forrest have made a $70m pledge to fight and prevent bushfires — and to help victims — as social media bickered over who has donated and how much.



The Forrests announced on Thursday that the charitable organ­isation they created, Minderoo Foundation, would give $10m to mobilise specialist volunteers from Western Australia, $10m for immediate bushfire recovery and a $50m investment to developing “a holistic assessment and blueprint of what Australia needs to do to improve resilience”.



Despite being one of Australia’s most generous philanthropists, Forrest is a regular Goldstein for the left. He might be extraordinarily generous (especially to indigenous causes), but Forrest is a mining magnate who is sceptical of the climate change narrative. Cue the torches and pitchforks.



But, if the left-elite hate Forrest, they hate Gina Rinehart infinitely more.



The donation came after a spokesman for Australia’s richest woman, Gina Rinehart, was prompted to issue a statement saying the billionaire preferred­ to make her donations privately.



Mrs Rinehart had apparently done so at a function for fire relief at her home on Tuesday, the same day comedian Celeste Barber named her in a tweet and wrote, “If you’re in Hawaii on a family holiday, I’m going to flip a f..king table”.



Barber has to be credited for starting an appeal that has raised nearly $50m – which makes it even more disgraceful that she then uses it as a platform for spewing idiotic leftist hate.



 _Many who were rich put in much. Then one poor widow came and threw in two mites…“Assuredly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those who have given to the treasury; for they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had, her whole livelihood” – Mark 12:41-44._



Unlike Rinehart, who has largely observed the injunction to make her giving private, too many wealthy business people, and celebrities especially, are using the bushfires to trumpet their own assumed moral goodness.



The moral rule about keeping philanthropy private is not just some musty Christian moralism, either. Many wealthy philanthropists have criticised their peers for being too cynically eager to make their charity all about **them**.



AC/DC’s Brian Johnson, a generous (if quiet) philanthropist, once reprimanded other celebrities for their self-aggrandising: **“I’m sorry mate, do it yourself, spend some of your own money and get it done…Do a charity gig, fair enough, but not on worldwide television,” he said. “I do it myself, I don’t tell everybody I’m doing it.”**



Johnson’s “worldwide television” comment seems to be a jab at the massive celebrity fundraisers such as Live Aid, which AC/DC turned down. The Smiths, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Rod Stewart also declined. Depeche Mode noted that many Live Aid participants not coincidentally enjoyed massively increased sales, post-Live Aid, and questioned the motive behind making such a public display of generosity.



 **Charity should be a matter of giving without thought of reward, not an excuse to publicly signal your own moral superiority.**

2020 has arrived and it promises to be one of intense interest, at least for us political tragics. There is our own election, the American election and the ongoing saga of Brexit. No doubt tragics of a different sort will keep banging on about climate change and how death for all of us is just around the corner. Then there will be the United Nations doing their best to march us all on to their misguided utopia of an eventual world government. Oh, and we mustn’t forget the [ludicrous impeachment.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/impeachment-really-about-harming-trump-2020/)



So what might be the outcomes of all of these? Some are easier to predict than others.  
Starting with our own election where, unfortunately, the outcome is by no means a certainty. Had National performed in Opposition as effectively as David Seymour then I think we could be more confident of a result to our liking. National need to hammer home the things they will do that set them apart from Labour. Getting rid of [Kiwibuild](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/resignation-another-hole-in-the-kiwibuild-ship/), a moderate message on climate change, start supporting legal gun owners, bringing back oil and gas exploration and charter schools and building roads. They should also show unequivocal support for our beleaguered farmers with realistic goals and regulations.



The American election looks much easier to predict. It will be tweeter Trump against whichever economic nutter the Democrats select. I just can’t see the Donald losing the election. He has lived up to most of his promises, the economy is strong and the sharemarkets are performing well. For how long is the million-dollar question? He has done well in the area of job creation which means he should maintain support in the rust belt. While some of his policies in relation to trade and foreign affairs might be questionable he overall comes across as a no-nonsense President and not one to be messed with.



[Brexit ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/monty-margaret-backing-boris-on-brexit/)will provide a year of engrossment. Boris will have to show a Trumparian determination to see it through. The EU is already starting to play dirty and act in a cowardly manner as they are only too aware that Boris now has the upper hand. You can expect plenty of political thuggery as this plays out. Boris must not yield any ground to these zealots of the left who despise anyone who thinks differently to them. How successful Brexit is could determine whether or not other countries decide to leave thereby hastening the end of a thoroughly obnoxious organisation.



The insane lot in the Green Party will no doubt keep wanting us to be forever having to change our knickers over their verbal emissions on climate change…while they get theirs in a twist. We can expect a lot more grandstanding from [Greta ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/the-bfd-video-13/)as George (Soros) tells her what to say. No doubt all the other political wets around the world will continue to show their undying support to this child marionette of global warming. You have to feel sorry for her.



Despite the major setback to the EU through Brexit, that paragon organisation of the left, the United Nations, will be undeterred in their aims for globalisation. Just last Friday they approved a Russian led bid, backed by China, to create a new convention on cybercrime. Russia and China’s aim will be to extend their **internet censorship** from their countries around the globe. I would hate to think our UN luvvie PM would sign us up to this dangerous convention. It is nothing short of impinging on the rights to free speech.



And finally to the circus that is [Trump’s impeachment](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/dim-bulbs-begin-to-light-up-that-impeachment-might-be-a-pyrrhic-victory/) led by the clowns from the Democrats with poor old Nancy forced to play the role of ringmaster. Ocasio-Cortez and her squad are pulling the strings from the high wires while Schiff, Nadler and co are the chimpanzees running the tea party. It appears Senate Democrats have a few more clues than their House counterparts as they are now expressing concern that the impeachment will only strengthen Trump’s hand following his acquittal in the Senate. They have come to the conclusion that the Donald will be able to say he did nothing wrong and the whole thing was a witch hunt. Correct, but we at _The BFD_ could have told them that at the start. This proves again that those on the Left are not the brightest of the human species. Hello Wellington.



However, you look at 2020, it’s going to hold our interest in more ways than one. And that’s before we get to prognosticating on how well Ian Foster will succeed as All Black coach! So many things to think about. But being on the right side, the bright side, I’m sure we’ll all cope.



Happy 2020!

Share this...FacebookTwitterGuest author Kenneth Richard has updated the lists of papers that do not support the claimed “climate science consensus” for 2014, 2015 and 2016 (just added). The updated list for 2015 has been posted (see right side bar under “Pages”) and now includes 282 papers.

 IPCC climate reports are emerging as only half reports. Image: IPCC
2014 will be updated soon.
2016 has just been added to the “Pages” side bar.
As the body of evidence refuting climate alarmism continues to balloon, the question of how the IPCC can continue ignoring it becomes ever more glaring. Clearly the IPCC has weighted alarmist papers over those that are not.

660 papers in just over 2 years
Over the last 27 months over 660 scientific peer-reviewed papers have ben published refuting alarmist claims on everything from temperature rise, climate model integrity, droughts, extreme weather events, floods to hurricanes, sea level rise, etc.
Overhauled IPCC is needed
Now is not the time to disband the IPCC, but rather it is time to completely overhaul it and assure it does its task objectively and without an agenda.
Though most of the papers the Kenneth Richard lists support that climate change is happening (it always has) and that human activity appears to be one factor, the alarmist scenarios often trumpeted by the media and IPCC scientists are in fact turning out to be more hype and less reality.
According to Kenneth Richard, who has spent hundreds of hours meticulously analyzing the body of climate science literature, already this year alone (2016) some 133 consensus-skeptical papers have been published.

"Even if President Trump’s      fails over the long run to create jobs or prevent companies from moving offshore, there’s a good chance that it will appear, at first, to be a success. But this is a dangerous illusion, the result of companies responding strategically to the new president’s threats. And it could lead to more bad policy if voters or policy makers draw the wrong conclusions. That’s why it’s important to understand precisely how these new policies are likely to shape the numbers over the next few years. Some simple economics can help. Mr. Trump has taken to Twitter to name and shame manufacturing firms planning to relocate some of their production lines overseas. His attacks on Carrier, on Toyota, on General Motors have made their chief executives squirm and, in some cases, have produced what appear to be results. Carrier, for instance, has promised to keep some of the jobs it had planned to send offshore in the United States. Other companies have recycled old announcements of their domestic expansion plans. At first glance, pressuring a handful of companies seems unlikely to have much impact in an economy as large as that of the United States. Imagine that you are a chief executive of a company that has not been a Trump target there are so many companies in the country that the risk of yours being denounced by the president is tiny. At least that’s what the math shows. But the psychological reality is very different. Research has shown that people often overreact to insignificant risks, especially when the risks are so vivid. Just as it is almost certain that you won’t get eaten by a shark this summer, it is a near certainty that the vast majority of companies won’t end up in Mr. Trump’s cross hairs. Yet the fears persist, and people take greater precautionary measures than the actual threat warrants. Moreover, Mr. Trump is targeting the asset that corporate bosses tend to protect most jealously: their personal reputation. Which makes them edgy. So far, the evidence bears this out. There are plenty of anecdotes suggesting that Mr. Trump has executives running scared. Some are hiring communications and crisis managers. Few have been willing to announce the sort of plant closings that might put them in the harsh glare of the president’s spotlight. But this doesn’t mean that Mr. Trump’s tweets have saved jobs. At least not in a lasting sense. To see why not, put yourself in the shoes of a C. E. O. You’re not just deciding whether to send production offshore you also need to decide when to act. This gives you a relatively cheap way to avoid the president’s ire: Mothball your blueprints for the new overseas factory, but don’t burn them. When the political threat passes  —   and, eventually, it will  —   just dust them off and move. If enough companies follow this script over the next couple of years, the number of factory jobs in the United States should stabilize, or even rise. Mr. Trump’s eventual successor may well inherit a manufacturing sector that is superficially stronger, though it will hide an underlying weakness: thousands of C. E. O.s ready to move production offshore. As soon as Mr. Trump leaves the stage, several years worth of   demand for offshoring may erupt, and as these plans are followed and factory jobs return to more normal levels, expect a sharp drop in manufacturing employment. Now imagine what all this will look like to a future policy wonk. Manufacturing jobs seemed to be scarce before Mr. Trump’s tenure, improved while he was at the helm, and then shrank sharply as soon as he left office. It might seem as though his angry tweets actually caused manufacturing to thrive. But it would be a mistake to infer that businesses really perform better when threatened. Rather, the fluctuating jobs numbers reflect the ease with which cuts can be delayed, not prevented. Sure, a delay is, in itself, good news for factory workers who keep their jobs a little longer, but it doesn’t address their   problems. Indeed, many economists, both Democrat and Republican, fear that Mr. Trump’s policy of naming and shaming will hurt the manufacturing sector in the long run. After all, the point of the exercise is to allocate workers and machines based on presidential diktat, not market forces. He is pushing corporate leaders to please the White House, rather than their customers and shareholders. The cost of hiring crisis managers to deal with Mr. Trump raises the cost of doing business just as surely as a tax hike would. By making it more expensive to leave the market, he also creates a disincentive for foreign companies thinking of building plants in the United States. The difficulty with trying to use the bully pulpit to create a lasting change in corporate behavior is that words  —   even a president’s  —   don’t much alter a company’s bottom line. Corporate decisions are driven by the balance of costs and benefits, and the benefits of offshoring are typically large and enduring. Still, for short periods, even relatively minor incentive shifts can cause large reactions when what is involved is merely a delay, not fundamental change. For example, imagine two people who love Cancún and have decided to vacation there if the cost of a flight rises by $100, they will go anyway, because the cost isn’t enough to deter them. But if the airfare rises by $100 on Sunday, the day they had planned to go, but was to remain at the original price on Monday, the travelers may well decide to wait a day. So fewer people may fly to Mexico on the weekend, when it’s more expensive, yet there will be no   impact on travel. Temporary policies often look as though they have disproportionately large effects, but they aren’t meaningful. That is the odd truth here: Mr. Trump’s approach may appear to have had a big effect precisely because it’s not viewed as a permanent solution. In fact, the more temporary his   industrial policy is thought to be, the more likely it is that chief executives will delay job cuts until the climate changes. Perhaps corporate bosses are currently pliant because they expect that this storm will pass. But bad economics can be good politics. We may see some spectacular   effects, even if Mr. Trump undermines the   competitiveness of America’s factories. The political upside will be obvious in the monthly employment numbers, while the economic downside will be difficult to disentangle from the   trend of declining factory jobs. Yet we shouldn’t be deluded. C. E. O.s will ultimately move jobs abroad if that’s what it takes to churn out profits."

From the Institute of Physics and the “children won’t know what snow is” department:
The likelihood of record-breaking warm years in England is set to substantially increase as a result of the human influence on the climate, new research suggests.
Time series of the observed CET (black).Time series of the mean of the historical simulations (solidorange), RCP8.5 simulations (solidred) and historical Nat simulations (solidblue). The maximum and minimum values of the modelled CET are shown for the historical simulations (dashedorange), RCP8.5simulations (dashed red) and HistoricalNat  simulations (dashedblue).The record annualCET is marked by the black cross.
In a study published today, 1 May, in IOP Publishing’s journal Environmental Research Letters, an international team of researchers has shown that the chances of England experiencing a record-breaking warm year, such as the one seen in 2014, is at least 13 times more likely as a result of anthropogenic climate change.
This is according to climate model simulations and detailed analyses of the Central England Temperature (CET) record–the world’s longest instrumental temperature record dating back to 1659.
The results of the study showed that human activities have a large influence on extreme warm years in England, which the researchers claim is remarkable given England is such a small region of the world.
Lead author of the study Dr Andrew King, from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of Melbourne, said: “When you look at average annual temperatures over larger regions of the world, such as the whole of Europe, there is a lower variability in temperatures from year to year compared with smaller areas.
“As a result of this low variability, it is easier to spot anomalies. This is why larger regions tend to produce stronger attribution statements, so it is remarkable that we get such a clear anthropogenic influence on temperatures in a relatively small area across central England.”
To arrive at their results, the researchers firstly used climate model simulations to calculate the likelihood of very warm years when there is just natural forcings on the climate and no human influence, and then when there is both natural forcings and human influence. The change in the likelihood of warm years due to human influences on the climate was then calculated.
The researchers then observed the CET and picked out the warmest years from the record since 1900. The warmest years were then plotted onto a graph which the researchers used to calculate the likelihood of warm years happening now and warms years happening 100 years ago.
The model-based method suggested at least a 13-fold increase (with 90% confidence) due to human influences on the climate, whilst the observation-based approach suggested at least a 22-fold increase in the probability of very warm years in the climate of today compared with the climate of a century ago (again with 90% confidence).
“Both of our approaches showed that there is a significant and substantial increase in the likelihood of very warm years occurring in central England,” Dr King Continued.
According to the CET, 2014 was the warmest year on record in central England. It has been reported that during the last 60 years there has been rapid warming in the CET in line with the anthropogenic influence on the climate, with the highest average annual temperature of 10.93 °C recorded in 2014.
The Central England Temperature (CET) series, which is the longest instrumental time series of temperature in the world, has monthly recordings of average temperatures dating back to 1659 and recordings of average daily temperatures dating back to 1772.
The CET is designed to represent the climate of the English Midlands, which is approximated by a triangular area enclosed by Lancashire in the north, Bristol in the south-west and London in the south-east. The CET has undergone thorough and extensive quality control, making it an ideal resource for studying long-term temperature trends across the region.
As to whether these results can be seen to be representative of areas outside of central England, Dr King said: “I would expect that other areas near the UK would produce similar results.
“For larger regions, stronger attribution statements can often be made. For example, we performed a similar attribution study for Europe as a whole and found a 35-fold increase in the likelihood of extremely warm years using model simulations.”

"I am descended from people who factor a flat tyre into a drive to the airport. I own a personal, portable water filter, just in case. I am someone who patrols her boundaries. I am a list writer, a timetable checker. The overarching project of my life has been making myself safe. No alarms; no surprises. It has become legend in my family that, at age 11, I ruined a holiday by demanding we move out of our accommodation at the foot of what everyone told me was a dormant volcano, because I thought it was too dangerous. (The volcano did erupt, on my 35th birthday.)  Nothing had changed by age 44, when I published a personal guide to surviving climate change, which was essentially a list of everything I was afraid of and all the ways I planned to stop those things happening to me. By age 49 my plans had come to fruition. I had left inner-city Melbourne and moved to the Huon Valley in the south of Tasmania. I’m not the only one who has thought it worthwhile making huge changes to their life in an effort to stay safe. There are the awful white-supremacist preppers, of course, and the billionaire tech magnates with their horrible luxury New Zealand bunkers. The self-sufficiency guru Michael Mobbs caused a ruckus in 2019 when he announced he was selling up his Sydney home to escape the coming societal collapse; he planned to shift to Bermagui, which he thought would be safer. (On 23 January 2020, residents of Bermagui were told the Badja Road fire was heading in their direction and it was too late to leave; to seek shelter as the fire approaches; to protect themselves from the heat of the fire.) Since Greta Thunberg started making headlines, since the IPCC declared we have only 12 years left to get our act together, since the UN’s biodiversity body warned last year of imminent ecosystem collapse, people of run-of-the-mill, middle-class privilege, friends and relatives of mine, have been quietly approaching me, asking, “Where will I be safe? How can I keep my children safe?” When my co-author and I wrote our handbook, we tried to answer this question. The answer was: nowhere. There is no where that will make you safe, there is only a when: when you become rich enough to build your children a bunker village with its own food and water and oxygen; even less probably when we decide to redistribute society’s benefits so that being rich is not a pre-condition for being safe. Until either of those whens happen, we suggested, you need to change your definition of “safe”. Stop looking for places to hide and barriers to put up. Build stronger relationships with the people around you so you will be there for one another when difficulties arise. Invest less of your time accruing material goods (like personal water filters) that you could lose in a fire or flood, and more of your time organising for social change. Stay light on your feet, valuing people and experiences more than you value property, and look for a life where those things are nurturing and exciting. So much for all that: in my struggle for safety I abandoned the network I had in Melbourne, moved to Tasmania on 16 January 2019, and bought myself some property just east of Huonville. (On 15 January, lightning struck 2,400 times across south-western Tasmania, igniting several fires including the Riveaux Road fire, which threatened the Huon Valley for the next three months.) During the 2019-20 mainland bushfires, when Tasmania was cool and damp, I was safe. During the coronavirus pandemic, isolated in my cottage at the end of a dirt road on a sparsely populated island at the bottom of the world, I was safe. (By late April, an outbreak in the north-west of the state meant Tasmania had the highest number of coronavirus infections per capita of anywhere in Australia.) Sometime in early April a friend in Melbourne sent me an email. “You must be feeling pretty pleased with yourself. The fires, now this?!” I was feeling pretty pleased with myself. I realised that all that work I’d done – the project of a lifetime – had finally paid off. And then I sat on a rock all by myself and had a little cry because it felt terrible. We all know, deep down, that we can never be safe. Don’t we? Searching for safety is a panicked thrashing around that drags you deeper and deeper into the quicksand. For a while in my 20s I went to the doctor once a week – four different doctors: so, as far as they each knew, I went to the doctor once a month – just to check whether I was safe from dying. They would say yes, and I’d have a day of relaxing, and then I’d think, well, yesterday I was safe, but how about now? What I wanted was to stay in the doctor’s office, hooked up to a (so far nonexistent) machine that would feed out constant information about my health, alerting me instantly if I was in any kind of danger, for the rest of my life. You can only ever know if you are safe in retrospect, once the you that was safe is gone forever without ever knowing how safe she was. You can wake up in the morning and know you didn’t die in the night, but you can never go to sleep because who knows what the future holds? Where can I move to that is safe? Let me know if you figure out how to move to the past. Oh, the night. I would also ask my housemate to check on me now and again to see if I had died or was near death while sleeping, because perhaps the only way to relax your vigilance is to hand the burden to somebody else; the trick, then, is not being too vigilant about how well they’re carrying it. (She never checked whether I had died.) When I was much younger, I assumed the government, grown-ups and some other amorphous forces were carrying the burden of keeping me safe from existential threats. Because that’s their job, isn’t it? A child raised in the 70s and 80s – me – could sanely go through their early life assuming that the government was concerned with their health, their financial wellbeing, even the future of the Earth they relied on. (In 1985 the world had stockpiled 61,662 nuclear warheads.) But now? Watching the disintegration of the United States and Brazil, knowing their rampant obsession with individual freedom is no different from here, except a little more heavy-handed with the satire, now I know – and we all do – that each of us must bear our own burden. Nobody else is watching out for us. We cannot afford to relax. This state of constant vigilance where threat is ever-present, just over there, just outside the line of our sight (don’t blink), it doesn’t leave a lot of time for anything else. It eats everything. You drag yourself panting into a glade in the sunlight of safety and instead of feeling joy, calm, peace, you find the forest is full of ticks (every last one of them is carrying Lyme disease). This is me, on a rock, having a cry because sure, I’m safe right now, but what is the point of being safe if everyone else is drowning and burning and starving and all the things you love are desiccating in the ever-hotter, ever-drier atmosphere? In a world like this world, safety means isolation and loneliness. It’s a jerk act to smile when everyone else is weeping in pain. There are no moments of spontaneous wonder in a bunker. Where can you be safe? Where can your children be safe? You can’t, they can’t, stop asking that question. Is there something better to be than safe? Well, I don’t know. But maybe it’s better to be brave. I have never managed to be particularly brave. I’ve always been able to come up with a rationale for slipping back into my comfortable life before things get really bad; my lucky life has always let me. But wouldn’t it be something to behave courageously? To see the threat and step forward to meet it? In 1917, the Australian poet Lesbia Harford wrote: Today is rebel’s day. Let all of us Take courage to fight on until we’re done – Fight though we may not live to see the hour The Revolution’s splendidly begun. “Politics is hard,” write Kai Heron and Jodi Dean in their article, Revolution or Ruin, for the journal e-flux, “because it asks us to take and wield power, to be disciplined, focused, and clear-eyed … it asks us to choose sides, to name our comrades and our enemies.” I think about that when I see you all – on the news, on Twitter – out on the streets angrily demanding justice, polarising opinion, while I’m here at the end of my pleasant country road. There is a kind of climate action that is about whittling away your own impact, reducing your footprint, negating yourself. What am I trying to make myself safe from? Bushfires? Floods? Criticism? Judgment? Small and quiet, squeaky-clean, a tiny target: “Leave me alone,” I beg the world and its terrors, and that is exactly what it does. • This essay will be part of the anthology Fire, Flood and Plague, edited by Sophie Cunningham and published by Penguin Random House in December"

Share this...FacebookTwitterDespite hyped claims, much doubt has emerged over the years on whether or not renewable energies such as wind and sun would able to substitute fossil and nuclear energy.

Europe’s PV energy systems are not working out, new study finds. Photo: Prof. Knut Löschke. Source: www.eike-klima-energie.eu/. 
Getting a sound answer to that question naturally would have been a reasonable step to take long before countries rushed to invest tens of billions of euros in solar in cloudy northern Europe.
A brand new paper by Swiss researchers Ferruccio Ferroni and Robert J. Hopkirk published by the Journal of Energy Policy now further intensifies that doubt, finding that solar power remains an inefficient way to produce energy in most cases. It’s beginning to appear that Europe has wasted tens of billions of euros in a mass energy folly.

Thus it should not surprise anyone that Germany’s fossil fuel consumption has not been falling over the past years.
The paper’s abstract states:
Many people believe renewable energy sources to be capable of substituting fossil or nuclear energy. However there exist very few scientifically sound studies, which apply due diligence to substantiating this impression. In the present paper, the case of photovoltaic power sources in regions of moderate insolation is analysed critically by using the concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (ERoEI, also called EROI). But the methodology for calculating the ERoEI differs greatly from author-to-author. The main differences between solar PV Systems are between the current ERoEI and what is called the extended ERoEI (ERoEI EXT). The current methodology recommended by the International Energy Agency is not strictly applicable for comparing photovoltaic (PV) power generation with other systems. The main reasons are due to the fact that on one hand, solar electricity is very material-intensive, labour-intensive and capital-intensive and on the other hand the solar radiation exhibits a rather low power density.
So is solar energy a worthwhile alternative in places like Europe? The authors conclude that it is not. They write in the conclusion that “an electrical supply system based on today’s PV technologies cannot be termed an energy source, but rather a non-sustainable energy sink” and that “it has become clear that photovoltaic
 energy at least will not help in any way to replace the fossil fuel“.
The authors add that “photovoltaic technology would not be a wise choice for helping to deliver affordable, environmentally favourable and reliable electricity regions of low, or even moderate insolation“.
Sounds like much of Europe has wasted very huge sums of money.

"**Some Tigrayans in Ethiopia have described to the BBC how they have been harassed, detained or discriminated against since fighting began in their home region on 4 November.**
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has emphasised that the conflict in the northern Tigray region is against a ""criminal clique"" within the dominant party there, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), but reports from elsewhere in the country suggest there is an ethnic dimension to the crisis.
Tigrayans make up around 6% of the Ethiopia's more than 110 million people and many live outside their regional state.
The government has denied that there has been ethnic profiling and said any action carried out against individuals was for justified security reasons.
Some in the security forces have told the BBC that they have been disarmed and ordered to stay at home.
One of those was a female officer who had been working as a policewoman for more than 20 years, but was once a member of the TPLF, which was originally a militia force.
She said that two days after the fighting began, she received a call from a superior who asked her to report to the office the next day.
On her arrival she was ""ordered to hand over all government property and my firearm"".
She added that some high-ranking officials, who were also Tigrayan, were given the same strict order.
The government has not commented on the allegation that police officers have been disarmed because of their ethnicity.
But speaking about the issue in general, Mamo Mihretu, a senor adviser to the prime minister, told the BBC that ""taking law-enforcement measures based on ethnicity and identity is something that we take seriously and would condemn - this is not acceptable"".
However ""there is a clear instruction to the security agencies to take their measures based on risk and actionable intelligence"", he said adding that it was aimed at ""hardliners - disgruntled and reactionary elements of the TPLF"".
Since coming to power in 2018, the prime minister has tried to emphasise national unity while also respecting the identities and rights of the different groups which govern the country's 10 ethnically based federal states.
But the fallout from this conflict has exposed the difficulties of maintaining that position.
The BBC has also heard from a federal soldier of 14 years' experience who alleged he and others were singled out because they were Tigrayan in what he described as ""shocking"" treatment.
He said he was detained in a warehouse by his fellow soldiers with nearly 90 other Tigrayan members of the armed forces. They had their phones confiscated and were ""treated as prisoners of war"", he alleged.
""It was only the Tigrayans who were disarmed and detained together. So, it's obviously based on our ethnicity,"" added the soldier, who wanted to remain anonymous.
When those detained challenged the people who were holding them ""they said: 'The TPLF attacked our [base in the north] and this order to detain you came from the top'"", he told the BBC.
Among those held were veterans of the TPLF's struggle against Marxist dictator Mengistu Hailemariam, who was toppled in 1991. The TPLF then became the dominant political force in the whole country but say they were sidelined by Mr Abiy when he came to power in 2018
Others were high-ranking military officials, some of whom had spent time in the African Union force in Somalia, he said.
""I had never imagined those people who had relentlessly served the national army and their country would be treated this way.""
He later managed to escape from the warehouse, disguise himself as a civilian and flee to a neighbouring country, from where he spoke to the BBC.
He said that as he was crossing the border, he was careful to hide his Tigrayan accent so as not to arouse suspicion, adding that he fears for the lives of his comrades who he left behind in the warehouse.
Others sources have told the BBC that many Tigrayans, who are either current or former members of the armed forces, have been detained or have had their homes searched, and some put under house arrest.
When asked for comment, Chief-of-Staff Gen Berhanu Jula told the BBC that this was ""a political matter"" and he was not in a position to respond.
This allegation of ethnic profiling is not limited to members of the military and the police.
A Tigrayan civilian, who asked to remain anonymous fearing for her safety, told the BBC that last week a group of armed people, who appeared to be members of the security forces, came to her home, searched it thoroughly, seized bank statements and took away her father, who makes his living as a driver.
She said he was then held for two days and was accused of having ""travelled to Tigray with six million birr ($160,000; Â£120,000) and returning to Addis Ababa with weapons"".
She disputed this and said that his work driving tourists took him all over the country. The accusation has now been dropped.
The issue has also allegedly affected some state-run organisations such as the national carrier Ethiopian Airlines.
Several Tigrayan employees there have been forced to take leave until further notice or work from home, sources at the airline told the BBC. Ethiopian Airlines did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
**More on the Tigray crisis:**
The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) recently said that a police officer asked staff at its branch office in the Amhara region to give details of their employees including birthplaces.
The WFP said the information was not available and then confirmed with the regional police that the request was not part of official policy.
The federal government described reports that this was related to ethnic profiling as ""a complete misrepresentation of the event"". It said the police officer was acting on specific intelligence that TPLF ""operatives [were] embedded and active within various local and international organisations within the country"".
It added that the police officer had a list of names and went to the WFP office to see if anyone on the list worked there.
It is clear that the security operation does not only concern what is happening in Tigray itself as the federal authorities are worried about TPLF sympathisers elsewhere.
But people who have spoken to the BBC have said that they have been singled out because of their ethnicity rather than anything they may have done.
If the conflict is short-lived then concerns about ethnic tensions may go away but if it proves to be protracted then there are fears that life for Tigrayans outside Tigray may become more difficult.
Despite seeing the TPLF as a blockage in the plan to achieve national unity, the impact of the conflict could prove to be a major challenge to the prime minister's vision of bringing the country together.
""If there is anything that the government is doing, it's to create a society that emphasises the ties that bind all of us,"" his adviser Mr Mamo told the BBC.
But the conflict in Tigray could threaten that goal."
"**The leader of Ethiopia's Tigray region has rejected the prime minister's ultimatum to surrender by Wednesday and has pledged to fight on in the conflict engulfing the north of the country.**
Debretsion Gebremichael denied federal government claims that the regional capital, Mekelle, was surrounded.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed and tens of thousands have fled in nearly three weeks of fighting.
The UN has warned it could trigger a humanitarian crisis.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Sunday announced a 72-hour deadline for the region's fighters to surrender, and the army warned Mekelle's 500,000 residents that soldiers would ""encircle"" the city and attack it.
But Mr Debretsion, who heads the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), said the prime minister ""doesn't understand who we are. We are people of principle and ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"", AFP news agency quotes him as saying.
The TPLF is the dominant political party in Tigray and was once a powerful militia force that led the fight to overthrow a previous Ethiopian government in 1991.
The Tigray leader also said, according to the Reuters news agency, that government claims about Mekelle were a cover for a need to regroup after the army was defeated on three fronts.
It is very hard to verify what is happening in the region as there is a virtual communications blackout.
The Ethiopian government has accused TPLF forces of destroying infrastructure including the airport in the ancient tourist town of Aksum, state-affiliated Fana news site reports.
It shared images of a ploughed runway, accusing the fighters of harming the region's economy.
The TPLF has not commented on the accusations but Mr Debretsion told Reuters news agency on Sunday that his forces had managed to stall advancing federal troops.
""They [are] sending waves after waves but to no avail,"" he said.
The United Arab Emirates, an influential ally of the Ethiopian government, said it was concerned about the conflict and that it was making contacts around Africa and the world to try to end it.
And on Friday, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the African Union chairman, announced the appointment of three former presidents to broker talks to end the conflict.
But Ethiopia has rejected the offer because it sees the operation as an internal ""law enforcement"" mission.
""We don't negotiate with criminals... We bring them to justice, not to the negotiating table,"" Mamo Mihretu, a senior aide to Mr Abiy, told the BBC.
""Our African brothers and sisters would play a more significant role if they put pressure on TPLF to surrender and for that, you know, nobody needs to go to Tigray or Mekelle to make that point clear to them.""
Mr Mamo said that the government was doing its ""utmost"" to allow UN agencies to provide assistance to people in Tigray.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the TPLF, the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, tensions escalated. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing that Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate. It held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal"".
On 4 November the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle.
The TPLF has rejected the claims.
Its fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000.
Aid agencies have no access to the conflict zone, but they fear that thousands of civilians may have been killed since fighting erupted at the beginning of November.
At least 33,000 refugees have already crossed into Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
On Friday, the TPLF was accused of firing rockets into the city of Bahir Dar in the neighbouring Amhara region. The Amhara government said there were no casualties and no damage caused.
But the reported incident in Amhara, which has a long-running border dispute with Tigray, has raised concerns that the conflict could extend into a wider war after regional forces were sent to support federal troops.
Meanwhile, the UN has raised concerns about the influx of refugees into Sudan, which it says could destabilise a nation already supporting about a million people displaced from other African countries.
Many of the refugees arriving in Sudan are believed to be children. Aid agencies say an immediate ceasefire would allow them to help thousands of civilians still trapped inside Ethiopia.
Aid agencies are appealing for $50m (Â£38m) for food and shelter for the new arrivals.

About 30 years ago I was working in Australia on the Kiewa Hydro scheme in the mountains south of the Snowy River. They had a huge potential bushfire problem and devoted a large amount of resources and people to preparing to fight fires. But they told me that the rubbish was building up the forest floor and sooner or later there would be a really serious fire. It happened a few years later and completely burnt out the forest. 



In his book “The Future Eaters”, Tim Flannery pointed out that, for thousands of years, the aborigines used [firestick farming](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/its-ok-to-burn-colonists/) to burn out the understory and encourage new growth. This provided food for the kangaroos on which the aborigines mainly lived. So the whole of the east coast ecology shifted from the pre-aborigine trees to gum trees that could withstand the regular burning. When the white man came, the regular burning largely stopped and more recently the forest managers have been encouraged/instructed to stop regular burning as it was believed to be unsustainable. In fact, **it was sustainable and had been for thousands of years.**



Australia has always had forest fires – for millions of years. Many are started by lightning. What makes these fires so bad is, as the cartoon points out, **the build-up of rubbish** on the forest floor. **A man-made problem.**



In the 1940s I remember smoke from forest fires in Australia. 



The 1943–44 Australian bushfire season was marked by a series of major bushfires following severe drought conditions in the state of Victoria in Australia. The summer of 1943–44 was the driest summer ever recorded in Melbourne until 2002 with just 46 millimetres or 1.81 inches falling, a third of the long-term average.[1]Between 22 December 1943 and 15 February 1944, burnt an estimated one million ha[2], 51 people were killed, 700 injured, and 650 buildings were destroyed across the state.[3] The current bushfires: The 2019–20 Australian bushfire season has burned an estimated 6,300,000 hectares (16,000,000 acres; 63,000 km2; 24,000 sq mi), destroyed over 2,500 buildings (including over 1,300 houses) and killed 24 people as of 4 January 2020, with a further six missing in the state of Victoria. 



And here are the Australian temperatures in 1896:



But now they say: On Wednesday 18 December, Australia experienced its hottest day on record with an average maximum temperature of **41.9C** (107.4F), beating the previous record by 1C that had been set only 24 hours earlier. The records they base this statement on do not go back as far as 1896. [Here is the rainfall picture back to 1900](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/history/rainfall/). The 20s and 30s look pretty bad.

"**The pace of change in Ethiopia has been so fast since Abiy Ahmed became prime minister in April 2018 that it is almost like observing a different country, and this is why he has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.**
The reforms he has introduced were unthinkable not so long ago.
For many years, the government seemed impervious to criticism from human rights groups that the state stifled free expression, sidelined and imprisoned opposition leaders and cracked down on protests.
It also appeared steadfast in its disagreement with a border commission ruling that was meant to end the two-decade conflict with neighbouring Eritrea.
But all that has changed.
In the first few months after he came to power, following the unexpected resignation of his predecessor Hailemariam Desalegn, Mr Abiy lifted the state of emergency, ordered the release of thousands of prisoners, allowed exiled dissidents to return home and unblocked hundreds of websites and TV channels.
He also ended the state of war with Eritrea by agreeing to give up disputed border territory, in the process normalising relations with the long-time foe.
But not everyone is happy with the pace of change.
In June 2018, Mr Abiy was targeted in an attack, with two people killed in an explosion at a rally held to show support for him, and there is some opposition to him in the Tigray province which used to dominate the country.
Later that year, a group of soldiers, some of them armed, marched to his office to demand a pay rise.
Initially, a photo of him doing press-ups with the soldiers led to him being praised for managing to defuse a potentially dangerous situation.
However, he later said that some of them had wanted to kill him \- a reminder of the extent of the opposition his reforms have attracted in some quarters.
And after some of the state's tight controls were lifted, the simmering ethnic tensions in this diverse country boiled over into violence which has forced some 2.5 million people from their homes.
In June 2019, two of Mr Abiy's close allies were killed in what was described as an attempt to seize control of the Amhara region, scene of some of the worst violence.
Mr Abiy's background is crucial to the way people view him.
He is the country's first Oromo leader - the ethnic group at the centre of nearly three years of anti-government protests, which left many dead and thousands arrested following clashes with security forces.
One of the protesters' main complaints was that they had been politically, economically and culturally marginalised for years - despite being the country's largest community.
The coming to power of Mr Abiy, who is believed to have huge support among the Oromo youth as well as other ethnic groups, has begun to change that.
He is leader of the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation (OPDO), one of the four ethnic parties which make up the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition.
**More about Abiy's impact:**
The 42-year-old, who was born in the city of Agaro in Oromia and comes from a mixed Christian-Muslim family, joined the OPDO in the late 1980s.
In the military he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel, before becoming the founder and director of the country's Information Network and Security Agency, which is responsible for cyber-security in a country where the government has always exercised tight control over the internet.
After that he became the minister for science and technology.
He has promised to free up the telecoms sector, which is currently dominated by a state-run monopoly.
However, old habits seem to die hard and in June 2019 the internet was blocked throughout the country for several weeks. The authorities never gave a reason but it coincided with national exams and may have been a draconian attempt to prevent cheating.
**Key facts: Abiy Ahmed**
The speed at which he has been changing Ethiopia has been unprecedented but should not be a surprise.
He laid out his political vision in comments made to the Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement's (SEPDM), a constituent party of the ruling coalition, in October 2017
""We have only one option and that is to be united, not only cooperating and helping each other but uniting in order to live together. The other option is to kill each other,"" Mr Abiy is quoted as saying.
""However, no sane person will opt for this. So, our option should be to trust one another, heal our wounds together and work together to develop our country.""
When Mr Abiy came into power, he was seen by many as outspoken and competent, with a participatory leadership style. It left opposition figures cautiously optimistic about the future, as long as he tackled the issues behind the unrest.
Opposition leader Berhanu Nega, once branded a terrorist in Ethiopia, has returned home, pledging that he will work closely with the government ""to stabilise the country"".
But he was not giving a free pass to the prime minster, saying that ""many institutions and many laws"" need to be reformed to create a meaningful democracy.
Ethiopia has had general elections every five years since 1995, but in the last vote in 2015 not a single opposition MP was elected.
Journalist and activist Jawar Mohammed was at one time accused of stoking anti-government protests. He has ended his exile and described Mr Abiy's appointment as ""a unique opportunity [for a] peaceful transition to democracy"".
Yeshiwas Assefa, who leads the opposition Blue Party, told the BBC: ""The main point is he has to be someone who understands the demands of the public and the public's desire for change... He has to reform institutions in dire need of reform.""
The next elections are due in 2020, and will be keenly watched to see if the reforms do mean that opposition parties are free to campaign against Mr Abiy and the governing EPRDF, in a way that was previously impossible."
"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   Sardar Hussain refused to believe it. He had been orphaned in Afghanistan by a Taliban bomb at age 13. After waiting in limbo for two years, he said he was only days away from getting on a plane to the United States when he heard that President Trump would be barring entry to refugees. Mustafa did believe it. He teared up, saying his life was over at age 28. An Iraqi refugee in Lebanon, he thought he was so close to getting to the United States that he had gone out and bought a new shirt for his trip. When she read on Facebook about the temporary ban, Alwia Abdullah, 43, who fled from Darfur in Sudan to Jordan with her husband and six children, got a sudden, stabbing pain in her gut, and couldn’t sleep. “We left because we were discriminated against in Darfur,” she said. “So to be discriminated against by a U. S. president, by a nation we see our future in, is so disheartening. How do you live with that?” They were among an estimated 110, 000 people in line to be processed for resettlement in the United States during this fiscal year. In fact, they thought they had already made it through the rigorous vetting procedure and, after years of waiting, were on the verge of having their hopes realized. Now, all are suddenly, indefinitely waiting again, barred from entry to the United States for at least four months, according to an executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Friday, with no assurances of what could happen to them next. The order, Mr. Trump said, is a way to “keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. ” “We don’t want them here,” he said at the Pentagon. “We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. ” The executive order calls for the United States’ annual refugee quota to be cut to a maximum of 50, 000, compared with 85, 000 allowed in during the fiscal year ending in September 2016. Even last year’s figure was dwarfed by the historically high number of displaced people in the world, 65 million, or by the more than 1. 5 million migrants and refugees arriving in European countries since 2014. Mr. Trump’s order also suspends the entry of all Syrian refugees indefinitely, calling their arrival “detrimental to the interests of the United States. ” Beyond that, it suspends visas to people from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for 90 days. Asked about Mr. Trump’s refugee ban, Stéphane Dujarric, the United Nations spokesman, said he hoped “it’s a temporary one. ” He noted that more people were displaced around the world than ever before. “The U. S. resettlement program is one of the most important resettlement programs the U. N. works with,” he said. Mr. Trump’s action was the latest closed door in a world that has become increasingly unwelcome to refugees, amid rising concerns and hostility in many resettlement countries in Europe, and in countries of first refuge like Turkey and Lebanon. For those refugees, in particular, who thought that their asylum process was over and that they would be accepted in the United States, the dismay was overwhelming this past week. Faten Diab, 34, a former charity worker from Syria, said she had been told that she and her family would be among a relatively small number of Syrians allowed into the United States. Last year, only 10, 000 had been granted that privilege, compared with 40, 000 in Canada. Ms. Diab and her husband said she fled to Turkey and applied for asylum in the United States in summer 2015, along with close friends who applied at the same time. They said the friends had received a final decision just over a week ago and had flown to America. The Diabs had reason to hope that their own number would come up any day. Now, that may never happen. Reached by telephone in their tiny apartment in Turkey, Ms. Diab sounded distraught, as the couple’s    daughter could be heard playing in the background. “We are so, so, so sad,” Ms. Diab said, complaining that Mr. Trump’s claim that terrorists were slipping in as refugees was overblown. “The process of resettlement is long and difficult. You can say he is wrong. Because he didn’t live the application steps in all its difficulties. ” Strictly speaking, America does not actually owe anything to the Diabs from Syria or the Abdullahs from Darfur they are just reacting to its historical promise to take the world’s “huddled masses yearning to breathe free. ” But in other countries, like Iraq, citizens who worked for the American military, government and companies were promised preferential treatment for resettlement. Many thought that the risks they took on behalf of the United States would be repaid one day with a safe haven when they needed it. Now Iraqis are also on Mr. Trump’s proscribed list. Laith   37, was one of many who could not believe it. A former interpreter for the United States military, he was wounded twice in battle, in the leg and stomach, and now lives in fear of retaliation from   militants in his Baghdad community. He was not ashamed to beg. “Please Mr. President, you are the president of one of the biggest states in the world,” he said. “Don’t be hasty in taking this decision. Be fair with us. ” Mustafa, the    Iraqi, is a Shiite Muslim who worked on construction crews on American bases, mostly on fortifications. As he put it: “I made homes for them that kept them safe. I felt I was doing something good for humanity. ” But   militias in his neighborhood discovered what his job had been and accused him of treason. “I was beaten and shot and knifed and eventually came to Lebanon two years ago,” he said, during an interview arranged in Beirut by the International Refugee Assistance Project, a New   legal aid group. After years of interviews and investigation, Mustafa said he was finally told to take his medical examination and now only needed to be given the date for his flight, to California. To get ready, Mustafa splurged at a   Beirut store to buy the clothes he would wear into his new life: dark green pants, a vest, a checked shirt in four colors. “I would wear the best clothes I have, and I wouldn’t take anything else with me, not even my memories,” he said. Mustafa still has some hope that somehow exceptions will be made, which is why  —   like most of the refugees interviewed for this article  —   he did not want his full name published. “If I do get rejected,” he said, “I’d regret ever having shaken hands with an American. ” He struggled not to weep. Sardar Hussain, 16, an ethnic Hazara boy from central Afghanistan, was rocked by disbelief. He said that when he was 13, his father, mother and younger sister were killed when a bomb blew up a taxi that was taking his mother to a hospital. After paying a smuggling network $7, 000 to get him to Australia, he was marooned en route, on the Indonesian island of Java, when Australia cracked down on boats bringing refugees there. For seven weeks, he slept on the sidewalk behind the United Nations offices in Jakarta, Indonesia. Now, after more than two years, he said, his flight to America was scheduled for Monday. “We were given a commitment to go there,” he said, speaking softly in English at a coffee house in Jakarta, just after completing his final medical exam. Firas   23, a Syrian refugee in Turkey, went out with friends on Wednesday night to drink away his disappointment. He was a university student and opposition activist in Syria before fleeing his hometown, Raqqa, now the Islamic State’s de facto capital. He was still looking for answers. “Is Trump trying to fight the terrorists by giving up on the victims of the very same terrorists?” he asked. “ISIS wants to destroy our lives, and now Trump declined to give us one. ” Sara, 31, a former television presenter who fled to Indonesia from Afghanistan after death threats  —   the Taliban and other cultural conservatives despise seeing Afghan women in public at all, let alone on television  —   was trying to arrive at answers of her own. “You just wait,” she said. “You see how the years pass. You get older, you cannot make any plans. You watch your dreams die with every second you spend waiting. ” After three years and four months, she thought that the waiting was finally over, and that she would soon have a date when she was allowed to fly. Now her life has been suspended for at least four more months, with no guarantee that she will still be included in the Trump administration’s   refugee quota once the visa moratorium is lifted. “The bitter truth,” she said, “is that your whole life is dependent on a single decision of someone who doesn’t have even the slightest idea what it’s like to live as a refugee. ”"
"Wind turbines take energy from the atmosphere and turn it into electricity: so we know they must have some impact on the atmosphere’s flow. With industrial grade turbines being built at a terrific rate, scientists have been trying to assess exactly what the effects are both at local and at global levels.  New research using a finely resolved model which focuses on Europe indicates that the effects of doubling the present wind capacity by 2020 are at the level of a couple of percent changes in rain and a few tenths of a degree of temperature. The study by Vautard and colleagues shows that these effects include a mix of more rain and less rain, and warming and cooling, depending on where you are around Europe. But a key policy question left unresolved by this paper is: to what should these changes be compared?   There are two main ways of estimating the climate impact of wind turbines. One is to compare the real climate of a region before and after wind farms are installed there. This approach is limited by the availability of observations – modern wind farms are a relatively new phenomenon so there is not much data to compare the climate after wind farms are installed with the years before. Ruling out other reasons for the climate changes we observe is also a challenge.    Using this observational approach, researchers have found that the climate around a large wind farm in Texas was affected by the presence of the turbines. Taking the ground temperatures measured by satellites, they detected a warming of 0.5°C at night in the region directly under the farm. This warming effect was local and small – the nighttime warming did not extend beyond the farm’s immediate neighbourhood.   But not many people live right among the wind turbines.  To look at smaller effects far from the wind farms, another approach is to simulate the earth’s climate with computer models. Using climate history data, projections are made that account for motion, thermodynamics, chemistry and radiation in the atmosphere, land and sea. Years of simulations are run with and without wind farms installed.  This method has the advantage of being able to detect very small climate change signals, since the model can be run for a long time, and natural variability gets smaller as you average over more and more years. Also, all factors besides wind that might cause climate changes can be held constant. The disadvantage is that the model of climate behaviour may not correspond exactly to what happens in reality. This approach was first attempted by David Keith and colleagues in 2004. When they compared the climate in their model with and without extremely large wind farms (large enough to generate about twice the world’s total present electrical demand), they found that in addition to climate effects in the immediate vicinity of the wind farms, there were changes in climate all around the world.   There were regions of warming and cooling of about 0.5°C, and increases and decreases in precipitation by a few percent. A followup paper showed that these changes were mostly a result of changes in wind direction caused by the wind turbines.  The model winds tended to shy away from the wind farms a little, so that downstream from the farms there would be regions of extra wind from the south, that would tend to be warmer, and regions of extra wind from the north, that would tend to be colder. Vautard’s study agrees with this earlier work, in finding that the climate impacts of wind farms extend beyond the farms themselves and are caused by changes in the flow of the atmosphere that bring warming and cooling to different regions around the wind farms.    So how should we understand these results?  Keith and colleagues compared the climate changes caused by wind turbines with the climate changes that would have been caused by fossil fuel burned to make the same amount of electricity.  But because carbon dioxide lasts for centuries or millennia in the atmosphere (unless we suck it out somehow), it’s hard to know over how many years to calculate the avoided carbon dioxide emissions. For the 20-year life of the turbines? Or for the few hundred years of supply of fossil fuels that could be burnt?     Now that the impacts of wind turbines on climate are becoming better understood, more comprehensive studies of complete future energy systems are needed. We need to ask, what combination of wind power, solar power, nuclear power and fossil fuel power, together with what combination of measures to remove carbon from the atmosphere, will result in the lowest overall environmental and social costs.

"**With my 11-year-old brother suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication following the outbreak of a new conflict in Ethiopia's already war-scarred Tigray region.**
He lives in the regional capital, Mekelle, with my parents and siblings and - just days before the conflict started - I had what has turned out to be my last video chat with them about his treatment.
As his medication is expensive and pharmacies in Mekelle often run out of stock, I agreed to send money to my family to pay for the drugs, while they were going to get the medication from the federal capital, Addis Ababa.
I did a bank transfer from Kenya's capital Nairobi - where I live - to Mekelle, but with the state-owned National Bank of Ethiopia now shutting all of its more than 600 branches in Tigray because of the conflict, my family cannot withdraw the money.
And even if they get the cash, they cannot get the medicines, as all passenger flights into Tigray have been halted, meaning that no-one can bring it from Addis Ababa. Road travel between the two cites, about 700km (435 miles) away from each other, has also stopped, leaving many Tigrayans stranded in the federal capital.
The airspace is now restricted to military aircraft.
Ethiopia's Prime Minster and Nobel Peace laureate Abiy Ahmed has warned people in Tigray to avoid holding gatherings as he has ordered air strikes to destroy the military arsenal of the regional government. He wants to dislodge it from power after accusing it of being illegally in office and of violently taking control of a federal military base near Mekelle, charges the Tigray government denies.
The regional government has also heavily restricted road travel within Tigray, as fighting takes place, according to the UN, in eight locations, including in the sesame-growing area of Humera, where farmers are usually harvesting crops at this time of the year, helped by workers from the neighbouring region of Amhara, in a sign of how the fate of Ethiopians of all ethnic groups is intertwined.
Now, fear and suspicion are growing, with some Tigrayans in the federal police and military telling me that they have been ordered by their superiors to hand in their weapons, and to stop reporting for work.
When news of the conflict broke in the early hours of 4 November - the day the world's attention was focused on the fiercely contested US election - I received a message from a colleague, saying: ""Have you heard what's happened? Have you checked on your family?""
I immediately dialled the numbers of my parents and siblings, but could not get through to any of them as the phone lines were down and the internet was shut, cutting me - and hundreds of thousands of others - off from our families in Tigray.
I miss my little brother the most. As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video link-ups of my family.
Now, I cling to the photos I have of him - and hope that the conflict ends soon so that he can get his medication. I had also been thinking of getting him over to Nairobi for further medical check-ups. I was also thinking of buying him a wheelchair as he has difficulty walking.
All this will have to wait until the conflict ends, but what if it drags on? This is a real possibility as the prime minister has rejected mediation while the regional government - led by a former guerrilla movement, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - is unlikely to give up power without a fight to the finish.
What will then happen to my family and other families? Will there be a scarcity of food? Will prices rise? How will families cope with a shortage of cash, especially if they rely on remittances sent by relatives living abroad?
There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel in Tigray - and, worst of all, water which was already rationed.
In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped.
Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected, they can no longer call to put in orders.
On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity.
But my biggest worry is this: What if tanks roll into my home town or if it is hit in an air strike?
I have vivid childhood memories of the 1998-2000 border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea - of being shielded by my mother in our home as we heard the terrifying roar of fighter jets and of being told never to wear white clothes to avoid being spotted.
This aversion lasted until my teens, when I finally said to myself: ""It really is OK to wear white.""
Some of my friends - whose minds are also racing back to that era, a time which we thought we had left behind - are having worse flashbacks - of building bunkers in their school as four-year-olds; of an Eritrean air strike killing children at another school; of friends and neighbours never returning from the frontline.
One friend's memory goes back even further - to the stories he had heard about how his mother fled to the outskirts of Mekelle in 1989 to escape air bombardments ordered by Ethiopia's then-ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam's Derg regime, and to how his grandfather survived the 1943 bombing of the city by the British Royal Air Force at the request of Emperor Haile Selassie.
So, the people of Mekelle - like those in other parts of Tigray and Ethiopia - have lived through war after war.
They are worried about another one, especially when the festive season is approaching.
I had planned to go back to celebrate Christmas in January - as Ethiopian Orthodox Christians do - and to get married to my boyfriend, who continued to live in Mekelle after I moved to Nairobi a few years ago to work for the BBC.
But my plans are frozen, as I find myself cut off from him and my family. It reminds me of my father, a humble carpenter, who lost all contact with his sister in Eritrea because of the war that the two countries fought.
For two decades, he spoke of how much he missed her. When border crossings reopened - albeit temporarily - following the peace deal Mr Abiy negotiated with Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki in 2018, he was looking forward to seeing her, only to learn that she had died.
For his peace efforts with Eritrea, Mr Abiy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 and, in his acceptance speech in Oslo, said:
""It takes a few to make war. But it takes a village and a nation to build peace. For me nurturing peace is like planting and growing trees. Just like trees need water and good soil to grow, peace requires unwavering commitment, infinite patience and goodwill to cultivate and harvest its dividends.""
Like many others, I am hoping that Mr Abiy and Tigray's leader Debretsion Gebremichae now make peace.
Otherwise, the seeds of hatred could grow, in a nation already hit by ethnic clashes that have left about two million people - including more than 100,000 Tigrayans - homeless in different parts of Ethiopia since 2018."

Have you ever wondered if celebrities have a conscience? Whether they consider their impact of their words and deeds in much the way as the common man? Let’s investigate that matter in the context of the raging debate over climate change.
Did you tune into the Live Earth concerts promoted by Al Gore on the catchy date of 7/7/07? No? Well, you certainly heard of them, thanks to the free time given by the media. Concerts on seven continents, headlined by Madonna, Genesis and the Black Eyed Peas. Concerts designed to arouse awareness of the apparent threats of climate change and global warming.

Concerts watched by fewer people, even in the United States, than the Princess Diana Tribute Concert a week or so earlier. Concerts attended by disappointing crowds but lauded by Al Gore, his promoters and the usual suspects in the Hollywood and music industry.
Indeed, not everyone saw value in another headline-grabbing event of this type – Bob Geldof, who organised concerts against poverty and starvation in Africa in earlier times sniffed, ‘We are all f***ing conscious of global warming. It’s just an enormous pop concert or the umpteenth time that, say, Madonna or Coldplay get on stage’. Right on, Sir Bob. In fact, even the youth who were targeted Gore’s media machine were unconvinced of the motives, with many downright cynical.
The issue promoted may or may not be bigger than world poverty, starvation in Africa, or many other issues facing our planet – although I doubt if a starving family in Darfur gives a single thought for Tim Flannery’s worries about the sea rising to swamp multi-million dollar mansions on the coastlines of Florida or Queensland. But, when the hypocrisy of opposing greenhouse gas emissions by consuming large amounts of electricity on stage, and flying to and from events in private jets, is the subject of greater debate than the so-called problem, then the promoters have an issue.
Let’s take Madonna, a serial and successful publicity grabber if ever there was one. Her charity, The Ray of Light Foundation, happened to own millions of dollars of stock in aluminium giant Alcoa, one of the single largest corporate users of electricity in the world; the Ford Motor Company; and Weyerhaeuser, a forestry giant. All these companies are on the radical environmental hit list. When this information came to light, Live Earth founder Kevin Wall’s defence was this: ‘I didn’t see the Fox News Report but Madonna is here today, which shows her commitment.’ So just turning up absolves one’s eco-sins, does it? ‘Today, we’re not focussing on what she or other artists may have done in the past; it is about the future. Whatever is being said, I know that her commitment to this cause runs deep. She is performing for free and has written a new song for us, which I think goes to show that.’
Apparently celebrities can write off their greenhouse gas emissions by giving their services for free, and of course, by writing a nice new, catchy tune.
You and I of course don’t, or soon won’t have it that easy. A breed of radical environmentalists, fronted by Gore, Flannery and others, is beginning to demand we give up many of life’s luxuries and even economic necessities, while they individually continue to consume enough energy to power small villages. Al Gore’s house has been revealed to use 20 times the energy of the average home; who knows what Madonna’s houses chew through in electricity; or the cars and jets she and her entourage use go through in gas and aviation fuel?
Another celebrity eco-warrior is Sting, who reunited with his band Police for the 7/7/07 gig. The same Sting who advertises, according to the leftist British newspaper, The Guardian, ‘the biggest gas-guzzling Jaguar of them all’.
Let’s take a little tour of the wacky world of global warming and climate change publicity… and see what we can discover – a little of the truth for ourselves, perhaps?
Remember, these are demands put forth by celebrities – many of them wealthy beyond the wildest dreams of workers in the suburbs of Los Angeles or Melbourne, let alone those struggling to make better lives in Brazil, Burma, South Africa, Cuba or the Ivory Coast. Remember, any amount of taxes or restrictions implemented at their behest cannot truly affect their own lifestyles, while they most certainly will damage yours or mine.
Here are some interesting proposals put forward by celebrities who feel sure climate change is largely driven by human intervention – factories, cars, aircraft, energy consumption and the like.

‘I propose a limitation on the number of squares of toilet paper to be used in a sitting…’ – singer and celebrity environmentalist Sheryl Crow
A ban on cremations, replaced with upright burials in cardboard tubes!
A congestion tax on trucks in New York City (with no viable alternative to move goods such as food in or out) – Mayor Michael Bloomberg
The leading celebrity environmentalist who suggested those who oppose the man-made climate change theory might one-day face ‘a prosecutor in some yet-to-be-formed international court’. You know, a court like Nuremberg (he didn’t need to say). And, by the way, this is no fringe nutcase – it is a direct quote from Tim Flannery, author of a leading text on man-made climate change, The Weather Makers

Okay, let’s agree most of those ideas are just plain silly. The power needed to pump water to your home so you can wash your hands thoroughly after using one or two squares of toilet paper proves that.
With little solid evidence, other than a series of climate models, which vary widely and are subject to massive manipulation to prove a particular point, the world is being railroaded into making a series of changes that may have huge consequences for our economy, and our lifestyles.
Claims are thrown about like confetti – a leading aid agency recently said, with an apparent straight face, ‘between now and 2050 climate change will push the number of displaced people globally to at least 1 billion.’ Note the will, not may; climate change will create 1 billion refugees! Apparently we are expected to simply accept the claim at face value and then… well, what? Turn off our air-conditioning?
How about the demand from a British charity that the US must pay $22 billion a year to help deal with the ‘ravages’ of global warming. How much do you think they propose should be China’s share? Remember, China is now the biggest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. Do we hear zero? Correct!
Why would China not be asked to pay? The answer seems quite simple – they are not a democracy, environmental campaigners have no real levers over their government, media or the thinking of their masses. But those same campaigners do have influence over those in America and Europe, so it’s they who must be badgered into what could well turn out to be very bad policy indeed.
The same Tim Flannery mentioned earlier, and who was mystifyingly made Australian of the Year in 2007, has made this claim: ‘I think there is a fair chance that Perth will be the 21st century’s ghost metropolis’ (Perth in Western Australia is a city of over 1.5 million people and is in the middle of an economic boom). Flannery also said that ‘some time in the next 30 years, we face… rapidly rising sea levels, maybe up to 6 metres and hundreds of millions of refugees, because there are whole cities going under.’ Now, 6 metres is 236 inches, nearly 20 feet of increased worldwide sea levels. It sounds and is scary. One suspects it was meant to sound scary. But, wait, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the touchstone of faith for the world’s leading climate change promoters, projects only 59cm (23 inches, not even two feet) of increased sea levels. What gives here? Deliberate sensationalism by Mr Flannery, or just poor science on his part? Either answer is damning.
Why does the hard-core environmentalist movement seek out hypocrites and the ill-informed to front their views (seriously as they take them)? And why do celebrities seek out opportunities to flash their ‘green’ views at every opportunity. Clearly there is a Faustian bargain here.
But a bargain with the Devil has payback. In this case the environmental movement and the celebrity musos, actors and soft scientists are already beginning to find that payback has come early.
When the green movement allows those compromised by their behaviour (Gore, Madonna, Sting et al) to display their hypocrisy the message itself is damaged, possibly irreparably. When the celebrities make claims that are wrong, irresponsible or just plain hypocritical and are exposed their credibility suffers, possibly irreparably. In fact whether they care, or even know, is a moot point and it is hard to imagine them lying awake at night worrying about that, or much else other than the source of their next dose of that most addictive of drugs – fame.
And for those who wonder if climate change is natural, who wonder if nothing man does to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will alter that, and who wonder if the real reason behind proposed carbon taxes and the like is being left unsaid, the exposure of a few compromised celebrities may be comforting. But it is cold comfort.
Do these celebrities actually have a conscience? Or did they trade that to the Devil as well?

President Obama’s speech to the nation last week about the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico followed a predictable script. Whenever a problem confronts this administration, the president’s answer is sure to include one of a trio of his 2008 campaign initiatives: health care reform, action to address climate change or education reform.



Obama claimed in 2008, for instance, that these long‐​term, slowly acting changes were a fix for a temporary downturn in the economy. Now, in an even greater leap of logic, he contends that the 1,427-page Waxman‐​Markey bill (which addresses climate change) is the proper response to the oil spill.



Obama’s advocacy of this bill exemplifies the incoherence and dishonesty of our present debate about energy policy. Two distinct problems — those associated with oil imports and those associated with greenhouse gas emissions — are treated as if they were one and the same.



At a minimum, those alleged problems have wildly different causes necessitating equally different responses. If we fear oil imports, we should tax foreign oil or administratively restrict imports. If we fear greenhouse gas emissions, we should tax those emissions or administratively restrict their release.



Those direct responses will by definition increase the price of gasoline in the first case and all forms of fossil fuels to varying degrees in the second. The more “progress” we wish to achieve in the course of our pursuit of “energy independence” or a carbon‐​free energy economy, the larger the price increases will have to be.



The president eschews direct confrontation with these alleged menaces because the public has little stomach for major, sustained increases in energy prices, particularly when the economy is ailing and gasoline prices are at historically rather high levels.



So he followed the established but failed practice of proposing complex, indirect remedies that aim to hide costs from consumers (and thus, voters). At best, this political sleight‐​of‐​hand makes import reductions and emission controls far more costly to achieve than would otherwise be the case. Economic harm is the more likely outcome.



Regardless, the animus toward foreign oil is unjustified. Historically, domestic energy producers have claimed that foreign suppliers are unreliable in order to restrict competition. Unfortunately, those arguments are readily embraced by the economically gullible.



Given the large number of suppliers and low transportation costs, a loss of supply from any one source can be relatively easily answered by buying from another. Fears of coordinated producer blackmail run aground on the fact that suppliers need us far more than we need them. That’s because the typical oil‐​exporting country is undiversified and a loss of oil revenue would destroy its economy. An oil supply disruption, however, would do far less damage to industrialized importers.



Similarly, if greenhouse gas emissions are a problem (and it is not altogether clear that they are), direct control of greenhouse‐​gas emissions is preferable to a complex set of rules. Economists dealing with these issues recognize that, in principle, either a carbon tax or a pure allocation of emission rights (popularly termed cap‐​and‐​trade) would work best.



Many prefer a simple tax because experience with quota systems proves that difficult problems arise regarding how to allocate the initial rights to emit. Regardless, even fervent supporters of action have long recognized that U.S. emission reductions were futile unless China and India also acted. Otherwise, warming will scarcely be affected.



Unfortunately, there is little reason to believe that U.S. action will prompt similar action in those states.



Waxman‐​Markey, despite its own and the president’s suggestions to the contrary, is predominantly a greenhouse‐​gas control measure. It works on imports very indirectly (and very minimally) by attempting a long‐​term re‐​engineering of the car.



More importantly, the bill imposes a convoluted cap‐​and‐​trade program with every conceivable problem that might be imagined with such programs.



Exceptions are provided for politically well‐​connected industries. Permits are first given away and then subsequently auctioned with the funds to be used to underwrite various inefficient corporate subsidies, a regime so complicated and convoluted that the relevant provisions constitute over half of the sprawling bill. They are preceded by many pages dictating how electricity is to be generated and what fuels shall be used.



In sum, even accepting that there is a problem to solve, the bill’s dictates violate virtually everything that economists know about designing an efficient environmental policy.



Would the Gulf spill have been any less damaging or any less likely to occur had Waxman‐​Markey been passed, say, 10 or 20 years ago? Of course not. No matter what one thinks about the merits of the bill, it would not have reduced the profits associated with oil production enough to have deterred investment in the deep waters of the Gulf.



Nor would it have changed any of the decisions made by BP officials on the Deepwater Horizon platform or any of the BP management practices that allegedly made an accident more likely.



In short, the president’s speech to the nation was a classic political bait‐​and‐​switch maneuver that, unfortunately, errs not only by embracing make‐​believe solutions but bad make‐​believe solutions at that.

"MAFRAQ, Jordan  —   Nisreen   thought the worst was behind her family when it fled to Jordan from   Homs in Syria. Then, two years later, though safe from the shelling and the Syrian civil war, her son Hisham, who was 5, began to rapidly lose weight. When Ms. Najjar and her husband, Haitham   took him to a clinic, a doctor prescribed cold medicine and dismissed him. But a few days later, Hisham got worse and complained of chest pain and aches in his sides. When his parents rushed him to the emergency room, doctors determined that his blood sugar was dangerously elevated. Doctors said Hisham had Type 1 diabetes that had gone untreated for years. He was quickly placed in intensive care, and doctors told his mother that the situation was dire. The next 24 hours will determine whether Hisham lives or dies, she recalled them saying. As she reflected on the harrowing episode in an interview this month, Ms. Najjar began to cry, trying to hide her tears from Hisham. He sat behind her with his two siblings, Yousef, 6, and Mais, 3, who was born in Jordan, in their small, cold apartment here, 40 miles north of Amman, the capital. “I’m sorry,” said Ms. Najjar, 26, wiping her eyes. Hisham, who is shy and has large dark brown eyes, left the room to play with balloons. “It’s just that I almost lost him, not to violence or to war, but to diabetes. ” A few birds singing in their cages brighten the grim space where Hisham’s family lives. But they also remind the family of what it left behind and how the lives of the couple and their children have been upended. About a year after the civil war started in Syria in 2011, the family packed up a few of its belongings, leaving behind almost everything, and left its apartment in Homs for the nearby home of Mr. Abrash’s parents. Ms. Najjar and Mr. Abrash thought they would be gone for 10 days, waiting for the fighting to dissipate. Most of the family’s neighbors in western Syria were also leaving. The temporary departure soon became permanent. After tank fire and shelling erupted one day near the home where the family had sought refuge, it drove to Damascus to get passports, then south to enter Jordan legally at the Jaber border crossing. Back in Homs, the   city in Syria, hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed. Many structures remain skeletons of their former selves, the walls and windows blasted out. The city was once a foothold for rebels fighting the regime of Syria’s president, Bashar   but many fighters started to leave at the end of 2015 under a   deal with the government. The city is now back under the president’s control. Ms. Najjar knows that if Hisham had fallen sick while in Syria, he probably would have died. Power disruptions, common in Syria, essentially shut down hospitals, cutting off electricity to refrigerators storing insulin. And he and his family would have risked their lives just trying to travel to the hospital. They have no plans to return. “Of course I was sad when I realized I wasn’t going to return home after a few months,” Ms. Najjar said. “There is nothing really to return to anymore. ” More than 650, 000 Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan, many of them settling in urban areas. They mostly live in cramped apartments where the rent consumes any humanitarian aid they may receive. The rest of the refugees, about 8 percent, according to some estimates, live in three refugee camps that offer basic services and are free, but also limit freedom of movement. Many of the Syrians arrived in Jordan six years ago, near the start of the civil war. The flood of refugees has put a strain on the country’s limited resources, and public clinics in Jordan no longer provide free health care to Syrians. The protracted crisis is increasing pressure on aid organizations to take on additional roles and provide refugees with more than emergency care, such as treatment for cardiovascular diseases, respiratory ailments and diabetes. Nearly a year ago, Amnesty International  warned that Syrian refugees in Jordan were unable to get access to health care and other vital services, citing “the combination of grossly inadequate support from the international community and barriers imposed by the government of Jordan. ” The report also found that even if Syrian refugees could get access to health care, many could not afford it without forgoing basic needs. The United Nations refugee agency provides Hisham’s family with $137 a month in cash assistance the money goes directly toward the $193 rent and the electricity bill, which is $28. In addition, the family receives $70 in food coupons. The International Rescue Committee, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, provides Hisham with free regular checkups and insulin, worth nearly $30 a month. The organization also paid for a glucose meter, but lacks the funding to pay for glucose test strips. The family must pay for them  —   $27 a month. Ms. Najjar takes her son to a diabetes clinic every three months in the northern town of Irbid, about 30 miles from here. Each checkup, including the cost of travel, is $35. Across northern Jordan, the International Rescue Committee provides nearly 9, 000 refugees and vulnerable locals with free primary health care. The group uses mobile health clinics, each with two doctors, two nurses, a midwife, a counselor and a mobile pharmacy. Patients with diabetes require more frequent care, and wait times for consultations at the group’s clinics are increasing. When the family first arrived, some Jordanians and informal charities helped it cover the rent. But with no immediate prospects of returning to Syria and Jordanian poverty levels rising, it is becoming harder for this family of five to pay the bills. When Mr. Abrash, 37, first arrived in Jordan in 2012, he spent five months searching for work. The unemployment rate among Jordanians exceeds 14 percent, and is almost double that among youth. Syrians, until recently, were not allowed to work. In Syria, Mr. Abrash was a tailor, mainly sewing women’s jeans. Five months after he arrived in Jordan, he began working as a tailor, sewing pillows and mattresses for customers who were referred to him. More recently, he also began selling birds. A bulging disk in his neck is preventing him from working full time at garment factories. After Hisham was found to have Type 1 diabetes, his mother attended awareness sessions about the disease and started to change the way the family eats. Today, it mainly eats vegetables and rice. In the morning before school, Hisham eats wheat bread with eggplant and has a cup of tea. He walks to school with his friends. His mother makes sure he takes an insulin shot before he leaves in the morning, after lunch and before he sleeps at night. “The insulin shots let me lead a normal life, like my friends,” Hisham, 7, said as he watched cartoons. “Sometimes I cheat and I eat something I’m not supposed to at school, but my mom makes sure I eat well at home. ” His mother also checks his blood glucose levels regularly. Hisham does not remember his home in Syria. All his memories are in Jordan. “Nothing,” he said. “I don’t remember anything. ” His home here has two small plastic toy cars and a few plush animals donated by a charity nearby. “When I’m not at school, I mostly jump on the sofas, play soccer with the inflatable balls we have,” he said, as his younger sister followed him around from one room to another."

Our comment primarily concerns the Department of Energy’s (DOE) use of the social cost of carbon (SCC) in the cost/​benefit analysis of the Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Pumps proposed rulemaking. The DOE’s determination of the SCC is discordant with the best scientific literature on the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the fertilization effect of carbon dioxide—two critically important parameters for establishing the net externality of carbon dioxide emissions. It is also at odds with existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines for preparing regulatory analyses. It is based upon the output of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which have little utility because of their great uncertainties. They provide no reliable guidance as to the sign, much less the magnitude of the social cost of carbon. Additionally, as run by the Interagency Working Group (IWG) (whose results were incorporated by the DOE in this action), the IAMs produce illogical results that indicate a misleading disconnection between climate changes and the SCC value. Further, we show that the sea level rise projections (and thus SCC) of at least one of the IAMs (DICE 2010) is not supported by the mainstream climate science.



Until this entire situation can be properly rectified, the SCC should be barred from use in this and all other federal rulemaking. It is better not to include any value for the SCC in cost/​benefit analyses such as these, than to include a value which is knowingly improper, inaccurate and misleading.

 _Behold; the [ **redacted** ] speaks._



 _‘But, what podium would give [ **redacted** ] a voice?’  
Do you have to ask? Really?_



Yesterday’s contribution to the ‘climate debate’ the people at _Stuff_ are not having was delivered by avowed ecommunist **Lynley Tulloch** , a philosophical gnat from the world-famous intellectual-vacuum known as Waikato Uni, or ‘Le Tron’. Yep; she’s a Tronskyite, typically handicapped by the lack of critical thinking celebrated at said school.



She advocates the overthrow of capitalism; the imperfect but mutually agreeable system encouraging the pursuit of individual agency as the path to self-betterment, a system which has delivered immeasurable benefit to humankind. In Tulloch’s imaginings she dreams the downfall of the most successful economic order ever devised will cure us of all the imagined evils caused by exposure to Li’l Miss Climate’s changing of her underpants; that regular phenomenon performed al least every several hundred years.



Basking in the very dim spotlight of Stuff’s pulpit, Tulloch praises the [Climate-change programme ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/state-organised-bullying-of-kids/)to be introduced in schools, but then declares such trifle as mere window-dressing:



in short, we can’t tinker around the edges of capitalism and try to green it. We need a complete economic and social revolution – one that challenges the core assumptions of industrial capitalist development. We need economic de-growth.



De-growth? That would be collapse – **economic collapse.**



If 1080-hating, possum-loving, vegan Tinkerbell Tulloch wishes economic collapse upon herself she’s welcome to it, but the [ **redacted** ], [ **redacted** ] has her wretched toe in the water our children will be drinking, poisoning it. She’s a teacher of teachers, and her mindless meanderings of yesterday are not some sort of devil’s advocacy, she’s [ **redacted** ] enough to believe her own verbal diarrhoea.



Her magnum-dopus ‘The Transnational State, Neoliberalism and Environmental Education Policy’ is marinated in pseudo-intellectual gobbledy-gook, saturated with [ **redacted** ], obsessing: _“The neoliberalized global world capitalist order is characterized by the ability of an economic elite to establish power through ideological means.”_



She hopes “Education can be a critical part of a counter-movement” and dreams of turning out little Marxists, so-called environmental issues are simply the bait: _“An ecopedagogical approach can empower students to develop the critical thinking capacities to challenge the environmentally, socially and species exploitative norms of neoliberal logic.”_



Her aim is economic destruction to usher in the neo-enlightenment of Tullochism. Keep the [ **redacted** ] away from [ **redacted** ].

Yesterday, I resumed some temperature analysis I had been doing and found an amazing improvement in the GISS website for station data.
Instead of the tiny map with no station locations marked on it, I found a nice rotatable and zoomable globe with dots marking the station locations. There is also now a time window selector, making it much easier to find long and/or recent temperature records.

 Figure 1: Screen grab of the station data selector screen on the GISS website here.
In this screen, there is also a selector for the data set. The selections are: GHCN V3 unadjusted, GHCN V3 adjusted, GHCN V3 adjusted and cleaned, and GHCN V3 adjusted, cleaned, and homogenized.


<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




When a station is selected, these selections will be the downloaded data. But, all these are visible, and highlightable, on the graph for each station. When you hover the cursor over a station dot, the station name, the station number, the latitude and longitude, the station altitude, and the record beginning and end dates.
Here is a typical graph, this one for Churchill, Manitoba, Canada.

Figure 2: Temperature chart for Churchill. As you hover the cursor over the legend, the corresponding data is highlighted.
At the bottom of this page are the links to the images and data. These have also been improved with more selections.
These improvements have made it much easier to explore the temperature data available and the homogenization adjustments that have been applied. Keep in mind that these data, even the unadjusted data, have been somewhat manipulated by GHCN and NCDC.

Florida Tech lightning research deepens understanding of sprite formation – link specific atmospheric conditions to exuberant, luminous displays above thunderstorms
From the FLORIDA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

MELBOURNE, FLA. — A new study led by Florida Institute of Technology Professor Ningyu Liu has improved our understanding of a curious luminous phenomenon that happens 25 to 50 miles above thunderstorms.
These spectacular phenomena, called sprites, are fireworks-like electrical discharges, sometimes preceded by halos of light, in earth’s upper atmosphere. It has been long thought that atmospheric gravity waves play an important role in the initiation of sprites but no previous studies, until this team’s recent findings, provided convincing arguments to support that idea.
The research, published in the June 29 issue of Nature Communications, includes comprehensive computer-simulation results from a novel sprite initiation model and dramatic images of a sprite event, and provides a clearer understanding of the atmospheric mechanisms that lead to sprite formation.
Understanding the conditions of sprite formation is important, in part, because they can interfere with or disrupt long-range communication signals by changing the electrical properties of the lower ionosphere.

Predicted by Nobel laureate C. T. R. Wilson in 1924 but not discovered until 1989, sprites are triggered by intense cloud-to-ground lightning strokes. They typically last a few to tens of milliseconds; they are bright enough to be seen with dark-adapted naked eyes at night; and only the most powerful lightning strokes can cause them.
The study, conducted by Liu, a Florida Tech professor of physics and space sciences, and collaborators Joseph Dwyer, a former professor at Florida Tech now at University of New Hampshire, Hans Stenbaek-Nielsen from University of Alaska Fairbanks, and Matthew McHarg from the United States Air Force Academy, investigated how sprites are initiated.
According to Liu, the perturbations in the upper atmosphere created by atmospheric gravity waves can grow in the electric field produced by lightning and eventually lead to sprites.
“Perturbations with small size and large amplitude are best for initiating sprites,” Liu said. “If the size of the perturbation is too large, sprite initiation is impossible; if the magnitude of the perturbation is small, it requires a relatively long time for sprites to be initiated.”
To validate their model, the team analyzed a sprite event captured simultaneously by high-speed, high-sensitivity cameras on two aircraft during an observation mission sponsored by the Japanese broadcasting corporation NHK. The high-speed images show that a relatively long-lasting sprite halo preceded the fast initiation of sprite elements, exactly as predicted by the model.
Hamid Rassoul, an atmospheric physicist and the dean of Florida Tech’s College of Science, said the findings will be critical to future researchers.
“They will allow scientists to study not only sprites but also the mesospheric perturbations, which are difficult, if not impossible, to observe,” he said.
Liu added, “Our findings also suggest that small, dim glows in the upper atmosphere may be frequently caused by intense lightning but elude the detection. There may be many interesting phenomena waiting for discovery with more sensitive imaging systems.”

"Is it fair that China is blamed for the carbon dioxide emissions it generates to manufacture products destined for the West? Would the West do more to reduce greenhouse gases if it had to pay for the emissions caused in producing the products it imports? Welcome to the world of carbon accounting, where changes to the way the books are kept could improve our chances of driving down greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas have soared. In 2013 they were more than 60% higher than in 1990. This is despite significant progress in global climate policy, with numerous international agreements promising emission cutbacks. This contradiction reflects the structure of most international agreements: industrialised countries are allotted emissions targets while developing countries are not. Unsurprisingly, emissions have largely stabilised in the countries with targets to meet, and more than doubled in countries without them. China has seen the largest amount of emissions growth and now emits more carbon dioxide per person than the entire European Union. This increase in carbon dioxide emissions from developing countries was expected as their economies catch up with the rest of the industrialised world. This has been fuelled by a rapid growth in international trade, particularly in the case of China. In fact, around one-quarter of Chinese carbon dioxide emissions in recent years stem from the manufacture of products destined for export and hence consumption in another the country.   In response, researchers have conducted numerous studies that allocate emissions to the point of consumption. In contrast to the conventional territorial system of allocating emissions at the point that they are produced – for example, out of the chimney of a power station or factory – these studies allocate the emissions created in producing products to the country where the products were consumed. This is known as their carbon footprint.  Many industrialised countries have succeeded in reducing their territorial emissions, such as by moving to lower-carbon power generation and moving from manufacturing to a services industry. But these have been more than offset by increases in consumption-based emissions. This is primarily due to a rapid increase in imports of manufactured products – your clothes, electronics, and children’s toys. A recent study found that EU member states have reduced territorial emissions by over 15% since 1990, but have reduced consumption-based emissions by only 2%. The UK has made a 20% reduction in its territorial emissions, but is just 1% lower in its consumption.  Even local air pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide (responsible for acid rain) and black carbon (soot), are not immune to these trends. In a somewhat ironic twist, local air pollutants can be transported from the place they were first generated to the point where the end products were consumed. In a form of atmospheric poetic justice, a study recently calculated that between 12–24% of sulfate pollution over the western United States was transported by westerly winds, from factories in China back to the consumers in the US.  It’s clear the current system of measuring emission levels can be misleading. An obvious response is to ensure all countries enact and uphold meaningful emissions targets. This would mean all emissions are accounted for, irrespective of whether they are exported or imported. But progress is slow. The UN’s climate principle of sharing responsibility in relation to responsibility is likely to ensure that developing countries will always have weaker emissions targets as they seek to develop their economies and societies. Alternatively, some argue that consumption-based emissions targets would be fairer. In this case, China’s emissions generated by its huge export economy would be allocated to the importing countries. Given that this would actually reduce China’s share of emissions, it’s surprising China has not pursued this argument – officials have only mentioned it rhetorically to media, never in formal climate negotiations. If China and other carbon exporters gave up their responsibility for their exported emissions, then they implicitly allow the carbon importers to regulate their exports. This can be implemented by using a border carbon adjustment, where a carbon price is placed on products imported from countries without sufficient climate policies – in effect a customs duty on carbon. It’s something that’s been discussed by the US, EU, and other industrialised countries. Since industrialised countries are net importers of emissions, the use of a border carbon adjustment would lead to larger global cuts in emissions. But it would also reduce income for net exporters as demand for products falls. Perhaps this is a reason why China and other major carbon exporters haven’t pushed the issue. To keep things fair, a consumption-based climate policy would need to ensure a share of the border tax on imported carbon is actually returned to the exporter. Potentially based on the amount of carbon exported, these payments would fund for installing cleaner technologies in the exporting countries. Some argue that the fear of such complex and provocative policies may be just what we need to force nations towards agreeing a comprehensive global agreement using the simpler territorial system. Despite the numerous studies on the consequences of consumption-based carbon accounting, there is still no thorough analysis of the policy implications. But this may be changing: the latest IPCC Assessment Report may highlight how changing the way we quantify and allocate emissions between countries could improve international efforts to mitigate climate change. Whether an improved carbon accounting mechanism can speed up the glacially slow speed of negotiations is, however, another question."

Isn’t it odd that every proposed “solution” to climate change requires either massive overreach by governments, or mountains of taxpayer’s cash, or most often both?



The biggest, most expensive climate boondoggle foisted on long-suffering taxpayers is without a doubt “renewable” energy. Renewables, their advocates insist, are just great: so great, in fact, that they need the strong arm (not to mention money) of government in order to survive.



A sharp slump in new ­investment in wind and solar farms will continue unless a price is put on carbon or the Renewable Energy Target is extended beyond next year, the Clean Energy Council warns.



How very unusual – a mouthpiece for a rent-seeking industry almost entirely reliant on government handouts to survive is demanding **more** taxpayer’s money.



CEC chief executive Kane Thornton said ­investment in ­renewable energy had dropped by 60 per cent in the past year and declines would continue without government intervention. He said this would put pressure on power prices and ­reliability as coal generators aged.



The comments ignited a ­debate about whether renewable energy was the cheapest form of power, as advocates including Anthony Albanese and Malcolm Turnbull claim.



Anyone who’s watched their power bills spiral into the stratosphere as governments rush to foist renewable energy on us is well aware that Albanese and Turnbull are, not to put too fine a point on it, full of the proverbial. The [same dire scenario](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/the-deadly-cost-of-green-alarmism/) has played out across the world. Power prices surged in Germany. In Britain, poor households are increasingly suffering “energy poverty” – the inability to afford even basic heating. People are dying as a result.



The Australian government is almost coming to its senses.



Energy Minister Angus Taylor said large-scale renewables ­projects would not receive any further government support. “The clean energy industry has assured us that the cost of renewables is now competitive with alternatives so we would expect investment to continue in the ­absence of subsidies,” he said.



“An industry that is now ­competitive shouldn’t require ­additional subsidies, Mr Taylor said.



And there’s the basic lie of the renewables spruikers (who, like Turnbull, always seem to have purely coincidental, no doubt, ties to the renewable energy industry): **if renewables really ARE so cheap and reliable, WHY do they need government handouts to survive?**



The winners from this end to green-washing ripoff schemes will likely be ordinary consumers, rather than multi-millionaire investors.



Household power prices are set to fall by 7 per cent by 2022, easing several years of bill shocks, as green subsidies are wound up and a flood of new renewable supply enters the electricity grid.



The federal government’s policy adviser said consumers should see a $97 fall in their tariffs over the three years to June 2022.



Falling wholesale costs would be the largest contributor to declining bills, accounting for $62 of the projected total…



Of course, that new supply wouldn’t have been necessary if green-besotted governments hadn’t scrambled to shut down reliable coal-fired generators.



The projected figures would ease the pressure after several years of bill hikes for many Australian households sparked by the closure of the Hazelwood and Northern coal plants in Victoria and South Australia, which created supply shortages and price jumps across the national electricity market.



Government: is there anything they can’t screw up?

"The government has announced that the final prices paid to generators of solar, onshore and offshore wind would change to favour offshore wind at the expense of the others. While the difference is fairly slight – a fiver off here, a fiver added there – it reveals a favour that ignores the industry’s struggles to make offshore wind development economically viable. In 2012 the global wind industry manufactured and installed more than 20,000  turbines generating 45GW of energy. The leading firm alone, Danish company Vestas, installed more than 6GW of this via 2,500 turbines. The company’s offerings centre on a “workhorse” platform that supports turbines from 1.8MW to 3MW and rotor sizes from 80-112m in diameter, to meet the needs of different sites with different wind conditions and remain cost effective. This cost effectiveness is made possible by a supply chain of factories and component makers that have through many very substantial investments been able to develop the rhythm and flow of work. A new family of turbines, of different size or specification, would require that investment and experience to be made all over again. After more than a decade, the total number of offshore wind turbines worldwide is only now approaching 2,000 and growing erratically as different developers using different machinery from different countries embark on wholly unrelated and sometimes even interfering projects. This is not a route to any kind of cost effectiveness at all.  A joint venture between Vestas and Mitsubishi is developing a large, 8MW wind turbine but production won’t go ahead until there are sufficient orders to make it worthwhile. A leader in this month’s Windpower Monthly, the industry journal, explains that “collaboration is vital for offshore future” and that “the European wind industry continues to suffer from political indecision and backtracking on subsidies.” The UK is a particular offender for this, as shown by this week’s changing figures. Likewise Germany, which had intended to build more than 30GW of offshore capacity, now aims for 6.5GW – and only if the price is right, which it currently isn’t. Building things in the middle of the sea is very, very expensive, and that isn’t going to change. Pictures of offshore wind turbines look very much like those on land. But what lies beneath the water, and getting it there, is the problem. A standard Siemens 3.6MW turbine, rotor, gearbox, electronics and all, weighs around 250 tonnes. The steel tower that supports it when used on land weighs about 260 tonnes. At the Dong Energy windfarm at Walney off the Cumbrian coast the water is 30m deep. A huge steel cylinder is driven 30m into the seabed – it weighs 600 tonnes, and comes from China. A connector sleeve that links the cylinder to the tower that is inserted into it weighs 300 tonnes, and also comes from China. These are very expensive and cost a great deal to put in place. Then there is the matter of bringing the electricity ashore. All in all, it’s expensive and energy intensive. Germany has four offshore wind farms connected to the grid, with each connected by cables of different voltages and substations of different designs – essentially what happened to be available at the time each system was ordered. More standardisation is needed to cut costs, but in truth the complexities of moving material out to sea, setting it up, and connecting high voltage equipment underwater, over 100 miles, will require many leaps in technology before offshore wind farms are robust and economical.  When asked what the wind power sector might look like ten years hence, Jonathan Cole, offshore managing director of Spanish firm Iberdrola said “unless offshore wind is 40% cheaper in a decade it won’t matter what the sector looks like, because offshore won’t be part of it.” The UK holds 3.5% of the world’s wind energy capacity. About a third is offshore, but even this small amount accounts for more than half of all offshore wind installations on the planet. This is not a good place to be. In the 1980s I created the designs, the manufacturing processes, the team and the company that made all the wind turbine blades in the UK. My old team is now the global blade technology development centre for Vestas on the Isle of Wight. I have many, many years experience in technology development of all sorts. But with the exception of a few groups of engineers such as my old team, the UK seems to have no understanding of what developing wind technology involves. It is barely part of this 30-year-old industry that employs over 150,000 people in Europe alone, yet prides itself on having more than 50% of this tiny offshore non-market that the big boys in the real wind energy industry such as GE ignore, as it will never be good business. But the UK is so illiterate in these strategic technical matters, with an unruly market with unclear and changing policies, full of protesters ignorant of not only how the technology works, but what is required to sustain it as an economically viable industry. Offshore wind is at best an area of research and development, not a real market. Even in its wildest dreams, offshore is a niche market, fraught with technical difficulty and seriously expensive. Instead the industry’s efforts are put to developing larger rotors and taller towers for its workhorse machines to generate more electricity at lower costs in southern Germany, for example, where the market is. It’s unlikely whether such developments, even with the best forward planning and standardisation, can ever make a good economic case for offshore wind over anything else, despite what the government hopes to achieve with its paltry financial incentives."

Steve Harris writes:
An article came out on the AIP Physics Today website about a push from some scientists to formally designate today’s human geological epoch as the “Anthropocene”. Editors of the journal Nature argue that the name “provides a powerful framework for considering global change and how to manage it.” Here is a link:
http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/news/10.1063/PT.5.8107
Here is an excerpt, quoted from an article in Nature:
“Some supporters of the Anthropocene idea have even been likened to zealots. “There’s a similarity to certain religious groups who are extremely keen on their religion—to the extent that they think everybody who doesn’t practise their religion is some kind of barbarian,” says one geologist who asked not to be named.”
Another excerpt:
“Official recognition of the concept would invite cross-disciplinary science. And it would encourage a mindset that will be important not only to fully understand the transformation now occurring but to take action to control it.”
There are some interesting comments in the online discussion. One of them from a poster known as Guest is copied below. I thought it well written and worth sharing.
“When a popular foolishness arises in society one may weep for Reason, or laugh at absurdity. Few take notice of the former, and the proponents of the absurdity are greatly offended by the latter. It is clearly embarrassing to be exposed on the wrong side of Reality, and to have your favourite phantom hazard deflated. Consider crop circles. Even after the perpetrators confessed and demonstrated how they created them, true believers refused the explanation and vilified both the sceptics and the self-exposed pranksters.
Phantom hazards are popular with the fundamentally pusillanimous for the ‘threat’ can be confronted with the (perhaps sub-conscious) realization that there is no physical harm for the believer, but provides a cause of great moral superiority – and not infrequently, a generous income. Politically, phantom hazards are ideal tool for manipulating a trusting population. The threat is what the proponents construe it to be, it will never physically materialize, and victory can be declared at any time it loses its persuasive ability and attendant revenue. The true danger lies in real damage done to society through misapplication of effort and funds, and the theft of personal freedom – in this case ‘to fight climate change’ – previously ‘global warming’.
The arrogance of the political manipulators to pretend that they can organize society to prevent ‘climate change’ speaks poorly of those who would be thought of as ‘leaders’, and brings into question not only their intelligence but also their ethics. We must ask who benefits from this particular phantom hazard – and it certainly is not the general population.
One must admit that, from the perspective of manipulating society, global warming (or ‘climate change’) is a clever tool. This phantom hazard is global. It impacts everyone in the world. And they are not only its victims but also its cause. Brilliant! But dishonest. Such perfidy warrants much more than mere scoff.”

Guest Opinion: Dr. Tim Ball
In a recent article, I was pleased to read that Willis Eschenbach identified himself as a “Generalist” on his business card. In doing so, he correctly identifies it as a unique, even out of step position, especially in the science community. There is a degree of whimsy in his self-assessment, but it also identifies an underlying real issue. It is like the woman who gave me a business card with the self-assessment of ABC, an acronym for “Another Bloody Consultant”.
Eschenbach’s position and defense don’t surprise me. I watched academia transform from the idea that there were general rules with exceptions, to the idea that everything is an exception. It translated into the view that to generalize is the mark of a fool to specialize the mark of genius.
Eschenbach adds that it is an advantage in climate science. It is not just an advantage, but essential in studying climatology. I wrote about this in various ways in previous articles, but it needs a larger context as the world grapples with increasing fragmentation of information and knowledge.
Climatology is the study of weather patterns of a place or region, or the change of weather patterns over time. Climate science is the study of one component piece of climatology. The analogy I’ve used for decades is that climatology is a puzzle of thousands of pieces; climate science is one piece of the puzzle. A practical approach to assembling the puzzle is to classify pieces into groups. The most basic sorting identifies the corner pieces, the edge pieces and then color. Climatologists say the four corner pieces, which are oceans, atmosphere, lithosphere, and the cosmos are not even fully identified or understood. Climate scientists tend to hold one piece of the puzzle and claim it is the key to everything.
The year 1859 was pivotal in reducing people’s ability to understand the world. In that year, Darwin’s Origin of Species was published, and Alexander von Humboldt died. Darwin’s theory evolved from the collection of large amounts of evidence. The collection of information dominated European science of the 19th century. The information came from all over the world in increasing volumes and rapidly overwhelmed the ability of anyone to know it all.
Because of that Von Humboldt is credited with being the last “universal” person. That is he was the last person who “knew” all the science and geography known at that time. We still have renaissance people with a wider knowledge of several subjects, but not universal knowledge.
Since then the proliferation of knowledge, information, and ideas encouraged and lauded specialization and derided generalization. People specialize and become experts in one small piece of a very large complex puzzle, but are incapable of seeing the larger picture necessary for context and real understanding. For example, psychology studies individual behavior while sociology studies group behavior, but in the real world they are intertwined and inseparable. We are truly in a world where we cannot see the forest for the trees. We have more information and less understanding.
The problems became apparent for people studying the real world. A farmer told me of such an experience. He knew there was something wrong with the efficiency and productivity of his soils. He went to the University of Manitoba School of Agriculture. They told him they had no expert on soils, but they could line up several specialists, on such subjects as nematodes, trace minerals, clay colloid complexes, and plant microclimates. He ended up at his local fertilizer dealer who knew more about the soil problems of his area than any specialist.
Only those in the academic world dealing with the real world understood and responded to the problem in two basic ways. One was the creation of interdisciplinary studies. University calendars are now replete with them. As always the status quo resisted. They viewed them as hybrids and impure. Often specialists who put too much emphasis on their specialty chaired them. Environmental studies were likely the most expansive interdisciplinary study because it encompassed the new paradigm of environmentalism. They were also controversial in the academic world because they crossed the largest academic and intellectual boundary between Arts and Science.
The second was the introduction of systems analysis. It is interesting to read the various attempts to define system analysis. I only use Wikipedia here because it illustrates the problem.
“Systems analysis is a problem solving technique that decomposes a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose”. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, systems analysis is “the process of studying a procedure or business in order to identify its goals and purposes and create systems and procedures that will achieve them in an efficient way”. Analysis and synthesis, as scientific methods, always go hand in hand; they complement one another. Every synthesis is built upon the results of a preceding analysis, and every analysis requires a subsequent synthesis in order to verify and correct its results. 
Other definitions provide insight and explanation about why a computer model was a natural vehicle for systems analysis.
The analysis of an activity, procedure, method, technique, or business to determine what must be accomplished and how the necessary operations may best be accomplished.
Or,
The analysis of the requirements of a task and the expression of those requirements in a form that permits the assembly of computer hardware and software to perform the task 
Computers apparently provided one other major benefit in the volumes of data they could include and mathematically manipulate. As climate modelers quickly discovered, to build a model you need adequate data and accurate understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In the case of climate, neither were available.
The need for computer models and the need for adequate data was a conflict that evolved at the Climatic Research Unit (CRU). Hubert Lamb knew the computer and models offered potential. As a result, he hired Tom Wigley. He explains in his autobiography,
The research project which I had put forward to the Rockefeller Foundation was awarded a handsome grant, but it sadly came to grief over an understandable difference of scientific judgment between me and the scientist, Dr. Tom Wigley, who we appointed to take charge of the research.
Lamb set up the CRU believing,
The first and greatest need was to establish the facts of the past record of the natural climate in times before any side effects of human activities could well be important. 
This approach is in line with Darwin’s that you need adequate data as a basis for developing a theory.
“Since my retirement from the directorship of the Climatic Research Unit there have been changes there and in the direction of my own efforts. My immediate successor, Professor Tom Wigley, was chiefly interested in the prospects of world climate being changed as a result of human activities, primarily through the burning up of wood, coal, oil and gas reserves…” 
 
After only a few years almost all the work on historical reconstruction of past climate and weather situations, which had made the Unit well known, was abandoned.”
 
Lamb knew it would degenerate into creating the historical record needed for the political agenda, as exposed in the leaked emails.
A computer model is a generalization created by a specialist with each component produced by a different specialist. You only have to read the chapter on computer models in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Physical Science Basis Reports to see the resulting disconnect and dissonance. I identified this as a Gestaltist or learning problem, but it is much more. The volume of data grows, but the division into narrower specialties continues.
Through this period climatology, a generalized approach became the specialties of climate science. Computer models offered a chance at dealing with large volumes of data and the ability to simulate natural systems. Most climatologists were generally not interested nor capable of producing computer models, as Lamb acknowledged when he hired Wigley. Instead, computer modelers cast around for large-scale systems to challenge their skills. The other issue was the cost of the computers and operation time, which only governments could afford. They either operated the computers themselves or provided funding to academics doing the research they wanted. After a discussion with a computer modeler in 1998, I realized the limitations of his weather and climate knowledge. Despite this, I watched modelers take over as climate scientists and become keynote speakers at most climate conferences. It became so technologically centered that whoever had the biggest fastest computers were the “state of the art” climate experts. I recall the impact of the Cray computer on climate science. The idiocy continues today with the belief that the only limitation to the models is computer capacity and speed.
This pattern in climate science reflects President Eisenhower’s warnings.
Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.
In this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.
Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers. The prospect of domination of the nation’s scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.
Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.
 
The comment that follows the above is more important because it provides the template for today and tomorrow.
It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system — ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society. 
This statesmanship was on display at the recent Heartland Climate Conference in the presentations of Senator Inhofe, US Rep. Lamar Smith, and State Sen. Carlyle Begay. They are the vanguard to fulfill what Marcel Masse observed,
The more the world is specialized, the more it will be run by generalists.

Recently when reading a newspaper I came across an article headlined – _Why Socialism became a dirty word in 2019._ The newspaper declined to give the author of the article so maybe it was from a right-wing source. The paper seems only too happy to publicise its friendly left-wing sources. The article concentrated on Britain and European countries. My distinction between the two is deliberate as I am of British heritage and don’t regard Britain as part of Europe or myself in any way European. By the by, neither does my wife and she is English. Britain has nothing in common with Europe, and indeed, some of the countries within Europe have nothing in common with each other. Hence the inevitable demise of the EU and its gang of highly paid left-wing henchmen. Thank God Britain is leaving.



Back to the point – the decline of socialism. The problem the left has, particularly the hard left, the Jeremy Corbyns of this world, is they want to return to the bad old days, which to them are the good old days, where the government controlled everything. The result is that for it to work everyone has to end up on the same level, thereby destroying ambition and the incentive to better oneself through hard work. The irony is that the left call this **“progressive”**. In the newspaper article Tony Blair says “The choice for Labour is to renew itself as the serious, progressive” (there’s that word) “non-Conservative competitor for power in British politics, or retreat from such an ambition, in which case over time it will be replaced.”



Using Italy as an example, the article says political fluidity is another challenge. Gone are the days when you stuck to your tribe for life. To me this is no better exemplified than by Trump’s and Johnson’s election wins. Trump may have had some luck due to the way elections are run under the electoral college system but what is relevant to this discussion is that he won in the rust belt with blue-collar workers. Johnson replicated this, winning over the workers in the north-east and the Midlands.



This is something the left, and definitely those on the far left, have to come to grips with. It is human nature with most people, apart from the likes of Shane’s nephews, that if you are brought into this world you want to make the most of your short time on the planet. That means having the ability to work hard and succeed. Those on the left, if our MPs are anything to go by, appear to be lacking in this regard and therefore support the socialist doctrine where the State does all the thinking for you mainly via their paymasters, the union bosses.



It stands to reason then that the only system that works is the capitalist one. It’s not perfect by any means but it allows human nature to behave as it should. To aspire to achieve, to take the ups with the downs, to cope with the school of hard knocks and to come out the other end hopefully a better person. The other option is the road our Captain is taking us down, the road of mediocrity where Shane’s nephews can sit on the couch all day because the so-called rich pricks, farmers, landlords and other hard workers will fund your lifestyle through paying exorbitant taxes. It probably won’t be too long before the nephews will only have to go as far as the front door where the courier man will be standing, welfare cash in hand.



This is why, this year, it is crucial to elect a right-wing coalition. I know those of us on _The BFD_ have differing views with regard to the minor parties but ACT, with its Epsom seat, is realistically, the most if not the only likely option to partner with National. Anything else risks staying on the road we are on which, in my view, can only come to a dead end. To avoid confusion, the dead-end will be due to leftie economics, not climate change.

"How does a young animal find its way to an unfamiliar location hundreds or thousands of kilometres from where it was born? A reasonable idea might be to find an older, experienced migrant and follow. This might work well for caribou or some songbirds, but what about the many marine animals such as tuna, salmon, eels or sea turtles that never even meet their parents? Our experiments published in Current Biology indicate that juvenile Chinook salmon (sometimes called king salmon) make their journey as if they have a GPS, based not on satellite links but the Earth’s magnetic field. This is possible because the Earth’s magnetic field varies predictably across the globe: the intensity of the field increases from the equator to the poles, and the angle at which magnetic field lines intersect the surface of the Earth similarly increases towards the poles. This forms a grid of coordinates that animals capable of sensing it can use to approximate their position. This is different to a compass, in which the magnetic field is used to find or maintain a direction. A compass can help you walk in a straight line, but it won’t tell you where you are. For that a map is needed, and quite conveniently for salmon they seem to come with one pre-installed. We were able to reveal this with surprisingly simple techniques. We created a model of the North Pacific’s magnetic field by wrapping a wooden frame with copper wires running horizontally and vertically around the perimeter, spaced at certain intervals. Passing an electric current of a specific amperage through the wires recreated the intensity and inclination angle found at any location in the North Pacific. We placed juvenile salmon in several five-gallon buckets within the contraption and changed the magnetic field around them, while a camera overhead photographed how their direction of swimming changed with the magnetic field. Overall, fish that found themselves to the north of their typical oceanic range swam southwards, and those displaced to the south swam northwards. Fish that remained in the local field, that is, the field they expected to be in, did not have a preference, which indicated that those preferences observed in the other simulated fields are attributable to the change in magnetic conditions (a reassuring “control” for our experiments). To demonstrate that salmon were using both the intensity and inclination of the magnetic field to determine where they were, we tested them in a field that paired the northern intensity with the southern inclination angle and vice versa. These combinations of magnetic parameters do not exist in the North Pacific, so only if the fish used one, rather than both, of the parameters would they be able to orient themselves correctly. We found the fish swam and directed themselves randomly, showing their confusion. What’s really interesting is that we used entirely naïve salmon in our experiments – they had never been anywhere but the testing facility, had never swum the route to learn the magnetic gradients, nor met another salmon that had. So the magnetic map, and compass, and knowledge of which direction to set off in are probably inherited traits, equipping the salmon to successfully navigate the world’s largest ocean as soon as they hit saltwater. Admittedly, it does seem fantastic that animals can know where they are on the globe by taking readings of the Earth’s subtle, invisible magnetic field. It’s been argued that the magnetic field is too weak and the gradients to shallow for animals to assess a latitudinal and longitudinal position. Others have likewise suggested that as the magnetic field gradually drifts over time, it doesn’t make a good map. Work by Ken Lohmann and me on sea turtles seems to have convinced most people that hatchling turtles are using inherited magnetic instructions (at least, in part) to guide their ocean migration. There is considerable scepticism among some as to whether this could work for other animals, while others have taken to it with gusto: some in the creationist/intelligent design camp claim the apparent “uniqueness” of turtles’ magnetic navigation system proves turtles are a “special creation” and thus disprove the theory of evolution by natural selection. But these experiments definitively show that juvenile salmon, like turtles, inherit an ability to detect and orient themselves to magnetic fields to help them cross the oceans. It appears that the unpredictable ocean environment imposes a strong selective pressure for animals to be able to determine where they are, so as to help them find food, favourable temperatures, and avoid predators. Many of these things are very difficult to directly detect; salmon and turtles seem to have evolved hard-wired orientation responses and this leads them to find better than average locations, which in turn leaves them better fed, better protected and more likely to reproduce. Given the behaviour observed in these two distantly related species of marine migrants, convergent evolution seems to have decided that the cues within the magnetic field are the right tool for the job."
"The hottest week in the UK since records began offers further proof that our weather is changing. Climate change and global heating are not predictions, but facts of life that we must deal with now. Ten of the UK’s warmest-ever years have been since 2002, while the temperature of 36.4C recorded at Heathrow airport last week made it the hottest August day since 2003. Links between climate and weather must always be made with caution. But scientists already have evidence that 2020’s record temperatures are the consequence of human-caused climate change. According to researchers, the heatwave in the Siberian Arctic between January and June, which caused permafrost to melt and buildings to collapse, was made at least 600 times more likely by greenhouse gas emissions. While this summer has seen no repeat of 2018’s devastating wildfires in Greece, which killed more than 80 people, records have been broken in the Middle East as well as Europe and 2020 is likely to be the hottest year globally on record. On 29 July Baghdad recorded a temperature high of 51.7C, leading to protests about electricity and goods shortages.  Yet despite warnings stretching back decades, the UK remains ill-equipped and underprepared for such changes. Tourist destinations are struggling to cope with the influx of new visitors due to warm weather as well as Covid-19 travel restrictions. And while some people have mainly enjoyed the sun and high temperatures, they carry risks for older people and those with underlying health conditions. Experts warn that the tendency by UK broadcasters to present long dry spells as good news risks lulling the public into a false sense of security. The deaths of three men, caused by Wednesday’s derailment of a train near Stonehaven in Scotland, were a tragic corrective to this national tendency to look on the bright side when it comes to weather. While the causes of the disaster remain to be determined by investigators, Network Rail and Scotland’s transport secretary, Michael Matheson, have both pointed to torrential rain and landslips as probable factors. Inspections of dozens of sites with similar trackside slopes have already been ordered. Meanwhile, farmers are warning that the weather has shrunk crops of grain and potatoes. Last weekend saw countryside in Surrey damaged by a wildfire, and Hammersmith Bridge in London is shut after cracks worsened in the heatwave. In March the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced that funding for England’s flood defences would increase to £5.2bn in 2021, while the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, pledged to decarbonise transport. The government is said to be planning a new, state-backed green bank. But there is still no sign of the comprehensive action plan that is needed to boost the UK’s resilience to the threat of climate chaos. Indeed, environmental commitments were conspicuous by their absence from last week’s planning proposals. And while Boris Johnson bandies about buzz phrases such as “infrastructure revolution”, ministers’ awareness of the scale of the climate challenge appears sketchy rather than solid. Last month a commission on the decarbonisation of heating systems convened by the CBI offered the latest of repeated warnings that the UK is on course to miss key targets. Of course, the pandemic and recession make it harder to think beyond the present and immediate future, especially for people whose livelihoods are threatened. But already the UK is lagging behind the green recovery plans of countries including Germany, with its £9bn investment in hydrogen. With flash floods expected over the weekend, the need for climate leadership has never been clearer, to shield us from the storms ahead."

"**A former guerrilla fighter who used to jam the communication network of Ethiopian troops, Debretsion Gebremichael is now leading the fight against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government for control of the northern Tigray region, described as the ""womb"" of the nation.**
Mr Debretsion leads the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the party which controls Tigray, and which has fallen out so dramatically with Mr Abiy.
Now married with a young child, Mr Debretsion cut short his studies at the University of Addis Ababa in the 1970s to join the TPLF in its 17-year war against Marxist ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam's Derg regime.
He then went on to be a government minister after the Derg had been defeated and replaced by a coalition of parties dominated by the TPLF until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018.
His close friend and comrade Alemayehu Gezahegn said that after they had both completed their military training in the rugged and mountainous terrain of Tigray and, noting his comrade's technical skills, he suggested to TPLF commanders that Mr Debretsion should be deployed to the ""technical unit"".
For Mr Alemayehu, this was the logical place for Mr Debretsion, as he was a bright, but reserved, ""city boy"" who grew up in Shire, which, in a major blow to the Tigray leader, is now under the control of federal troops.
Coming from an Orthodox Christian family, the Tigray leader was named Debretsion, which means Mount Zion, while his second name is that of his father, Gebremichael, meaning Servant of Saint Michael.
""When he was in primary school, he used to collect old batteries, radios, electric equipment, and fix them. When no-one had electric power in our town, he made a lightbulb for himself from scraps,"" Mr Alemayehu recalled.
Mr Debretsion excelled in the TPLF's ""technical unit"", playing a vital role in developing intelligence capabilities so that the TPLF could eavesdrop on the conversations of the Ethiopian army and jam their radio communications.
""This helped us to win because TPLF freedom fighters knew about enemy movements in advance, and, being jammed, they could not communicate with each other when they were attacked,"" Mr Alemayehu said.
To further develop his skills, Mr Debretsion travelled to Italy on a false passport and returned to set up the TPLF's first radio station - Dimtsi Weyane, meaning Voice of the Revolution.
Another TPLF guerrilla fighter, Measho Gebrekidan, recalled that they used to go to the mountains at night, when the chances of being spotted by government spies were slim, to install antennas.
""One night, he slipped... and it was me and another comrade who saved his life. I always thought that if this had happened, would this radio have been created?"" Mr Measho said.
Now Dimtsi Weyane is part of a multilingual and multiplatform media group based in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, broadcasting TPLF statements about its military confrontation with the federal government.
The media station has broadcast fierce criticism of Mr Abiy, and as the conflict began its signal was jammed, but Dimtsi Weyane was back on air the next day.
Mr Debretsion and Mr Abiy seemed to be friends at the start of the prime minister's time in office in 2018. The Tigray leader even arranged a rapturous welcome for the prime minister in Mekelle.
""Tigray is a place where the history of our country is cooked, and it's the region where foreign invaders [including Italians and Egyptians] had been defeated and embarrassed. In modern Ethiopia, it is the womb of Ethiopia,"" Mr Abiy said in 2018.
For his part, Mr Debretsion hailed the prime minister's peace initiative with Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki to end the ""no war-no peace"" situation that had existed between the two countries since the end of their 1998-2000 border conflict.
""[Mr Abiy] travelled to Eritrea and met Isaias. This was impossible for many years. It's a big deal because it is going to give a massive opportunity for the country,"" Mr Debretsion said when the deal was agreed.
But this display of comradeship appears to have masked the tensions that were brewing between the two men.
Mr Debretsion had ambitions to be prime minister himself and lost out to Mr Abiy in the 2018 contest within the ruling coalition.
**You may also be interested in:**
""I told him: 'You are immature. You are not the right candidate',"" Mr Debretsion told the UK-based Financial Times newspaper in 2019.
But his defeat did not come as a surprise, as the TPLF had become synonymous with repression and corruption during its 27 years as the dominant country's dominant political force.
Views about Mr Debretsion's performance when he was working in government are mixed.
His critics say that when he was the deputy head of the intelligence bureau in the 1990s, he was instrumental in spying on opposition figures, and helping to crush dissent.
But his supporters focus on the fact that he transformed Ethiopia's telecommunications infrastructure when elevated to the cabinet, where he served as deputy prime minister and as minister of communications and information technology.
He launched massive projects to expand mobile phone coverage across Ethiopia, though the state kept a monopoly over the industry, and the telecom company has been criticised for internet shutdowns aimed at curbing anti-government protests.
""Most of the power and telecom infrastructure projects were led by him,"" US-based public policy expert Dade Desta said.
""The IT Park that is now in Addis Ababa was his idea [and] his fingerprints can be found in many state-owned projects.""
This includes the building of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is now at the centre of diplomatic tensions with US President Donald Trump warning that Egypt might ""blow it up"".
The TPLF and the prime minister parted ways when Mr Abiy dissolved the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, the ruling coalition of ethnically based parties, to launch the Prosperity Party in 2019, arguing this would help unite the country.
The TPLF refused to join, arguing that Ethiopia's federal nature was a better way to manage the country's deep ethnic divides.
Mr Debretsion returned to Tigray where he was seen as a reformist. He allowed four new political parties to contest the regional election held in September in defiance of the federal government.
""My door is open to everyone,"" he often said.
""We want development; not war,"" was another common statement of Mr Debretsion.
But now, he finds himself at the centre of a conflict that is reported to have killed hundreds of people, forced more than 30,000 people to flee to neighbouring Sudan, and damaged crucial infrastructure - including roads and buildings - in a region with the highest levels of poverty in Ethiopia, according to the UN.
""Mr Debretsion counts this war as a curse,"" Mr Dade said.
But, he added, he expected the TPLF to strongly resist attempts by Mr Abiy to establish a new administration in Tigray.
""They [the TPLF] were in the war with Eritrea, and the struggle against the Derg. So they have enough experience. By its nature, war needs the will of the people to fight, which there is in Tigray,"" Mr Dade said, raising the prospect of a long conflict.
However, Mr Abiy is also confident that he can defeat the TPLF and bring Mr Debretsion, who is facing charges of treason and rebelling against the constitution, to justice.
**1\. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region.** Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires.
**2\. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site.** The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant.
**3\. Most people in Tigray are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.** The region's Christian roots stretch back 1,600 years.
**4\. The region's main language is Tigrinya** , a Semitic dialect with at least seven million speakers worldwide.
**5\. Sesame is a major cash crop** , exported to the US, China and other countries."
"**The fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray state may not only have drastic implications for the future of the country but could also seriously affect its neighbours.**
Seeking to calm tensions a day after fighting started, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that ""the stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region"".
With a population of more than 110 million and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, what happens in Ethiopia inevitably has a wider impact.
Despite this, the federal government has so far resisted calls for diplomatic intervention to end the hostilities with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which runs the state.
Instead it has launched a charm offensive aiming to persuade the world that this is an internal matter. The government has described the conflict as a ""law-enforcement operation"" against a ""clique"" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order.
This fighting may have been the result of long-standing tensions between the TPLF and the federal authorities, but the thousands of refugees crossing into Sudan indicates how this has spread beyond Ethiopia's borders, whether the government likes it or not.
""The war is already regional,"" says Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst.
""The Sudanese are involved and at some point it will involve other countries in the region, and also beyond, because it is a strategic region. The impact is huge.""
He also believes that the conflict has drawn in Eritrea, which shares a long border with Tigray.
Eritrea has a history of poor relations with the TPLF, with its own scores to settle, and its President, Isaias Afwerki, is an ally of Ethiopian Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed.
There is no doubt that attacking across Tigray's northern border would open up a new flank in the fighting, but so far the Eritrean authorities have denied involvement in the crisis.
There is also a danger that the federal government's focus on Tigray could weaken its involvement in backing the government in Somalia against al-Shabab militants.
Ethiopia has already withdrawn about 600 soldiers from Somalia's western border, though they were not tied to the African Union's mission in Somalia (Amisom), which Ethiopia also supports.
""If the situation deteriorates further and Mr Abiy is forced to pull out of Amisom, that would be catastrophic... it will create an opportunity for al-Shabab to regrow and regroup again,"" says regional analyst Mr Abdi.
The International Crisis Group agrees, saying that unless the conflict is urgently stopped, it ""will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa"".
Regardless of the current involvement of Ethiopia's neighbours, some argue that the conflict could weaken the Ethiopian state, which could have damaging regional consequences in itself, with other groups in the multi-ethnic country emboldened to take on the central government.
Mr Abdi told the BBC that ""what you will see essentially is the regions drifting away from the centre and the centre becoming weaker, unable to assert itself"".
But the director of Nairobi-based think-tank the Horn Institute, Hassan Khannenje, understands that Prime Minister Abiy needed to bring Tigray back in line with the federal government to avoid a situation where others could follow its example.
""Mr Abiy sees this as setting a bad precedent for the other regions... a unilateral movement towards a potential secession will mean the balkanisation of Ethiopia, which could mean the end of Ethiopia as a nation-state,"" he told the BBC.
""His endgame is to bring the state back into the fold and hopefully move into elections next year as a united country. Which is going to very hard to do in practice, but it is not impossible.""
In the meantime, the crisis could lead to thousands being forced from their homes either directly because of conflict, or because of the fear of conflict.
Growing numbers have been crossing into Sudan and on Friday the UN's refugee agency said that the speed of new arrivals risked ""overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid"", the Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman as saying.
The Sudanese government has agreed to the establishment of a camp for 20,000 people 80km (50 miles) from the border and more sites are being identified, the UN says.
Added to this is the spectre of food shortages, with the region being one of the worst-affected by a desert locust infestation, with threats of new swarms arriving in the coming weeks, according to a recent UN humanitarian report.
About 600,000 people in Tigray - about 10% of the population - already rely on food aid and across the country around seven million people face food shortages, the UN says.
If the fighting does continue, the numbers of people needing assistance would increase rapidly in a region already under pressure on other fronts.
The UN adds that the threat ""of uncontrolled diseases and desert locust infestation"" reaching other parts of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries ""is high"".
Ethiopia's size and strategic position in the region means that what happens in the country cannot necessarily be isolated, whether that is the fighting itself or the humanitarian fall-out.
The prime minister is confident that this will be a short conflict and insists that it is a purely Ethiopian issue, but if it is prolonged then it could have serious repercussions for many of its neighbours."

"The sight of speakers known to dispute the scientific evidence supporting climate change being called to speak at a parliamentary select committee on the latest IPCC report last week has raised certain commentators’ blood pressure. Some have gone so far as to claim that the climate change debate in Britain has become “as depressingly unscientific and polarised as it is in the United States”. I disagree. The debate about climate change needs to become more political, and less scientific. Articulating radically different policy options in response to the risks posed by climate change is a good way of reinvigorating democratic politics. A paper by John Cook and colleagues published in May 2013 claimed that of the 4,000 peer-reviewed papers they surveyed expressing a position on anthropogenic global warming, “97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming”. But merely enumerating the strength of consensus around the fact that humans cause climate change is largely irrelevant to the more important business of deciding what to do about it. By putting climate science in the dock, politicians are missing the point. What matters is not whether the climate is changing (it is); nor whether human actions are to blame (they are, at the very least partly and, quite likely, largely); nor whether future climate change brings additional risks to human or non-human interests (it does). As climate scientist Professor Myles Allen said in evidence to the committee, even the projections of the IPCC’s more prominent critics overlap with the bottom end of the range of climate changes predicted in the IPCC’s published reports. In the end, the only question that matters is, what are we going to do about it? Scientific consensus is not much help here. Even if one takes the Cook study at face value, then how does a scientific consensus of 97.1% about a fact make policy-making any easier? As Roger Pielke Jr has often remarked in the context of US climate politics, it’s not for a lack of public consensus on the reality of human-caused climate change that climate policy implementation is difficult in the US. So politics, not science, must take centre stage. As Amanda Machin shows in her recent book, asking climate scientists to forge a consensus around facts with the expectation that decisive political action will naturally follow misunderstands science and politics in equal measure. If democratic politics is to be effective we need more disagreement, not more consensus, about what climate change is really about. As I have argued elsewhere, the most important questions to be asked about climate change extend well beyond science. Let me suggest four; all of which are more important than the committee’s MPs managed. They are questions which people should and do disagree about and they have no correct answer waiting to be discovered by science. How do we value the future, or in economic terms, at what rate should we discount the future? Many of the arguments about urgent versus delayed interventions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions revolve around how much less we value future public goods and natural assets relative to their value today. This is a question that clear-thinking people will disagree about. In the governance of climate change what role do we allocate to markets? Many arguments about climate change, as about environmental management more generally, revolve around whether commodifying nature, by pricing environmental “goods” and “services”, is part of the problem rather than part of the solution. How do we wish new technologies to be governed, from experimentation and development to deployment? This question might revolve around new or improved low-carbon energy technologies (such as fracking, nuclear power, or hydrogen fuel), the use of genetically modified crops as a means to adapt to changing climate, or proposed climate engineering technologies. Again, these are not questions upon which science, least of all a scientific consensus, can adjudicate. What is the role of national governments as opposed to those played by multilateral treaties or international governing bodies? This requires citizens to reflect on forms of democracy and representation. They are no less important in relation to climate change than they are in relation to state security, immigration or financial regulation. Any considered response to climate change will need to take a position, implicitly or explicitly, on one or more of these four questions, and others besides. And the percentage of climate science papers that accept humans are causing global warming has little to no bearing on public deliberations about these four questions. Because the questions about climate change that really matter will not be settled by scientific facts. They entail debates about values and about the forms of political organisation and representation that people believe are desirable. This requires a more vigorous politics that cannot be short-circuited by appeals to science. This article has been updated to better reflect the views of the author."
"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been [harshly criticised](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-22/prime-minister-scott-morrison-hawaii-holiday-bushfires/11821682) for being on holiday in Hawaii as the catastrophic bushfires were burning Australia. 



Since his return, he has visited stricken communities – most recently, on [Kangaroo Island yesterday](https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/11-million-funding-package-announced-to-support-small-businesses-affected-by-kangaroo-island-bushfires/news-story/a7075d119ce8c89005590107bb7a6c76). He has acknowledged the emotional toll on victims and promised practical support. 



But the criticism continues. Every detail of the prime minister’s performance is being scrutinised via the 24/7 news cycle and social media. There is plenty of scope for perceived missteps, and little tolerance of them. 



Disaster of any kind throws qualities of leadership – or the perceived lack thereof – under the spotlight. By what criteria, then, do we evaluate a leader’s performance at such times? What do we look for? 



These are questions that have guided [my research](https://primeministers.moadoph.gov.au/topics/i-had-to-come-to-see-for-myself) on how prime ministers have historically connected with Australians during times of peril. 



During crises, people expect two things, broadly speaking. One is practical information, advice and support to minimise the risk faced by those directly impacted. The other is “[humanistic communication](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00909880601065664)” – or, the ability to offer comfort. 



Last March, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern [showed both of these qualities in her decisive response](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/new-zealand-shooting-jacinda-ardern-video-reaction-world-praise-a8832186.html) to the massacre of 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch. 



She immediately provided detailed information and promised aid and tighter gun control measures. And she unambiguously aligned all New Zealanders with the Muslim community [by what she said](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/18/jacinda-ardern-is-showing-the-world-what-real-leadership-is-sympathy-love-and-integrity) – “They are us” – and by standing with community leaders and comforting those in distress. 



Importantly, [Ardern also wore a headscarf](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/28/with-respect-how-jacinda-ardern-showed-the-world-what-a-leader-should-be) when meeting the families of victims. This was seen as a strong and culturally sensitive statement of solidarity and support – a mark of good political leadership. 



Australian leaders have long shown strength in times of need, but the way they do so has changed over time. Today, there’s much more emphasis on being visible.



Following the Black Sunday bushfires in Victoria in 1926, for example, The Age printed a speech by Prime Minister Stanley Bruce in which [he promised federal government aid and praised the heroism and altruism of Australians](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/155775733?browse=ndp%3Abrowse%2Ftitle%2FA%2Ftitle%2F809%2F1926%2F02%2F18%2Fpage%2F18727995%2Farticle%2F155775733). 



When the Black Friday fires devastated the state 13 years later, The Age [quoted an “appalled” Prime Minister Joseph Lyons](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/19405913), who promised aid and expressed his “heartfelt sympathy” to victims.



But nothing was said in the newspapers back then about either prime minister interacting directly with victims. 



A leader wouldn’t get away with that these days. Since televisions became ubiquitous in people’s homes, it’s become necessary for leaders to be on the ground following a disaster, surveying damage and consoling victims. 



Prime Minister Harry Holt, a savvy user of the media in the early years of television, travelled to Tasmania in the aftermath of the Black Tuesday fires in 1967. Holt [said](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14443058.2019.1614647?journalCode=rjau20) he had to go to see for himself, to better understand people’s experience and needs. A [detailed study](https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1109993) of the 1967 bushfire response notes that Holt’s visit, while short, “caught the imagination” of journalists, who reported his reaction to the devastation in vivid detail. 



This is what we now expect. Visits to disaster sites have become [rituals vital to crisis management](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/politics-of-crisis-management/D91A08EC1089E0463A1BEDBF244176FA) and [a fixture](https://www.peterlang.com/view/title/21344) of disaster reporting. 



For a prime minister, such visits are also a chance to express those inherent qualities of “Australianness” that guarantee a full recovery. Everything that is said and done matters, which is why small details are heavily scrutinised. 



People do not expect to be held at arm’s length on these occasions. Expressions of empathy are often reinforced by physical contact, even hugs. 



Prime Minister Kevin Rudd demonstrated this following fires in Victoria in 2009, as did John Howard in the wake of the fires that swept through Canberra in 2003. They shook hands, patted backs and embraced survivors and emergency service workers.



Others have got it completely wrong. Among his many missteps in his response to Hurricane Katrina, President George W. Bush [delayed returning to Washington from his vacation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-04/bushfires-climate-change-scott-morrison-perplexing-failures/11839770) by two whole days. An image of him surveying the damage from Air Force One then [backfired](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/bushfire-crisis-burns-like-morrison-s-katrina-moment-20200103-p53ohw) – a decision Bush later called a “huge mistake”. 



When Hurricane Harvey devastated Texas in 2017, President Donald Trump was likewise [criticised](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/us/trump-texas-harvey.html) for paying too little attention to victims when he toured the site. And after the Grenfell Tower fire in London, UK Prime Minister Theresa May [admitted](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/11/theresa-may-grenfell-tower-fire-response-not-good-enough) that not meeting residents on her first visit was a mistake. 



Misjudging what type of response is welcome from a leader also risks being seen as symptomatic of poor leadership, of being out of touch with the people. As we saw recently with Morrison, not everybody appreciates a handshake. 



Even what a leader wears may be important. First Lady Melania Trump, for instance, was [widely mocked](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/08/melania-trump-hurricane-harvey-heels) for wearing stiletto heels to tour the Harvey devastation. 



And when Prime Minister Julia Gillard went to Queensland in early 2011 following extensive flooding and held a press conference with Premier Anna Bligh, [some commentators focused on the differences in their attire](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/captain-bligh-steers-the-ship-in-face-of-adversity-20110112-19ob0.html). Gillard, with her tidy suit, was criticised for not striking the right note. Bligh’s more casual appearance, meanwhile, had the look of someone more in touch with the suffering of the people. 



Earlier this year, Morrison was also faulted for wearing a [military camouflage jacket](https://thewest.com.au/opinion/mark-riley/scott-morrison-townsville-flood-tragedy-reveals-the-man-beneath-the-political-armour-ng-b881098307z) when touring a north Queensland flood zone, with some saying he was “[hamming it up](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/05/not-easy-being-green-scott-morrison-inspires-army-fatigue-with-choice-of-camouflage)” for the cameras.



The reactions to Morrison’s handling of the bushfires shows how important these qualities are in our presidents and prime ministers and how they will continue to influence perceptions of leadership in times of crisis. 



Just as every leader is different, every disaster also requires a distinct approach. Each demands quick and sensitive judgements about what’s appropriate for the occasion. Reaction to any perceived errors of judgement will be swift and will spread quickly. 



Above all, we look for [authenticity in these moments](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1461670X.2018.1527712?journalCode=rjos20), rather than obviously scripted photo opportunities. And in times of crisis, we’re more attuned to those out-of-touch moments when authenticity seems to be lacking.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOver the past couple of days an “explosive scandal” has erupted in Germany.
Apparently traces of Monsanto pesticide product Glyphosate has been detected in 14 of Germany’s top beer brands, read background here. OMG!

Greens warn of a “health danger”: Those 50,000,000 micrograms of alcohol in 1 liter of beer might contain a whole 29 micrograms of “unlikely carcinogenic” Glyphosate! Photo: normalkneipe.de/
 This story is just the latest that so vividly illustrates how Green clean-freaks can erupt into a fit of irrational hysteria. And the drone media just blindly run with it.
According to the Environmental Institute in Munich, tests on 14 German beer brands that have the highest sales figures in the country were found to contain “traces of the pesticide”.
The highest intensity of the pesticide was allegedly found in Hasseröder brand beer with over 29 micrograms of the chemical per litre. Note here that we are talking about a few millionths of a single gram, and per liter concentrations in the billionths.
According to the English-language The Local here, the World Health Organization (WHO) labelled Glyphosate “potentially carcinogenic” in 2015. That means they are not even sure. And the EU food safety authority Efsa concluded that it was “unlikely that Glyphosate poses a cancer risk to humans”.
In a nutshell: the evidence showing that Glyphosate is carcinogenic, especially at those low levels, is scant at best.

Alcohol concentration million times higher
What makes the story all the more comical is that by comparison German beer contains alcohol, and at concentrations of near 5%, or 50,000,000 micrograms. German blogger Ludger Weß here discusses just how ridiculous the reaction of the German Green clean-freaks has been. He notes that the chemical alcohol has been put in the highest hazard category (Class 1 – carcinogenic) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).
The German Greens are thus demanding the public be hysterically concerned about 30 micrograms of “unlikely carninogenic” Glyphosate in beer, and not to worry at all about the comparatively whopping 50,000,000 microns of Class 1 carcinogen alcohol in the beer.
Weß adds sarcastically (paraphrasing): “What’s next? Tests to see if cigarettes might contain trace amounts of Glyphosate ?”
So what motive could be behind the irrational hysteria that has been brewed up by the green-leaning Environmental Institute in Munich? The Local writes:
With Monsanto’s licence to sell the pesticide running out in the summer, the European Commission will have to once again consider whether the product is safe for use in the EU.”
Just the latest dirty attack by environmentalists and greens aimed at an industry it wants to destroy. Create a scare story about a non-problem.
It’s always a good idea to really put all scare stories of environmentalist greens into the correct perspective. Almost all the time they are completely false and irrational.

"President Trump’s ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim nations could have a wide impact on international sports, including jeopardizing a warm relationship between the United States and Iran in wrestling competitions and threatening the chances of Los Angeles hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics and of the United States securing soccer’s 2026 World Cup. On Saturday, sports officials struggled to understand the implications of Mr. Trump’s executive order, including the question of whether athletes from the targeted nations could enter the United States to compete, especially in the initial   period of the ban. “We are working closely with the administration to understand the new rules and how we best navigate them as it pertains to visiting athletes,” Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee, said in an email. “We know they are supportive of the Olympic movement and our bid and believe we will have a good working relationship with them to ensure our success in hosting and attending events. ” At least one International Olympic Committee delegate criticized Mr. Trump’s decision. The delegate, Richard Peterkin of St. Lucia, said Saturday that he considered the executive order “very, very disappointing. ” He also called the United States a “haven” for many athletes hoping to train outside their home countries. “Most of our athletes from St. Lucia train in the States,” Mr. Peterkin said. “We don’t have an issue because we’re not on that list of seven, but if we were  —   there go hopes and dreams. ” On Saturday evening, a federal judge blocked part of the executive order, but that decision appeared unrelated to the elements of the ban that troubled sports officials. The most immediate effect may come in wrestling, given that one of the nations affected by Mr. Trump’s ban is Iran, which has long had a congenial relationship with the United States in that sport. Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump’s order. The United States freestyle wrestling team is scheduled to participate in a World Cup competition in Iran on Feb. 8. Steve Fraser, the chief   for U. S. A. Wrestling and a 1984   Olympic champion, said on Saturday that the president of Iran’s wrestling federation was scheduled to meet this weekend with government officials there in an attempt to make sure the Americans would still be invited to the meet. “There’s some nervousness by us that the Iranian government might say, ‘We can’t get visas to go there, so no Americans can come here, either,’” Mr. Fraser said. While Olympic boycotts have resulted from tense political differences between nations, opposing countries have also long found common ground on playing fields, on the track and in sports arenas. One of the most celebrated examples is the     diplomacy that helped foster the relationship between the United States and China in the 1970s. In wrestling, the United States, Iran, Cuba and Russia banded together in 2013 to persuade the I. O. C. to keep the sport in the Summer Games. American wrestlers and officials are warmly welcomed in Iran, and Iranian wrestlers compete regularly in the United States. They may be invited to meets in May in New York and in June in Los Angeles, Mr. Fraser said. There is uncertainty now, however, about whether they would be granted P1 visas, commonly known as sports visas, to compete. In 2014, Christina Kelley, the chief international ambassador for U. S. A. Wrestling, became one of the few women allowed into a wrestling arena in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. She said on Saturday that she was frustrated by Mr. Trump’s decision. “I don’t think our current president has any clue what the State Department and what sports diplomats and cultural exchanges do for our country and for the safety of our people around the world,” Ms. Kelley said. The ban on visitors from the seven nations  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   comes at a delicate time for the U. S. O. C. Los Angeles is seeking to host the 2024 Summer Games, and it will learn in September whether it, Paris or Budapest will get the Games. (There is some speculation that the I. O. C. will award the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles, but the U. S. O. C. remains committed to the bid for the 2024 Games.) David Wallechinsky, an American member of the I. O. C. ’s cultural and heritage commission and the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, said the election of Mr. Trump in November had hurt Los Angeles’s bid with I. O. C. delegates because Mr. Trump was perceived as being “    and  . ” “This is worse,” Mr. Wallechinsky said of the Muslim ban, adding, “I would consider it a blow to the Los Angeles bid  —   not fatal but a blow. ” At a meeting at the I. O. C. ’s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, several days after the American presidential election, Mr. Wallechinsky was asked repeatedly, “What is wrong with your country?” he said. He said he sought to assure I. O. C. officials by explaining that   of the voters in Los Angeles had voted against Mr. Trump, describing the city to them as a “a multicultural,   zone. ” The United States is expected to bid to host the world’s other major sporting event, the World Cup, in 2026. In June, Sunil Gulati, president of the United States Soccer Federation, told reporters that a Trump presidency could complicate an American bid, especially if it were a joint bid with Mexico, given Mr. Trump’s plans to build a wall across America’s southern border. “I think a   World Cup with Mexico would be trickier if Secretary Clinton isn’t in the White House,” Mr. Gulati said at the time, in a reference to Hillary Clinton, who lost the election to Mr. Trump. After Mr. Trump won the election, Mr. Gulati modified his remarks, saying, “It’s not going to dissuade us or persuade us to bid. ” International perceptions of the Trump administration “matter, for sure,” Mr. Gulati said, “but I think those will be developed in the months to come. ” U. S. Soccer said Saturday it would have no immediate comment as it examined Mr. Trump’s order. Many questions remained unanswered about the ability of a number of athletes to travel. Two N. B. A. players, Thon Maker and Luol Deng, were born in Sudan, one of the seven countries listed in Mr. Trump’s executive order. (Both, however, were born in Wau, now part of South Sudan, which gained its independence from Sudan in 2011.) Mr. Maker’s family fled Sudan when he was 5 and eventually settled in Australia. Mr. Maker, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, moved to the United States to play high school basketball in Louisiana, eventually moved to Canada and is an Australian citizen who holds a passport from that country. It was unclear how people with dual citizenship would be treated under the order. Mr. Deng, a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, has lived in the United States for 17 years. His family fled to Egypt when he was 5 to escape the Sudanese civil war. Mr. Deng came to the United States when he was 14 and attended high school in New Jersey, and he later became a British citizen. The N. B. A. also holds an annual Basketball Without Borders camp, and it is expected to be held in New Orleans during the league’s   weekend in February. While rosters have not been released, last year’s camp involved players from 25 countries, including Amir Reza   from Iran. Major League Soccer has two   players with familial ties to two of the nations facing bans. Steve Beitashour of Toronto has played for Iran’s national team, and Justin Meram of Columbus has played for Iraq. League officials were looking into the matter on Saturday. Mo Farah of Britain, who was born in Somalia and has won four Olympic gold medals on the track at 5, 000 meters and 10, 000 meters, is a   athlete coached by Alberto Salazar. Early Sunday morning Mr. Farah’s Facebook page had a post that, among other things, said: “On 1st January this year, Her Majesty The Queen made me a Knight of the Realm. On 27th January, President Donald Trump seems to have made me an alien. I am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years   working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home. Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome. ” Abdi Abdirahman, a   Olympian for the United States who finished third in the 2016 New York City Marathon, was also born in Somalia, and the race regularly attracts runners from around the globe. The 2016 race featured three runners from Iran, nine from Syria and one from Sudan in the field of about 50, 000 runners. “Our goal is always to recruit the world’s best and cleanest athletes, regardless of where they’re from,” Chris Weiller, a spokesman for New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon, said in an email. Jackie   a spokeswoman for track and field’s world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, said, “We clearly need to understand the implications of this new U. S. immigration policy and will be seeking assurances that it will not adversely affect” the sport’s world championships, scheduled to be held in Eugene, Ore. in 2021. Phil Andrews, the chief executive of U. S. A. Weightlifting, said officials were trying to figure out the impact of Mr. Trump’s ban on the world   championships, scheduled for November in Anaheim, Calif. and on the American team’s participation at a competition in Iran. “Our view is that politics and sport should be separate,” Mr. Andrews said, stressing sports diplomacy among nations. “We sincerely hope to peacefully welcome these seven nations to Anaheim this November. It is unimaginable to be able to host a true world event without their participation. ”"
"**Reports of the mass killing of civilians in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region ""would amount to war crimes"" if confirmed, the UN human rights chief has warned.**
Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in one town.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre.
Its officials have denied involvement.
Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"".
Mr Abiy said that fighters backing Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra, a town in the South West Zone of Tigray.
Witnesses blamed forces loyal to TPLF for Monday's killings - first reported by human rights group Amnesty International.
If confirmed, this would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the fighting between government forces and the TPLF which broke out on 4 November.
Getting information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down.
In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings.
It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident.
Ms Bachelet said she was ""alarmed"" about the situation in Ethiopia, but added that the ""first priority"" was to stop the fighting and prevent further atrocities.
There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state. The tension has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces.
Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen said on Friday that the military operation was going on as expected and would end ""in a very short period of time"".
He added that order had to be restored and ""criminals caught"" before dialogue was possible.
The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
Amnesty said the killings happened on the night of 9 November.
The human rights group said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"".
It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from.
It said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
Civilians were also killed in a government air strike in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, and in the city of Adigrat close to the border with Eritrea, Mr Debretsion told AFP.
""People are running in every corner. So the most important consequence of the conflict currently is displacement. Of course there are casualties, but we don't have the numbers. This is too big to manage,"" he added.

Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut.
There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed.
In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped.
Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders.
On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region.
I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.
As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible.

Ethiopia's prime minister said his forces had liberated an area that had been subject to ""gruesome and fatal attacks"" at the hands of the TPLF.
""Committing crimes and injustice is very normal for the greedy junta,"" Mr Abiy said in a Facebook statement.
Referring to army soldiers he said were shot when their hands and legs were tied, he added, ""the cruelty was heart-breaking"".
Mr Abiy's government later announced it had appointed Mulu Nega Kahsay as an interim administrator for the province as part of its efforts to oust the regional leadership.
His government has also issued arrest warrants for Tigray officials.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"".
He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.
There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray, with Mr Abiy saying government forces had made major gains.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, and ran Tigray.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
However, Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018, while the TPLF refused to dissolve and merge with the other three parties to form the Prosperity Party, as pushed for by the prime minister.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run, but they say they have been unfairly targeted.
The disagreement represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, served in the central government for long periods of time. Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea - but the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked.
Mr Debretsion has accused Eritrean forces of siding with Ethiopia. Ethiopia and Eritrea both deny this.
For his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority."

The history of economic thought is replete with examples of economic ideas that are politically attractive and persist even after they have little empirical support or theoretical validity. That has certainly been the case with the Phillips curve.



The Federal Reserve continues to incorporate the Phillips curve in its macroeconomic models even though the empirical evidence for a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment is weak at best. In a recent study by the Brookings Institution, the authors note that the Fed still relies on the Phillips curve as a “key factor” in setting its policy rate and as a “tool … to forecast what will happen to inflation when the unemployment rate falls, as it has in recent years” (Ng, Wessel, and Sheiner 2018: 1–2).



This article traces the history of the Phillips curve and argues that it is a poor guide for monetary policy. The underlying problem is that the Phillips curve misconstrues a supposed correlation between unemployment and inflation as a causal relation. In fact, it is changes in aggregate demand that cause changes in both unemployment and inflation. The Phillips curve continues to misinform policymakers and lead them astray.



In 1958, New Zealand economist A. W. Phillips published a landmark paper showing an inverse relationship between unemployment and the rate of change in money wages in the United Kingdom from 1861 to 1913. He also found that relationship persisted when the data set was extended to 1957 (Phillips 1958).



R. G. Lipsey (1960) provided further support for Phillips’s findings, as did Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow (1960), who coined the term “Phillips curve.” In their version of the curve, price inflation (rather than wage inflation) is plotted against unemployment. Using U.S. data for 1934 to 1958, they found a negative relationship between the rate of change in the average level of money prices and the level of unemployment. By viewing the Phillips curve as a “menu of choice[s] between different degrees of unemployment and price stability,” Samuelson and Solow opened the door for policymakers to believe they could fine‐​tune the economy by choosing a socially optimal point on the Phillips curve, at least in the short run (see Humphrey 1986:100–03).



Although Samuelson and Solow (1960: 193) stated that their analysis pertained to the short run, and that the shape of the Phillips curve could change in the long run, or the curve could shift, those caveats were largely ignored in the 1960s. There was a strong sense that the Phillips curve was stable and that there was a _permanent_ tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. That belief fostered the idea that mild inflation was beneficial in reducing unemployment. In such an environment, inflation increased from 1.2 percent in 1962 to 5.8 percent in 1970 (see Hall and Hart 2012: 62–64).



In his monumental _History of the Federal Reserve_ , Allan Meltzer, paints a succinct picture of the raise of the Phillips curve as a policy guide in the 1960s:



In a separate study of the Samuelson‐​Solow Phillips curve, Hall and Hart (2012: 63–64) note:



With high and variable inflation in the 1970s, reaching 13.5 percent in 1980, the Phillips curve lost its luster as both inflation and unemployment soared. Peter Ireland, a member of the Shadow Open Market Committee notes, “Despite the occasional appearance of a statistical Phillips curve relationship between inflation and unemployment in the United States data, the Federal Reserve’s efforts to exploit that Phillips curve led, during the 1970s, not to lower unemployment at the cost of higher inflation but instead to the worst of both worlds: higher unemployment and higher inflation” (Ireland 2019b: 5).



The stagflation led Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve, to proclaim before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in 1981: “I don’t think that we have the choice in current circumstances — the old tradeoff analysis — of buying full employment with a little more inflation. We found out that doesn’t work” (Volcker 1981: 28). Volcker’s war on inflation was not popular with many members of Congress, who continued to think that higher inflation could help reduce unemployment. However, he proved to be correct in arguing that lowering inflation and achieving long‐​run price stability would help calm markets and improve the prospect for growth in employment and output (see Steelman 2011: 3–4).



Milton Friedman (1968, 1977) and Edmund Phelps (1967) recognized that when inflation expectations are built into the Phillips curve, and individuals fully anticipate inflation, unemployment will settle at its “natural” level as determined by market forces, and the long‐​run Phillips curve will be vertical — that is, there will be no tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.



In his 1976 Nobel lecture, “Inflation and Unemployment,” Milton Friedman (1977) traced out three stages in the evolution of the Phillips curve. The _first stage_ featured the simple curve in Figure 1, showing a stable, negative relationship between inflation and unemployment.





The _second stage_ featured Friedman’s “natural rate hypothesis,” which he first described in his 1967 presidential address to the American Economic Association. In this stage, the short‐​run Phillips curve is adjusted for expectations and the long‐​run curve is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment (Friedman 1968). An unexpected increase in inflation initially reduces unemployment. However, once workers and employers fully anticipate higher inflation, they will revise their plans and unemployment will return to its “natural” level consistent with equilibrium real wages and the overall structure of the labor market.2



Figure 2 shows an increase in inflation from 0 percent to I1 temporarily reduces unemployment below its long‐​run “natural” level UN to U1, say from 4 percent to 3 percent. (No one knows for certain what the actual “natural rate of unemployment” is; it is not observable.) The movement from point _a_ to point _b_ on the initial Phillips curve (PC1) is posited on the assumption that the initial inflation rate is 0 percent. However, once the higher inflation rate is fully recognized by market participants, unemployment will return to UN and PC2 will become the relevant Phillips curve — provided expected inflation remains at I1. Points _a_ and _c_ now lie on the long‐​run Phillips curve (LRPC), where each point represents a state of full adjustment between actual and expected inflation. Thus, the long‐​run Phillips curve is vertical. As Meltzer (2009: 287) writes, “The long‐​run Phillips curve must be vertical because inflation is a nominal variable and unemployment is a real variable. Rational behavior require[s] that any influence of nominal variables on real variables last only as long as it takes markets to learn and adjust.”





The concept of “rational expectations,” first developed by John Muth (1961) and later elaborated upon by Robert Lucas (1987) and Thomas Sargent (1986), provided a strong theoretical case that there could be no tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment — even in the short run. Hence, under the rational expectations framework, systematic monetary policy can have no impact on relative prices, output, or employment. However, if wages and/​or prices are sticky and there are costs to acquiring information about job openings, and so on, then activist monetary policies can still have real effects — perhaps for a considerable time (see Humphrey 1986: 126).3



The _third stage_ in the evolution of the Phillips curve is the hypothesis that high and variable inflation plants the seeds for higher future unemployment by distorting relative prices and increasing “regime uncertainty,” thus producing a positively sloped long‐​run Phillips curve as shown in Figure 3 (adapted from Humphrey 1986: 108).4 As Humphrey explains:





Milton Friedman considered the possibility of a positively sloped Phillips curve, given the stagflation that occurred in the 1970s. Using inflation lagged one‐​half year (n 5 0.5), Friedman (1977: 461, Table 1) found that unemployment averaged 6.1 percent from 1971 through 1975 while inflation averaged 6.7 percent. His “tentative hypothesis” was that the positively sloped Phillips curve may be “a transitional phenomenon that will disappear as economic agents adjust not only their expectations but their institutional and political arrangements to a new reality.” He therefore thought that the natural‐​rate hypothesis would still hold in the very long run, but the “transitional period may well extend over decades” (Friedman 1977: 464–65).



Friedman (1977: 467) recognized that, during the transitional period, “increased volatility of inflation” can distort relative price signals and increase unemployment. Moreover, he believed that, “in practice, the distorting effects of uncertainty, rigidity of voluntary long‐​term contracts, and the contamination of price signals will almost certainly be reinforced by legal restrictions on price change” (i.e., wage and price controls).



During the Great Moderation, roughly from the mid‐​1980s until 2007, the transition to a more systematic monetary policy that implicitly followed a Taylor‐​type rule reduced the volatility of inflation and output compared to the stop‐​go monetary policy that preceded it (see Hakkio 2013). By anchoring inflation expectations and stabilizing the growth of nominal GDP (NGDP) around a trend rate of about 5 percent per year, the Fed improved its credibility and reduced regime uncertainty.



Jerry L. Jordan, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, described the atmosphere surrounding the Phillips curve during the last two decades of the 20th century:



The global financial crisis of 2008 ended the Great Moderation and ushered in a new wave of uncertainty associated with unconventional monetary policies. After more than a decade, the inflation rate has remained low despite historically low unemployment, a result that challenges those who continue to place faith in the Phillips curve’s credibility as a forecasting tool to guide monetary policy. As St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (2017) has stated, “the idea that unemployment outcomes are a major factor in driving inflation outcomes in the U.S. economy” cannot be substantiated by the data. “A more important determinant” appears to be “inflation expectations.” He goes on to say:



Even in the face of strong evidence for the flattening of the short‐​run Phillips curve (i.e., decreases in unemployment have a much smaller impact on inflation than in earlier periods), central banks are reluctant to omit it from their macroeconomic models.5 As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted in his April 6, 2018, speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, “Almost all of the participants [at the January 2018 Federal Open Market Committee meeting] thought that the Phillips curve remained a useful basis for understanding inflation.” Yet they recognized “that the link between labor market tightness and changes in inflation has become weaker and more difficult to estimate, reflecting in part the extended period of low and stable inflation in the United States and in other advanced economies” (Powell 2018: 6–7).



The real problem with the Phillips curve is not that it supposes that inflation and unemployment are related, especially in the short run, but that it misconstrues that relation as involving a direct causal influence of unemployment on inflation, and vice versa, when in fact it is changes in aggregate demand that cause changes in both unemployment and inflation. According to Mickey Levy, chief economist at Berenberg:



The Phillips curve is a distraction to the main function of a central bank — namely, to “prevent money itself from being a major source of economic disturbance,” as Milton Friedman observed in his 1968 presidential address (Friedman 1968: 12).



At a press conference following the Fed’s Open Market Committee meeting on June 14, 2017, Janet Yellen remarked: “We continue to feel that, with a strong labor market and a labor market that’s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are in place for inflation to move up” (Yellen 2017). Likewise, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell believes the Phillips curve “continues to be meaningful for monetary policy” even though the strength of the relationship between unemployment and inflation “has weakened” (Powell 2018).6



A few years earlier, in 2015, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Dennis Lockhart, in an interview with the _Wall Street Journal_ , stated:



A final example of how the Phillips curve continues to be treated by Fed officials as a useful guide to policy, even in the face of strong evidence during the last 20 years that the degree of unemployment is a poor indicator of inflation, comes from a working paper prepared by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board’s Divisions of Research & Statistics and Monetary Affairs in 2018:



All of the forgoing examples show that central bankers are not yet willing to discard the Phillips curve as a policy tool, even though the evidence for a downward sloping curve is meager. Indeed, as early as 2002, William Niskanen, a former member of President Ronald Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers, declared: “The concept of a Phillips curve should be considered empty when most of the variation in the data must be explained by shifts in this presumed relation. In any case, the Phillips curve proved to be a poor basis for forecasting and a worse guide to policy” (Niskanen 2002: 194).



Using annual data from 1960 through 2001, Niskanen found that “there is _no_ tradeoff of unemployment and inflation except in the same year,” and that “in the long term, the unemployment rate is a _positive_ function of the inflation rate” (Niskanen 2002: 198). During the 1970s, inflation and unemployment both increased, as the United States experienced stagflation, and since 2009, unemployment has turned sharply lower while inflation has remained low.



Nevertheless, the existence of even a transient and loose relation between inflation and unemployment provides policymakers with the illusory hope that they can exploit that relation to achieve desired policy goals. The idea that a little more inflation is desirable in return for a little less unemployment is appealing to both policymakers and politicians, both of whom are inclined to overemphasize the short run and discount the long run. That is why economic fallacies have a tendency to reappear, especially when politicians can win votes by resurrecting them. Protectionist rhetoric is one common example; the idea that a little inflation is a good thing is another.



Although the Phillips curve has been discredited, it is not really dead and so distracts from alternative ideas for conducting monetary policy that offer a better chance of achieving long‐​run price stability and promoting economic stability and growth. The still‐​lingering influence of circa. 1965 Keynesianism — with its emphasis on short‐​run remedies for long‐​run problems, its distrust of the market adjustment process, and its dismissal of the quantity theory of money — downplays the point, clearly recognized by F. A Hayek in 1960, that “the stimulating effect of inflation will … operate only so long as it has not been foreseen; as soon as it comes to be foreseen, only its continuation at an increased rate will maintain the same degree of prosperity” (Hayek 1960: 331). Hayek went on to criticize the myopic view of policymakers:



The Phillips curve gives policymakers a justification to try to fine‐​tune the economy, but it is a weak reed on which to base policy — and it fails to recognize the limits of monetary policy.7



Instead of relying on a flawed Phillips curve analysis to guide policy, Fed officials should focus on the underlying causes of both undesired changes in inflation and cyclical fluctuations in unemployment. In turn, the Fed’s dual mandate to achieve maximum employment and price stability, which is flawed by assuming a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, should be replaced by a single target, preferably keeping NGDP on a level growth path.8 Doing so would increase the credibility of monetary policy, reduce regime uncertainty, mitigate business fluctuations, and avoid stop‐​go monetary policy. Niskanen (2008: 377) argued that “the intent of Congress would be better served and monetary policy would be more effective if Congress instructed the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that reflects both their concerns in a _single_ target.” He did so because he clearly recognized the failure of forecasting inflation under a Phillips curve framework and, hence, the merits of a nominal income target over an inflation target (with the unemployment rate serving as a poor proxy for likely inflation).9



One benefit of a rule designed to keep nominal income on a steady growth path is that it bypasses the issue of assigning weights under the Fed’s dual mandate to achieve price level stability and maximum employment. All that needs to be done is to set a target path for the growth of nominal spending (i.e., the sum of real output growth and inflation). Market forces will then determine real growth.



Peter Ireland nicely summarizes the benefits of NGDP targeting over a problematic reliance on the Phillips curve as a guide to monetary policy:



As the sum of real GDP growth and nominal price inflation, NGDP growth conveniently captures, in a single number, the Fed’s performance in satisfying both sides of its dual mandate for maximum sustainable growth with stable prices. At the same time, however, NGDP, precisely because it is a nominal variable, measured in units of dollars, is under the central bank’s control in the long run.… Moreover, the Fed’s ability to regulate the growth rate of NGDP does not depend on the stability of the Phillips curve.… [I]n the current environment, where various nonmonetary forces may well be causing the very low rate of measured unemployment to overstate the true degree of resource utilization in the U.S. economy, focusing instead on the real component of NGDP growth guards against one of the risks alluded to in Powell’s remarks: a policy stance that becomes inappropriately restrictive out of concern for inflationary pressures working through a misperceived Phillips curve.



Finally, as noted by Tobin (1983) and McCallum (1985), the equation of exchange MV5PY identifies nominal income (PY) as a measure of the money supply (M) that gets adjusted automatically for shifts in velocity (V). Thus, analyses based on the behavior of NGDP growth provide a monetarist cross‐​check against mainstream Keynesian approaches, like Powell’s, organized around the Phillips curve instead. According to this monetarist view, interactions between trends in M, reflecting monetary policy actions that affect the money supply, and V, interpreted following Friedman (1956) with reference to the determinants of money demand, replace those between the actual and natural rates of unemployment as the key mechanisms determining inflation [Ireland 2019a: 52–53].



Congress should put the Phillips curve to bed and consider the case for a nominal GDP (or domestic final sales) target. One step toward that goal would be to add nominal GDP growth to the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections, a proposal first made by Jeffrey Frankel (2019: 461–70).



Instead of continuing to hold onto the discredited presumption of a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, policymakers should focus on the misallocative and distributive effects of activist monetary policy. The Fed needs to recognize that the Phillips curve is not a reliable policy compass. A monetary policy based on short‐​run activism, such as that implied by a “data‐​dependent” Fed, is not a good substitute for one based on a transparent, long‐​run strategy guided by a robust monetary rule. Policymakers should heed the advice of Hayek, who in 1975 wrote:



What we must now be clear about is that our aim must be, not the maximum of employment that can be achieved in the short run, but a “high and stable level of employment.” We can achieve this, however, only through the reestablishment of a properly functioning market which, by the free play of prices and wages, establishes the correspondence of supply and demand for each sector.



Though monetary policy must prevent wide fluctuations in the quantity of money or in the volume of the income stream, the effect on employment must not be its dominating consideration. _The primary aim must again become the stability of the value of money._ The currency authorities must again be effectively protected against the political pressure that today forces them so often to take measures that are politically advantageous in the short run but harmful to the community in the long run [Hayek (1975) 1979: 17].



It has been more than 40 years since Hayek made those recommendations for changes in the framework for monetary policy, yet we are still in search of a monetary constitution.10



The Phillips curve has diverted attention from the search for a monetary constitution and a rules‐​based regime by promoting the idea that central banks can use expansionary monetary policy to lower unemployment — and, hence, that discretionary policy is to be preferred to a rules‐​based regime. Macroeconomic models used by the world’s central banks still rely on the Phillips curve as a tool for their inflation forecasts, even though those forecasts have been unreliable.



Today, the United States has historically low unemployment while inflation has stayed at less than 2 percent for more than a decade. Those facts alone should convince policymakers that the Phillips curve is a poor guide for monetary policy.

1 In an endnote, the authors suggest: “The diagrams for the sub‐​periods in Phillips’s paper might also have alerted Samuelson and Solow to the fact that the Phillips curve relation only seemed to be stable under fixed exchange rates which helped to anchor inflation expectations” (Hall and Hart 2012: 69, n.7).



2 For a more detailed description of the adjustment process from an unanticipated increase in nominal aggregate demand, see Friedman (1968: 100–11; 1977: 456–57). Friedman gives credit to Edmund S. Phelps for his groundbreaking work in developing the natural rate hypothesis, for which he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2016 (see Phelps 1967, 1968).



3 Friedman (1968: 11) estimated “that the initial effects of a higher and unanticipated rate of inflation last for something like two to five years; that this initial effect then begins to be reversed; and that a full adjustment to the new rate of inflation takes … a couple of decades.” The adjustment process would be faster, he said, in countries experiencing “more sizable changes” in the rate of inflation.



4 Robert Higgs (1997) coined the term “regime uncertainty,” which he used to refer to the uncertainty caused by fiscal and regulatory policies that attenuated private property rights by decreasing expected returns on capital. In the case of a discretionary government fiat money regime, moving to a monetary rule would help reduce uncertainty about the future value of money and improve the climate for making private investment decisions (Dorn 2018, 2019).



5 Stock and Watson (2019: 1) find that the slope of the Phillips curve (measured by the change in inflation relative to the change in the unemployment gap), has gone from 20.48 in 1960–83 to 20.26 in 1984–99, and to 20.03 in 2000–2019Q1, which is not statistically different from zero.



6 By “weakened,” Powell means the slope of the Phillips curve has flattened: large decreases in unemployment have not had much impact on inflation. The rate of unemployment has gone from 10 percent in October 2009 to less than 4 percent today, while inflation has remained relatively low at less than 2 percent per year.



7 On the limits of monetary policy, see Friedman (1968), Plosser (2014), and Dorn (2001).



8 On the case for an NGDP target, see Sumner (2014); Selgin, Beckworth, and Bahadir (2015); and Beckworth (2017). Earlier proponents include Gordon (1985), McCallum (1989: chap. 16), and Meltzer 1989). Niskanen (1992: 284) favors targeting nominal domestic final sales (NDFS) and argues that keeping nominal demand on a stable growth path is superior to a “price rule” and a “money rule.” Unlike a price rule (e.g., inflation targeting), “a demand rule.… does not lead to adverse monetary policy in response to unexpected … changes in supply conditions.” Even more important, a demand rule, unlike a money rule, “accommodates unexpected changes in the demand for money” (i.e., in the velocity of money). See also Frankel (2019: 464–65).



9 On Niskanen’s ideas for reforming the monetary framework, see Selgin (2017).



10 On the search for a monetary constitution and stable money, see Yeager (1962); Dorn (1987); and White, Vanberg, and Köhler (2015).

Donald Trump’s upset victory over Hillary Clinton last night is bound to stir up fears of instability and uncertainty in East Asia, a region that was almost entirely ignored during the campaign. Commentators have rushed to predict that Trump’s campaign rhetoric will turn into reality: the United States will pull back from East Asia, and China will take advantage of the ensuing chaos to seize geopolitical dominance of the region. This morning James Palmer at _Foreign Policy_ writes, “Chinese leaders near me in the palatial complex of Zhongnanhai are surely cracking open the drinks.” This is a pretty scary vision of the future. However, such assessments, which focus solely on Chinese benefits, don’t take into account the complex nature of U.S.-China relations.   
  
President Trump is by no means a clear victory for China. The uncertainty created by his victory could easily produce an economic and geopolitical climate that damages Chinese interests. For example, three of the seven points in Trump’s Plan to Rebuild the American Economy mention policies that would hurt the U.S.-China economic relationship: labeling China a currency manipulator; bringing trade cases against China in the World Trade Organization; and imposing tariffs in response to “illegal activities.” Igniting a trade war with China would pose a severe risk to China’s economy, which is already slowing down. Trump’s stated policies would likely deepen China’s economic woes, thereby increasing the domestic instability that Beijing is obsessed with avoiding, especially in the lead-up to the 19th Party Congress in late 2017.



  
  
In the realm of geopolitics, Chinese gains in the conventional balance of power resulting from a reduced U.S. commitment to traditional allies could be offset if other regional states turn to nuclear weapons. America’s regional partners have started to improve their conventional self-defense capabilities, but it will take a good deal of time and money to get their militaries to the point where they can resist Chinese coercion without U.S. help. With this in mind, and given the recent nuclear saber rattling by North Korea, if Trump starts shedding U.S. alliance commitments then partners may turn to nuclear weapons to defend themselves.   
  
Japan would likely be the first country to develop a nuclear weapon in such a scenario. Its limited conventional capabilities create a pressing need for a deterrent if the United States would not come to its rescue, and its highly-developed nuclear energy program makes it relatively easy for Japan to acquire the materials it would need. It would still take a good amount of time for Japan to develop such weapons. For example, a 2006 article by Jeffrey Lewis at the Arms Control Wonk blog suggested a timeframe of 3–5 years. If Japan goes down this road, there is a chance that neighboring countries, such as South Korea, would also push for their own nuclear weapons. While Japan would face enormous resistance to nuclear weapons development, support for having nuclear weapons among lawmakers has increased in recent years in response to growing tension in East Asia. A nuclear-armed Japan is completely anathema to Chinese security interests, and would be a serious setback for China’s geopolitical position in East Asia.   
  
While this analysis is almost purely speculative at this point, there is a case to be made that the Trump administration will not be as good for China as many commentators have suggested. China could reap some benefits from a United States occupied with domestic political turmoil and a president that disdains alliance commitments. However, the economic and geopolitical uncertainty that could be unleashed by his victory should curb Beijing’s enthusiasm. As Isaac Stone Fish recently stated in _Foreign Policy_ _,_ “the Chinese elite seem to prefer Trump’s opponent because they feel she would be better … [for] global stability, which remains of great importance to Beijing.” The officials in Zhongnanhai should save those drinks for another day.

Share this...FacebookTwitterBecause the data behind the man-made global warming hypothesis is turning out to be so frail and flakey, we often hear the proponents claiming “97% of climate scientists agree that man is now driving the climate” as an argument.
Never mind the 97% figure is a bogus one to start with.
Whenever the data basis underpinning a theory is a shambles, then claims of consensus among experts are often the last go-to argument in a bid to salvage the theory. This is not only true in climate science, but also in the science of nutrition and heart disease.
Dr. Tim Noakes has posted a video on the horrible misconceptions involving the once highly ballyhooed high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. For some 40 years 99% of the experts claimed the diet was good for our hearts and health. Saturated fat was villainized by junk science cranked out by a less-than honest-vegetable oil industry.
So what does Tim Noakes think of consensus in science?
At the 10:16 mark we hear something us man-made global warming skeptics can truly relate to (and AGW proponents can’t stand hearing). It’s why the argument of “consensus among experts” is in fact just the last gasp of a dying scientific theory and so must never be accepted. He tells his audience:
So, these are consensus guidelines. And you must never trust consensus guidelines because they are anti-science. Science is not about consensus; it’s about disproof, disbelief and skepticism. It’s not about consensus. When you have consensus, you got trouble.”

Of course there are are some not-so-bright readers out there who will claim that a few lumps of sugar does not disprove “climate science”. Of course it doesn’t. But what it does show, however, is that consensus among scientists does not make the science right – no matter how broad it is. Scientific consensus is often totally wrong. This we now seeing in the case in the high-carb, low-fat diet, and it it is also becoming clear that it is also the case with CO2 and climate.
Just think for a moment of all the major factors warmists currently deny within the science itself, everything from the models being wrong, the 18-year pause, the sun’s impact on climate cycles, the oceanic cycles, the Medieval Warm Period, etc.
Also in the case of climate science, “follow the money”.
Also do note that despite the overwhelming evidence and huge success of Dr. Noakes in treating obesity, there continue to be the stubborn diehard stalwarts of the old theory – desperately clinging to it to the very end. It doesn’t matter what massive evidence gets presented to them, they’ll continue denying, denying, denying.
Myself I can confirm what Dr. Noakes professes. I’ve been on a low-carb, high-fat diet for some one and half years and have seen a huge difference in health.

"We all know the stereotype: silly millennials, tethered to their phones, unable to accomplish the simplest tasks without scrolling their Instagram feeds, snapping their friends   tweeting inanely. But a Nielsen report released last week shows that Americans from 18 to 34 are less obsessed with social media than some of their older peers are. Adults 35 to 49 were found to spend an average of 6 hours 58 minutes a week on social media networks, compared with 6 hours 19 minutes for the younger group. More predictably, adults 50 and over spent significantly less time on the networks: an average of 4 hours 9 minutes a week. Sean Casey, the president of Nielsen’s social division, said the finding initially surprised him because “the going thought is that social is vastly owned by the younger generation. ” “It’s kind of synonymous,” said Mr. Casey, who wrote the foreword to the report. “When you think of millennials, you think of social. ” Mr. Casey, 46, said that eventually, the finding started to make more sense to him. “At a time when we wanted to be connected, it came out right when we were at the top of our media consumption,” he said. “It’s become second nature to our generation. ” The finding underscores how ubiquitous the smartphone has become. The report, released on Jan. 17, found that in the United States, 97 percent of people 18 to 34, and 94 percent of people 35 to 49, had access to smartphones.   percent of those 50 and older used smartphones, the report found. The   report was based on data from 9, 000 smartphone users and 1, 300 tablet users across the country from July through September. The data was not  . The report also broke out which social networks were most popular on smartphones, finding that Facebook still dominated on mobile, with about 178. 2 million unique users in September. It was followed by Instagram, with 91. 5 million unique users Twitter, with 82. 2 million unique users and Pinterest, with 69. 6 million users. Snapchat, a favorite of younger users, was sixth on the list, behind the professional networking site LinkedIn. Finally, the report looked at   activity on social media, measuring how many times Facebook and Twitter users employed those sites to post about programs they were watching or to interact with others’ posts. Again, in this category, it was Generation X that could not look away from its devices: On an average day, the report found, 42 percent of those interacting with television on Facebook were from 35 to 49 only 40 percent were millennials."
"Could Scotland benefit from having an independent electricity system? Our report published this week found that it could – if it meant Scotland paying for (and benefiting from) its own renewable energy, without having to pay for the expensive UK nuclear power programme recently agreed south of the border. The Scottish government has committed itself to a target of meeting all its electricity demand from renewable energy by 2020. It has also refused to allow new nuclear power stations to be built in Scotland. The problem for a nuclear-free Scotland is two-fold. First, Scotland faces the prospect of having to pay not only the high and increasing price for nuclear power – the “strike price” required to persuade French utility giant EDF to build Hinkley Point C nuclear power station – but also its share of UK’s renewable power subsidies. Second, it seems unlikely that the UK government will now fund much in the way of offshore renewables around Scotland. On the other hand, Scotland has made strong progress in deploying renewable energy in the country, with onshore wind in particular adding to biomass combined heat and power, some solar and hydro-power capacity. We project that by 2018, the earliest plausible date that the market could be restructured to allow Scotland greater electricity independence, around two-thirds of the Scottish government’s renewable energy target will have been met. The issue would then be whether it would be cost-effective for Scotland to finance the other one-third of the target while not carrying the burden of paying for nuclear power. We calculated what a renewable energy programme controlled and paid for by Scotland would cost, if its government paid incentives for renewables broadly similar to those the UK government offered for nuclear power. Under the UK’s Electricity Market Reform (EMR) programme to be phased in from next year, nuclear power receives very long, 35-year premium price contracts, while renewable projects have just 15-year contracts. Scotland could offer 20-year premium price contracts to developers, as is the case under the current Renewables Obligation that the EMR scheme will replace. Renewable energy projects could also be offered loan guarantees, as is offered to those investing in nuclear power. Contracts would also be offered to independent developers, whereas – at the moment – premium price contracts under EMR are only available to major electricity companies. That would lead to more projects for the same price. If these techniques were employed, onshore wind could be financed for around £76/MWh compared to the £92.50/MWh offered for Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant from 2023, when it is due to come online. On the basis of these prices we estimate that if the UK government arranged for three, twin-reactor nuclear power stations to be built, the increased prices to all consumers from the nuclear and renewable programmes combined would be around 10.4%. In contrast, the cost to Scottish consumers would be an extra 7.2% to meet Scotland’s renewable electricity target. However, these increased prices would be paid only for 20 years, while in the rest of the UK the price increases associated with funding nuclear power would last some 35 years. If the UK built just Hinkley C and Sizewell C the price increases for all low-carbon sources would be 8%, or 5.6% if only Hinkley C is built. Although this calculation assumes that onshore wind is used to meet the bulk of the remaining elements of the target, the Scottish government would have discretion to fund some offshore renewables, for example tidal stream projects. However that would entail increasing prices for consumers beyond 7.2% or backing away from the 100% renewable target. There are other, more fundamental changes that an independent Scotland could make other than just independently managing its low-carbon incentives and regulations. In theory it could, for example, have different system operators run its electricity grid. Scotland could join the Scandinavian Nordpool system to utilise Swedish and Norwegian hydro reserves, as is done by Denmark. This would involve building an interconnector to carry power to and from Norway, which would take time. Otherwise, to avoid having to spend a lot of money on gas power stations as back-up, Scotland would have to negotiate with the rest of the UK some shared method for assuring there is sufficient capacity to cope with the fluctuating nature of renewable energy. Using the same System Operator – National Grid – in both countries would be easiest, and this is politically straightforward, but restricts the degree to which Scotland would have a genuinely independent system. The Scottish government itself, in its White Paper has preferred continuing with a shared System Operator. Yet the Scottish government foresees the UK will continue to fund Scottish renewables while excusing Scotland from paying for its nuclear power. In practice, the politics may demand that Scotland choose either to pay for its own new renewables, or share all the UK’s costs."
"A: No, we are opposed to pollution.
Pollution is the transfer of unusual or harmful matter or energy to another person’s property without their consent. Thus I should not allow smoke, ash particles, industrial effluent, noise, noxious gases, bad smells or light from my property to annoy anyone else unless we have negotiated an agreement.
Burning of carbon fuels has been part of the natural cycle of the earth since the first plant was set on fire by the first lightning strike. All the products of burning natural carbon fuels are easily and beneficially absorbed by the atmosphere, dissolved by rain and go to fertilise the soil.
However there are some emissions that are annoying or dangerous in concentrated amounts, for example nitrous oxide, hydrogen chloride, sulphur dioxide. And others such as soot and ash that are not so dangerous, but visible and annoying. Bush fires produce all of these, but usually not in troublesome amounts.
Burning coal or oil in power stations can produce continual pollution in a small area, so modern clean plants remove almost everything from the emissions except water vapour and carbon dioxide, which are disseminated into the atmosphere via a tall stack. These two are normal beneficial atmospheric gases not pollutants. Taking them out of the emissions would be a silly and very expensive exercise for no benefit.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis morning, even here in the North German lowlands, close to sea level, snow fell as temperatures hovered near the freezing point.
Currently many Germans are struggling under snow, ice and cold as winter terminates spring for the time being. The cause: a low pressure centered over the Baltic Sea pumping in cold polar air through Europe.

Winter transforms Germany’s Thuringia Forest into a winter wonderland today. Massberg webcam photo 11.07 a.m.
Newsite Thuringia Antenne here writes that winter has returned and will stick around for awhile, reporting of icy roads, accidents and cold. Meteorologist Dominik Jung of www.wetter.net forecasts 5 to 10 cm of snow across wide regions of Germany, especially Bavaria and Thuringia.

The Rheinbrücke at Rees had to be closed for over an hour and a half early this morning due to accidents from icy conditions, the RP Online reports here.
Sub-zero temperatures were recorded at a number of weather stations throughout Germany this morning.
In the northeastern state of Saxony Bild national daily reports by video of a snow chaos as travelers struggle with an “enormous snow mass” as roads become impassable from the snow and snow plows are unable to keep up. The snow is expected to stay at elevations over 400 – 600 meters, wetter.net reports.
Much of Europe is forecast to remain cold at least for the next 7 days, as the following chart shows negative temperature anomalies:

 In his viedo forecast from this morning, meteorologist Jung says for now, “Spring is nowhere in sight.”

I’ve spent the Christmas/New Year period listening to podcasts and looking to see some parallels between the recent UK election and New Zealand politics.



The video posted above is a great example of where Labour went wrong.



Basically Labour didn’t listen to what was obvious as the problems voters were seeing and experiencing. Consequently, they provided solutions to problems most people don’t rate as important.



The major point is that people’s values are being ignored all for the sake of diversity and the minority. A strong leader in the National Party would pick up on this and run with it. A sensible caucus would recognise that too. The pity is that they currently don’t and it seems that their plan is to be as much like Labour as possible.



Politics is about action and reactions. Sitting in the middle afraid to ever upset anyone is a recipe for a long term in opposition.



Politicians need to realise that the **shouty types on Twitter and Facebook** **are not the majority** of the population **.** The left-wing is susceptible to listening to them, but National is falling for the trap too. They set up a troll army to hound the left-wing on Twitter. It is controlled and operated by Todd McClay and his right-hand man outside of parliament. They are very vocal and are actually operating in the same way as the nasties from the left on Twitter.



Labour in the UK had their Twitter proxies, celebrities and pundits all leaping around the country lobbying and hectoring. One prominent exponent was Owen Jones who has a record of being wrong almost as bad as Martyn Bradbury. Just a few short weeks after the massive loss, Owen Jones is still talking up a storm of doom and gloom. It’s nice to think we will have another five years of lefty moaning. I am in favour of him campaigning, even more, as he reminds everyone why they hate the whinging left.



  
[Chris Trotter posted](https://bowalleyroad.blogspot.com/2019/12/if-you-want-to-know-why-clinton-and.html) this video at Bowalley Road that also explains brilliantly why the candidates and parties of the Left keep on losing to the Right.



What both of these videos also highlight for me is how much our NZ version of the MMP electoral system gets in the way of resolving voter’s needs, wants and desires. The mere fact that losing parties can end up ‘winning’ through coalition negates the will of the primary party. The refrain of pro-MMP activists was to look at two elections that badly showed that the majority will of the people was thwarted by FPP. Those elections were [1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_New_Zealand_general_election) and [1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_New_Zealand_general_election). Both of those elections saw National win despite scoring less votes. Now we have had 2017 and the leading party left out of government. This has caused resentment and as such it creates a situation in NZ not dis-similar to the Brexit situation, where **people feel disenfranchised and powerless.**



The problem for National, of course, is that they lack partners that they previously relied upon to govern. It is simply a pipe dream to believe that Simon Bridges will achieve that which failed John Key, a majority government. John Key always enjoyed a net positive popularity rating, Simon Bridges is yet to even get a zero score, mired in deeply negative territory. Only Jim Bolger has managed to surmount that, in 1990, and under FPP. **Those conditions simply cannot occur under MMP** , and they certainly won’t occur with an unpopular leader.



So, in summary, the conditions for a backlash exist, but our system prevents truly wonky results. National needs to get smart, let Labour pander to intersectionality and inclusiveness along with the climate change fraud, and **create a real point of difference for voters.** More of the same just ensures there is no compelling reason for the middle to swap sides from Labour.

Page 12 of the new New Zealand [teachers’ resource](https://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/content/download/168449/1243903/file/Climate%20Change%20Learning%20Programme%20%E2%80%93%20Teacher%20Resource.pdf) for child indoctrination has this conclusive experiment for children to learn about the evils of man-made CO2 and the greenhouse effect. 



Our resident _BFD_ ex-science teacher has posed some questions and further experimentation for the brighter students for homework:



Repeat the experiment at home at night.



3\. Does the temperature increase in the jar?  
4\. If not, why not?  
5\. Why does the jar heat up more in the day than at night? 



On the tiny scale of a jar (even a jar ten metres tall), the infrared absorption effects of carbon dioxide are too weak to be measured using just a thermometer. This is true even if the jar is filled with pure carbon dioxide. There are other reasons why this experiment proves nothing at all, but this is the main one.



If you heat an enclosed jar with a lamp, (or the sun) the thermometer inside the jar will indeed heat up relative to the air outside the jar, but this is because the air inside the jar is trapped and cannot mix with cooler, surrounding air. But this has nothing to do with the Earth’s “greenhouse effect”, however. (Yes, it does describe why a plant greenhouse is warmer inside, though.) But, obviously, the earth and the atmosphere around it is not a closed system like the jar.



Will teachers with a brain be prosecuted if they refuse to take part in this charade?

Share this...FacebookTwitterYou gotta wonder what President Obama will be thinking when he visits the northern city of Hanover later today. Ironically the US global warming president may be confronted with snow tomorrow morning as he gets set to pitch further steps with regards to TTIP and global warming to Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Temperature anomalies of more than -10°C are forecast to hit many areas of Europe in the days ahead.
A blast of polar air is now super-cooling the European continent and delivering unusual late April snows and frosty conditions even down in the lowlands, where the German city of Hanover is located.
“Wintershock”
The online SVZ daily here warns “Winterschock: In Germany the snow is back. Ice cold polar air delivers snowfall and storms.”
German weekly, Stern, writes at its online newsite: “Experts even advise putting the winter tires back on” and warns of icy streets in the lowlands by Monday morning! The Stern clip calls the snow for this time of year “unusual”.

High profile meteorologist Joe Bastardi tweeted: “rest of April in Europe.. about as cold as it can get this late.”
Online Bild here bears the headline: ” Polar air frosts the spring away– and will stay!”
The DWD German national weather service reported that the temperature at the Lower Saxony Brocken summit (1140m) was -5°C just some 100 or so kilometers away from Hanover, where President Barack Obama is scheduled to arrive to open up the Hanover industrial trade show.
Al weather forecasts agree that the bitter cold will persist through much of the week. Experts warn of frost damage to blossoming plants.
To be fair, much of far eastern Europe and Russia are enjoying warmer than normal spring weather, and so we do not want to give readers the impression that the Europe cold means the globe is cooling. Such a trick, after all, is the kind of stuff the global warming alarmists routinely resort to. Remember how back around New Year’s the media and alarmists were jumping up and down, hollering that the North Pole was melting – trying to make us think it was all because of global warming? In fact that was just the reverse of what is happening in Europe right now. And never mind that snow was supposed to become “a thing of the past” even in the dead of winter.
Moreover the euro-warmunistas are now claiming that snow and cold we are seeing today has happened before at this time of year and thus is normal and we should not be surprised if it happens from time to time. But that’s just the point: our weather is no longer supposed to be “normal”. Climate change supposedly has changed all that. Yet there we have it: snow in late April, just like 100 years ago, back when that sort of thing used to happen once in a blue moon as well. Nothing (except the media reporting) has really changed that much.

"The Morrison government’s Great Barrier Reef envoy, Warren Entsch, has urged fellow Liberal MPs to do more on climate change policy, including pushing for greater global action, after the world heritage site suffered a third mass bleaching event in five years. In a report to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, Entsch said climate change was having a growing impact on the reef and was unequivocally its greatest long-term threat. He said he feared that programs to address greenhouse gas emissions might be dropped as the government rationalised spending in response to the Covid recession, and called for it to take another path.  The northern Queensland MP said Australia did great work in protecting the reef from local threats and was globally recognised as “the best reef managers in the world”, but the country’s record on climate change fell “short of attaining similar levels of prestige”. “We must recognise that these two elements go hand-in-hand – that is, the actions we continue to take in water management initiatives are definitely worthwhile pursuits, but they can only do so much,” he said. “By the turn of the century, these actions in isolation – while entirely valiant – will be all for nought if the world has not also effectively limited anthropogenic warming.” Entsch said the Covid-19 recovery would be a mammoth undertaking, with all aspects of government funding likely to be under review, but policies and programs that dealt with climate change were of great importance and should not be deemed “less essential”. “While I agree that we need to shore up the economic situation and lead a growth-oriented response, I believe that in doing so we must not accept a scaled-back response to climate change,” he wrote. “If anything, it should be greater.” Entsch told Guardian Australia he had “a very strong view that we can do better” on climate. He said he agreed with people from across the spectrum who believed Covid recovery was a unique opportunity for policy reform, and called for bold ideas that went beyond the “politically safe and expedient” and that would “propel us forward in this brave new world”. “Whether it’s overhauling taxation and fiscal federalism, a faster transition to renewables, reviewing the viability of fossil fuel subsidies, increasing support for low emissions industries and perhaps even reconsidering the nuclear moratorium – the list goes on,” he said in the report. “There’s plenty of policy areas that are inefficient and ripe for generational change. In developing our vision for a post-pandemic Australia, I believe absolutely everything must be on the table.” The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority confirmed in March that the natural landmark had suffered an unprecedented third mass coral bleaching in five years. It followed a government-backed assessment last year downgrading the reef’s outlook to “very poor”. About half the 2,300km reef system’s shallow-water corals bleached and died in 2016 and 2017 following inflated temperatures. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found published evidence suggested a majority of tropical coral reefs would disappear even if heating was limited to 1.5C and would be “at very high risk” at 1.2C. The globe has warmed about 1C since the industrial revolution. Entsch was appointed special envoy for the reef after the 2019 election. He acknowledged in the report that he was talking to the wrong minister – that Ley was not responsible for emissions reduction policy – but said this did not absolve him “of the need to raise this important issue” with her. He would also “continue to make representations on the subject” to the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor. He said Australia’s action on climate would not on its own make an appreciable difference to global temperatures but it was part of a group of countries, each responsible for less than 2% of global emissions, that together released about 40% of the gases warming the planet. “If any country in this cohort should seek to abdicate responsibility for their fair share, others may be inclined to do the same, bringing about what is known as a ‘prisoner’s dilemma’, ultimately resulting in suboptimal emissions reductions,” the MP for Leichhardt said. “I believe it is incumbent upon us as custodians of this great natural wonder to protect it. In doing so we must work with other parties to the Paris agreement, encourage greater ambition to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and ensure warming is limited to well below 2C. “Without sufficient action we risk the long-term sustainability of the reef, the economic value it provides our nation and the 64,000 jobs that rely upon it.” Guardian Australia asked Ley and Taylor for the government’s response. Ley said Entsch was doing “an outstanding job” in working with communities and stakeholders on the reef, and had highlighted the importance of investing in the environment and “maintaining strategies to reduce global emissions”. “That is exactly what we are doing,” she said, listing funding for environmental science programs, national parks upgrades, native species bushfire recovery, reef protection and the $2bn climate solutions fund. Australia has a 2030 target of cutting emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels, less than what scientists say would be its fair share in meeting the goals of the Paris agreement. It has rebuffed calls for it to join other countries, businesses and Australian states in setting a goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. National emissions were largely flat in the six-and-a-half years under the Coalition before the Covid-19 pandemic shut down significant parts of the economy, but fell slightly in the most recent greenhouse accounts. The Australian Marine Conservation Society applauded Entsch’s advocacy for the government doing more on global heating. Reef campaigner Elise Springett said: “As custodians of our reef, Australia must lead and advocate for a climate-focused recovery, pulling our weight in the global effort to combat climate change.”"

Earlier this afternoon in the Rose Garden, President Obama celebrated the ratification of the Paris Agreement. I had this to say in response:   




President Obama was a bit less than candid in his speech about the adoption of the U.N.’s Paris Agreement. Using realistic assumptions about role of carbon dioxide in climate change, the Agreement will prevent 0.1 to 0.2°C of global warming by the year 2100, not the inflated figure the U.N. gets by assuming all warming since the Industrial Revolution is caused by human emissions of carbon dioxide. Few, if any, climate scientists would defend that. It also assumes that emissions will—without the Paris Agreement—increase much faster than the average increase used in climate simulations. In reality, the UN’s own Climate Panel states only that carbon dioxide is causing more than 50% of the warming observed since 1950, not 1800. Further, the switch from coal to natural gas for electrical generation has already invalidated the UN’s assumptions about the growth of atmospheric carbon dioxide.   
  
  
He is also a bit optimistic about China, which has said it will stop increasing carbon dioxide emissions “around” 2030. This is exactly the time that researchers in Obama’s own Department of Energy said, in 2011, that their emissions would level off due to their maturing economy, and without any explicit policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, best known as “business as usual.”

"**Vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there, a top UN official said.**
""Shortages of basic commodities such as flour and fuel are being reported,"" Catherine Sozi, UN country director in Ethiopia, told the BBC.
Fighting in Tigray between the federal government and a regional force broke out eight days ago.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed as fears of an escalating conflict grow.
Long-standing tension between Ethiopia's federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state, boiled over into military clashes last week.
The Ethiopian government has also carried out airstrikes on military targets in Tigray.
As a result of the fighting at least 7,000 civilians have crossed the border into Sudan. They fled either the fighting itself or the fear of attack and there are concerns that many more have been forced from their homes but are still living within Tigray.
Al Sir Khalid, a commissioner for refugees in Sudan's Kassala state, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that some of those fleeing had walked for two or three days to escape ""bombardment"", and that they included Ethiopian soldiers.
The UN supplies at least 600,000 people in Tigray with food relief on a regular basis and ""assistance... is bound to be interrupted if the supplies are not restocked and if movement is not permitted"", Dr Sozi told the BBC's Newsday programme.
Given that banks are closed in Tigray, she also warned of cash shortages affecting people's ability to buy food.
But the UN is committed to staying ""as long as our security can be reassuredâ¦ we will go on as long as stocks are not exhausted"".
Getting information from the region is hard as roads have been blocked, the internet is down and telephone lines have been cut.
But in a tweet on Thursday, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said his government was providing assistance in the areas of Tigray controlled by the federal army. This could not be independently verified.
Both the federal government and Tigrayan authorities are scaling up efforts to mobilise resources indicating that the conflict may go on for some time, the BBC's Kalkidan Yibeltal reports from the capital, Addis Ababa.
On Wednesday, Tigrayans were told by the TPLF to ""defend"" themselves from ""flagrant aggression"" from the federal government.
Demonstrations and blood donation campaigns have also been held by groups in other parts of Ethiopia showing their support for the federal army.
The government is sounding confident and has urged Tigrayan forces to surrender. The prime minister has tweeted that the west of Tigray has been ""liberated"" but again this cannot be verified.
Defence Minister Kenea Yadeta said it would not be long before the TPLF leaders were on trial. He also talked of appointing an interim administration in areas taken by federal troops.
Parliament has voted to strip dozens of MPs from Tigray of their immunity from prosecution.
The TPLF was the most powerful member of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018 on the back of anti-government protests.
Relations got worse last year after Mr Abiy - who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade conflict with Eritrea - dissolved the ruling coalition, which was made up of several ethnically based regional parties.
He merged them into a single, national party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption, and say Mr Abiy is an illegitimate leader, because his mandate ran out when he postponed national elections due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run.
The row worsened in September after the TPLF defied the nationwide ban on elections, and held a vote which was declared illegal by the central government."
"**Ethiopia's prime minister has said a military operation against rebel forces in the northern Tigray region is entering its ""final phase"".**
Abiy Ahmed said a three-day deadline given for Tigray's forces to surrender had now expired.
Hundreds of people have reportedly died in nearly two weeks of clashes between the rebels and the federal army. At least 27,000 people have fled to Sudan.
The UN has said a ""full-scale humanitarian crisis"" is unfolding.
Getting information from Tigray is hard as there is a virtual communications blackout.
Fighting broke out on 4 November after Ethiopia's central government accused the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party which controls Tigray, of holding an illegal election and attacking a military base to steal weapons. The TPLF has denied the attack.
In response, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive against forces loyal to the regional government of Tigray, accusing them of treason. He said that ""the last red line had been crossed"".
The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing Mr Abiy does not have a mandate to lead the country after postponing national elections because of coronavirus.
Ethiopia said its forces are marching on Tigray's capital Mekelle after making major military gains, and accused Tigrayans of destroying bridges en route to the city. The Tigrayans say they are defending the town of Alamata, which lies on the road north to Mekelle.
In a Facebook post, Mr Abiy said the operation by the federal forces was nearing a conclusion.
""The final critical act of law enforcement will be done in the coming days,"" the prime minister said.
He thanked TPLF fighters who, he said, had taken advantage of the deadline to switch sides but he did not give a number.
And Mr Abiy added that his government was ""ready to receive and reintegrate our fellow Ethiopians fleeing to neighbouring countries"".
Meanwhile, TPLF adviser Fesseha Tessema, a former Ethiopian diplomat, told the BBC that civilian sites in Mekelle were being bombed by federal forces.
""[The people of Tigray] haven't done anything wrong, they are in their own homes, churches,"" Mr Fesseha said.
The federal government has denied targeting civilians and said that air attacks are aimed at the Tigrayan military.
The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, has said that ""a full-scale humanitarian crisis is unfolding"" and thousands have been fleeing the fighting.
The agency was ""on stand-by to provide assistance in Tigray when access and security allow"" spokesman Babar Baloch said.
""There may be massive displacement inside Tigray and that is of course a concern and we try to prepare the best way possible,"" Jens Laerke, spokesman of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said.
The UN fears the numbers fleeing Ethiopia may be just a fraction of those forced from their homes by the fighting, but for the moment aid agencies have no access to the Tigray region.
Regional powers Kenya and Uganda have called for negotiations to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
The Ethiopian government has, however, ruled out talks with the TPLF.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed.
Human rights group Amnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) on Monday last week.
Mr Abiy has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings. The TPLF has denied involvement, saying it will welcome an independent international investigation.
Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate.
The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms.
Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join.
The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea.
The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority."

The Don does not muck about. If rules and regulations are hampering progress, then ditch the rules and regulations. Especially if the progress is being hampered by unwarranted worrying about climate change.



Federal agencies would no longer have to take climate change into account when they assess the environmental impacts of highways, pipelines and other major infrastructure projects, according to a Trump administration plan that would weaken the nation’s benchmark environmental law.



The proposed changes to the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Act could sharply reduce obstacles to the Keystone XL oil pipeline and other fossil fuel projects that have been stymied when courts ruled that the Trump administration did not properly consider climate change when analyzing the environmental effects of the projects.



According to one government official who has seen the proposed regulation but was not authorized to speak about it publicly, the administration will also narrow the range of projects that require environmental review. That could make it likely that more projects will sail through the approval process without having to disclose plans to do things like discharge waste, cut trees or increase air pollution.



The new rule would no longer require agencies to consider the “cumulative” consequences of new infrastructure. In recent years courts have interpreted that requirement as a mandate to study the effects of allowing more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. It also has meant understanding the impacts of rising sea levels and other results of climate change on a given project.



The act requires the federal government to prepare detailed analyses of projects that could have significant environmental effects, including long-term impacts that courts have said include climate change. Since 1970, when the law was enacted, it has undergone only one major change. That was in 1983, when the White House Council on Environmental Quality limited the use of worst-case scenarios in project reviews.



But the Trump administration has been aggressive in its efforts to roll back environmental regulations. The 50 or so pages of revisions that the Council on Environmental Quality is expected to make public on Wednesday would not amend the act itself. Rather, they would revise the rules that guide the implementation of the law.



Compare and contrast with New Zealand and the recently released Productivity Commission report.[ _Local government funding and financing_](https://www.productivity.govt.nz/).



A new, challenging and growing pressure on local government funding comes **from climate change in particular, the threats from sea-level rise and more frequent and extreme weather events.** The most direct threat for councils is climate-induced damage to local government infrastructure such as roads and bridges, and stormwater, wastewater and flood-protection assets.



Councils are responsible for planning and regulating development on at-risk land. **They therefore have an urgent and important role in reducing future climate risk exposure** and long-run adaptation costs. Councils must resist pressure for risky development, and deal with property owners who shun talk of retreat and demand councils invest in hard defences against sea-level rise and flooding. 



New Zealand’s laws and institutions acknowledge the risk from climate change, and **require local governments to plan for the approaching and rising hazards it will cause.** Yet, a significant shift in policy thinking and implementation is needed to deal with the nature of climate risk **even though how climate risk will unfold is very uncertain.** In contrast, much thinking and practice is still dominated by assumptions that risks are unchanging. 



Here, we are busily tying ourselves up in unnecessary worry, planning for and attempting to avoid something that the even Productivity Commission states has considerable uncertainty about it.



… even with the best available science, **deep uncertainties** exist about the course of climate change and the damage it will cause.

"Humans use their eyes constantly while communicating with others. Eye movements can be gestures, so that when we see someone glance to the side, we look in the same direction. Eyes can also be a warning to others: when pictures of eyes are on display, it encourages generosity and has been said to discourage antisocial behaviour such as theft. The thought of someone watching us is enough to change our behaviour, and as social creatures we are constantly aware of our actions in relation to others. Jackdaws are also social animals and our research suggests that they too communicate with their eyes.  Jackdaws, a member of the corvid family that includes crows, rooks, ravens and jays, forage, roost and nest in groups. Interacting with one another is an essential part of their daily lives, but it also encourages competition. Because jackdaws rely on natural cavities for breeding, they fight to secure this limited resource. Even when a jackdaw has claimed a nest cavity, other jackdaws will approach and try to take over. How can a breeding pair prevent jackdaw competitors from taking over their nests? It seems that their eyes act as an early warning signal to put off any would-be usurpers. Jackdaws are best known for their incredible cognitive abilities. Their use of tools, memory skills and social behaviour rival those of the great apes, but what makes jackdaws stand out amongst their corvid relatives is their ability to track and respond to human eye movement and follow the path of another’s gaze – something even primates fail to comprehend. They have bright blue eyes that can be seen staring out from within tree-holes, chimneys or nest boxes.  Lots of animals have been known to respond fearfully to eyes because the eyes resemble predators. So what makes jackdaw responses to human eyes so special? Jackdaws respond to very subtle movements of human eyes and can even follow them to locate hidden food. Like humans, jackdaws have very conspicuous eyes, whereas most of their corvid relatives (and indeed 90% of perching birds) have dark eyes. Perhaps sharing this feature with humans makes jackdaws particularly responsive to their eyes. But, until now, there has been no evidence to show that jackdaws use their bright eyes to communicate with each other. The question of whether jackdaw eyes are important for nest defence began at Cambridge University’s Comparative Cognition Lab. When aviary-housed jackdaws were inside their nest boxes, their eyes were very visible against the dark background, and nest box owners stared out of their box most when competitors were nearby. To test whether the bright eyes were an effective deterrent against nest competitors, it was essential to understand the behaviour of would-be intruders when faced with these bright eyes. If having bright eyes helps ward off competitors, jackdaws scouting out potential nest sites would be more cautious of nest boxes displaying bright eyes than nest boxes displaying a jackdaw with dark eyes instead of bright eyes. Using jackdaw nest boxes of the Cambridge and Falmouth Jackdaw Projects, the role of eye colour and brightness in nest defence was investigated. During the pre-breeding season when jackdaws prospect potential nest sites, one of four circular images was suspended at the entrance hole within the nest boxes to give the appearance of something inside.  The first image was a jackdaw face with normal bright eyes, the second image was a jackdaw face, but with dark eyes. The third image was jackdaw eyes only (to test whether eyes alone were enough to frighten away intruders), and the fourth was a black circle to serve as a control. A hidden camera filmed for 2-3 hours to capture the reactions jackdaws had to the images when investigating nest sites. When the jackdaw face with dark eyes or the image with eyes only was on display, jackdaws approached as though there was nothing there. But when the jackdaw face with bright eyes was in the nest box, jackdaws approached much less. They also spent less time on a perch closest to the entrance hole when either image with bright eyes was on show. This demonstrated that bright eyes in jackdaws have an important function: to warn others that a nest is occupied and to stay away. This is the first demonstration that members of the same species outside of the primate lineage can communicate with their eyes. This exciting finding in jackdaws prompts further interest into the function of coloured eyes in birds. Jackdaws’ ability to communicate in this way is the first evidence that bright eyes could act as signals in the bird world. It is unknown whether all birds that nest in cavities tend to have bright eyes more than dark eyes. An even more intriguing question is whether jackdaws, or indeed other birds, use their eyes to communicate in ways other than as warning signals. This is a question that warrants further exploration.

"The leads have dried up in the killing of a young woman in Queens  during a jog last summer. Tips about potential suspects have gone nowhere. A reward has failed to bear fruit, even as it has swelled to over $280, 000. And the samples of a stranger’s DNA found on the hands, throat and cellphone of the jogger, Karina Vetrano, 30, did not match those in national offender databases. But the authorities say that the recovered DNA could hold the key to solving the case if state officials authorize what is called familial searching, which allows investigators to search criminal databases to identify likely relatives of the offender. The technique, which has been used more than a dozen times in the United States over the last 10 years, represents a frontier in the evolving world of forensic science. While some methods, like microscopic hair testing and   matching, have been challenged in recent years, DNA testing remains a staple of forensic investigation, used to both identify suspects and exonerate the wrongfully convicted. Familial searching allows investigators to search offender databases with wider parameters to identify people who are likely to be close relatives of the person who may have committed a crime. Law enforcement officials say a hit in the database is less a piece of evidence than it is a lead, and such matches have helped solve some heinous crimes in states where the practice has been authorized. But the method raises some complicated ethical issues that have trailed the expansion of DNA technology since its introduction. And as the collection of DNA grows in the private sector, so do the concerns about its potential misuse, particularly in the hands of government institutions. Problems at some laboratories, including the New York City medical examiner’s office, have highlighted how DNA evidence is not immune from human error. A 2013 review of more than 800 rape cases processed by the medical examiner’s office found that DNA evidence was mishandled in dozens of cases. In the case of Ms. Vetrano, who the police say was sexually assaulted and strangled,  lack of progress led Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, to push for familial searching. “The Police Department reached a point where they exhausted all their leads. And they came to us and said in essence, ‘What else can we possibly do? ’” Mr. Brown said in an interview. Mr. Brown and two of his deputies, Eric Rosenbaum and Robert J. Masters, said that Ms. Vetrano’s case presented an ideal situation for using familial searching, in part because of what they say is the high likelihood that the DNA is from the perpetrator. “It is a stranger rape case,” Mr. Masters said. “In the annals of law enforcement, there are few fact patterns that are more frightening. ” The New York State Commission on Forensic Science, a   panel appointed by the governor to develop standards for forensic laboratories, and its   DNA subcommittee will hold a meeting next month on whether to authorize the technique. Familial DNA searching was pioneered in Britain, helping in 2002 in what was believed to be the first conviction using the technique. In 2008, California became the first state in the country to authorize the testing, and Colorado followed a year later. It has now been used in at least eight other states. California has solved seven cases using familial searching, a spokeswoman for the state’s Justice Department said. One was the   Grim Sleeper case in Los Angeles. A serial killer preyed on vulnerable women and eluded identification for decades until investigators matched crime scene DNA to the killer’s son, whose DNA was in an offender database. “You’ve got a serial murderer or rapist in your community  —   you sit on your hands and wait for him to get in your database or do you try something?” said Mitchell R. Morrissey, an early proponent of the testing and a former district attorney in Denver. In New York, efforts to authorize such testing through the Legislature went nowhere several years ago. A compromise that allowed the authorities to use partial DNA matches automatically generated in the course of routine investigations has proved ineffective. But Ms. Vetrano’s case  —   along with the public pleas of her father, Philip, and his    work with the Police Department and elected officials  —   has   the push for familial searching. Critics of the technique say that regardless of its potential for success, it expands the use of DNA databases beyond their original intent. They fault it for allowing for searches of people who happen to be related to someone who has committed a crime, and say that given the composition of the offender databases, familial searching disproportionately affects blacks and Hispanics. “You’re creating a database of suspects largely defined by their race and class,” said Stephen Mercer, the chief attorney of the forensics division of the public defender’s office in Maryland, which outlawed the technique in 2008 in the face of these concerns. “That is just so fundamentally against our core values. ” The District of Columbia has also prohibited these searches. Leads provided by familial DNA have resulted in errors. A filmmaker in New Orleans was told that he was a suspect in a murder in Idaho based on a DNA sample given by his father years earlier as part of a   genealogy project. Ancestry. com, which had purchased the database from a nonprofit that had collected the DNA, was required by a court order to identify the man to the police. The man was cleared after his DNA  —   which he gave under a court order  —   was tested. Since then, Ancestry. com has made the database private and has not received any other requests from law enforcement officials for health or genetic information about an Ancestry member, a spokesman for the company said. The spokesman, Brandon Borrman, said the company would comply with such a request only if legally required. Proponents of the technique said the filmmaker’s case could have been handled differently DNA samples of potential suspects can be retrieved surreptitiously, from a discarded soda can, for example. But in some cases, that hasn’t been a ready option. Investigators chasing the   BTK serial killer in Wichita, Kan. compelled a hospital to turn over a sample of the suspect’s daughter’s DNA she had recently undergone a Pap test. That sample allowed the police to acquire an arrest warrant for the man, Dennis Rader. Mr. Rader later was sentenced to more than 170 years in prison after pleading guilty to 10 counts of   murder. The legal implications of familial testing, namely whether it is limited by the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches or the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, have not been tested in the courts, Erin E. Murphy, a law professor at New York University, said. She said the logic that law enforcement officials rely on to support familial testing should, by extension, support the testing of other government databases, which include repositories of DNA from members of the military, forensic personnel and crime victims. But such testing would most likely face wider opposition. “Familial searching is just an   around these debates,” said Professor Murphy, the author of “Inside the Cell: The Dark Side of Forensic DNA. ” “You shouldn’t have fewer civil rights because you’re related to someone who broke the law. ” A spokesman for Mr. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said it would be premature to answer questions about whether the office would seek to search other databases. If the DNA subcommittee and the New York State forensic commission vote to approve familial searching after the meeting on Feb. 10, a   period for public comment will follow. The Legal Aid Society and the New York Civil Liberties Union have both filed memos with the commission that question the method’s constitutionality as well as the commission’s authority to weigh in on the matter. Many law enforcement officials around the state said that any   in civil liberties were minor compared with the potential to solve some particularly difficult cases. “Invasion of privacy is basically what law enforcement does. We do it legally. We do it with warrants, court orders,” William J. Fitzpatrick, the Onondaga County district attorney and a proponent of the technique, said. Mr. Fitzpatrick, who is a member of the state forensic commission, compared the method to a tip from an informant. “You’re telling me that if I have a scientific piece of evidence that shows me a perpetrator’s son is in prison  —   what’s a better lead?” In New York City, the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, and the district attorneys from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island, support authorizing the method. Mr. Vetrano acknowledges that the testing may not lead to his daughter’s killer, but he said he would continue to advocate its use. “This would have been left as a dead issue unless I started making waves,” he said. “I’m the squeaky wheel and I will never ever stop. ”"

"Growing up in north-eastern Ohio, Kimberly Byce spent much of her childhood running around in the woods, with the greatest threat being mosquito bites or sunburn. She can’t remember her parents ever uttering the word “tick”. And yet, in adulthood, disease-laden ticks now blight her family’s life. Byce’s husband Trent Beers has been struck down by Lyme disease twice in the past year, initially misdiagnosed after suffering back pain so bad he couldn’t emerge from bed, drenched from night sweats and his mind a fog of confusion. Their sons Arbor, four, and Abbott, seven, were struck down by raging fevers initially thought to be related to coronavirus, but subsequently confirmed to also be from Lyme disease. The family has been ravaged by the tiny black-legged, or deer, ticks, a creature the size of a pinhead that can carry Lyme disease and other maladies. Byce picked two of the ticks off her body last week, part of a regime that has become a constant worry in the family’s semi-rural household, located about 30 miles north-east of Columbus, Ohio’s capital. “It’s really wearing on the kids, when they are in the back yard I’m spraying them like a maniac which is kind of putting a lot of fear into them,” Byce said. “I feel like some of their carefree childhood is being taken away but there’s the threat of a lot of damage. What’s scary is that I am the most diligent person with spraying, keeping to trails, being careful, checking for ticks. If I can get them on me, anyone can.” That Byce could, in her lifetime, go from never even hearing about the warmth-loving ticks to fretting about them from as early as February each year is a possible symptom of a warming climate that, scientists say, is helping push ticks northward and westward from their traditional ranges in the US north-east. Cases of Lyme disease, a potentially debilitating condition primarily transmitted by black-legged ticks, have doubled over the past two decades to about 30,000 cases a year in the US. These ticks have spread into the upper reaches of New England and the midwest, while other tick species normally found in warmer southern states, such as the longhorned tick and lone star tick, are now popping up in New York and New Jersey. Infections may now spread further, ironically, due to restrictions imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. National parks and hiking groups have reported huge booms in the number of people seeking to break the monotony of lockdown by heading to walking trails, risking contact with ticks that latch on to people as they brush through vegetation. “We know tons of people checking out new trails and parks because they have no other options,” said Byce. “If you don’t know what to look for in tick areas, it becomes problematic.” The clearing of forest for housing and other infrastructure is bringing humans into closer contact with animals that carry disease, such as ticks. Meanwhile, rising temperatures are allowing ticks to become active earlier in the year and then feed deep into autumn, giving them a better chance of surviving winter. While ticks usually target animals such as deer and chipmunks, humans can unwittingly become hosts for their blood meal. “It’s a nightmare scenario,” said Felicia Keesing, a professor of biology at Bard College who has co-authored research linking the heat of the climate crisis to greater tick activity. “We are seeing more tick-borne diseases in more places. Wherever you find ticks, they are spreading.” Keesing lives in upstate New York and has recently noticed more nearby hikers than she can ever remember in the past. Her region has had Lyme disease for decades but is now being assailed by a brew of new bacteria-based diseases carried by ticks, including anaplasmosis, which can cause fever and chills, and a rare but “frightening” condition called Powassan virus, which can be fatal. “We are getting new pathogens from the old ticks, as well as new ticks moving up from the south with new conditions,” she said. A friend of Keesing’s recently fell ill and was tested for coronavirus, only to ascertain, through a chance conversation with Keesing, that she probably had a tick-borne disease instead. A test came back positive for Lyme disease and Keesing’s friend is now on antibiotics, concerned that she may suffer from the longterm effects of muscle aches, fatigue and mental fogginess that can bedevil patients for years. “With this Covid pandemic some people have the impression that bacteria is easy to treat with antibiotics and that viruses like coronavirus are the real threat,” said Keesing. “But not all bacteria are easy to treat, which Lyme sufferers are acutely aware of. We need to do a better job of preventing tick-borne illnesses and diagnosing them quickly, too.”"
"Fire, flood and plague. Toilet rolls and mental health. Injections of bleach and sunlight. For a studied introvert with a writer’s routines, the duty of social isolation is reassuring. In such a tumultuous year I realise I’m extremely lucky to be a homeowner, securely employed and gifted with – as well as the baby boomer years – certain contraband privileges of whiteness.  With all that luck, it may seem hard-hearted and selfish of me to insist on telling you what I’ve missed out on so far in 2020. Not just the fear of missing out, you understand, but the actuality. What might have been: In late February I had planned to be part of a small group of people visiting a remote beach on the south coast of Western Australia to continue reuniting an Aboriginal creation story and song with its landscape. Our group would be comprised of Noongar traditional owners – people descended from those that first created human society in this part of the world – and staff from two conservation groups, Gondwana Link and South Coast Natural Resource Management. The story had been transcribed by a linguist who’d passed through nearly a hundred years ago. The son of the linguist’s informant son would be with us. One of the stolen generations, he hadn’t heard the story, but he knew of the song that accompanied it: a pack of hunting dogs bursts from the trees. They leap through flames and roll into the sea. Swimming with burnt and stumpy limbs, they raise their heads and bark. See how it goes? The dogs weren’t destroyed, they were transformed. There was fire in the story and song we carried and, at the same time, fire was raging all around the nation and a ferocious local heatwave banned all vehicle movement in paddocks and bush. So that trip was cancelled. We made new plans, vowing that nothing less than a pandemic would stop us. It did. A few of us had visited the site before, relying on hints from the linguist and his informant along with a few scattered memories of where the story belonged. I remember a little over half a dozen of us walking to the far corner of the beach’s sandy smile. Sheltered just beyond the calm sea’s reach, a fishing net had rolled itself up into a rocky crevice and filled with sand. Some birds had made a nest. “Oystercatcher” is their common name, “Kooran-kooran” in Noongar language; you often see them quick-stepping along the ocean’s edge. I hadn’t realised it was a nest but, as we got closer, we saw the young birds staring back at us even as we crouched and spoke to them. Someone reached out a hand. Too young to fly, the birds skipped away along the rock sheet and disappeared between rocks in the shallows. They’re very good at hiding. Opportunistic, too; their parents made that curious, hybrid nest near the base of the very slope down which the flaming dogs rolled. The sandy dunes either side of the headland were crowned with a thin layer of crumbly, red rock. It might have been evidence, or memory, of fire. A boulder, half-buried at the edge of those dunes could have been a seal, one of those that didn’t make it, arching upwards in its death throes. We scanned the ocean, looking for live seals. In that old story, in that very landscape, a man lit a fire that began in a circle around his errant dogs on the hilltop, then marched down the slope to the sea. It was a very controlled fire. Controlled is not a word you’d use to describe Australia’s 2020 bushfires, our wildfires. They howled and devoured like fiery beasts themselves, they incinerated and razed. Mallacoota looked like hell: gloomy red-tinted light, broiling clouds of smoke and people scrambling into rescue boats to escape the flames. It’s tempting to think of 2020’s floods and fires and pandemic as retribution. Many of the world’s creation stories – myths – feature punishment of sinners (blasphemers, heathens, infidels, deviants; all those others) so that the “righteous” and chosen can lead the way. Perhaps. Or perhaps the “righteous” might be the very same ones who led us into this mess in the first place. Then again, Australia – as the late great poet Les Murray informed us – is all drought and fire and flood. “We’ll all be rooned,” wrote another Australian bard. Complacency and fatalism won’t help. Our crisis is not just because of flood and fire and Covid-19. The quality of our leadership as of late 2019 may help explain it. Don Watson expresses it best, with his straight-talking distrust of “weasel words”. Our leaders are generally “duck-shovers and deadbeats, incompetents, and cowboys” who comprise “a bunyip aristocracy … besotted with power, sectional interest and the dogmas of economic rationalism”. In addition – and I go beyond Watson’s words now – our society scoops profit from quarries and prison-industrial complexes, builds border forces against refugees, is stingy with the homeless and battered and mentally ill, and only begins to value public institutions of health, education – and, indeed, of democracy itself – when our dependence on them becomes obvious. We have the facts. Despite the quibbling and distractions, we know that climate change contributes to environmental disasters like fire, and diseases such as Covid-19. We also know climate change is caused by the damage we have done to the interlocking, natural systems of the miracle that is our planet. I don’t wish to the deny the dangers and suffering of 2020 so far but I’d like to think that good may yet come. Global greenhouse gas emissions fell over the time of virus lockdown. Away from the screens and hustle there was often a relative calm, a lack of crowds, a change of pace. Rearrangement of transport and work protocols came under consideration, and cycling became more popular. We reflected on the importance of family and friends, noticed the birds. There are new heroes, and new ideas of what and who is “essential”. We cheer health workers, rely on teachers and carers and have, as Watson writes, “fallen for the scientists, the knowledge flowing on our screens, the honest reasoned arguments and, no less, the varieties of genuine humanity we have been seeing. The citizenry has sprouted heroes.” After the fires but before the pandemic, Thomas Keneally hoped for a change in the national response to climate change. Riffing on the relationship between fire and many Australian plants, he said the fires might “germinate” action. A veteran of an earlier deadly virus reminded us that Covid-19 might give us the chance to “take the best possible advantage of new opportunities while preserving and extending the principles of Australian social democracy that have served us so well”. That same social democracy has turned its back on immigrants, international students, casual workers, universities, tourism, the arts. Unprecedented times? The fires have gone but they’ll be back. The virus lingers, ready to flare up again. I began thinking about this essay in late May, on Sorry Day in Reconciliation Week. “In this together” was the theme. Our leaders mouthed similar phrases. An Aboriginal site in the Pilbara was blasted into nothingness. A single plait of hair from 4,000 years ago, woven of strands of hair from several different ancestors, was as good as unravelled and cast to the wind. One expert compared it to the destruction of sacred artefacts by Islamic State. A man in the US repeated the exact words – “I can’t breathe” – earlier used by David Dungay in Australia. Both were killed by law-enforcement officers. Both knew racism and imprisonment. The proportional incarceration of Aboriginal people is even higher than African Americans in the US. A 20th century poem by Jack Davis about a prison death has the refrain, “A concrete floor, a cell door, and John Pat.” Since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody 30 years ago there are now more than 430 more Aboriginal names that could be inserted at that end-of-the-line. Racism burns like a pox and a plague, and is incubated at the centre of how we live and organise ourselves. We’re not all in it together. It’s probably not a matter or a tweak or mere adjustment. A vaccine might do it. Reconstructive surgery? Can such a thing ever be minor? I began with an Aboriginal story of fire. The award-winning book The Biggest Estate on Earth tells us that in Aboriginal stories, “the tone is theological, the teaching ecological”: A mobile people organised a continent with … precision … They sanctioned key principles: think long term; leave the world as it is; think globally, act locally; ally with fire; control population. They were active, not passive, striving for balance and continuity to make all life abundant, convenient and predictable. Fire was used to shape the landscape in order to “channel”, “lure” and “persuade” resources to gather at places of easy access. A “rich spiritual life” and “time spent nourishing the mind” produced a “voluminous and intricate” art. Aboriginal heritage and the natural environment need to be at the centre of any national reconstruction. In A Rightful Place: Race, Recognition and a More Complete Commonwealth, Noel Pearson says there are three parts to our “national story”: Aboriginal cultural heritage, the inheritance of British institutions and our multicultural achievement. Put it like this: Aboriginal cultural heritage is a major denomination in this country’s currency of identity and belonging. It includes the experience of racism. For most of our shared history, its classical form has been denigrated and almost destroyed, along with its connection to a descendant community. It needs investment and fair rates of exchange. At the same time, I have some respect for the western canon and Sir Francis Bacon’s words that any currency, like shit, is “of very little use except it be spread”. And my little group from the beginning of this essay? Aboriginal-led, we want to regroup and share our blossoming heritage with the region’s wider community, who, to judge by their Kukenarup memorial and efforts at land rehabilitation, are trying to come to terms with their own part in our shared history. It might be a model of reconciliation for the nation. However, the denigration and attempted destruction of Aboriginal heritage and the trauma, turmoil and disempowerment of its community are connected. While there’s potential for healing and a transformed relationship in processes of consolidating and sharing a pre-colonial heritage, the neoliberal context of dog-eat-dog and the primacy of the market means there’s also plenty of opportunity for a community to be split and to destroy itself over brokerage rights. So here’s another fact: it’s hard to reconcile and restructure without respectful, supportive infrastructure. We need the Uluru statement, and a Voice. • This essay will be part of the anthology Fire, Flood and Plague, edited by Sophie Cunningham and published by Penguin Random House in December"

From Washington State University: Closing the Case on an Ancient Archeological Mystery
Solving 4,000-year-old mystery helps WSU archeologist find useful resource for a warmer future

PULLMAN, Wash.–Climate change may be responsible for the abrupt collapse of civilization on the fringes of the Tibetan Plateau around 2000 B.C.
WSU archaeologist Jade D’Alpoim Guedes and an international team of researchers found that cooling global temperatures at the end of the Holocene Climatic Optimum, a 4,000 year period of warm weather, would have made it impossible for ancient people on the Tibetan Plateau to cultivate millet, their primary food source.
Guedes’ team’s research recently was published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Her results provide the first convincing explanation for why the area’s original inhabitants either left or so abruptly changed their lifestyles.
They also help explain the success of farmers who practiced wheat and barley agriculture in the region 300 years later.
Unlike millet, wheat and barley have high frost tolerance and a low heat requirement, making them ideally suited for the high altitudes and cold weather of eastern Tibet. Guedes argues this made the two crops an important facet of subsistence immediately after their introduction around 1700 B.C.
“Wheat and barley came in at the opportune moment, right when millets were losing their ability to be grown on the Tibetan Plateau,” Guedes said. “It was a really exciting pattern to notice. The introduction of wheat and barley really enabled Tibetan culture to take the form it has today, and their unique growth patterns may have played a crucial rule in the spread of these crops as staples across the vast region of East Asia.”
One offshoot of the research: The ancient millet seeds that fell out of cultivation on the Tibetan Plateau as the climate got colder might soon be useful again as the climate warms up.
“Right now, these millets have almost become forgotten crops,” Guedes said. “But due to their heat tolerance and high nutritional value, they may be once again be useful resources for a warmer future.”
An archaeological enigma
At Ashaonao, Haimenkou, and other archeological sites in the Tibetan highlands, researchers for years had noticed a growing trend. An abundance of ancient wheat and barley seeds found at the sites suggested the crops rapidly replaced millet as the staple food source of the region during the second millennium BCE.
The findings were puzzling considering that the scientific consensus of the time was the region’s climate would have actually favored millet, due to its shorter growing season, over wheat or barley.
The conundrum intrigued Guedes so she dove into the agronomy literature to investigate. She found agronomists tended to use a different measurement than archaeologists to determine whether crops can grow in cold, high altitude environments like the Tibetan Plateau. They used total growing degree days or the accumulated amount of heat plants need over their lifetime rather than the length of a growing season.
“My colleagues and I created a new model based off what we found in the literature,” Guedes said. “It revealed that global cooling would have made it impossible to grow millet in the Eastern Tibetan Highlands at this time but would have been amenable to growing wheat and barley. Our work turned over previous assumptions and explained why millet is no longer a staple crop in the area after 2000 BCE.”
Guedes’ work points to climate cooling as the culprit behind the collapse of early civilization on the Tibetan Plateau. Ironically, the region is today one of the areas experiencing the most rapid climate warming on the planet. There are some areas in the southeastern plateau where temperatures are 6 degrees Celsius higher than they were 200 years ago.
Rapid temperature increase is making it difficult for the region’s inhabitants to raise and breed yaks, a staple form of subsistence in the central Asian highlands, and grow cold weather crops, once again endangering their survival.
“So now we have a complete reversal and climate warming is having a big impact on the livelihood of smaller farmers on the Tibetan Plateau,” Guedes said.

"Some winter nights when my heart is tight, I take the F train from work to stand on the sidewalk in front of the   window at Lucali, the famed, candlelit pizzeria on Henry Street in Brooklyn, and watch Mark Iacono make pizza. His movements are slow, deliberative. They resemble a jungle cat, grooming. The dough moves back and forth in his hands, slowly growing in circumference. Iacono barely looks at it. He looks at the people in the dining room, though his gaze is   unfocused. His   is a meditation.   should be a meditation. I go home and make pizza. On other suffering evenings, I walk down the echoing corridors and ramps of Grand Central Terminal and make my way to a stool in the Oyster Bar for a pan roast. I like the cherrystone version better than the oyster one and, especially, the rich interplay of the clam juice and the cream, the way it soaks into the toast points floating in the center of the bowl. I do not make pan roasts at home. Pan roasts should be made only in the steam kettles of the Grand Central Oyster Bar. But I do make clam chowder, and I float toast points on top of it, and that is what John Cheever called a triumph over chaos, every time. Lately I’ve been doing both, at once:   pizza, a balm against the pain of the world. It was probably Frank Pepe who invented the clam pizza, in New Haven, scattering freshly shucked littlenecks onto a round of dough, then pecorino cheese, garlic, oregano, black pepper and a torrent of olive oil. That was in the 1940s, according to his family, which still operates Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana on Wooster Street there. Clam pizza moved south in the decades that followed, to New York City. Lombardi’s put one on the menu. Franny’s made one, makes it still. Otto. Motorino. Moto. Most recently, Pasquale Jones. Some are built on the Frank Pepe model. Franny’s omits cheese altogether. Moto adds potatoes. Motorino’s is dressed with fior di latte mozzarella in addition to the clams. They are all the best pizza. Clams are on them. Quibble all you like, but a clam pizza is the very best pizza in the world. My recipe honors no one particular preparation of the pie. It honors all of them, and the teachings of Iacono and the Oyster Bar as well. It uses as sauce the building blocks of a classic clam chowder  —   alliums slowly fried with bacon, then infused with clam juice and wine, reduced to a glaze and thickened with cream  —   and tops it with chopped clams, lemon zest and a spray of hot pepper flakes. I spread these elixirs across homemade pizza dough, a recipe I learned from another pizza guru, Anthony Falco, until recently the pizza czar at Roberta’s in Bushwick. But you could use them on   dough and still have a good pizza. Or on slices of sourdough bread, or an old running shoe. Just work slowly as you make it, being present in the moment of creation. Cooking is a practice, a kind of devotion, a form of mindfulness. Practice. Recipe:   Pizza"
"When it comes to climate change, professional cycling faces something of a paradox. The sport is, on one hand, the high-performance version of a climate-conscious form of transit and exercise; governments and activists have long promoted the climate benefits of bike riding. Yet at the same time, elite cycling has a hefty carbon footprint and has long been the brand-washing vehicle of choice for major polluters.  This week, a group of climate-minded Australians gathered via Zoom to mark the launch of their response to how cycling will adapt as the climate crisis intensifies. An Adelaide-based collective, Fossil Free SA (FFSA), is commencing a new campaign, #BreakAwayFromGas. It hopes to pressure the organisers of the Tour Down Under, the first race on the World Tour calendar each January, to drop the naming-rights sponsor Santos, a major oil and gas producer.  “This is a very prestigious event, and one that we support and cherish as South Australians,” says Jim Allen, a spokesperson for the movement. “But it has a cosy relationship with a fossil fuel company, which is seeking a social licence for climate destructive activities.” For Allen and his peers, concerns about Santos’s long-standing sponsorship heightened in recent years as extreme weather conditions took their toll on the TDU. “The irony of the race being vulnerable to global warming, having to make radical changes to adapt, and yet being sponsored by Santos, that really resonated for us,” he says. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, race organisers were forced to modify or shorten stages due to extreme temperatures. This year, the race route went through bushfire-hit areas. After winning a stage, Sam Bennett described the scenery as “something out of a film about the end of the world.” FFSA is not the only organisation to highlight the problem climate change poses to elite cycling. In January, the Australian Conservation Foundation and Monash’s Climate Change Communication Research Hub published a report, Vicious Cycle: Climate Change, Extreme Heat and the Tour Down Under. It painted a bleak picture. “With global warming on track to exceed 3C, the future of elite cycling is grim without serious action to reduce climate emissions,” says Suzanne Harter, a climate campaigner at ACF. “Cyclists are canaries in the coalmine of elite sport in a warming world – they are directly exposed to increasing heat and extreme weather.” In a joint statement, the TDU and Events SA, a state government body which owns the race, said: “The support and partnership of Santos for this event each year generates millions of dollars of economic benefit and hundreds of jobs for the City of Adelaide and state of South Australia.” The TDU is a microcosm of the wider climate challenge faced by professional cycling. Both locally and globally, this debate has two interwoven dimensions: the impact of climate change on cycling and cycling’s impact on the climate. Certainly, Australian races are not the only competitions enduring extreme weather. Last year, stage 19 of the Tour de France was cancelled mid-race due to hail, flooding and a landslide. At the time, a commentator described it as “the first Tour significantly affected by climate change”. European summer heatwaves are increasingly forcing cyclists to sweat it out at some of the World Tour’s landmark races. One stage of the 2019 Tour saw temperatures above 40C, with the conditions in the saddle – directly above scorching bitumen – up to 20C higher. Many major races have made a concerted effort to mitigate their immediate environmental impact. The Tour, for example, has a comprehensive waste management action plan and mandates the use of biodegradable water bottles. But while the peloton might be using only human energy, the vast caravan of cars, motorbikes, helicopters and television planes that follows the race guzzles fossil fuels. A 2013 estimate put the Tour’s annual carbon footprint at 341,000 tonnes. The World Tour’s global span compounds this climate impact. In 2019, the men’s edition of the series included 38 races across four continents. In pre-Covid times, the travel bill of Australian team Mitchelton-Scott exceeded $1m each year, mainly spent on flights. Just bringing the hundreds of World Tour cyclists and support staff, and their bikes, from Europe to Adelaide for the TDU represents a sizeable emissions impact. The sport is also a favoured vehicle for companies to burnish their green credentials – Santos’s sponsorship of the TDU is by no means unique. The British chemicals and gas company Ineos is the title sponsor of the peloton’s dominant team, formerly Team Sky. When the deal was announced in 2019, anti-fracking activists protested against the sponsorship at the Tour de Yorkshire, while Friends of the Earth decried it as “greenwashing”. Until 2018 Mitchelton-Scott was known as Orica-Scott, sponsored by the explosives multinational that services the mining, oil and gas sector. Two current World Tour teams, Bahrain–McLaren and UAE Team Emirates, are funded by Middle Eastern petro-states. But there are some rays of hope. In January, Belgium’s Deceuninck-QuickStep announced their intention to become the first carbon neutral team in the peloton. Having calculated their annual carbon footprint at 1,288 tonnes, equivalent to “539 return flights between Brussels and New York”, the team decided to offset that amount of carbon and adopt other climate-conscious initiatives. “Not easy to start projects like this without acknowledging the difficulties and somewhat inevitable hypocrisy of what comes with being an international team in our sport,” QuickStep rider James Knox said on Twitter at the time. “But great to see the team and the sponsors help make a positive change, albeit small, for the environment.” On Tuesday, to coincide with the launch of the #BreakAwayFromGas campaign, the City of Adelaide councillor Robert Simms proposed a motion calling for the lord mayor to engage with Events SA over Santos’s ongoing sponsorship of the TDU. The motion was rejected. “It is absurd that an event that promotes sustainability and healthy living is associated with a fossil fuel company,” says Simms, a former federal Greens senator. Adelaide has aspirations to be a carbon neutral city, and last year declared a climate emergency. “I fear that an association with a big polluter like Santos undermines our reputation as a green city,” the councillor adds. Local government wrangling and grassroots groups may seem a world away from the glitz and glamour of the world’s biggest cycling races. But, says the ACF’s Harter, if cycling does not get real about the climate crisis, it faces a truly existential threat. “Meeting our Paris Agreement commitments are critical to ensuring a world in which cycling and other sports much loved by the Australian community can continue to exist,” she says. To Allen and his fellow FFSA activists, the TDU discontinuing its commercial relationship with Santos would be a small but significant step in the right direction. “It would be an important signal that we are waking up to the negative legacy of fossil fuels,” says Allen. “This is a wake-up call.”"

State education rankings published by _U.S. News & World Report_, _Education Week_ , and others play a prominent role in legislative debate and public discourse concerning education. These rankings are based partly on achievement tests, which measure student learning, and partly on other factors not directly related to student learning. When achievement tests are used as measures of learning in these conventional rankings, they are aggregated in a way that provides misleading results. To overcome these deficiencies, we create a new ranking of state education systems using demographically disaggregated achievement data and excluding less informative factors that are not directly related to learning. Using our methodology changes the order of state rankings considerably. Many states in New England and the Upper Midwest fall in the rankings, whereas many states in the South and Southwest score much higher‐​than they do in conventional rankings. Furthermore, we create another set of rankings on the efficiency of education spending. In these efficiency rankings, achieving successful outcomes while economizing on education expenditures is considered better than doing so through lavish spending. These efficiency rankings cause a further increase in the rankings of southern and western states and a decline in the rankings of northern states. Finally, our regression results indicate that unionization has a powerful negative influence on educational outcomes, and that, given current spending levels, additional spending has little effect. We also find no evidence of a relationship between student performance and teacher‐​pupil ratios or private school enrollment, but some evidence that charter school enrollment has a positive effect.



So many myths stand in the way of expanding educational freedom to all Americans: choice drains money from public schools; choice segregates; choice undermines democracy; and so on. In _School Choice Myths_ , editors Corey A. DeAngelis and Neal P. McCluskey bring clear logic and overwhelming evidence to bear against all the major anti school‐​choice myths, giving readers what they need to see though them and understand how even well‐​intentioned people can be deceived. This book is a one‐​stop guide to everything from the latest research on the effects of school choice on civic engagement to Supreme Court precedent. It is a must‐​have for any combatant in the school choice wars, or anyone who just wants the best education for their children. 



_Preorder your copy below:_



Which states have the best K–12 education systems? What set of government policies and education spending levels is needed to achieve targeted outcomes in an efficient manner? Answers to these important questions are essential to the performance of our economy and country. Local workforce education and quality of schools are key determinants in business and residential location decisions. Determining which education policies are most cost-effective is also crucial for state and local politicians as they allocate limited taxpayer resources.



Several organizations rank state K–12 education systems, and these rankings play a prominent role in both legislative debate and public discourse concerning education. The most popular are arguably those of _U.S. News & World Report_ ( _U.S. News_ ).1. It is common for activists and pundits (whether in favor of homeschooling, stronger teacher unions, core standards, etc.) to use these rankings to support their arguments for changes in policy or spending priorities. As shown by the recent competition for Amazon’s HQ2 (second headquarters), politicians and business leaders will also frequently cite education rankings to highlight their states’ advantages.2. Recent teacher strikes across the country have likewise drawn renewed attention to education policy, and journalists inevitably mention state rankings when these topics arise.3. It is therefore important to ensure that such rankings accurately reflect performance.



Though well-intentioned, most existing rankings of state K–12 education are unreliable and misleading. The most popular and influential state education rankings fail to provide an “apples to apples” comparison between states.4. By treating states as though they had identical students, they ignore the substantial variation present in student populations across states. Conventional rankings also include data that are inappropriate or irrelevant to the educational performance of schools. Finally, these analyses disregard government budgetary constraints. Not surprisingly, using disaggregated measures of student learning, removing inappropriate or irrelevant variables, and examining the efficiency of educational spending reorders state rankings in fundamental ways. As we show in this report, employing our improved ranking methodology overturns the apparent consensus that schools in the South and Southwest perform less well than states in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. It also puts to rest the claim that more spending necessarily improves student performance.5.



Many rankings, including those of _U.S. News_ , provide average scores on tests administered by the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), sometimes referred to as “the nation’s report card.”6. The NAEP reports provide average scores for various subjects, such as math, reading, and science, for students at various grade levels.7. These scores are supposed to measure the degree to which students understand these subjects. While _U.S. News_ includes other measures of education quality, such as graduation rates and SAT and ACT college entrance exam scores, direct measures of the entire student population’s understanding of academic subject matter, such as those from the NAEP, are the most appropriate measures of success for an educational system.8. Whereas graduation is not necessarily an indication of actual learning, and only those students wishing to pursue a college degree tend to take standardized tests like the SAT and ACT, NAEP scores provide standardized measures of learning covering the entire student population. Focusing on NAEP data thus avoids selection bias while more closely measuring a school system’s ability to improve actual student performance.



However, student heterogeneity is ignored by _U.S. News_ and most other state rankings that use NAEP data as a component of their rankings. Students from different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds tend to perform differently (regardless of the state they are in). As this report will show, such aggregation often renders conventional state rankings as little more than a proxy for a jurisdiction’s demography. This problem is all the more unfortunate because it is so easily avoided. NAEP provides demographic breakdowns of student scores by state. This oversight substantially skews the current rankings.



Perhaps just as problematic, some education rankings conflate inputs and outputs. For instance, _Education Week_ uses per pupil expenditures as a component in its annual rankings.9. When direct measures of student achievement are used, such as NAEP scores, it is a mistake to include inputs, such as educational expenditures, as a separate factor.10. Doing so gives extra credit to states that spend excessively to achieve the same level of success others achieve with fewer resources, when that wasteful extra spending should instead be penalized in the rankings.



Our main goal in this report is to provide a ranking of public school systems in U.S. states that more accurately reflects the learning that is taking place. We attempt to move closer to a “value added” approach as explained in the following hypothetical. Consider one school system where every student knows how to read upon entering kindergarten. Compare this to a second school system where students don’t have this skill upon entering kindergarten. It should come as no surprise if, by the end of first grade, the first school’s students have better reading scores than the second school’s. But if the second school’s students improved more, relative to their initial situation, a value-added approach would conclude that the second system actually did a better job. The value-added approach tries to capture this by measuring improvement rather than absolute levels of education achievement. Although the ranking presented here does not directly measure value added, it captures the concept more closely than do previous rankings by accounting for the heterogeneity of students who presumably enter the school system with different skills. Our approach is thus a better way to gauge performance.



Moreover, this report will consider the importance of efficiency in a world of scarce resources. Our final rankings will rate states according to how much learning similar students have relative to the amount of resources used to achieve it.



Students arrive to class on the first day of school with different backgrounds, skills, and life experiences, often related to socioeconomic status. Assuming away these differences, as most state rankings implicitly do, may lead analysts to attribute too much of the variation in state educational outcomes to school systems instead of to student characteristics. Taking student characteristics into account is one of the fundamental improvements made by our state rankings.



An example drawn from NAEP data illustrates how failing to account for student heterogeneity can lead to grossly misleading results. (For a more general demonstration of how heterogeneity affects results, see the Appendix.) According to _U.S. News_ , Iowa ranks 8th and Texas ranks 33rd in terms of pre-K–12 quality. _U.S. News_ includes only NAEP eighth-grade math and reading scores as components in its ranking, and Iowa leads Texas in both. By further including fourth grade scores and the NAEP science tests, the comparison between Iowa and Texas remains largely unchanged. Iowa students still do better than Texas students, but now in all six tests reported for those states (math, reading, and science in fourth and eighth grades). To use a baseball metaphor, this looks like a shut-out in Iowa’s favor.



But this is not an apples-to-apples comparison. The characteristics of Texas students are very different from those of Iowa students; Iowa’s student population is predominantly white, while Texas’s is much more ethnically diverse. NAEP data include average test scores for various ethnic groups. Using the four most populous ethnic groups (white, black, Hispanic, and Asian),11. at two grade levels (fourth and eighth), and three subject-area tests (math, reading, science), there are 24 disaggregated scores that could, in principle, be compared between the two states in 2017. This is much more than just the two comparisons—eighth grade reading and math—that _U.S. News_ considers.12.



Given that Iowa students outscore their Texas counterparts on each of the three tests in both fourth and eighth grades, one might reasonably expect that most of the disaggregated groups of Iowa students would also outscore their Texas counterparts in most of the twenty exams given in both states.13. But the exact opposite is the case. In fact, Texas students outscore their Iowa counterparts in all but one of the disaggregated comparisons. The only instance where Iowa students beat their Texas counterparts is the reading test for eighth grade Hispanic students. This is indeed a near shut-out, but one in Texas’s favor, not Iowa’s.



Let that sink in. Texas whites do better than Iowa whites in each subject test for each grade level. Similarly, Texas blacks do better than Iowa blacks in each subject test and grade level. Texas Hispanics do better than Iowa Hispanics in all but one test in one grade level. Texas Asians do better than Iowa Asians in all tests that both states report in common. In what sense could we possibly conclude that Iowa does a better job educating its students than does Texas?14. We think it obvious that the aggregated data here are misleading. The only reason for Iowa’s higher overall average scores is that, compared to Texas, its student population is disproportionately composed of whites. Iowa’s high ranking is merely a statistical artifact of a flawed measurement system. When student heterogeneity is considered, Texas schools clearly do a better job educating students, at least as indicated by the performance of students as measured by NAEP data.



This discrepancy in scores between these two states is no fluke either. In numerous instances, state education rankings change substantially when we take student heterogeneity into account.15. The makers of the NAEP, to their credit, allow comparisons to be made for heterogeneous subgroups of the student population. However, almost all the rankings fail to utilize these useful data to correct for this problem. This methodological oversight skews previous rankings in favor of homogeneously white states. In constructing our ranking, we will use these same NAEP data, but break down scores into the aforementioned 24 categories by test subject, grade, and ethnic group to more properly account for heterogeneity.



Importantly, we wish to make clear that our use of these four racial categories does not imply that differences between groups are in any way fixed or would not change under different circumstances. Using these categories to disaggregate students has the benefit of simplicity while also largely capturing the effects of other important socioeconomic variables that differ markedly between ethnic groups (and also between students within these groups).16. Such socioeconomic factors are related to race in complex ways, and controlling for race is common in the economic literature. In addition, by giving equal weight to each racial category, our procedure puts a greater emphasis on how well states teach each category of students than do traditional rankings, paying somewhat greater attention to how groups that have historically suffered from discrimination are faring.



Our methodology is to compare state scores for each of three subjects (math, reading, and science), four major ethnic groups (whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asian/Pacific Islanders) and two grades (fourth and eighth),17. for a total of 24 potential observations in each state and the District of Columbia. We exclude factors such as graduation rates and pre-K enrollment that do not measure how much students have learned.



We give each of the 24 tests18. equal weight and base our ranking on the average of the test scores.19. This ranking is thus limited to measuring learning and does so in a way that avoids the aggregation fallacy. We refer to this as the “quality” rank.



From left to right, Table 1 shows our ranking using disaggregated NAEP scores (“quality ranking”), then how rankings would look if based solely on aggregate state NAEP test scores (“aggregated rank”), and finally the _U.S. News_ rankings.



 **Table 1**  
 **State rankings using disaggregated NAEP scores**  




  
*Controls for heterogeneity; **Does not control for heterogeneity.

The difference between the aggregated rankings and the _U.S. News_ rankings shows the effect of _U.S. News_ ’ use of only partial NAEP data—no fourth grade or science scores—and the inclusion of factors unrelated to learning (e.g., graduation rates). The effects are substantial.



The difference between the disaggregated quality rank (first column) and the aggregated rank (third column) shows the effects of controlling for heterogeneity—our focus in this report—which are also substantial. States with small minority population shares (defined as Hispanic or black) tend to fall in the rankings when the data are disaggregated, and states with high shares of minority populations tend to rise when the data are disaggregated.



There are substantial differences between our quality rankings and the _U.S. News_ rankings. For example, Maine drops from 6th in the _U.S. News_ ranking to 49th in the quality ranking. Florida, which ranks 40th in _U.S. News_ ’, jumps to 3rd in our quality ranking.



Maine apparently does very well in the nonlearning components of _U.S. News_ ’ rankings; its aggregated NAEP scores would put it in 24th place, 18 positions lower than its _U.S. News_ rank. But the aggregated NAEP scores overstate what its students have learned; Maine’s quality ranking is a full 25 positions below that. On the 10 achievement tests reported for Maine, its rankings on those tests are 46th, 45th, 48th, 37th, 41st, 40th, 34th, 40th, 41st, and 23rd. It is astounding that _U.S. News_ could rank Maine as high as 6th, given the deficient performance of both its black and white students (the only two groups reported for Maine) relative to black and white students in other states. But since Maine’s student population is about 90 percent white, the aggregated scores bias the results upward.



On the other hand, Florida apparently scores poorly on _U.S. News_ ’ nonlearning attributes, since its aggregated NAEP scores (ranked 16th) are much better than its _U.S. News_ score (ranked 40th). Florida’s student population is about 60 percent nonwhite, meaning that the aggregate scores are likely to underestimate Florida’s education quality, which is borne out by the quality ranking. In fact, Florida gets considerably above-average scores for all but one of its 24 reported tests, with student performance on half of its tests among the top five states, which is how it is able to earn a rank of 3rd in our quality rankings.20.



The decline in Maine’s ranking is representative of some other New England and midwestern states such as Vermont, New Hampshire, and Minnesota, which tend to have largely white populations, leading to misleadingly high positions in typical rankings such as _U.S. News_ ’. The increase in Florida’s ranking mirrors gains in the rankings of other southern and southwestern states, such as Texas and Georgia, with large minority populations. This leads to a serious distortion of beliefs about which parts of the country do a better job educating their students.



We should note that the District of Columbia, which is not ranked at all by _U.S. News_ , does very well in our quality rankings. It is not surprising that D.C.’s disaggregated ranking is quite different from the aggregated ranking, given that D.C.’s population is about 85 percent minority. Nevertheless, we suspect that the very large change in rank is something of an aberration. D.C.’s high ranking is driven by the unusually outstanding scores of its white students, who come from disproportionately affluent and educated families,21. and whose scores were more than four standard deviations above the national white mean in each test subject they participated in (a greater difference than for any other single ethnic group in any state). Were it not for these scores, D.C. would be somewhat below average (with D.C. blacks slightly below the national black average and Hispanics considerably below their average).



Massachusetts and New Jersey, which are highly ranked by _U.S. News_ , are also highly ranked by our methodology, indicating that they deserve their high rankings based on the performance of all their student groups. Other states have similar placements in both rankings. Overall, however, the correlation between our rankings and _U.S. News_ ’ rankings is only 0.35, which, while positive, does not evince a terribly strong relationship.



Failing to disaggregate student-performance data and inserting factors not related to learning distorts results. By construction, our measure better reflects the relative performance of each group of students in each state, as measured by the NAEP data. We believe the differences between our rankings and the conventional rankings warrant a serious reevaluation of which state education systems are doing the best jobs for their students; we hope the conventional ranking organizations will be prompted to make changes that more closely follow our methodology.



The overall quality of a school system is obviously of interest to educators, parents, and politicians. However, it’s also important to consider, on behalf of taxpayers, the amount of government expenditure undertaken to achieve a given level of success. For example, New York spends the most money per student ($22,232), almost twice as much as the typical state. Yet that massive expenditure results in a rank of only 31 in Table 1. Tennessee, on the other hand, achieves a similar level of success (ranked 30th) and spends only $8,739 per student. Although the two states appear to have education systems of similar quality, the citizens of Tennessee are getting far more bang for the buck.



To show the spending efficiency of a state’s school system, Figure 1 plots per student expenditures on the horizontal axis against student performance on the vertical axis. Notice that New York and Tennessee are at about the same height but that New York is much farther to the right.



 **Figure 1**

The most efficient educational systems are seen in the upper-left corner of Figure 1, where systems are high quality and inexpensive. The least efficient systems are found in the lower right. From casual examination of Figure 1, it appears likely that some states are not using education funds efficiently.



Because spending values are nominal—that is, not adjusted for cost-of-living differences across states—using unadjusted spending figures might disadvantage high-cost states, in which above-average education costs may reflect price differences rather than more extravagent spending. For this reason, we also calculate a ranking based on education quality per adjusted dollar of expenditure, where the adjustment controls for statewide differences in the cost of living (COL).22. The COL-adjusted rankings are probably the rankings that best reflect how efficiently states are providing education. Adjusting for COL has a large effect on high-cost states such as Hawaii, California, and D.C. Table 2 presents two spending-efficiency rankings of states that capture how well their heterogeneous students do on NAEP exams in comparison to how much the state spends to achieve those rankings. These rankings are calculated by taking a slightly revised version of the state’s z-score and dividing it by the nominal dollar amount of educational expenditure or by the COL-adjusted educational expenditure made by the state.23. These adjustments lower the rank of states like New York, which spends a great deal for mediocre performance, and increase the rank of states like Tennessee, which achieves similar performance at a much lower cost. Massachusetts and New Jersey, which impart a good deal of knowledge to their students, do so in such a costly manner using nominal values that they fall out of the top 20, although Massachusetts, having a higher cost of living, remains in the top 20 when the cost of living adjustment is made. States like Idaho and Utah, which achieve only mediocre success in imparting knowledge to students, do it so inexpensively that they move up near the top 10.



 **Table 2**  
 **State rankings adjusted for student heterogeneity and expenditures**

The top of the efficiency ranking is dominated by states in the South and Southwest. This result is quite a difference from the traditional rankings.



The correlation between these spending efficiency rankings and the _U.S. News_ rankings drops to –0.14 and –0.06 for the nominal and COL-adjusted efficiency rankings, respectively. This drop is not surprising since the rankings in Table 2 treat expenditures as something to be economized on, whereas the _U.S. News_ rankings don’t consider K–12 expenditures at all (and other rankings consider higher expenditures purely as a plus factor). The correlations of the Table 1 quality rankings and Table 2 efficiency rankings, with nominal and adjusted expenditures, are 0.54 and 0.65, respectively. This indicates that accounting for the efficiency of expenditures substantially alters the rankings, although somewhat less so when the cost of living is adjusted for. This higher correlation for the COL rankings makes sense because high-cost states devoting the same share of resources as the typical state would be expected to spend above-average nominal dollars, and the COL adjustment reflects that.



Our data allow us to make a brief analysis of some factors that might be related to student performance in states. Our candidate factors are expenditure per student (either nominal or COL adjusted), student-teacher ratios, the strength of teacher unions, the share of students in private schools, and the share in charter schools.24. The expenditure per student variable is considered in a quad­ratic form since diminishing marginal returns is a common expectation in economic theory.



Table 3 presents the summary statistics for these variables. The average z-score is close to zero, which is to be expected.25. Nominal expenditure per student ranges from $6,837 to $22,232, with the COL-adjusted values having a somewhat smaller range. The union strength variable is merely a ranking from 1 to 51, with 51 being the state with the most powerful union effect. The number of students per teacher ranges from a low of 10.54 to a high of 23.63. The other variables are self-explanatory.

We use multiple regression analysis to measure the relationship between these variables and our (dependent) variable—the average z-scores drawn from state NAEP test scores in the 24 categories mentioned above. Regression analysis can show how variables are related to one another but cannot demonstrate whether there is causality between a pair of variables where changes in one variable lead to changes in another variable.



Table 4 provides the regression results using COL expenditures (results on the left) or using nominal expenditures (results on the right). To save space, we only include the coefficients and p-values, the latter of which, when subtracted from one, provides statistical confidence levels. Those coefficients for variables that were statistically significant are marked with asterisks (one asterisk indicates a 90 percent confidence level and two a level of 95 percent).

The choice of nominal vs. COL expenditures leads to a large difference in the results. The COL-adjusted results are likely to lead to a greater number of correct conclusions.



Nominal expenditures per student are related in a positive and statistically significant manner to student performance up to a point, but the positive effect of expenditures per student declines as expenditures per student increase. The coefficients on the two expenditure-per-student variables indicate that additional nominal spending is no longer related to performance when nominal spending gets to a level of $18,500 per student, a level that is exceeded by only a handful of states.26. The predicted decline in student performance for the few states exceeding the $18,500 limit, assuming causality from spending to performance, is quite small (approximately two rank positions for the state with the largest expenditure),27. so that this evidence is best interpreted as supporting a view that the states with the highest spending have reached a saturation point beyond which no more gains can be made.28.



Using COL-adjusted values, however, starkly changes results. With COL values, no significant relationship is found between spending and student performance, either in magnitude or statistical significance. This does not necessarily imply that spending overall has no effect on outcomes (assuming causality), but merely that most states have reached a sufficient level of spending such that additional spending does not appear to be related to achievement as measured by these test scores. This is a different conclusion from that based on nominal expenditures. These different results imply that care must be taken, not just to ensure that achievement test scores are disaggregated in analyses of educational performance, but also that if expenditures are used in such analyses, they are adjusted for cost of living differentials.



The union strength variable in Table 4 has a substantial and statistically significant negative relationship with student achievement. The coefficient in the nominal expenditure regressions suggests a relationship such that if a state went from having the weakest unions to the strongest unions, holding the other education factors constant, that state would have a decrease in its z-score of over 1.22 (0.024 × 51). To put this in perspective, note in Table 3 that the z-scores vary from a high of 1.22 to a low of –1.51, a range of 2.73. Thus, the shift from weakest to strongest unions would move a state down about 45 percent of the way through this total range, or equivalently, alter the rank of the state by about 23 positions.29. This is a dramatic result. The COL regressions also show a large relationship, but it is only about half the magnitude of the coefficient in the nominal expenditure regressions. This negative relationship suggests an obvious interpretation. It is well known that teachers’ unions aim to increase wages for their members, which may increase student performance if higher quality teachers are drawn to the higher salaries. Such a hypothesis is inconsistent with the finding here, which is instead consistent with the view that unions are negatively related to student performance, presumably by opposing the removal of underperforming teachers, opposing merit-based pay, or because of union work rules. While much of the empirical literature finds positive relationships between unionization and student performance, studies that most effectively control for heterogeneous student populations, as we have, tend to find more negative relationships, such as those found here.30.



Our results also indicate that having a greater share of students in charter schools is positively related to student achievement, with the result being statistically significant in the COL regressions but not in the nominal expenditure regressions. The size of the relationship is fairly small, however, indicating, if the relationship were causal, that when a state increases its share of students in charter schools from 0 to 50 percent (slightly above the level of the highest observation) it would be expected to have an increase in rank of only 0.9 positions (0.5 × 1.8) in the COL regression and about half of that in the nominal expenditure regressions (where the coefficient is not statistically significant).31. Given that there is great heterogeneity in charter schools both within and between states, it is not surprising that our rather simple statistical approach does not find much of a relationship.



We also find that the share of students in private schools has a small negative relationship with the performance of students in public schools, but the level of statistical confidence is far too low for these results to be given any credence. (Although private school students take the NAEP exam, the NAEP data we use are based only on public school students.) Similarly, the existence of vouchers appears to have a negative relationship to achievement, but the high p-values tell us we cannot have confidence in those results.



There is some slight evidence, based on the COL regression, that higher student-teacher ratios have a small negative relationship with student performance, but the level of statistical confidence is below normally accepted levels. Though having more students per teacher is theorized to be negatively related to student performance, the empirical literature largely fails to find consistent effects of student-teacher ratios and class size on student performance.32. We should not be too surprised that student-teacher ratios do not appear to have a clear relationship with learning since the student-teacher ratios used here are aggregated for entire states, merging together many different classrooms in elementary, middle, and high schools.



Although this study constitutes a significant improvement on leading state education rankings, it retains some of their limitations.



If the makers of state education rankings were to be frank, they would acknowledge that the entire enterprise of ranking state-level systems is only a blunt instrument for judging school quality. There exists substantial variation in educational quality within states. Schools differ from district to district and within districts. We generally dislike the idea of painting the performance of all schools in a given state with the same brush. However, state-level rankings do provide an intuitively pleasing basis for lawmakers and interested citizens to compare state education policies. Because state rankings currently play such a prominent role in the public debate on education policy, their more glaring methodological defects detailed above demand rectification. Any state ranking is nonetheless limited by aggregation inherent at the state-level unit of analysis.



Another limitation to our study, common to virtually all state education rankings, is that we treat the result of education as a one-dimensional variable. Of course, educational results are multifaceted and more complex than a single measure could capture. A standardized test may not pick up potentially important qualities such as creativity, critical thinking, or grit. Part of the problem is that there is no accepted measurement of those attributes.



We also are using a data snapshot that reflects measures of learning at a particular moment in time. However, the performance of students at any grade level depends on their education at all prior grade levels. A ranking of states based on student performance is the culmination of learning over a lengthy time period. An implicit assumption in creating such rankings is that the quality of various school systems changes slowly enough for a snapshot in one year to convey meaningful information about the school system as it exists over the entire interval in which learning occurred. This assumption allows us to attribute current or recent student performance, which is largely based on past years of teaching, to the teaching quality currently found in these schools. This assumption is present in most state rankings but may obscure sudden and significant improvement, or deterioration, in student knowledge that occurs in discrete years.



While the state level may be too aggregated a unit of analysis for the optimal examination of educational outcomes, state rankings are frequently used and discussed. Whether based appropriately on learning outcomes or inappropriately on nonlearning factors, comparisons between states greatly influence the public discourse on education. When these rankings fail to account for the heterogeneity of student populations, however, they skew results in favor of states with fewer socioeconomically challenged students.



Our ranking corrects these problems by focusing on outputs and the value added to each of the demographic groups the state education system serves. Furthermore, we consider the cost-effectiveness of education spending in U.S. states. States that spend efficiently should be recognized as more successful than states paying larger sums for similar or worse outcomes.



Adjusting for the heterogeneity of students has a powerful effect on the assessments of how well states educate their students. Certain southern and western states, such as Florida and Texas, have much better student performances than appears to be the case when student heterogeneity is not taken into account. Other states, such as Maine and Rhode Island in New England, fall substantially. These results run counter to conventional wisdom that the best education is found in northern and eastern states with powerful unions and high expenditures.



This difference is even more pronounced when spending efficiency, a factor generally neglected in conventional rankings, is taken into account. Florida, Texas, and Virginia are seen to be the most efficient in terms of quality achieved per COL-adjusted dollar spent. Conversely, West Virginia, Alabama, and Maine are the least efficient. Some states that do an excellent job educating students, such as Massachusetts and New Jersey, also spend quite lavishly and thus fall considerably when spending efficiency is considered.



Finally, we examine some factors thought to influence student performance. We find evidence that state spending appears to have reached a point of zero returns and that unionization is negatively related to student performance, and some evidence that charter schools may have a small positive relationship to student achievement. We find little evidence that class size, vouchers, or the share of students in private schools have measurable effects on state performance.



Which state education systems are worth emulating and which are not? The conventional answer to this question deserves to be reevaluated in light of the results presented in this report. We hope that our rankings will better inform pundits, policymakers, and activists as they seek to improve K–12 education.



Conventional education-ranking methodologies based on NAEP achievement tests are likely to skew results. In this Appendix, we provide a simple example of how and why that happens.



Our example assumes two types of students and three types of schools (or state school systems). The two columns on the right in appendix Table 1 denote different types of student, and each row represents a different school. School B is assumed to be 10 percent better than School A, and School C is assumed to be 20 percent better than School A, regardless of the student type being educated.



There are two types of students; S2 students are better prepared than S1 students. Students of the same type score differently on standard exams depending on which school they are in, but the two student types also perform differently from each other no matter which school they attend. Depending on the proportions of each type of student in a given school, a school’s rank may vary substantially if the wrong methodology is used.



 **Table 1**  
 **Example of students and scores**  




  
**Source** : Author calculations.



An informative ranking should reflect each school’s relative performance, and the scores on which the rankings are based should reflect the 10 percent difference between School A and School B, and the 20 percent difference between School A and School C. Obviously, a reliable ranking mechanism should place School A in 3rd place, B in 2nd, and C in 1st.



However, problems arise for the typical ranking procedure when schools have different proportions of student types. The appendix Table 2 shows results from a typical ranking procedure under two different population scenarios.



School ranking 1 shows what happens when 75 percent of School A’s students are type S2 and 25 percent are type S1; School B’s students are split 50-50 between types S1 and S2; and School C’s students are 75 percent type S1 and 25 percent type S2.33.



Because School A has a disproportionately large share of the stronger S2 students, it scores above the other two schools even though School A is the weakest school. Ranking 1 completely inverts the correct ranking of schools. This example, detailed in appendix Table 2, demonstrates how rankings that do not take the heterogeneity of students and the proportions of each type of student in each school into account can give entirely misleading results.



 **Table 2**  
 **Rankings not accounting for heterogeneity**  






  
**Source** : Author calculations.



Conversely, school ranking 2 reverses the student populations of schools A and C. School C now also has more of the strongest students. The rankings are correctly ordered, but the underlying data used for the rankings greatly exaggerate the superiority of School C. Comparing the scores of the three schools, School B appears to be 32 percent better than School A and School C appears to be 68 percent better than School A, even though we know (by construction) that the correct values are 10 percent and 20 percent, respectively. School ranking 2 only happens to get the order right because there are no intermediary schools whose rankings would be improperly altered by the exaggerated scores of schools A and C in ranking 2.



The ranking methodology used in this paper, by contrast, compares each school for each type of student separately. It measures quality by looking at the numbers in appendix Table 1 and noting that each type of student at School B scores 10 percent higher than the same type of student at School A, and each type of student at School C scores 20 percent higher than the same type of student at School A. That is what makes our methodology conceptually superior to prior methodologies.



If all schools happened to have the same share of different types of students, a possibility not shown in appendix Table 2, the conventional ranking methodology used by _U.S. News_ would work as well as our rankings. But our analysis in this paper has shown that schools and school systems in the real world have very different student populations, which is why our rankings differ so much from previous rankings. Our general methodology isn’t just hypothetically better under certain demographic assumptions; rather, it is better under any and all demographic circumstances.

Chingos, “Breaking the Curve,” https://www.urban.org/research/publication/breaking-curve-promises-and-pitfalls-using-naep-data-assess-state-role-student-achievement, published by the Urban Institute, is a more complete discussion of the problems of aggregation and presents on a separate webpage updated rankings of states that are similar to ours, but it does not discuss the nature of the differences between its rankings and the more traditional rankings. Chingos uses more controls than just ethnicity, but the extra controls have only minor effects on the rankings. He also uses the more complete “restricted use” data set from the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), whereas we use the less complete but more readily available public NAEP data. One advantage of our analysis, in a society obsessed with STEM proficiency, is that we use the science test in addition to math and reading, whereas Chingos only uses math and reading.



5. For a recent example of the spending hypothesis see Paul Krugman, “We Don’t Need No Education,” New York Times, April 23, 2018. Krugman approvingly cites California and New York as positive examples of states that have considerably raised teacher pay over the last two decades, implying that such states would do a better job educating students. As noted in this paper, both states rank below average in educating their students.



6. We assume, as do other rankings that use NAEP data, that the NAEP tests assess student performance on material that students should be learning and therefore reflect the success of a school system in educating its students. It is of course possible that standardized tests do not correctly measure educational success. This would be a particular problem if some schools alter their teaching to focus on doing well on those tests while other schools do not. We think this is less of a problem for NAEP tests because most grades and most teachers are not included in the sample, meaning that when teacher pay and school funding are tied to performance on standardized tests, they will be tied to tests other than NAEP.



7. Since 1969, the NAEP test has been administered by the National Center for Education Statistics within the U.S. Department of Education. Results are released annually as “the nation’s report card.” Tests in several subjects are administered to 4th, 8th, and sometimes 12th graders. Not every state is given every test in every year, but all states take the math and reading tests at least every two years. The National Assessment Governing Board determines which test subjects will be administered each year. In the analysis below, we use the most recent data for math and reading tests, from 2017, and the science test is from 2015. NAEP tests are not given to every student in every state, but rather, results are drawn from a sample. Tests are given to a sample of students within each jurisdiction, selected at random from schools chosen so as to reflect the overall demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the jurisdiction. Roughly 20–40 students are tested from each selected school. In a combined national and state sample, there are approximately 3,000 students per participating jurisdiction from approximately 100 schools. NAEP 8th grade test scores are a component of _U.S. News_ ’ state K–12 education rankings, but are highly aggregated. 



8. As direct measures of student learning for the entire student body, NAEP scores should form the basis of any state rankings of education. Nevertheless, rankings such as _U.S. News_ ’ include not only NAEP scores, but other variables that do not measure learning, such as graduation rates, pre-K education quality/enrollment, and ACT/SAT scores, which measure learning but are not, in many cases, taken by all students in a state and are likely to be highly correlated with NAEP scores. We believe that these other measures do not belong in a ranking of state education quality.



9. “Quality Counts 2018: Grading the States,” _Education Week_ , January 2018, https://www.edweek.org/ew/collections/quality-counts-2018-state-grades/index.html. The three broad components used in this ranking include “chance for success,” “state finances,” and “K–12 achievement.”



10. Informed by such rankings, it’s no wonder the public debate on education typically assumes more spending is always better, even in the absence of corresponding improvements in student outcomes.



11. NAEP data also include scores for the ethnic categories “American Indian/Native Alaskan,” and “Two or More.” However, too few states had sufficient data for these scores to be a reliable indicator of the performance of these groups in that state. These populations are small enough in number to exclude from our analysis.



12. Not all states give all the tests (e.g., science test) to their students. While every state must have students take the math and reading tests at least every two years, the National Assessment Governing Board determines which other tests will be given to which states.



13. Because Iowa lacks enough Asian fourth and eighth grade students to provide a reliable average from the NAEP sample, NAEP does not have scores for Asian fourth graders in any subject or Asian eighth graders in science. This lowers the number of possible tests in Iowa from 24 to 20.



14. Our rankings assume that students in each ethnic group are similar across states. Although this assumption may not always be correct, it is more realistic than the assumption made in other rankings that the entire student population is similar across states.



15. For example, Washington, Utah, North Dakota, New Hampshire, Nebraska, and Minnesota also shut out Texas on all six tests (math, reading, science, 4th and 8th grades) under the assumption of homogeneous student populations. Nevertheless, Texas dominates all these states when comparisons are made using the full set of 24 exams that allow for student heterogeneity. Six states change by more than 24 positions depending on whether they are ranked using aggregated or disaggregated NAEP scores.



16. There are other categories in the NAEP data not directly related to race. Several of these (e.g., disability status, English language learner status, gender) have only minuscule effects on rankings and thus are ignored in our analysis. Among these nonracial factors, the most important is whether the student qualifies for subsidized school lunches, a proxy for family income. We do not include this variable in our analysis because the income requirements determining which students qualify for subsidized lunches are the same for all states in the contiguous United States, despite considerable differences in cost of living between jurisdictions. High cost of living states can have costs 85 percent higher than low cost of living states. High cost of living states will have fewer students qualify for subsidized lunches, and low cost of living states will have more students qualify than would be the case if cost of living adjustments were made. Because the distribution of cost of living values across states is not symmetrical, the difference in scores between students with subsidized lunches and students without, across states, is likely to be biased. This bias is pertinent to our examination of state education systems and student performance, so we exclude it from our analysis. Its inclusion would only have had a minor effect on our rankings, however, since the correlation between a state ranking that includes this variable (at half the importance of the four equally weighted ethnicity variables) with one that excludes it is 0.92. A different nonracial variable is the parents’ education level, but this variable has the deficiency of only being available for eighth grade and not fourth grade students.



17. While we would have preferred to include test scores for 12th grade students, the data were not sufficiently complete to do so. While the NAEP test is given to 12th graders, it was only given to a national sample of students in 2015, and the most recent state averages available are from 2013. Even these 2013 state averages did not have a sufficient number of students from many of the ethnic groups we consider, and many states lacked a large number of observations. Because of the relatively incomplete data for 12th graders, we chose to include only 4th and 8th grade test scores. Note that _U.S. News_ only includes state averages for 8th grade math and reading tests in their rankings.



18. When states do not report scores for each of the 24 NAEP categories, those states have their average scores calculated based on the exams that are reported.



19. We equate the importance of each of the 24 tests by forming, for each of the 24 possible exams, a z-score for each state, under the assumption that these state test scores have a normal distribution. The z-statistic for each observation is the difference between a particular state’s test score and the average score for all states, divided by the standard deviation of those scores over the states. Our overall ranking is merely the average z-score for each state. Thus, exams with greater variations or higher or lower mean scores do not have greater weight than any other test in our sample. The z-score measures how many standard deviations a state is above or below the mean score calculated over all states. One might argue that we should use an average weighted by the share of students, but we choose to give each group equal importance. If we had used population weights, the rankings would not have changed very much because the correlation between the two sets of scores is 0.86, and four of the top-five and four of the bottom-five states remain the same.



20. Without listing all of Florida’s 24 scores, its lowest 5 (out of the 51 states, in reverse order) are ranked 27, 21, 20, 19, and 10. The rest are all ranked in the top 10, with 12 of Florida’s test scores among the top 5 states.



21. Some 89 percent are college educated. See for example, David Alpert, “DC Has Almost No White Residents without College Degrees,” GGW.org, August 29, 2016, https://ggwash.org/view/42563/dc-has-almost-no-white-residents-without-college-degrees-its-a-different-story-for-black-residents.



22. The statewide cost of living adjustments are taken from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center’s Cost of Living Data Series 2017 Annual Average, https://www.missourieconomy.org/indicators/cost_of_living.



23. It would be a mistake to use straightforward z-scores from Table 1 when constructing the “z-Score/$” variable because states with z-scores near zero and thus near one another would hardly differ even if their expenditures per student were very different. Instead, we added 2.50 to each z-score so that all states have positive z-scores and the lowest state would have a revised z-score of 1. We then divided each state’s revised z-score by the expenditure per student to arrive at the values shown in Table 2.



24. Data on expenditures, student-teacher ratios, and share of students in charter schools are taken from the National Center for Education Statistics’ _Digest of Education Statistics_. Data on share of students in private schools come from the NCES’s Private School Universe Survey. Our variable for unionization is a 2012 ranking of states constructed by researchers at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education research organization, that used 37 different variables in five broad categories (Resources and Membership, Involvement in Politics, Scope in Bargaining, State Policies, and Perceived Influence). The ranking can be found in Amber M. Winkler, Janie Scull, and Dara Zeehandelaar, “How Strong Are Teacher Unions? A State-By-State Comparison,” Thomas B. Fordham Institute and Education Reform Now, 2012, https://edexcellence.net/publications/how-strong-are-us-teacher-unions.html.



25. Because many states had results for fewer than 24 exams, giving each state equal weight in the overall average would not provide the zero “average” that would be expected if the average of every z-score were used to form the average. There were also some rounding errors.



26. New Jersey, Vermont, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., Alaska, and New York all exceed this level.



27. The decline is 0.15 z-units, which is about 5 percent of the total z-score range.



28. We should also note that efficient use of money requires that it be spent up until the point where the marginal value of the benefits is less than the marginal expenditure. Thus, the point where increasing expenditures provides no additional value cannot be the efficient level of expenditure. Instead, the efficient level of expenditure must lie below that amount.



29. This is a somewhat rough approximation because the ranks form a uniform distribution and the z-scores form a normal distribution with the mass of observations near the mean. A movement of a given z-distance will change ranks more if the movement occurs near the mean than if the movement occurs near the tails.



30. For a review of the literature on unionization and student performance, see Joshua M. Cowen and Katharine O. Strunk, “The Impact of Teachers’ Unions on Educational Outcomes: What We Know and What We Need to Learn,” _Economics of Education Review_ 48 (2015): 208–23. Earlier studies found positive effects of unionization, but recent studies are more mixed. Most researchers agree that unionization likely affects different types of students differently. For studies that find unionization negatively affects student performance, see Caroline Minter Hoxby, “How Teachers’ Unions Affect Education Production,” _Quarterly Journal of Economics_ 111, no. 3 (1996): 671–718, https://doi.org/10.2307/2946669; and Geeta Kingdom and Francis Teal, “Teacher Unions, Teacher Pay and Student Performance in India: A Pupil Fixed Effects Approach,” _Journal of Development_ Economics 91, no. 2 (2010): 278–88, https://doi.org/10.1016/j. jdeveco.2009.09.001 For studies that find no effect of unionization, see Michael F. Lovenheim, “The Effect of Teachers’ Unions on Education Production: Evidence from Union Election Certifications in Three Midwestern States,” _Journal of Labor Economics_ 27, no. 4 (2009): 525–87, https://doi.org/10.1086/605653. More recently, only very small negative effects on student performance were found in Bradley D. Mariano and Katharine O. Strunk, “The Bad End of the Bargain? Revisiting the Relationship between Collective Bargaining Agreements and Student Achievement,” _Economics of Education Review_ 65 (2018): 93–106, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2018.04.006.



31. To arrive at this value, we multiply the coefficient (1.96) by 50 percent to determine the change in z-score and then divide by 2.73, the range of z-scores among the states. This provides a value of 35.5 percent, indicating how much of the range in z-scores would be traversed as a result of the change in charter school students. This value is then multiplied by 51 states in the analysis.



32. For a discussion on the empirical literature regarding school class size, see Edward P. Lazear, “Educational Production,” _Quarterly_ _Journal of Economics_ 116, no. 3 (2001): 777–803, https://doi.org/10.1162/00335530152466232. Lazear suggests that differing student and teacher characteristics make it difficult to isolate the effect of class size on student outcomes. This view, although spun in a more positive light, generally is supported in a more recent summary of the academic literature found in Grover J. Whitehurst and Matthew M. Chingos, “Class Size: What Research Says and Why It Matters for State Policy,” Brown Center on Education Policy, Brookings Institution, May 2011, https://www.brookings.edu/research/class-size-what-research-says-and-what-it-means-for-state-policy/.



33. The score column in appendix Table 2 merely multiplies the score for each type of student at a school by the share of the student type in the school population and sums the amounts. For example, the 87.5 value for School A in ranking 1 is found by multiplying the S1 score of 50 by .25 (=12.5) and adding that to the product of the population share of S2 (0.75) and the S2 score of 100 (=75) in School A. This method is effectively what _U.S. News_ and other conventional rankings use.

Naomi Klein has been invited to attend a top level conference at the Vatican, to advise leaders how to fight climate change and dismantle capitalism.
According to The Guardian;
Naomi Klein and Cardinal Peter Turkson are to lead a high-level conference on the environment, bringing together churchmen, scientists and activists to debate climate change action. Klein, who campaigns for an overhaul of the global financial system to tackle climate change, told the Observer she was surprised but delighted to receive the invitation from Turkson’s office.
“The fact that they invited me indicates they’re not backing down from the fight. A lot of people have patted the pope on the head, but said he’s wrong on the economics. I think he’s right on the economics,” she said, referring to Pope Francis’s recent publication of an encyclical on the environment.
Release of the document earlier this month thrust the pontiff to the centre of the global debate on climate change, as he berated politicians for creating a system that serves wealthy countries at the expense of the poorest.
Activists and religious leaders will gather in Rome on Sunday, marching through the Eternal City before the Vatican welcomes campaigners to the conference, which will focus on the UN’s impending climate change summit.

The madness of this latest development, is Capitalism is the single most important factor which has made the wealth of rich countries possible. Dismantling Capitalism would not make poor countries rich, it would make rich countries poor.
As for non capitalist societies being better stewards of the environment, what a busted myth that is – if you want to see truly horrific levels environmental destruction, you need look no further than the old anti-capitalist Soviet Union, which is now practically a byword for pollution, inefficient use of resources, and environmental degradation.

Governor Andrew Cuomo announced yesterday “a dramatic drop in state income tax revenue of $2.8 billion.” More high earners appear to be leaving New York than expected in response to the 2017 federal tax reform. “Cuomo said the law’s cap on deductions for state and local taxes at $10,000 was to blame and suggested it is, anecdotally, triggering high‐​earners to leave New York.”   
  
  
Data from both the Census Bureau and Internal Revenue Service have long shown that Americans are, on net, moving from higher‐​tax states such as New York to lower‐​tax states such as Florida. The issue now is whether the 2017 tax law has accelerated the trend.   
  
  
_Newsday_ notes, “Cuomo blames Trump and his 2017 tax cut legislation for prompting New York’s wealthiest taxpayers to change their legal address to another state to avoid a big federal tax hit. He said he bases this on anecdotal stories, not hard facts yet, but that the behavior of just a few thousand of these high‐​earners could have a significant impact on state revenues.”   
  
  
One way to get a real‐​time glimpse of migration patterns is to see where real estate prices and purchases are rising and falling. The _Wall Street Journal_ reports:   




A growing list of public officials in high‐​tax states are expressing alarm that big earners are bolting to low‐​tax states as new data suggests some home buyers are moving in response to the year‐​old change in the federal tax law.   
  
  
… Preliminary data show a jump in Florida home purchases by buyers from high‐​tax states. Home values in lower‐​tax areas have been rising faster than those in places where limiting the ability to deduct high state and local taxes eroded some of the savings from the federal tax reduction, according to an analysis by real estate and data firm Zillow.   
  
  
One of the biggest winners from this shift has been Miami. The city is experiencing more activity than usual from buyers living in states like New York, New Jersey and Illinois. People are drawn to the city by mild weather—as always—and by deals on condos and lower taxes.   
  
  
… While high‐​end condo prices in Miami have flattened out or even declined a bit in recent months as foreign buyers have pulled back, the market is holding up much better than New York City’s. Manhattan co‐​op and condo sales last year were down 12% from 2017 to their lowest level since 2009, a Wall Street Journal analysis found.   
  
  
Other low‐​tax cities are also doing well. Las Vegas and Phoenix have slowed a bit recently but still have the fastest home‐​price growth among major metropolitan areas, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case‐​Shiller home‐​price indexes. Brokers credit Californians fleeing rising home prices and tax changes.   
  
  
… Nelson Gonzalez, a senior vice president at EWM Realty International in Miami, said that in the past year most of the buyers for high‐​end listings that he encounters are from high‐​tax states in the U. S.—a big change from several years ago when he mostly saw foreigners. “Ninety percent of all the deals over $10 million were tax refugees,” he said.   
  
  
… “A lot of rich people are trying to find a way out of New York,” said Barry Horowitz, an accountant who specializes in helping clients switch residency to lower‐​tax states.   
  
  
… Carney Shegerian, a 54‐​year‐​old lawyer from Los Angeles, recently bought a three‐​bedroom condo in the Aria on the Bay tower in Miami for about $1.5 million. He said he plans to move there permanently and open a new branch of his law practice. The unit “is a great value compared with what you’d get in Los Angeles,” Mr. Shegerian said. And the lack of income tax in Florida is “attractive to anyone,” he said.



These new moves have likely strengthened existing migration patterns, which are shown in the chart. Each blue dot is a state. The vertical axis shows the mid‐​2017 to mid‐​2018 Census net interstate migration figure as a percentage of state population. The horizontal axis shows state and local household taxes as a percentage of personal income. Household taxes include individual income, sales, and property taxes. The red line shows the fitted relationship between the two variables.   
  
  
On the right, most of the high‐​tax states have net out‐​migration. The blue dot on the far right is New York with a tax burden of 13 percent and a net migration loss of nearly 1 percent (0.92) over the year.   
  
  
On the left, nearly all the net in‐​migration states have tax loads of less than 8.5 percent. If policymakers want their states to be attractive, they should reduce their household tax burdens to 8.5 percent or less of personal income.   
  
  
Governor Cuomo recognizes the out‐​migration problem, but what will he do about it? _Newsday_ says that he is considering spending cuts to balance the state budget, which would be a good start.   
  
  
The new federal tax law should be a wakeup call for out‐​migration states to improve their tax climates and trim their governments. High‐​tax states should aim to create simpler, lower‐​rate tax codes and improve the quality and efficiency of government services.

"Lockdown has given us a taste of how good it is to live in a more local way: walking to shops, working from home, spending less time commuting. Emissions have decreased, and the air we breathe has felt cleaner. But if we change the way we design our cities, in particular, we can hold on to this climate-friendly way of living. The “15-minute city” is a vision of urban living where everything you need – house, job, supermarket, school, park, health centre, post office – is a quarter of an hour away, by foot or bike. Paris, Barcelona, Bogotá and many other cities are exploring this. It means making cities more pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly, and prioritising refurbishment over new construction, retrofitting buildings to include a greater mix of uses, such as retail, office space, education, small makers and housing.  If cities reduce the number of cars on the road, and with them the need for parking, we could free up 10% extra space in cities. That’s a lot – and the best thing we can do with it is plant trees, creating green, low-emission urban areas. If we do that, natural species will follow, and biodiversity will increase. But size matters: if these green spaces are small and scattered, they won’t be as effective. Only 13% of urban trees in the UK are in areas bigger than 0.25 hectares; they need to be 10 to 35 hectares to support wildlife. We have to fight against the building of “hard squares” – the large, concrete public spaces seen in cities the world over. All public spaces need varied greenery and water-permeable paving. We can further green up our cities with green roofs, balconies and small gardens. We can promote urban laws, like in San Francisco, forcing green roofs in new constructions, or when significant refurbishment happens in existing buildings. As temperatures rise, city centres are predicted to become “heat islands” – around 3C hotter than surrounding areas. Trees and greenery will combat this. What is beautiful about this plan is that it can reap financial benefits, too, by making cities more attractive to residents, businesses and tourists. If our cities are designed in this way, we will be better able to weather climate change, but also future pandemics.  • Izaskun Chinchilla is an architect who runs her practice in Madrid and London, and is a professor at the Bartlett School of Architecture, University College London"

Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1638 by Justus Sustermans. Source Wikipedia
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Does a Christian owe their first loyalty to the Pope, or to God? If your conscience tells you one thing, and the Pope tells you another, which path should you follow?
Galileo followed his conscience. Even when given a direct order by the highest authority in Christendom, to recant his opinion that the Earth is not the centre of the universe, he chose conscience over obedience, divinity over temporal authority – until he was threatened with unspeakable pain.
I am not saying the church is always wrong. Most of the time, the church is a force for good. The moral authority which is the Christian church helped to create the modern world. The concept of a single god, a god of love rather than hate, a universe of order, in which the forces of chaos were chained in the abyss, gave the philosopher monks the peace to pursue their research into the innermost workings of creation – and the faith to believe that creation was orderly enough to be explored.
However, a papal encyclical which demands action on climate change would be tantamount to an accusation that people who doubt the urgency of addressing climate change are evil – are cynically exploiting the doubts of others, for their own selfish ends. Yet surely true evil is condemning millions to live their lives in endless drudgery, by denying them the opportunities inexpensive energy and affordable food might bring, on the basis of the flimsiest of evidence – defective models and failed predictions.
I do not doubt the sincerity of the Pope. I don’t even doubt the sincerity of most alarmist climate scientists. But sometimes scientists get it wrong. There was once another group of people who thought they were right – that the world was on the brink of a catastrophe which only their statistical models could foresee, that mass cruelty was the only path to salvation. Their sincere blindness almost plunged the entire world into darkness. The one regime which embraced this dark vision, even after others finally rejected it, is now a byword for evil. Yet arguably, those who believed were simply accepting the scientific consensus of the day.
The lesson is, or should be, that if you demand the infliction of unspeakable cruelty on a vast number of people, as many climate scientists, green politicians and activists in my opinion demand, with their vehement opposition to affordable energy, you had better be sure of your facts. You better have more evidence that such an abomination is an inescapable necessity, than a set of models which fail, again and again, to demonstrate plausible predictive skill.
If you believe in a creator, one day you will face, not the pope, but your creator. On the day of judgement, the opinion of the pope will count for nothing. All that will matter is whether you lived a principled life, and stood up for what mattered. Even if this sometimes means disobeying the instructions of the Pope, just as Galileo once did.

"One night six years ago, on a quiet side street in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, I came across a photo album that had been put out with the trash. I lived around the corner, and I was walking home when I saw it sitting beneath a streetlamp on Lincoln Place. It looked handmade, with a wooden cover bound with a shoelace. But it had been tied up with twine, like a bunch of old newspapers, and left atop a pile of recycling. After hesitating a moment, I picked it up and took it home. The pages were fragile, and they cracked when I turned them, as if the album hadn’t been opened in a long time, but the photos were perfectly preserved. They seemed to chronicle the life of a black couple at midcentury: a beautiful woman with a big smile and a man who looked serious, or was maybe just   and had served in World War II. As I turned the pages, the scenery changed from country picnics to city streets and crowded dance halls in what appeared to be Harlem, and the couple went from youth to middle age. Looking at the album, I was struck by how joyful the photos were  —   and by the fact that as fabled as this era was, I had never seen a black family’s own account of that time. I wondered who these neighbors were, and who had thrown the album out. For decades, this part of Crown Heights had been mostly black. When I arrived in the neighborhood, several years before, I was one of the few nonblack residents on the block. The neighborhood was changing, though newcomers were arriving and longtime residents were moving out. I went back to Lincoln Place, hoping to find the album’s owner it had surely been thrown out by mistake. Lincoln Place was the very image of old Brooklyn promoted by real estate agents. On other blocks, the houses were carved up or crumbling. Or they had been torn down and replaced by big buildings with spotlights and   signs. But on Lincoln Place, the stately rowhouses were still intact and well loved. The block was preserved in amber. I knocked on doors and left my number, but I never heard from anyone. So I put the album on my bookshelf. A few years later, my landlords got an offer they couldn’t refuse, and my short time in Crown Heights was up. I stumbled upon the album while packing and pulled it off the shelf. Now I really had to reckon with it. Gentrification was transforming the neighborhood  —   soon there might be no one left who recognized the world in these pictures. And the album was literally falling apart in my hands. If I was ever going to try to get to the bottom of it, this was the time. I decided to uncover its story. I thought it would be simple. But chasing the album would become something of a journey, one that would take me far from   Brooklyn to the Jim Crow South, from a remote island in the Pacific to the packed tenements of Harlem, before returning me to Lincoln Place at another moment of great change. Last spring, I began the search. The photos were arranged on black   pages with little mounting corners and Scotch tape that had turned yellow with age. There were 167 pictures, and they covered both sides of the pages, as if to save space. But the photos stopped about halfway through the album. The rest of it was blank. I looked behind every photo, but there were only a few clues, handwritten notes like “From your old pal Duke,” “Myself and Sylvia” or “Love to Etta Mae, From Dorothy. ” The name Etta Mae was written on three or four photos, and I began to suspect she was the woman who appeared throughout the album. She had a full figure and elegant hands. She smoked. But I always spotted her by her smile. She was often with the same man. They were embracing, or they were in separate photos on the same page. I guessed that he was her husband on one photo, someone had written, “To my best friend’s hubby. ” Carrying photocopies of a few pictures, I went back to Crown Heights. I had been gone less than two years, but there were all sorts of changes. On Nostrand Avenue, a West Indian market that had carried buckets of salt cod had closed. Where once the only coffee had come in yellow cans of Bustelo, cafes served locally roasted espresso. There was a retro cocktail bar. On Lincoln Place, a   sign hung outside one house, and another was under renovation. There was a Pilates studio. There were more young families now, and when I asked them about the album as they swept the sidewalk or sat on their stoops, they apologized: They were new to the block and couldn’t help. One evening, I was close to giving up when a young man in a garden apartment told me to talk to Jimmy, the oldest guy on the block. He pointed to a red house a few doors down. An old man answered the door. Yes, he said, he was Jimmy  —   James Burton. I showed him the photocopied pictures, and he squinted. “That’s Mrs. Taylor,” he said. “Etta Mae. ” The man in the pictures was her husband, Isaiah Taylor. Everyone called him Ike, Mr. Burton said. The Taylors had lived on Lincoln Place forever. He pointed next door, at a white house with classical molding. When I returned to Lincoln Place a few days later with the whole album, Mr. Burton and his wife, Lenore, were doing a puzzle at a card table. “You say you just found this album on the street?” she asked, laughing. “I wouldn’t touch it. I’m amazed you would touch it. ” “Would you pick it up?” she asked her husband. “Maybe,” he said. They were in their late 80s. Ms. Burton had worked as a bookkeeper, and Mr. Burton had been a chauffeur and a shipping clerk. They had lived on Lincoln Place since the early 1950s, and raised their two daughters there. The Taylors had been their neighbors and close friends, almost like family. “In those days, we knew most everybody, and then they started disappearing and dying and moving away,” Mr. Burton said. “Now I’m lucky if I know 10 people. ” We sat on the couch and opened the album. Pages had torn loose from the binding, and as we passed them between us, black flakes fluttered to the floor. “No, no,” Mr. Burton said, peering at the faces to see if he recognized anyone. “Etta and Ike. That’s all I know is them two. ” Halfway through, we came to a page crowded with small pictures. Mr. Burton paused. “That looks like me,” he said, his voice a little louder. “Your mother, Uncle Fernando  —   that’s my wedding. ” I was hooked. Now that I had names, I enlisted a researcher at The New York Times, Susan C. Beachy, and she pulled documents for Etta Mae Taylor: census records birth, death and marriage certificates old phone books newspaper clippings. Etta Mae didn’t have children. Her siblings had all died. But she had relatives scattered across the country. The Burtons remembered a niece from North Carolina, and the researcher found someone in Raleigh named Joann Barnes. She was now in her 70s. For months, the only other thing I knew about her was that she didn’t pick up her phone. I didn’t blame her. “Hello,” I would say when I left voice mail messages, “I’m calling about a photo album that may have belonged to your family. ” Even as I said it, I knew it sounded like a scam. I tried her relatives, calling, sending emails and friendly Facebook messages, but always with the same result: silence. The documents, at least, gave me the beginnings of Etta Mae’s story. Etta Mae Barnes was born on July 28, 1918, in Wilson, N. C. which once called itself the world’s greatest   tobacco market. When Ms. Taylor was young, it was a boomtown. Thousands of   families had migrated to Wilson from the countryside to pick tobacco on farms and hang it in big warehouses downtown. The first pages in the album seemed to be of Wilson several photos had stamps from photographers’ studios there. There were portraits of women in flouncy dresses, babies, a boy with a dog, a group in straw hats in a field. In two portraits placed side by side, a   couple posed by a flowering bush, in front of a clapboard house. I wondered if they were Etta Mae’s parents. Etta Mae’s mother, Anna Bell Green Barnes, was born in Virginia and worked as a hanger at a tobacco company, the documents revealed. Her father, James Frank Barnes, was a grocery store clerk. His family went back generations in Wilson County. Etta Mae was one of six. When she was still a child, her oldest brother, Charles, boarded the train that passed through Wilson and became part of what we now call the Great Migration, the exodus of millions of black Southerners from the Jim Crow South. Judging from the album, many of Etta Mae’s relatives had gone north I could tell them apart from their country kin by their suits and furs. Etta Mae left school after seventh grade and went to work as a housekeeper in a private home, according to the 1940 census. That year, 10 other people were living at the Barneses’ including an aunt an adopted daughter Etta Mae’s sister Mildred Mildred’s husband, Jack Artis and their baby, Charles. In 1940, Etta Mae left her crowded home. But she didn’t go north just yet. She went to Suffolk, Va. where, according to her marriage license, she wed Isaiah Taylor on the day after her 22nd birthday. Ike Taylor was three years younger than Etta Mae, and when they married, he had recently graduated from high school and was working as a deliveryman. His father was a cook. His mother worked at a peanut processing plant. Suffolk, like Wilson, was segregated, unofficially divided by the railroad tracks. On one side, a sizable black community had grown, drawn by jobs in the factories of peanut producers like Planters. The Taylors’ wedding announcement in a local paper said, “The couple will reside here. ” But in 1941, the United States entered World War II, and farm work had grown scarce amid an agriculture crisis. Hundreds of thousands of black Southerners rushed to enlist, and Ike was one of them. There were about a dozen photographs from the war in the album, loose snapshots tucked in the back. They showed black soldiers amid spindly trees and what looked like Japanese shrines. Ike was an army truck commander in the 510th Port Battalion and rose to the rank of master sergeant, according to his military records. His unit was stationed on Tinian, an island in the Pacific that the United States captured from the Japanese, where the armed forces built a huge air base. (It was from Tinian that the Enola Gay took off for Hiroshima.) Today, most of the men in Ike’s unit would be approaching 100, if they were alive at all, and I had given up on getting a firsthand account, when I found a videotaped interview with a member of the 510th in the Library of Congress. James W. Taylor (no relation to Ike) died in 2014. In the video, he described their time in the army. The armed forces were still segregated, and there were almost no black combat units until troops thinned at the end of the war black soldiers were instead relegated to labor and service units. Their battalion unloaded ammunition from ships and provided transport. On Tinian, they lived apart from the white soldiers. They slept in tents in a separate camp, ate separately and drank from water tanks that they filled, separately, from a mountain spring. These men may have enlisted in the army to escape Jim Crow, but instead they found themselves on a tropical island in the Pacific that had become a replica of the segregated South. This was where records trailed off. To go any further, I needed a guide. One night in the fall, I found one. I got a Facebook message from someone in Wilson named Craig Barnes Jr. whom I had written to months before. “Sorry, I’m just seeing this now,” he said. “Do you still have that photo?” I replied immediately with a smiley face. “I have the entire album!” Over the phone, Mr. Barnes, 25, said that he was related to Etta Mae, but that he didn’t know much about her the person to talk to was his grandmother, Joann Barnes  —   the woman in Raleigh who hadn’t taken my calls. He promised to set up a conversation, but weeks went by. When we finally spoke, he had bad news: She wasn’t answering the phone. But that was all I had. So a week later, I boarded a flight for Raleigh, the album in my bag. I met up with a photographer and we drove to the last listed address for Ms. Barnes: a retirement complex in a   apartment building surrounded by trees. I was unsure if she even lived there, much less how she would feel about my visit, and as we approached, I felt nervous for the first time. I had come all this way, and though I thought the album was important, maybe I was just intruding. I pressed the buzzer and identified myself over the intercom as a reporter from New York. After a long moment, a woman’s voice crackled through the speaker. “All right,” she said. “I’ll buzz you in, dear. ” As we walked down the hall toward her apartment, Ms. Barnes stepped out from her door, as if she planned to give us only a minute. She had short gray hair and wore a   blouse. “Are you a relative of Etta Mae Taylor?” I asked. “Yes, I was her niece,” she said. I explained, quickly, how I had met the Burtons, that they had told me Etta Mae’s name and that I should look for her niece. “O. K.,” she said. “And, well,” I said, “basically, I found this on the street. ” I held out the album. She gave a surprised laugh. I laughed too, with relief. “You know, it kind of makes you leery,” Ms. Barnes said. She had gotten my messages, and her grandson’s, but she was skeptical because she had never seen her aunt’s photo album. She invited us in. Her apartment was small and neat. She had been cleaning, and after she washed her hands, we sat down. She was from Wilson, she said, but she left when she was young and spent nearly 30 years in New York, where she was a visiting nurse. She opened the album. “Oh, my goodness,” she said. “These are from way back. ” She spotted her grandparents  —   Etta Mae’s parents  —   in front of the clapboard house in Wilson where she, too, had grown up. There, in the yard, they played horseshoes and caught pigeons. She named her aunts and uncles and cousins. “And that’s me,” she said, touching a photo of a little girl. “I always liked this picture. I believe my father made this skirt. He used to make clothes for me when I was small. And I always had those big bows. ” She shook her head and smiled. “Little knock knees,” she said. Wilson was about an hour’s drive east. The downtown was deserted, the brick warehouses the only remnant of the tobacco era. Across the tracks, the house where Etta Mae grew up had been torn down. In the empty lot where it once stood, there was no trace of the family that had become so real to me. A pickup was parked in the overgrown grass. Most of Etta Mae’s family had left Wilson and scattered, but Craig Barnes Jr. was still there. We met up at an Applebee’s off the highway. I thanked him for writing to me and handed him the album. As he turned the pages, I said I had never seen a black family’s photos from this era. He said he hadn’t either. “The lifestyle they’re living looks amazing,” he said. In Etta Mae’s day, the magic of Harlem reached the South through newspapers, relatives’ letters and the radio, and in the 1940s, another wave of Southern migrants moved to New York, drawn by Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington as much as by the promise of factory jobs. “New York was the place to be,” Ms. Barnes said. While Ike was in the Pacific, Etta Mae joined her sister Mildred and her husband, along with her brother Charles, in Harlem, and the sisters found jobs pressing drapes at a factory in the garment district. “They were pressers,” Ms. Barnes said. “That was kind of the going job at the time. ” When the war was over, Ike and Etta Mae were reunited in New York. On weekends, they would go dancing  —   at small clubs and at the blocklong Savoy Ballroom on Lenox Avenue, where thousands of couples did the jitterbug. From the time she was little, Ms. Barnes would take the train every year to visit the Taylors. “I was a Southern girl I used to go every summer with my grandmother,” she said. “When I would see them dressed up, it was exciting. Like these were some movie stars or something. ” Of her two aunts, Ms. Barnes said, Etta Mae was the serious one. “Mae thought she was the boss. She always thought she was smarter than everybody else. She was always saying, ‘Sister, you shouldn’t do that Sister, you should. ’” But she loved to dance, Ms. Barnes said. “And she could sing, too. ” The photos speak to the glamour of life in Harlem, but they barely hint at its struggles. Housing discrimination largely confined black people to Harlem, and in the 1940s, as more Southern migrants surged into the city, its blocks became some of the most densely populated in the world. Landlords charged high rents and let their buildings fall into ruin. They knew their tenants had nowhere else to go. After riots broke out in 1943, Langston Hughes wrote of Harlemites’ poverty and frustration: “Some of them don’t try anymore.   I reckon. ” Etta Mae and her sister lived in a packed tenement on West 116th Street. Their brother Charles, who in the album looks dashing in a dark suit with a pocket square, worked as a deliveryman for a florist, and shared his apartment on 131st Street with his wife and seven lodgers from the South. In the middle of the album was a series of oversize portraits of couples gathered around   tables in night clubs. I couldn’t figure out where they were taken until a clue cropped up in an old newspaper: Ike was listed among the members of the Eight Chaps Social Club, a men’s club composed of Suffolkians that was hosting a dance in Harlem. Seven of the Chaps were dead now, but the eighth picked up the phone. “Isaiah Taylor?” Walter Howell, 95, said. Of course he remembered him. “Good buddy of mine. ” He told me the photos were, indeed, from the club’s dances. They look glamorous, but all of the Chaps, Mr. Howell said, had   jobs. He had worked in a   plant preparing minks and sables. Then he answered a question that hadn’t occurred to me, which was why the Taylors had such a dazzling record of their social life. The reason was that one member of the club, Jesse Williams, was a professional photographer. Craig Steven Wilder, a historian at M. I. T. told me that for Southern migrants far from home, men’s clubs like the Eight Chaps “become their new kinship networks. ” “That informal network is how you access news about where you can move,” Professor Wilder said, “where black people are moving and welcome. ” In 1950, the population of Central Harlem reached its peak, and   began to inch their way into other boroughs. The Eight Chaps scattered. Etta Mae and Ike, of course, went to Brooklyn. Crown Heights was predominantly white at the time. And when Etta Mae and Ike moved to Lincoln Place around 1950, renting a room from a black hairdresser named Lucille Stewart, they became some of the first black residents on the block. The Burtons, the neighbors whose wedding photos were in the album, came soon after. “We were about the second blacks on the block,” Lenore Burton said. Ms. Burton’s parents, Clara and Cannon Harper, moved into the white house with the classical molding, with their daughter Jackie. After they got married, the Burtons bought the red house next door. Etta Mae and Ike soon moved into the third floor of the Harpers’ white house, and the two households became like one. Etta Mae’s album captures their communal life: They shared meals, gave each other haircuts, gathered in the kitchen in their bathrobes. Ms. Burton’s sister, Jackie Jones, still lives in the white house that she grew up in and eventually inherited from her parents. On one of my visits to the Burtons’ she appeared, magically, in their living room: Back in the 1950s, they had installed a door between their homes. “All the families were intertwined more or less, though they weren’t blood relations,” Ms. Jones, 89, said. The picture the Burtons painted of the 1950s was a happy one. And it took me a moment to step back and see the obvious: During this time, as black people arrived on Lincoln Place, white families were leaving. Isabel Wilkerson, the author of “The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America’s Great Migration,” said the timing was not a coincidence. “Fear led many white residents to flee,” she said. “Neighborhoods began to open up because white people were so fearful that they would sell at a loss. ” It was a sign of what was coming. In the next decades, hundreds of thousands of white families would leave the city, and black families would move into their homes, a phenomenon that came to be known as white flight. In 1950, the Taylors’ census tract was 95 percent white. By 1970, it was 87 percent black. White flight is often associated with the poverty and crime that plagued New York City in the later decades of the 20th century, and conjures images of muggings, abandoned buildings and urban blight. But these photos too were images of the   era: People posing beside a 1950s television console, a man at a piano, a sunny picnic. In 1956, the new homeowners formed the Lincoln Civic Block Association, which still exists. “There was a Pokeno circle, a poker circle,” Mr. Burton said. “You’d go from house to house. Nobody had a lock on the door. Our house was never locked. You’d look up, and there’d be cousin   . ” The Burtons pointed out a few houses on Lincoln Place where   still lived. A neighbor, Marilyn LeGall, 72, grew up visiting her aunt and uncle on Lincoln Place. “You played stickball, you jumped rope,” she said. “Everyone looked after the other. ” That was life on Lincoln Place, said Arthur Bates Jr. 56, who grew up on the block. “It was a real neighborhood, and a black experience no one talks about, because it wasn’t filled with drugs and it wasn’t filled with poverty,” Mr. Bates said. “It was public schools, it was playing ball, it was playing music. ” Now, he added, everyone was discovering brownstone Brooklyn. “It’s been sitting here, like so many aspects of our lives. People say, ‘It’s dripping with original details.’ Who do you think maintained it? Where were you?” Etta Mae and Ike settled down on Lincoln Place after a decade of war and uncertainty and living in cramped quarters in Harlem. Etta Mae kept working in the garment district. She went bargain hunting on Flatbush Avenue for outfits and nice furniture for their apartment. She joined a book club. Ike got dogs  —   and cars. “A blue Chevy,” Mr. Burton recalled. On the weekends, they would go to their dances, and Mildred came over. They drank cocktails and listened to records. “They were   folks,” Ms. Jones said. “You could come and sit and drink and smoke and laugh. They loved to laugh. ” They traveled, driving south to see one of Ike’s sisters in Washington, and to their hometowns. In the 1960s, they went on cruises. New York gave them a good life. And if it was lived in the shadow of white flight, it was a life they never could have had in the South. Ike’s niece, Brenda Oliver, 67, remembered her aunt arriving in Virginia wearing pretty clothes, smelling good. Ms. Oliver’s mother was a maid. “My mom lived in a house with a coal stove. She was so impressed that her siblings had gotten out of the South and made a life for themselves. ” In their later years, Ike and Etta Mae look content. In one photo, they stand beside each other, she in a dress, he in a suit. She is giving him a knowing little smile. His arm is around her shoulder. It is the last photo of the two of them together. On Aug. 5, 1971, Ike died of cancer. He was 50. After he died, Etta Mae stopped keeping the album. That was why half of the pages were blank. Etta Mae stayed on Lincoln Place. She took care of children for working couples, recalled the Burtons’ daughter, Carol Burton, 58. Etta Mae got books in the mail, never putting them on the shelf until they were read. She went to church every Sunday, at Berean Baptist nearby. She took in relatives once or twice, for brief spells, but otherwise lived alone. I found former residents of Lincoln Place. They remembered Etta Mae, but not as the young woman in the album. “She was always an old lady,” Sherrie Tanner Hammonds, 47, said. She grew up on the block with her grandmother, Ms. Stewart, the hairdresser, and now lives in Rochester. “She always had a small dog. She had a little set schedule. She would walk morning and night. ” “Rain or shine,” said Constance P. Jermin, 83, who left Lincoln Place for Georgia in 2002. “She was very deliberate and devoted. And she always greeted everyone. Always with a big smile. ” For a few years, Etta Mae and I shared the block. Our bedroom windows looked out on the same backyards, and every day, she must have walked past my house, though I can’t recall if I ever actually saw her. When she could no longer get around, Ms. Jones, her landlady, took care of her. “She was feisty,” said Ms. Jones, who said she never raised her rent from $200. “She was good until the end. ” The end was swift. In 2010, Etta Mae fell and went to the hospital, and from there, to a nursing home in East New York, Brooklyn. She died there, five long miles from Lincoln Place, on June 4, 2011. She was 92. She is buried next to her husband at Long Island National Cemetery, a veterans’ graveyard in Farmingdale, N. Y. They share a single headstone, their names on either side. Etta Mae’s funeral program ends, “Etta lived a full life. ” It was all in the album: the Great Migration, Harlem at its most chaotic and crowded, the transformation of Brooklyn. For her neighbors on Lincoln Place, Etta Mae’s album brought back happy memories of their first years on the block, but it did not stop the clock from ticking. In October, Lenore Burton died. Her widower, James Burton, plans to stay in their home on Lincoln Place. For Etta Mae’s family, the album helped fill the void left by relatives who moved to the North. They let me hold onto the album until the publication of this article. I had one last question: How did the album end up on the curb? After her aunt died, Joann Barnes came from Raleigh to arrange the funeral in Brooklyn. She hadn’t been to Lincoln Place in years and was surprised by how little her aunt’s home had changed. She had moved into the back rooms and left the rest untouched. Everything was from the 1950s  —   the kitchen sink and cabinets, the furniture in the living room, which was covered in plastic. In Ike’s old office, there was a record player, hundreds of records, and a shelf with glasses and little stirrers, the remnants of his bar. The closets were stuffed with linens and old clothes. When she went to dry her hands after washing them in the bathroom, the hand towel was so old it split in two. She was tired from the funeral, and overwhelmed. She just wanted to get home. She packed up some wedding dishes for her sister, a few pots and pans. For herself, she took some change from a drawer. “A silver dollar, some old coins,” she said. “That’s just me. I have my memory of her and our trips and what we did together. I’m not a keeper. ” As she got ready to go, Ms. Jones came in. “She asked me if I was coming back,” Ms. Barnes said, “and I said no. ‘Open the doors and let the neighbors come and take what they want. Just open it up. ’” In the weeks afterward, Ms. Jones worked her way through the apartment. She bagged up the clothes. She pulled the records off the shelf. She boxed up Etta Mae’s books. When she found the album, she tied it up with twine. And one evening, before the trucks came to pick up the recycling, she carried it outside with a few boxes and left it on the curb. A few minutes, or a few hours, passed. Then, just as Etta Mae had walked past my house so many times before, I walked by hers, picked up her album and carried it home."

After a long vacancy, President Trump nominated Kelvin Droegemeier of Oklahoma to fill the position of Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), often referred to as the White House Science adviser.





John Holdren, Obama’s science adviser, called him “a very good pick.” Climate scientists such as Katherine Hayhoe and Judith Curry have expressed their approval. It’s rare we see Myron Ebell, who headed the EPA transition team, and Rush Holt, the head of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in emphatic agreement.



There are many reasons for this agreement. Droegemeier is a working scientist whose enthusiasm will be infectious and convincing, something sorely needed within the demoralized ranks of federal and university scientists.



At the University of Oklahoma School of Meteorology, he taught and advised students, chased storms and tornadoes in pursuit of their fine dynamic structure, and rose through the academic ranks to serve as vice president of research for the entire university. His colleagues describe him as conscientious, fair-minded, apolitical and non-partisan—a science nerd who works very hard.





Droegemeier is a working scientist whose enthusiasm will be infectious and convincing, something sorely needed within the demoralized ranks of federal and university scientists.



The nation’s top‐​ranking scientific adviser should not only have a strong record of research and research policy experience, but also the capability to clearly communicate complicated information to the president and lawmakers. The scale of science and technology policy issues tasked to the OSTP is vast and involves navigating the perilous Washington bureaucratic minefield. Droegemeier’s experience is highly germane, including his recent service on the National Science Board that oversees the National Science Foundation. He is also Oklahoma’s Secretary of Science and Technology.



During the previous administration, OSTP was largely focused on the putative perils of climate change. It is no secret that the Trump administration is generally skeptical about climate change gloom and doom. Expect that Droegemeier is fully cognizant of the difference between what environmental activists, the scientific literature, and politicians say—and hopefully able to influence the president to speak more clearly about climate. Droegemeier’s OSTP would likely also pay more attention to the universe of other scientific activities including biology, remote sensing from space, and computing.



One criticism libertarians may have with Droegemeier is, like most, he believes that government funding of basic science is “critical for growing our economy.” In fact, as noted by the likes of the OECD, American University’s Walter Park, and our Cato colleague Terence Kealey, there’s no clear relationship between government funding of basic science and economic growth. In fact, government funding of basic science crowds out that of the private sector. With rare exceptions, almost all U.S. science was non‐​governmentally funded until World War II—but it was in this era that the U.S. economy overtook those of the rest of the world.



Regardless of his views on U.S. basic science R&D, the federal government’s share of funding is now below 50 percent, being increasingly displaced by private industry support, as well as direct university support. This transition accelerated under John Holdren’s watch, and is likely to continue regardless of who assumes the role of science adviser. The rate of technological progress continues apace, with or without government funding.



Senators may use the confirmation battle to go after Trump’s nominee and score political points ahead of the midterm elections. That would be a disservice to Dr. Droegemeier and poison the recruiting well when other highly‐​respected scientists are asked to serve in government. In fact, John Holdren was unanimously confirmed, in spite of his outspoken and partisan views on climate. We encourage an honest evaluation of the nominee’s record and a spirited debate on his science policy views, and it will become clear that Trump’s pick for OSTP director should be confirmed without delay.

Last week we pointed out how a study showed pine beetle damaged forests didn’t have a greater burn risk than healthy forests, now this new study shows that the favorite ‘milder winter caused by climate change’ link is overblown.
Mountain pine beetles (pictured here) have killed pine forests over more than 140,000 square miles in the western US, but warming winters can’t be blamed for the full extent of recent outbreaks in the region, a Dartmouth College and US Forest Service study finds. Credit Jeff Foott
Mild winters not fueling all pine beetle outbreaks in western United States
Dartmouth College
HANOVER, N.H. – Warming winters have allowed mountain pine beetle outbreaks in the coldest areas of the western United States, but milder winters can’t be blamed for the full extent of recent outbreaks in the region, a Dartmouth College and U.S. Forest Service study finds.
Milder winters have contributed to recent beetle outbreaks in Canada, but this is the first study to evaluate warmer winters as a factor permitting simultaneous outbreaks across the majority of its range in the western United States. In the last 15 years, bark beetles in the western U.S. have killed pine forests over more than 140,000 square miles (about the size of Montana), which exceeds the area killed by forest fires during the same years. Warming winters could be fueling these beetle epidemics, but large-scale tests have been limited and other explanations are possible, such as rising summer temperatures that accelerate beetle development and the legacy of forestry practices.
The findings appear in the journal Landscape Ecology. A PDF is available on request.
The researchers examined the long-term trend in minimum air temperatures across 23 ecoregions in western U.S. forests that have had bark beetle outbreaks and assessed whether increased beetle survival due to warming winters permitted the outbreaks. The results show the coldest winter night has warmed by about 4 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1960 across Western forests. “This amount of warming could be the difference between pests surviving in areas that were historically unfavorable and could permit more severe and prolonged pest outbreaks in regions where historical outbreaks were halted by more frequent cold bouts,” says first author Aaron Weed, a former postdoctoral researcher at Dartmouth and now an ecologist at the National Park Service.
Despite the trend for warming winters across western U.S. forests, not all beetle populations between 1997 and 2010 have responded to winter warming. In the 11 coldest ecoregions, winter temperatures lethal to the mountain pine beetle have become less frequent since the 1980s and beetle-caused tree mortality has increased significantly in these regions. But in the 12 warmer ecoregions, recent beetle epidemics cannot be attributed to warming winters because earlier winters were rarely cold enough to kill the beetles.
Although winter warming has been occurring across the western United States for decades, it has only permitted mountain pine beetle outbreaks in regions where winters historically killed more than 50 percent of the beetles — primarily in the Middle Rockies (Idaho, Montana and Wyoming), the Blue Mountains in eastern Oregon and northern Colorado. In these regions, winter temperatures during the 1980s were more likely than in recent years to drop below the lower lethal temperatures for mountain pine beetles. But in coastal and southern regions, winters dating back to 1980 were never cold enough to cause substantial beetle mortality. However, these warmer regions are undergoing sustained and, in some forests, increasing impacts from beetles. Other factors — such as warming temperatures that affect seasonal rhythms of beetle development and forestry practices that have influenced forest composition, primarily pine density and age in this case — are necessary to understand the broad extent of mountain pine beetle outbreaks across the western United States, the study finds.

The study, which was funded by the Forest Service, was conducted by scientists from Dartmouth and the Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Research Station and Southern Research Station.

"The reports from Sochi’s newly built hotels and Olympic Village have not painted their construction in the best light, with tales of doors that wouldn’t open, yellow drinking water, and collapsing fixtures and fittings. Unfortunately, the situation doesn’t look any better on the environmental front. In fact the most symbolic failure of the 2014 Winter Olympics came before even a brick was laid, when the government decided to host the games inside the Sochi National Park, a region that contains the greatest species diversity of anywhere in Russia and is encompassed by a UNESCO World Heritage area. It is also a poor decision from a tourism perspective. The planners have built infrastructure for more than 100,000 people, but the valley of the Mzyma River can accommodate no more than 30,000 people at a time. There simply aren’t enough slopes for such a massive skiing resort. This gratuitous sacrifice of nature would be comical if its implications weren’t quite as tragic. When the planning for the games began, it was illegal to organise large scale sporting events within the national park. But by 2006 these laws were amended, along with a few others. In 2007 the Russian government abolished compulsory environmental assessment and oversight for construction projects. In December 2009, the State Duma approved changes to the Forest Code that allowed the logging of rare species of trees and shrubs, in order to speed Olympic construction. These changes to legislation are guaranteed to have a long lasting impact on our ability to protect the environment in Russia. These amendments, made for a single event, will most certainly allow the exploitation and degradation of the environment to continue entirely legally for years to come. Following a similar comically grotesque trend, the Sochi games’ organisers failed to carry out a survey for their construction sites. Absurdly, the official reports on the areas that would become the “mountain cluster” of winter sports facilities mention that dolphins and pelicans reside there. No plans were made to relocate or mitigate the effects upon these species the report claimed were there. A lack of reliable initial surveys means we might never discover the full extent of the environmental damage. The most environmentally damaging construction was the joint highway-railway route from the Adler district of Sochi by the coast to Krasnaya Polyana in the mountains. The River Mzymta used to be a spawning area for roughly 20% of endangered Black Sea population of Atlantic Salmon. Now, no more salmon come up the river due to pollution and destruction of spawning sites by streamlining the river bed. More than 3,000 hectares of rare forests were logged for their large numbers of Taxus (yew) and Buxus (box) trees, and many sites where red deer and wild boar overwintered were uprooted and destroyed. Some migration routes used by bears and ibex on the Aibga Mountain Range were also destroyed – and for what? The road itself is a wasteful extravagance, which could have been easily avoided by simply repairing and widening the existing road. Relative to previous Olympic venues, the games in Sochi were all but guaranteed to inflict greater environmental damage simply because there is so much more environment to damage compared to those events in or around major cities. That said, the Russian government has failed to meet even the most reasonable expectations. From the start of the construction planning it was clear that significant damage to the environment was unavoidable. So in 2012, the organisers agreed to support the rehabilitation works once Games were over. But the support ended by approving the programme with zero budget. In fact, far from supporting environmental protection, Sochi 2014 seems to be actively prosecuting those who speak out in its defence. In the days immediately before the opening ceremony, the overt repression and harassment of local activists escalated. Suren Gazaryan, a member of the Environmental Watch of Northern Caucasus, was forced to flee from the country and seek political asylum in the EU. Another local activist and journalist, Evgeny Vitishko, had his probation period extended to a three year prison sentence, causing protests from Amnesty International. More than seven others have also been arrested. The UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) played a very positive role in the course of preparation for the games, carrying out regular assessments and reporting back to the Russian government. But only in a few cases did Olympic organisers take any action based on these reports and recommendations. For example, the bobsleigh, biathlon and mountain Olympic village were relocated from the originally proposed site in a very sensitive part of the national park. In contrast, the International Olympic Committee has never seriously looked into any concerns raised by environmentalists, providing tacit backing to the organisers’ rampage through the delicate and diverse ecology of the Caucasus. In Sochi, the IOC has demonstrated that the only things that matter are image and money."

Audrey Young, writing in a weekend newspaper prior to Christmas, wasn’t going to let reality get in the way when it came to handing out festive bouquets to the leaders of our political parties. According to Audrey, echoing the words of old Mr Grace in Are You Being Served, “you’ve all done very well.” I beg to differ.



Audrey couldn’t resist giving the Prime Minister, arguably the worst performer apart from her hugs and kisses, the politician of the year. Blunders aside, Audrey says. She then spends the first half of her column accurately describing the blunders of which there are plenty. First up was the crisp phrase, The Year of Delivery. Body’s cartoon, accompanying the article, is a good illustration of the fallacy of the phrase where he has Jacinda riding on a horse and cart marked Year of Delivery across a desert.



Audrey says for all the policies that have been delivered (she didn’t mention what they were and I have no idea either) there were also the ones that were not part of the manifesto: the year of delivering higher rents, the year of delivering lower growth, the year of deficit etcetera. She then talks about the [Kiwibuild debacle](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/kiwibuild-lets-not-do-this/) and says that and the Year of Delivery catchphrase epitomises Ardern’s single biggest weakness – a propensity to over-promise and a failure to manage expectation. Audrey says she fails to grasp there is often little difference between a great sound – bite and a superlative that sets herself up for failure. Her big decision to scrap a capital gains tax gets a plaudit from Audrey. Was there an option?



Audrey says Ardern’s two best ministers have been Chris Hipkins, who knows how to get things done, and Greens co-leader James Shaw who persevered with an inclusive approach to establishing climate change architecture. Hipkins might get things done but usually at the behest of his union masters. Shaw’s inclusive approach has failed miserably with the farmers who are anything but happy with what is proposed.



Simon Bridges, according to Audrey, has had an excellent year. Really? She credits him with holding the MPs together, getting policy under development, maintaining high support for the party, keeping Judith Collins at bay and improving his communication skills. He also led National in small but deliberate steps to bipartisan support for Shaw’s [Zero Carbon Bill.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/a-national-mp-on-national-voting-for-the-zero-carbon-bill/) I think the MPs largely held themselves together, Judith kept herself at bay and high support for the party has little to do with Bridges. His small but deliberate steps re the Zero Carbon Bill were giant steps [too far](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/letter-to-the-editor-zero-carbon-bill/) for most of us.



Audrey says Act Leader David Seymour has had a momentous year, getting his [End of Life Choice Bill ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/end-of-life-choice-act/)passed into law, to take effect after a referendum. I might add, that more than that, he was the lone voice on a number of matters that are of concern to those on _The BFD_ and would get my award for the **most effective politician of the year.**



Despite the domestic difficulties Audrey says it is impossible to go past Ardern as Politician of the Year for the way she handled the Christchurch massacre. Not just for the comfort she gave the victims’ families and the country, but for taking steps to diffuse any possible negative impact between Muslims and non- Muslims. Through Ardern, the world saw the genuine grief that non- Muslims were experiencing as well.



Her expertise in grief has allowed her to heap it on other sections of society including law-abiding gun owners in a stupid [knee jerk reaction](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/why-we-should-be-worried-about-phase-two-of-the-gun-law-changes/) to the Christchurch massacre. Like everything else in her year of delivery few guns were delivered to Police. Farmers were given plenty of grief through an unworkable climate change agenda and insults from her Ministers. Workers were given grief through job losses due to her ridiculous minimum wage policy.



In conclusion, Audrey, it gives us all grief that you saw fit to name her politician of the year.

"The government’s long-awaited plans on how to help the insurance industry provide flood insurance to those homes and properties most at risk was presented. They are promising, but have fundamental shortcomings, according to the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy. The main criticism is that the scheme does not take into account the effects of climate change. This is likely to raise the risk of flooding, increasing the number of uninsurable properties eligible for the scheme, and thereby making it financially unviable. The government’s proposed scheme is designed to cover the 2% of homes most at risk, but if this has been substantially underestimated, then the scheme may prove unworkable. The proposed model creates a reinsurance pool called Flood Re to which insurers may cede the worst flood insurance risks. This way an insurer can retain only the risks it considers of commercial value in its own portfolio. Flood Re acts as a reinsurer that takes on only the very worst risks, removing them from the market and saving those in high-risk households the high premiums they would otherwise have to pay for flood insurance. The scheme would be mandatory for all home insurers, and the pool would require funding – from the insurers, calculated on the basis of the cross-subsidy currently applied in relation to high risk flood insurance policies, and through a small fee added to each home insurance policy that covers flooding. The practice of ceding risks to a reinsurer is not uncommon; commercial reinsurers decide what types of risks they are willing to accept and what premium they require in return, a relationship much the same as between policy holders and insurers. But in the case of Flood Re, though the scheme will accept the worst risks, it will not be able to set a premium reflecting the risk. This is crucial. Home insurers will try to cede as many high-risk properties as possible. If there is an increasing number of properties at high flood risk, this may put a financial strain on Flood Re. The effects of climate change will exacerbate this problem. The government in its report puts forward figures of around 250,000 UK households at significant probability of flooding. The figures from CCCEP estimate 370,000, although the long term effects of climate change are not laid out. As the economics of the scheme are vital to its survival, this criticism is important. The consultation document refers to a “list of high flood risk properties”, but if there is a closed list of properties, eligibility for the scheme is pre-determined, and no subsequent additions can be made. This would help shore up the economics of the scheme, but the question must be asked whether it is politically feasible to restrict it so tightly. Homeowners just the wrong side of the scheme’s boundaries will find that their premiums are higher than their immediate neighbours. In addition, CCCEP’s projection is that the effects of climate change may push the real costs of damage and loss beyond first estimates. The government’s aim is that Flood Re should be introduced to provide protection for the most at risk properties. Over 20-25 years, premiums will be allowed to gradually rise to market level while flood prevention measures continue to be taken, to bring insurance costs down to a reasonable level. But as the CCCEP report notes, flood risk is rising, losses are increasing, and there is no detailed explanation of how the scheme will be phased out. The difficulty arises from the need for the income of the scheme to be determined in advance. The whole point of the scheme is that it covers risks that are not insurable at current market prices. Flood Re cannot simply raise the premium to a level where it covers its expected costs. Instead the premium has been calculated in advance and is paid by an insurer levy and a charge to insurance policy holders. Without a clear definition of what properties can be ceded to the scheme, insurers will have free rein to offload all their worst risks, but the scheme’s ability to raise cash to cover costs will not rise correspondingly. Another problem that CCCEP highlights is that a scheme like Flood Re sends the wrong message to the insurance market, homeowners and local authorities. The Statement of Principles, the agreement between the insurance industry and the government following the particularly severe floods in 2007 entails that the government continue to invest in flood defences. It is vital this continues, but by providing guaranteed reinsurance for the porperties most at risk, the sense of urgency to build flood protection measures is reduced. Worse, CCCEP note that far from alleviating the problem, the Flood Re scheme may actually make things worse. For example, mortgage providers and developers profit from building properties on flood plains, and while an uninsurable property cannot be mortgaged, Flood Re provides low cost insurance to the otherwise uninsurable. CCCEP’s response emphasises that mortgage providers and developers should also contribute to reducing flood risks. Essentially, Flood Re as outlined steps away from the Statement of Principles, by failing to emphasise the urgent need for flood protection measures. As the CCCEP reponse notes, “insurance alone, without complementary risk reduction efforts, is not a sustainable solution, particularly in the context of climate change”. To get it right requires an integrated approach, one that considers the incentives of all the parties involved – mortgage providers, builders, local government planning authorities and central government – and ensures they are all working toward the same goal."

In just a few short hours, 2020 will arrive. BOAKYAG (Bend over and kiss your assets goodbye) as life as we know it is about to end.



A secret report, suppressed by US defence chiefs and obtained by The Observer, warns that **major European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a ‘Siberian’ climate by 2020. Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world.**



This secret report said that the abrupt climate change could bring the planet to the edge of anarchy because countries would be arming themselves to defend and secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies. The reality is that we are throwing away more food waste than ever before in human history as the FAO tells us that approximately 1.3 billion tonnes of food gets lost or wasted each year. Food losses and waste amount to roughly US$ 680 billion in industrialized countries and US$ 310 billion in developing countries. 



Nevertheless, the secret report tells us that disruption and conflict will be endemic features of life and warfare will define human life as from tomorrow.



Way back in 2004 we were told that the planet was carrying a higher population than it can sustain and that, as from tomorrow catastrophic shortages of water and energy supply will become increasingly harder to overcome and this will plunge the planet into war. 



The prediction was based upon the fact that 8,200 years ago climatic conditions brought widespread crop failure, famine, disease and mass migration of populations and this was likely to be repeated. 



So, friends, as this will obviously be my last post, it’s been great to know you – it’s been a blast. Maybe I will meet some of you in the Defence Force recruiting lines as we head off to war, who knows? What a pity all those useful weapons were destroyed by the police.

"Dear Professor Garnaut,
I note that your review has been commissioned to “examine the impacts of climate change on the Australian economy, and recommend medium to long-term policies and policy frameworks to improve the prospects for sustainable prosperity”.
As written, this is a straightforward if challenging task. Unwritten, however, is that the term “climate change” today carries connotations of human causation, thanks mainly to lobby group pressure and media propaganda. This transforms a straightforward task into one of immense complexity, because of the existence of both many unresolved, controversial scientific issues and the fierce environmental politics that becomes involved.

There is wide variation in scientific opinion as to whether any human impact on global climate can be measured, or is likely to prove dangerous in the medium term future. It is, however, the case that the preparation of four comprehensive IPCC reports since 1998, accompanied by the estimated expenditure of more than US$50 billion on climate research worldwide, has as yet failed to document a human signal above the level of the noise in the natural climate system.
In view of this, it is alarming that previous Australian governments have signalled publically that they were basing their climate policy on advice from the IPCC, which is now widely accepted to be a flawed and partisan advocacy body for the existence of dangerous human-caused global warming.
The IPCC’s advice – together with that of now numerous climate lobby groups and interests – occupies the extreme, alarmist end of the range of possible views on climate change. At the other end of the spectrum are the handful of (mostly unqualified) persons who deny altogether any danger from human-caused climate change. Much more attention needs to be accorded in the public debate to the balanced, and balancing, views of the many thousands of independent qualified scientists, engineers and economists who, whilst acknowledging that natural climate change is an important issue, remain unconvinced that strong evidence exists for dangerous human-caused change and are not involved in the IPCC process.
I attach four documents that exemplify the views of some of these moderate centrist scientists, who are perhaps best described by the term “climate rationalists”, and urge that you heed their advice. The centrist view can be summarized by the following quotation from the third attachment:
————————————–
“Climate changes naturally all the time. Human activities have an effect on the local climate, for example in the vicinity of cities (warming) or near large areas of changed land usage (warming or cooling, depending upon the changed albedo). Logically, therefore, humans must have an effect on global climate also. This notwithstanding, a distinct human signal has not yet been identified within the variations of the natural climate system, to the degree that we cannot even be certain whether the global human signal is one of warming or cooling. Though it is true that many scientists anticipate that human warming is the more likely, no strong evidence exists that any such warming would be dangerous.”
“The gentle global warming that probably occurred in the late 20th century falls within previous natural rates and magnitudes of warming and cooling, and is prima facie quite unalarming, especially when consideration is given to the likelihood that the historic ground temperature records used to delineate the warming are warm-biased by the urban heat island and other effects. Once corrected for non-greenhouse climate agents such as El Niños and volcanic eruptions, the radiosonde (since 1958) and satellite (since 1979) records show little if any recent warming and certainly none of untoward magnitude.”
“Atmospheric carbon dioxide is indeed a greenhouse gas, but the empirical evidence shows that the warming effect of its increase at the rates of modern industrial emission and accumulation is minor, given an assumed pre-industrial level of about 280 ppm and noting the established logarithmic relationship between gas concentration increases and warming. As one such empirical test, it can be noted too that no global increase in temperature has now occurred since 1998 despite an increase in carbon dioxide concentration over the same 8 years of about 15 ppm (4%). Putative human influence aside, it is certain that natural climate change will continue, sometimes driven by unforced internal variations in the climate system and at other times forced by factors that we do not yet understand.”
“The appropriate public policy response is, first, to monitor climate accurately in an ongoing way; and, second, to respond and adapt to any changes—both warmings and the likely more damaging coolings—in the same way that we cope with other natural events such as droughts, cyclones, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Neither the Stern Review itself, nor the additional papers that our critique has stimulated, address the above cautious and widely held assessment of the situation. Instead, straw-man arguments are erected and attacked, detail is endlessly obfuscated and IPCC orthodoxy is relentlessly repeated.”
“In dealing with the certainties and uncertainties of climate change, the key issue is prudence. The main certainty is that natural climate change will continue, and that some of its likely manifestations—sea-level rise and coastal change in particular locations, for example—will be expensive to adapt to. But adapt we must and will. Moreover, reducing vulnerability to today’s climate-sensitive problems will also help the world cope with future challenges from climate change whether that is due to natural variability, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions or other human causes. The most prudent way of ensuring that happens is to build wealth into the world economy and to be receptive to new technologies. This will not be achieved by irrational restructuring of the world’s energy economy in pursuit of the chimera of “stopping” an alleged dangerous human-caused climate change that, in reality, can neither be demonstrated nor measured at this time.”
Finally, and given the strong and polarized views that have come to exist on the topic of human-caused climate change (including amongst prestigious science organizations and academies), an objective assessment of the matter in Australia can now only be achieved by government through the mechanism of a Royal Commission, operating under appropriately neutral terms of reference. For, to ascertain the truth, it has become necessary that expert witnesses on all sides of the argument be heard under oath, under a neutral, scientifically competent chairperson and under stringent conditions of cross examination.
Yours sincerely,
Bob Carter

"Sea Ode Two
We think with each succeeding year
Our worries are a new idea
And chicks who think the sky is falling
Keep cropping up at rates appalling.
“Hold your breath” you hear them shout
“And never let your methane out”.
While the sheep are ruminating
Here’s some facts for contemplating.
Man’s CO2 (not many may know)
Is swamped by every live volcano.
Most chlorides come from nature’s stack
To blame us then is pretty slack.
The ozone hole down south of us –
Yawns right above Mt Erebus!!!
The sea will rise, the sea will fall
There’s nothing surer – after all.
That’s what was in days of yore
And will be for ever more
Despite our presence; and our fate
Is micro in the macro, mate.
This greenhouse panic now it’s clear
Is nothing more than atmos-fear.

Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski reports at Spiegel on the claim that climate change is the big factor behind the Syria conflict: Syria: scientists dispute climate change as cause of war.
A number of activists and some climate scientists have claimed or suggested that the war in Syria was due to the 2006-2010 drought (caused by man-made climate change, of course).
Fortunately many experts have come out called this claim a rather wild stretch of the imagination. And now even German warmist scientists have come out and dismissed the claim as well, citing a lack of evidence and an array of other factors at play.
The German Climate Consortium (DKK) issued a press release on the subject two weeks ago. According to this press release, Dr. Paul Becker, Vice President of the DWD German Weather Service, reminds that climate change itself is only one of many factors involved in migration and conflict, and that the issue is very complex and needs to be researched more.
Moreover, according to peace researcher Dr. Christiane Fröhlich, results of a survey of Syrian farmers and workers who were hard hit by the 2006-2010 drought showed:

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




The often claimed causality between drought, migration and conflict outbreak is not tenable. Though the migration of people rose domestically during the drought, neither was the drought the single conflict initiator nor was it ‘climate migrants’ who sparked the protests.”
The press release adds that the conflict was in fact mostly due to bad policies by the Assad regime. Bojanowski adds:
When it comes to who to blame for hunger, the climate argument enables politicians to find guilty parties outside of their countries when in fact they themselves are responsible because of their mismanagement.”
On whether climate change is having an impact on droughts worldwide, The press release adds (emphasis added):
The impact of climate change on the developments with respect to the dangers of drought, according to Paul Pecker, is not statistically significantly verifiable due to the high range of variation in precipitation.”
This is yet another surprisingly reasonable statement coming from a German scientist who has been known to be excessively warmist.
We hope Dr. Becker will also acknowledge the fact that the Sahara region has in fact been greening over the past couple of decades and so climate change is not all bad. In fact history shows that a warmer planet is far more agreeable to life than a cooler one.

Guest author Kenneth Richard examines the impacts of past volcanoes on climate. The findings will surely be controversial. (Title above is my own). -PG
============================================
Volcanic activity explains long-term climate change better than CO2
By Kenneth Richard
Long-term (decadal and even centennial-scale) volcanic influence on climate has recently gained more and more attention in the scientific literature.  Previously thought to influence surface temperatures for only a few years at a time, there is now a growing body of evidence suggesting volcanic aerosols may significantly affect both short and long-term climate changes by blocking solar radiation from heating the oceans’ surface waters.
When specifying the factors contributing to decadal and centennial-scale temperature changes, solar activity and greenhouse gases are usually thought to top the list. And since 93% of the heat from global warming ends up in the oceans (IPCC, 2013), the focus necessarily should be on what mechanisms contribute most to variations in ocean heat content (OHC) and sea surface temperatures (SST).
Back in 2013, Rosenthal et al. published a paper in Science on millennial-scale ocean heat content variations (Pacific). As the graph (Fig. 4B from the paper) below illustrates, the authors document a dramatic cooling of the 0-700 m layer between the Medieval Warm Period (~1000 CE) and Little Ice Age (1600-1800 CE). While OHC has risen since the depths of the Little Ice Age, modern ocean temperatures are still significantly cooler (-0.65°C) than what they were just 1,000 years ago, or during the Medieval Warm Period.

Source: Meteo.lcd.lu
In a Rosenthal et al 2013 paper, he writes:
We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer by 2.1 ± 0.4°C and 1.5 ± 0.4°C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both water masses were ~0.9°C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65° warmer than in recent decades.”
The causal explanation for this dramatic ocean cooling during the last millennium has generally not been forthcoming from those who attribute variations in temperature/heat content predominantly to variations in carbon dioxide. After all, there was essentially no change in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (which centered around ~275 ppm) between ~1000 CE and 1600-1800 CE, implying that CO2 forcing cannot explain the long-term changes in OHC.
There are literally hundreds of scientific papers that have been published suggesting that tracts of low solar activity (i.e., Oort, Spörer, Maunder, Dalton Minimums) are well correlated with decadal- and centennial-scale cooling periods. It is also well-documented that the Medieval Maximum and Modern Grand Maximum (~1920 to ~2010) of very high solar activity are well correlated with the last two warm periods. However, the solar activity explanation is deemed quite controversial, as it is presumed that long-term variations in the Sun’s energy output are too small to have a significant impact on climate changes.  So as not to veer off track or stumble through this controversy, a more indirect explanation for global warming and cooling trends is succinctly referenced here.
In 2015, the authors of the Pages2k (2013) “global” temperature reconstruction for 0-2000 CE released their Ocean2k record of sea surface temperatures (SST) entitled “Robust global ocean cooling trend for the pre-industrial Common Era“.  Below is the definitive graph from the paper depicting this robust global ocean cooling (which conspicuously conceals the post-1900 SST record). The paper itself indicates that the 1,000-year (kyr) cooling trend for global ocean temperatures changed by a modest ~0.1°C (from about -0.45°C kyr to -0.35°C kyr) with the inclusion of the 1800 to 2000 (“anthropogenic”) SST record:

Source: here.
 McGregor et al., 2015 (Ocean2K):
Our best estimate of the SST cooling trend, scaled to temperature units using the average anomaly method (method 1), for the periods 1–2000 CE is –0.3°C/kyr to –0.4°C/kyr, and for 801–1800 CE is –0.4°C/kyr to –0.5°C/kyr“
While intriguing that the authors of the Ocean2k reconstruction effectively acknowledge that global ocean surface temperatures haven’t fallen out of the range of long-term natural variability when including the last ~200 years, even more interesting is the physical mechanism suggested for this long-term ocean cooling: a centennial-scale decrease in surface incident solar radiation (SSR) via the aerosol dust-veiling effects of “explosive volcanism.”  Here is the summary from the paper’s abstract:
Climate simulations using single and cumulative forcings suggest that the ocean surface cooling trend from 801 to 1800 CE is not primarily a response to orbital forcing but arises from a high frequency of explosive volcanism. Our results show that repeated clusters of volcanic eruptions can induce a net negative radiative forcing that results in a centennial and global scale cooling trend via a decline in mixed-layer oceanic heat content.”
Another 2015 paper by Pausata et al. published in PNAS explains how the direct, short-lived (2 to 3 years) effects of volcanic eruptions indirectly influence major long-term decadal-scale (25-35 years here) ocean oscillations (AMOC, ENSO), which, in turn, heavily influence climate.
Large volcanic eruptions can have major impacts on global climate, affecting both atmospheric and ocean circulation through changes in atmospheric chemical composition and optical properties. The residence time of volcanic aerosol from strong eruptions is roughly 2–3 y. Attention has consequently focused on their short-term impacts, whereas the long-term, ocean-mediated response has not been well studied. Most studies have focused on tropical eruptions; high-latitude eruptions have drawn less attention because their impacts are thought to be merely hemispheric rather than global. No study to date has investigated the long-term effects of high-latitude eruptions. Here, we use a climate model to show that large summer high-latitude eruptions in the Northern Hemisphere cause strong hemispheric cooling, which could induce an El Niño-like anomaly, in the equatorial Pacific during the first 8–9 mo after the start of the eruption. The hemispherically asymmetric cooling shifts the Intertropical Convergence Zone southward, triggering a weakening of the trade winds over the western and central equatorial Pacific that favors the development of an El Niño-like anomaly. In the model used here, the specified high-latitude eruption also leads to a strengthening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the first 25 y after the eruption, followed by a weakening lasting at least 35 y. The long-lived changes in the AMOC strength also alter the variability of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO).”
The conclusion that explosive volcanic eruptions – or clusters of smaller eruptions spaced closely together – could have a significant long-term effect on climate is not a new one. Back during the 1960s and 1970s, when scientists were searching for an explanation for the decades-long -0.3°C global cooling trend and its possible connection to droughts and severe weather events, volcanic climate forcing was often recognized as significantly responsible (Benton, 19701; Mitchell, 19702; Budyko, 19693). It was also usually acknowledged that the proportion of human contribution to atmospheric aerosol loading was small (~10%) relative to the predominance of volcanic aerosols (Mitchell, 1970; Cobb, 19734).  More recently, scientists have also confirmed that volcanic eruptions are the  primary source of increases in stratospheric aerosol, and that “no hint for a strong anthropogenic influence has been found” (Neely et al., 20135; Höpfner et al., 20136 ).
Further strengthening this correlation between the presence or absence of volcanic aerosols and long-term cooling or warming trends, consider this key graph taken from Oliver (1976) below (Fig. 1, page 2).

They write:
A period of several decades existed (~1915-1945) in which volcanic activity was unusually light and, as mentioned earlier, the temperatures were higher than the preceding [1880s to 1910s] or, in fact, the subsequent (current) [1950s-1970s] period. … Numerous possible causes of climate change have been discussed in the literature, including both anthropogenic and natural factors. Two principal anthropogenic sources are often considered: changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and changes in tropospheric dust. … Mitchell (1975) concluded that neither tropospheric particulates [anthropogenic pollution] nor atmospheric CO2, in concert or separately, could have accounted for the major part of the observed temperature changes of the past century.”

Notice the remarkable correlation between the warming decades (1915-1945) and the lack of volcanic eruptions during that same period, and then notice the years and decades with several large volcanic eruptions and how these periods correspond with cooling. This appears to suggest that the absence of a physical cooling mechanism – namely, clusters of volcanic eruptions – may effectively be interpreted as a warming mechanism.
This explanation could account for the ocean temperature changes since the 1880s far better than anthropogenic CO2 emissions can. After all, anthropogenic CO2 emissions were flat and low (~1 GtC [gigatons carbon] per year) during the 1915 to 1945 warming period, and they rose dramatically (up to ~5 GtC per year) between the 1940s and 1970s.  This means that as CO2 emissions increased significantly, surface temperatures cooled significantly (1940s to 1970s) – the opposite of what should have been occurring if rising CO2 emissions are largely responsible for global warming.
A more recent depiction of large-scale volcanic eruptions for the last 1,500 years comes from a new paper (Liu et al., 2016) linking global-scale precipitation patterns (monsoons) to large volcanic eruptions. Notice that the dramatic post-Medieval Warm Period centennial-scale ocean cooling described above (Rosenthal et al., 2013, Ocean2k) corresponds closely with frequent clusters of volcanic eruptions. Also, notice how volcanically quiescent the last 80 years of the 20th century have been, which has, on net, allowed more solar radiation to heat the oceans and contribute to global warming.
Liu et al., 2016 finds:
There are 54 large explosive volcanoes during 501–2000 AD in total, and the strongest one is the Samalas volcano in 1257–1258, which is followed by three smaller eruptions in 1268, 1275 and 1284. These strong volcanoes do not allow the climate to recover, and might have triggered the Little Ice Age.”

Chart source: www.nature.com/articles/srep24331/figures/2. 
Other recently-published papers also document a strong correlation between volcanic eruptions and climate changes. Otterå et al. (2010)7 conclude that volcanoes have played a “particularly important part” in directly influencing sea surface temperatures and  in phasing multi-decadal variability for the last 600 years.  Ludlow et al. (2013)8 find 1,200 years of statistically significant (99.7%) associations between cooling events and explosive volcanism for the Greenland Ice Sheet.
Instead of asking what factors are contributing to ocean warming on decadal and centennial time-scales, perhaps there needs to be more of a focus on answering the question of what factors have contributed to the periods of ocean cooling during the last millennium.
Variations in CO2 concentrations or anthropogenic CO2 emissions cannot effectively explain the long-term cooling of the oceans (about -0.35 C per 1,000 years for the last 2,000 years per Ocean2k ). On the other hand, explosive volcanism and its dimming effect on surface solar radiation can much more readily explain decadal- and centennial-scale cooling and warming phases with both its presence (cooling) and absence (warming).

“Climate is variable. In historical times, many significant fluctuations in temperature and precipitation have been identified. In the period from 1880 to 1940, the mean temperature of the earth increased about 0.6°C; from 1940 to 1970, it decreased by 0.3-0.4°C.  Locally, temperature changes as large as 3-4°C per decade have been recorded, especially in sub-polar regions.  … The drop in the earth’s temperature since 1940 has been paralleled by a substantial increase in natural volcanism. The effect of such volcanic activity is probably greater than the effect of manmade pollutants.”

“[V]ariations of human-derived loading are an order of magnitude less than those of volcanic dust loading. For reasonable estimates of the thermal cooling effect of dust load increases, it is inferred that secular cooling due to human-derived particulate loading is currently of the order of 0.05°C per decade. Although changes of total atmospheric dust loading may possibly be sufficient to account for the observed 0.3°C-cooling of the earth since 1940, the human-derived contribution to these loading changes is inferred to have played a very minor role in the temperature decline.”

“[A] rise in temperature that began at the end of the last century stopped in about 1940, and a fall in temperature started. The temperature in the northern hemisphere that increased in the warming period by about 0.6oC then decreased by the middle of the fifties by 0.2oC.  A comparatively short-period rise in temperature with smaller amplitude was also observed in the last years of the [19th] century. … Thus, it seems probable that the present changes in the Earth’s temperature are determined mainly by the atmospheric transparency variations that depend on the level of volcanic activity.”

“It has been estimated (Squires, 1966; Selezneva, 1966; Hidy and Brock, 1970; Robinson and Robbins, 1970) that the anthropogenic component of the global particulate burden of the atmosphere amounts to 5-12%; not, it would seem a very alarming figure.”

Washington, D.C. — Today, the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal), a 501 (c) (3) watchdog group, released an investigatory report, Back to Square One: Unlawful Collusion with Green Pressure Groups Should Doom U.S. EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Regulation  and an appendix of source documents.  The report, which is based on e-mails and other documents obtained under numerous Freedom of Information (FOIA) requests and litigation, details illegal activities by EPA staff, colluding with certain environmental lobbyists to draft EPA’s greenhouse gas (GHG) rules behind the scenes, outside of public view, and to the exclusion of other parties.  More importantly, it clearly shows that EPA must start anew if it wishes to regulate GHGs. (A two-minute companion video is available for use.)

With EPA’s GHG rules going final any day, it is critical to inform the public of the emails detailed in this report for what they show about how EPA has developed these costly public policies with select, ideologically aligned outside interests, and its continuing efforts to obscure and even hide the content of discussions with those same lobbyists.

“E&E Legal has obtained proof that EPA’s GHG rules are the product of unlawful collusion and are themselves therefore unlawful,” said E&E Legal Senior Legal Fellow Chris Horner and author the report.  “Congress or the courts — or EPA, in a moment of rationality — should stop these rules from taking effect before the (intended) anticipatory harms of a sham rulemaking are imposed upon millions of Americans, without years of delay and devastation before the ultimately illegal agency rulemaking is overturned.”

EPA is a regulatory agency tasked with protecting the environment. EPA can regulate greenhouse gases thanks to the Supreme Court’s Massachusetts v. EPA decision. It is not compelled to do so, and it remains prohibited under the law from regulating with an “unalterably closed mind”, for the purposes of completing a “naked transfer of wealth”, or to do the bidding of ideologically aligned pressure groups.

“This pattern of conducting official business in secret and outside of the legal parameters is unfortunately a hallmark of this Administration,” said E&E Legal Executive Director Craig Richardson.  “In the case of the EPA, green groups led by the Sierra Club and NRDC set up shop at the EPA, even before Obama took office, with a plan to eliminate the U.S.’s most abundant source of electricity, coal-fired power plants.  Part of this was to shift the public’s wealth to renewable energy, where the large benefactors of these same green groups are now poised to make significant money.”

The report comes as President Obama prepares to announce these rules next week, and follows an E&E Legal interim report released last September which also showed that EPA was working with outside green lobby groups on a common regulatory agenda, often with deliberate secretiveness and unlawfully.   Since the 2014 report, E&E Legal has pried many hundreds of relevant emails out of EPA in several requests and lawsuits.  The record is not complete, of course, but reflects only those records responsive to E&E Legal’s search terms and that EPA, or its now-departed activist-staffers, decided to produce. EPA continues to improperly withhold certain obviously important information with no conceivable legal justification.

Through the influence of ions from cosmic rays, the effect increases even 10 to 100 times.”

The UV mechanism
Now Germans Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt present papers on another way the sun impacts climate: UV radiation. Clearly the sun has an entire bag of tricks when it comes to dominating climate on Earth, and we are only at the dawn of understanding.
===================================
Heavenly Teamwork: How UV Radiation Above The Stratosphere Impacts Climate At The Earth’s Surface
By Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated by P. Gosselin
The sun? It doesn’t have any impact on the climate. At least that’
s what climate alarmism circles believe. A new study from 28 April 2016 appearing in the Geophysical Research Letters once and fore all shakes this view. Scientists have been able to show that changes in solar UV radiation on a scale of months have a clear impact on temperatures at the lower weather atmospheric levels at the tropics. What follows is the paper’s abstract. a paper by L. L. Hood of the Univeristy of Arizona in Tucson:
Lagged response of tropical tropospheric temperature to solar ultraviolet variations on intraseasonal time scales
Correlative and regression analyses of daily ERA-Interim reanalysis data for three separate solar maximum periods confirm the existence of a temperature response to short-term (mainly ∼27 day) solar ultraviolet variations at tropical latitudes in both the lower stratosphere and troposphere. The response, which occurs at a phase lag of 6–10 days after the solar forcing peak, consists of a warming in the lower stratosphere, consistent with relative downwelling and a slowing of the mean meridional (Brewer-Dobson) circulation, and a cooling in the troposphere. The midtropospheric cooling response is most significant in the tropical Pacific, especially under positive El Niño–Southern Oscillation conditions and may be related to a reduction in the number of Madden-Julian oscillation events that propagate eastward into the central Pacific following peaks in short-term solar forcing.”
Thomas et al. even found a solar-regulated temperature in the mesosphere, which he described in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics in November 2015:
Solar-induced 27-day variations of mesospheric temperature and water vapor from the AIM SOFIE experiment: Drivers of polar mesospheric cloud variability
Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMCs) are known to be influenced by changes in water vapor and temperature in the cold summertime mesopause. Solar variability of these constituents has been held responsible for 11-year and 27-day variability of PMC activity, although the detailed mechanisms are not yet understood. It is also known that the solar influence on PMC variability is a minor contributor to the overall day-to-day variability, which is dominated by effects of gravity waves, planetary waves, and inter-hemispheric coupling. To address this issue, we have analyzed 15 seasons of data taken from the Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) on the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite. The SOFIE data contain precise measurements of water vapor, temperature and ice water content (among other quantities). These high-latitude measurements are made during the PMC season at the terminator, and therefore directly relate to the simultaneous measurements of mesospheric ice. Using a composite data set of Lyman-α irradiance, we correlated the time variation of the atmospheric variables with the 27-day variability of solar ultraviolet irradiance. We used a combination of time-lagged linear regression and Superposed Epoch Analysis to extract the solar contribution as sensitivity values (response/forcing) vs. height. We compare these results to previously published results, and show that the temperature sensitivity is somewhat higher, whereas the water sensitivity is nearly the same as published values. The time lags are shorter than that expected from direct solar heating and photodissociation, suggesting that the responses are due to 27-day variations of vertical winds. An analytic solution for temperature changes forced by solar irradiance variations suggests that if the response is due purely to Lyman-α heating and Newtonian cooling, the response should vary throughout the summertime season and depend primarily upon the height-dependent column density of molecular oxygen.”
Also Ball et al. found a detectable climate impact by solar UV fluctuations in a study appearing in the journal Nature Geoscience of 25 January 2016. Interesting result: The models are unable to reproduce the results. Here’s the abstract:
High solar cycle spectral variations inconsistent with stratospheric ozone observations
Solar variability can influence surface climate, for example by affecting the mid-to-high-latitude surface pressure gradient associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation1. One key mechanism behind such an influence is the absorption of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation by ozone in the tropical stratosphere, a process that modifies temperature and wind patterns and hence wave propagation and atmospheric circulation2, 3, 4, 5. The amplitude of UV variability is uncertain, yet it directly affects the magnitude of the climate response6: observations from the SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite7 show broadband changes up to three times larger than previous measurements8, 9. Here we present estimates of the stratospheric ozone variability during the solar cycle. Specifically, we estimate the photolytic response of stratospheric ozone to changes in spectral solar irradiance by calculating the difference between a reference chemistry–climate model simulation of ozone variability driven only by transport (with no changes in solar irradiance) and observations of ozone concentrations. Subtracting the reference from simulations with time-varying irradiance, we can evaluate different data sets of measured and modelled spectral irradiance. We find that at altitudes above pressure levels of 5 hPa, the ozone response to solar variability simulated using the SORCE spectral solar irradiance data are inconsistent with the observations.”
A long neglected link between the solar fluctuations and climate change at the sea surface, troposphere and stratosphere was described by Yamakawa et al. in March 2016 in the journal Quaternary International:
Relationships between solar activity and variations in SST and atmospheric circulation in the stratosphere and troposphere
Relationships between solar activity and variations in both sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric circulation at the time of the solar maximum are presented. The global distribution of correlation coefficients between annual relative sunspot numbers (SSN) and SST from July to December was examined over a 111-year period from 1901 to 2011. Areas with a significant positive correlation accounted for 11.7% of the global sea surface in December, mainly over three regions in the Pacific. The influence of solar activity on global atmospheric pressure variations and circulation in the maximum years was also analyzed from 1979 to 2011. The results indicated that higher geopotential height anomalies tended to appear in the stratosphere and troposphere in the northern hemisphere, centering on around the Hawaiian Islands from November to December, in the second year of the solar maximum. The SST distribution in the Pacific with strong north and south Pacific Highs produced a pattern that resembled teleconnection patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Central-Pacific (CP) El Niño, or El Niño Modoki (ENM). It is suggested that the solar activity had an influence on the troposphere via not only the stratosphere but also the sea surface.”
Another paper by Reichler et al. appearing in Nature Geoscience already back in 2012 follows similar lines:
A stratospheric connection to Atlantic climate variability
The stratosphere is connected to tropospheric weather and climate. In particular, extreme stratospheric circulation events are known to exert a dynamical feedback on the troposphere1. However, it is unclear whether the state of the stratosphere also affects the ocean and its circulation. A co-variability of decadal stratospheric flow variations and conditions in the North Atlantic Ocean has been suggested, but such findings are based on short simulations with only one climate model2. Here we assess ocean reanalysis data and find that, over the previous 30 years, the stratosphere and the Atlantic thermohaline circulation experienced low-frequency variations that were similar to each other. Using climate models, we demonstrate that this similarity is consistent with the hypothesis that variations in the sequence of stratospheric circulation anomalies, combined with the persistence of individual anomalies, significantly affect the North Atlantic Ocean. Our analyses identify a previously unknown source for decadal climate variability and suggest that simulations of deep layers of the atmosphere and the ocean are needed for realistic predictions of climate.”
The University of Utah issued the following press release:

Stratosphere Targets Deep Sea to Shape Climate:
North Atlantic ‘Achilles heel’ lets upper atmosphere affect the abyss
A University of Utah study suggests something amazing: Periodic changes in winds 15 to 30 miles high in the stratosphere influence the seas by striking a vulnerable “Achilles heel” in the North Atlantic and changing mile-deep ocean circulation patterns, which in turn affect Earth’s climate.
‘We found evidence that what happens in the stratosphere matters for the ocean circulation and therefore for climate,’ says Thomas Reichler, senior author of the study published online Sunday, Sept. 23 in the journal Nature Geoscience.
Scientists already knew that events in the stratosphere, 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth, affect what happens below in the troposphere, the part of the atmosphere from Earth’s surface up to 6 miles or about 32,800 feet. Weather occurs in the troposphere.
Researchers also knew that global circulation patterns in the oceans – patterns caused mostly by variations in water temperature and saltiness – affect global climate.
‘It is not new that the stratosphere impacts the troposphere,’ says Reichler, an associate professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah. ‘It also is not new that the troposphere impacts the ocean. But now we actually demonstrated an entire link between the stratosphere, the troposphere and the ocean.’
Funded by the University of Utah, Reichler conducted the study with University of Utah atmospheric sciences doctoral student Junsu Kim, and with atmospheric scientist Elisa Manzini and oceanographer Jürgen Kröger, both with the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.

Stratospheric Winds and Sea Circulation Show Similar Rhythms
Reichler and colleagues used weather observations and 4,000 years worth of supercomputer simulations of weather to show a surprising association between decade-scale, periodic changes in stratospheric wind patterns known as the polar vortex, and similar rhythmic changes in deep-sea circulation patterns. The changes are:
— ‘Stratospheric sudden warming’ events occur when temperatures rise and 80-mph ‘polar vortex’ winds encircling the Artic suddenly weaken or even change direction. These winds extend from 15 miles elevation in the stratosphere up beyond the top of the stratosphere at 30 miles. The changes last for up to 60 days, allowing time for their effects to propagate down through the atmosphere to the ocean.
— Changes in the speed of the Atlantic circulation pattern – known as Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation – that influences the world’s oceans because it acts like a conveyor belt moving water around the planet.
Sometimes, both events happen several years in a row in one decade, and then none occur in the next decade. So incorporating this decade-scale effect of the stratosphere on the sea into supercomputer climate simulations or “models” is important in forecasting decade-to-decade climate changes that are distinct from global warming, Reichler says.
‘If we as humans modify the stratosphere, it may – through the chain of events we demonstrate in this study – also impact the ocean circulation,” he says. “Good examples of how we modify the stratosphere are the ozone hole and also fossil-fuel burning that adds carbon dioxide to the stratosphere. These changes to the stratosphere can alter the ocean, and any change to the ocean is extremely important to global climate.’
A Vulnerable Soft Spot in the North Atlantic
‘The North Atlantic is particularly important for global ocean circulation, and therefore for climate worldwide,’ Reichler says. ‘In a region south of Greenland, which is called the downwelling region, water can get cold and salty enough – and thus dense enough – so the water starts sinking.’
It is Earth’s most important region of seawater downwelling, he adds. That sinking of cold, salty water ‘drives the three-dimensional oceanic conveyor belt circulation. What happens in the Atlantic also affects the other oceans.’
Reichler continues: ‘This area where downwelling occurs is quite susceptible to cooling or warming from the troposphere. If the water is close to becoming heavy enough to sink, then even small additional amounts of heating or cooling from the atmosphere may be imported to the ocean and either trigger downwelling events or delay them.’
Because of that sensitivity, Reichler calls the sea south of Greenland “the Achilles heel of the North Atlantic.”
From Stratosphere to the Sea
In winter, the stratospheric Arctic polar vortex whirls counterclockwise around the North Pole, with the strongest, 80-mph winds at about 60 degrees north latitude. They are stronger than jet stream winds, which are less than 70 mph in the troposphere below. But every two years on average, the stratospheric air suddenly is disrupted and the vortex gets warmer and weaker, and sometimes even shifts direction to clockwise.
‘These are catastrophic rearrangements of circulation in the stratosphere,” and the weaker or reversed polar vortex persists up to two months, Reichler says. “Breakdown of the polar vortex can affect circulation in the troposphere all the way down to the surface.’
Reichler’s study ventured into new territory by asking if changes in stratospheric polar vortex winds impart heat or cold to the sea, and how that affects the sea.
It already was known that that these stratospheric wind changes affect the North Atlantic Oscillation – a pattern of low atmospheric pressure centered over Greenland and high pressure over the Azores to the south. The pattern can reverse or oscillate.
Because the oscillating pressure patterns are located above the ocean downwelling area near Greenland, the question is whether that pattern affects the downwelling and, in turn, the global oceanic circulation conveyor belt.
The study’s computer simulations show a decadal on-off pattern of correlated changes in the polar vortex, atmospheric pressure oscillations over the North Atlantic and changes in sea circulation more than one mile beneath the waves. Observations are consistent with the pattern revealed in computer simulations.
Observations and Simulations of the Stratosphere-to-Sea Link
In the 1980s and 2000s, a series of stratospheric sudden warming events weakened polar vortex winds. During the 1990s, the polar vortex remained strong.
Reichler and colleagues used published worldwide ocean observations from a dozen research groups to reconstruct behavior of the conveyor belt ocean circulation during the same 30-year period.
‘The weakening and strengthening of the stratospheric circulation seems to correspond with changes in ocean circulation in the North Atlantic,’ Reichler says.
To reduce uncertainties about the observations, the researchers used computers to simulate 4,000 years worth of atmosphere and ocean circulation.
‘The computer model showed that when we have a series of these polar vortex changes, the ocean circulation is susceptible to those stratospheric events,’ Reichler says.
To further verify the findings, the researchers combined 18 atmosphere and ocean models into one big simulation, and “we see very similar outcomes.”
The study suggests there is “a significant stratospheric impact on the ocean,” the researchers write. ‘Recurring stratospheric vortex events create long-lived perturbations at the ocean surface, which penetrate into the deeper ocean and trigger multidecadal variability in its circulation. This leads to the remarkable fact that signals that emanate from the stratosphere cross the entire atmosphere-ocean system.'”

Within five years of the United States being written off as a declining economic and imperial power, the shale gas revolution it has pioneered provides it with the energy independence it has sought since the first Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC) oil shock of 1973. It also changes the global future of fossil fuels, which have been the basis of the modern intensive growth — generating a sustained increase in per capita incomes, first in the West and now in the Rest. (See my _Unintended Consequences_.)



One of the periodic fears generated by the Greens is that of the world running out of fossil fuels, of which the discredited “peak oil” theory was the latest (see Daniel Yergin’s _The Quest_ ). The potential increase in worldwide natural gas resources from currently estimated recoverable reserves of shale gas is 40 per cent, implying that about 250 years of gas supplies are now available. (See US Energy Information Administration’s “World Shale Gas Resources”.) These are also widely distributed, with China and the Americas having the largest assessed reserves (see map). Furthermore, the potential shale oil reserves are even larger. The US government estimates that the Green River Formation in the Western US contains three trillion barrels of shale oil — three times as large as total global oil consumption over the past 100 years ( _seewww​.theg​w​pf​.org_).



This increase in cheap natural gas will allow the replacement of coal‐​fired power stations, which account for 46 per cent of the electricity produced globally, by gas‐​fired ones, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by half. Moreover, this will happen through normal market processes without any need for the mandates and taxes currently in place to decarbonise the world. The US, as a result of the shale revolution, has cut its carbon footprint by five percent this year, well ahead of those hankering after a new Kyoto Protocol on climate change.





The geostrategic implications of the shale gas revolution invalidate predictions of the death of American‐​style capitalism.



However, for the next decade or two this imminent energy revolution is likely to be mainly confined to the US, which shows the robustness of American entrepreneurship, its system of property rights and the depth of its financial markets. The technology of “fracking” was developed by small companies experimenting in the 1980s and 1990s, supported by venture capital from Wall Street, and took off in 2005 when the Barnett Shale in Texas was shown to be commercially viable. Other shale formations were then rapidly developed. These small companies were aided by the unique US system of property rights, whereby owners of land also own rights to subsurface minerals; in much of the rest of the world these belong to the state. The exploration and production companies have to negotiate with these private property owners for the right to drill in return for negotiated royalties. This provides an incentive for the locals to allow “fracking”, overcoming the NIMBYism prevalent in much of the world. The shale gas and oil revolution, thus, attests to the robustness of US capitalism despite its current fiscal woes.



The fall in the price of natural gas in the US, from $16 to $3.30 per mBtu, has meant that the US is re‐​industrialising as petrochemical — and energy — intensive industries shift from Europe, the Gulf and China back to the US. All the predictions of the US‐​related economic decline are soon to be overturned. The renaissance in US manufacturing, particularly in petrochemicals, has been estimated to increase US manufacturing employment by one million by 2025. This increase in high‐​paying jobs should help mitigate the stagnation of US wages and the attendant rise in its inequality indices. Just as the proponents of “Japan as number one” had written off the US in the 1980s with the stagnation of US productivity, all those rushing to anoint “China as number one” are likely to be nonplussed by the coming resurgence of the US economy.



Moreover, other parts of the world with large shale gas reserves are also unlikely to realise their potential. Argentina, with large reserves, is a pariah when it comes to the direct foreign investment that is needed, after its nationalisation of the oil firm YFP. China, with shale reserves greater than the US’, has a shortage of the water needed for “fracking”. Given the continuing “Green” uproar over mining and nuclear energy, India’s polity also seems unlikely to be able to exploit this bounty.



It is the geopolitical consequences of this US economic renaissance and energy independence that are likely to be momentous, allowing greater freedom of manoeuvre in its foreign policy — most importantly, in its relationship with West Asia. Ever since President Franklin D Roosevelt struck the deal with the Saudi King Ibn Saud on the USS Quincy in 1945 promising security to the Saudi dynasty in return for the free flow of oil to the West (to match the leverage provided to Russia by its oil in the Cold War), the US has been unable to counter the fundamentalist Wahhabi poisoning of the Muslim mind. With the ending of its reliance on West Asian oil, the US could cut back on its implicit protection of the Wahhabi state, and its policing functions in the Strait of Hormuz. It only needs to act as an offshore balancer in the coming internecine conflict amongst the Shias and the Sunnis in the region. It will be the Chinese, Indians and, above all, the Europeans who will no longer be able to remain free riders relying on US arms to secure their oil supplies from the impending turbulence in West Asia.



Moreover, the prospective global abundance of oil and gas, by spiking the Russian threat to world order based on deploying the rents from these natural resources, could also lead Russia to move from its authoritarian crony capitalism to the advanced liberal market economy that it needs for its future prosperity. Equally important, by allowing a shift of US military resources from West Asia to the Pacific, it might give the other authoritarian capitalist state — China — cause to pause in its recent aggressive attempts to challenge the US Pax in Asia. In conclusion, it is premature to predict the end of the American Imperium.

It all sounds utterly ridiculous, but unbelievably something about as nutty happened recently. Everywhere in the media we read how mega-filmstar Leonardo DiCaprio took his private jet over 12,000 kilometers – to pick up an environmental award! See here and here.

Need to pick up an environmental award in a hurry? We’ve got the ideal private jet! Image cropped at www.gulfstream.com/.
While the millionaire Hollywood star jets-sets across the globe between stays at his mansions, awards and yachts, he likes to preach to the rest of the struggling world on responsible, humble and sustainable living.
DiCaprio’s Dilemma
Probably one of the most telling aspects of the affair is the decision process leading up to this junket. The award in New York City happened to coincide with the Cannes film festival – an event the California-residing Mr. DiCaprio obviously didn’t plan on missing. Yet, he really wanted that image-polishing environmental award as well. In a normal world a normal person in such a dilemma would have foregone one or the other. Indeed if the environment and climate were as important to Mr. DiCaprio as he likes to profess it is, he certainly would have skipped the star-studded Euro-Festival altogether, or if anything at least cut the Cannes fling short and picked up his award on the way back. That, after all, would have sent a clear signal that he is quite serious about the environment and that it precludes material things like Cannes. Remember DiCaprio’s own words:
Climate change is real. It is happening right now, it is the most urgent threat facing our entire species.”
The other option would have been to skip the environmental award, citing scheduling problems. But that would not have gone over well either. Doing so would have sent the message that having fun at Cannes was more important than the stinking environment and shown that maybe he wasn’t really sincere about the environment.

So you do what people like DiCaprio do in such a bind. You simply flaunt the very rules you profess, and you do both – even if it means clandestinely indulging in an orgy of fossil fuel burning and environmental rape. Besides, you can always offset later. It’s Leo first. Rules apply to us, but not to him.
DiCaprio took the private jet to Cannes, then back to New York to pick up the environmental award, and then shuttled back to Cannes. After that, who knows?
Enough fuel for 10,000 automobiles!
Just how much fuel did that particular 12,000-kilometer environmental round-trip junket consume? No one knows for sure, but we can estimate it. The round trip involved around 16 hours of flight time – if not more – in a longer range private jet, e.g. a Gulfstream G450, which has a fuel capacity of 29,500 lbs,  or approx. 16,000 liters. For the 16-hour long haul roundtrip, refueling once, such a jet would need close to 30,000 liters of fuel – fuel that gets burned right where greenhouse gases are claimed to be the most effective.
30,000 liters is a huge amount of fuel. A normal compact European car can travel some 600,000 kilometers, or some 30 years, on that amount. In a single day, 30,000 liters are enough fuel to power some 10,000 cars!
Clearly if you hold Mr. DiCaprio’s beliefs, private jets are the most environmentally damaging form of transport imaginable. They ought to be banned outright. Yet, Mr. DiCaprio saw no problem committing this mass environmental climate crime. What Leo wants, Leo gets. The environment be damned.
Interestingly the Gulfstream websites overviewing the various models do not include fuel consumption and CO2 emission ratings in order to let the jet-setting millionaires and Hollywood environmental activists know the damage they do to the environment. In Europe brochures and new car stickers clearly state the vehicle’s fuel consumption and CO2 emissions so that people can judge the alleged damage to the environment (er, never mind for now the recent scandalous car exhaust test manipulations).
Sorry, I forgot. Fuel consumption awareness and environmental protection are only for the little folks.

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. _____ 1. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain became the first foreign leader to meet President Donald Trump. Ms. May had been on edge over Mr. Trump’s gleeful support of her country’s withdrawal from the European Union, which she opposed but has to carry out. But they vowed to work together on security and trade as they met at the White House, affirming the “special relationship” between the two countries. Our reporters offered   analysis, which you can see along with the video of their press conference here. Later in the day, Mr. Trump traveled to the Pentagon, where he ordered “new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out” of the country. He closed the nation’s borders to refugees from around the world and temporarily suspended immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries The American Civil Liberties Union described it as a “euphemism for discriminating against Muslims. ” The move was met with disappointment across the Muslim world, with many saying it would be interpreted as a sign that Mr. Trump sees Islam itself as the problem. _____ 2. Mr. Trump also addressed his feud with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico. The two spoke by phone on Friday morning, a day after Mr. Peña Nieto canceled a trip to Washington. Mr. Trump said that it was a “very friendly call” but repeated that he would take a tough stance on trade. Mr. Peña Nieto’s office released a statement saying that they had agreed not to speak publicly about who will pay for the wall. Above, some of the existing fencing. _____ 3. On the Mexican side of the border, there’s deep worry over the impact of Mr. Trump’s immigration policies. Many places are already overwhelmed by migrants from Central America. In Tijuana, above, Haitians hoping to cross the border have crowded into churches and community centers. Immigrants’ advocates say the Mexican government isn’t doing enough to address the crisis, and local charities don’t have the capacity to deal with a big wave of deportees. _____ 4. Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the   March for Life on the National Mall. He became the   official ever to speak in person at the march, which has taken place every year since the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, in 1973. With the Trump administration on their side, activists opposed to abortion rights are preparing to seize a   political opportunity. _____ 5. France has banned soda refills in an effort to combat obesity and diabetes. The French are, on average, less overweight than Americans and other Europeans. The proportion of overweight or obese adults in France was reported to be 15. 3 percent in 2014. In the U. S. it is 36. 5 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _____ 6. The Australian Open finals are this weekend. Rafael Nadal, above, beat Grigor Dimitrov in a match that lasted nearly five hours. That set him up to face Roger Federer in Sunday’s final. Nadal and Federer have not met in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French Open. It’s a nostalgic counterpoint to the women’s championship match between Venus Williams and Serena Williams on Saturday. _____ 7. An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward. The government of French Polynesia has agreed to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon. The project is led by a California nonprofit, the Seasteading Institute, which has raised about $2. 5 million and says work on the project could start as early as next year. _____ 8. Some theater news: Bryan Cranston, above, will star at the National Theater in London in a stage adaptation of the film “Network,” about TV executives and their Machiavellian maneuvers for higher ratings. And Elton John and the playwright Paul Rudnick have signed on to write a musical adaptation of “The Devil Wears Prada” for Broadway. _____ 9. One night six years ago, a reporter found an old photo album on the sidewalk near her home in Brooklyn. It revealed a rich history of black lives, from the segregated South to Harlem dance halls. Last spring, she began the long process of finding its owners. Here is their story. If you’re interested in other projects that explore race, ethnicity and related issues, please consider subscribing to our   newsletter. _____ 10. Finally, do you remember your dreams? If not, here are some tips on how to do so, from a sleep expert at Harvard. First, drink water.     awakenings are frequently accompanied by dream recall. Next: Resolve to remember them. Keep a pen and notebook by your bed. When you wake up, don’t move. Just lie there,  . Sink back into the dream, trying to gather more detail. Have a great weekend. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.

"Our awareness of food waste is increasing all the time, yet we continue to throw away vast amounts of produce even when we don’t need to. We are getting tired of being lectured on our habits so its time to start thinking practically about how to change our ways, and digital technologies can play a significant role in this. There has been a 21% reduction in food waste in the UK and EU in the last five years. But the problem remains, and rather than trying to convince us that food waste is bad (we already know that), we need new ways to shop, cook, eat, and throw away food. These new approaches can be good for the environment and help families and businesses save money.  Few people actively want to waste food, yet households throw away as much as six full meals a week. Although supermarket promotions and inefficiencies in the distribution cycle are often blamed for a large proportion of waste, research suggests that people’s hectic lifestyles, knowledge about food and food labels and tendency towards large serving sizes are also very much part of the problem. In research with Austrian and British households, we found that food waste does not happen as a result of a single act such as shopping or cooking, but by the connections between these activities. Having an active social life, for example, can affect your shopping habits. You may have less time to shop and find that fewer supermarkets are open when you do get round to buying food. These might be smaller supermarkets where food might be packaged in larger quantities. So instead of buying a single onion for your dinner that evening, you may find that you have to buy a kilo. There are other complicating factors, such as knowing what you already have at home when you are in the supermarket, that can lead to you throw away more food in the end. Digital technology is helping to alleviate these problems, by connecting the spaces (such as the home and supermarket) and connecting people. A vision of a technology future is the refrigerator that knows when the milk is running out and orders more from the supermarket. This form of just-in-time grocery shopping might reduce the need to buy in bulk as part of a weekly shop. We have worked with a FridgeCam prototype which allows shoppers to see what they have in the fridge at home. Although the results were a little unexpected. Rather than checking the contents of the fridge while they were in the supermarket, some people found it useful to watch how and when they took food out of the fridge. The routines of food consumption can help us to understand when we might really need that extra milk and when we might be buying more than we need. We should also consider the impact of food production on our food waste. One way of doing this is to look at food miles – the length of distance a product travels before reaching our plate. We’re really not making much progress in this area. According to a recent survey, just 6% of shoppers avoided buying products because they were concerned about food miles. This might be because the concept of food miles is not particularly straightforward and we struggle to make sense of it. Digital technology could play a part here too, such as if consumers could watch videos about where coffee is grown and make purchasing decisions based on what they have learnt. Of course businesses can leave a corporate mark all over such videos at the moment, but the internet of things could change that. If all the products on the supermarket shelf could be scanned to reveal their history, you could independently trace the origins of everything you buy and easily find out how far it has travelled to make it onto the shelf of your local shop.  Food has always been at the centre of community and family life.  In the digital age, online food sharing communities are helping people share leftover food. Whether it is to swap a glut of home-grown produce or to offer a soon-to-expire food item, food sharing communities help us connect with other people to reduce the amount of food we throw out. These new communities also provide a platform for sharing information about new ways to find food, such as through dumpster diving for free groceries. Although this is not yet a widespread phenomenon, the growing number of people looking to alternative food cultures could soon put pressure on retailers to think about the way they waste food as a result of their centralised distribution practices. Our existing social networks can even be used to shame us into action. With BinCam, a household bin with a camera in the lid, our food waste crimes are shared with our friends on our Facebook page. When the camera clicks we start to pay attention to our otherwise unconscious behaviour. You might balk at the idea of broadcasting your kitchen detritus online or at seeing what lurks at the bottom of your friend’s bin when you log in but, it turns out, people soon start to take part in playful competition when they start using BinCam. Many of these digital solutions to food waste are at an early stage in development and many more are still just aspirations for the future. But they  help us to understand our own eating, shopping and cooking habits a bit more, which can only be a good thing as we try to bring food waste figures down in the future."
"A mishandled handoff between foremen may have played a role in an Amtrak crash last April in which two workers were killed when a train slammed into construction equipment that was on the tracks near Chester, Pa. according to documents released on Thursday. The documents, part of a continuing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, also revealed the train’s operator tested positive for marijuana, and show a supervisor’s distress upon hearing that the track had been cleared for use. “Oh my gosh you’ve got to be kidding me,” John Yaeger, an Amtrak day shift foreman whose shift had just begun, told a dispatcher, according to a transcript of radio communications from that morning. “Oh man. The backhoe got plowed. I can’t believe it. ” The documents released on Thursday do not draw conclusions about what caused the crash, though possible factors are cited. The crash occurred around 7:50 a. m. on April 3, when the train struck a backhoe that was being used during a multiday maintenance operation on a neighboring track, according to the documents. During an interview with investigators, Mr. Yaeger suggested there had been confusion in the handoff from a night foreman about whether the track had been cleared for traffic. The backhoe operator, Joseph Carter Jr. 61, and his supervisor, Peter Adamovich, 59, died.   people were taken to hospitals. The preliminary N. T. S. B. documents consist of hundreds of pages of interviews, transcripts and reports, and include the revelation that the train’s operator, Alexander Hunter, tested positive for marijuana that day. Efforts to reach Mr. Hunter on Thursday evening were not immediately successful. The train was traveling south at 106 miles per hour  —   within the authorized limit of 110 m. p. h.  —   when Mr. Hunter applied the emergency brakes after “seeing something” on Main Track 3, according to the documents. He was able to slow the train to only 88 m. p. h. before striking the backhoe. “The collision obliterated the backhoe, sending pieces of the equipment throughout the area and into the west side of the first passenger coach,” according to an analysis report. Amtrak estimated the damage at $2. 5 million."

Eric Worrall writes:
Reuters reports that the upcoming COP21 Paris climate conference, widely hyped by greens and politicians to be the conference which will achieve the great international climate breakthrough, is already in trouble – that the USA is one of the few countries which could be bothered to submit their climate action plan homework by the agreed deadline.

According to Reuters;
“… emitters such as China, India, Russia, Brazil, Canada and Australia say they are waiting until closer to a Paris summit in December, meant to agree a global deal.
“It’s not the ideal situation,” said Niklas Hoehne, founding partner of the New Climate Institute in Germany which tracks submissions, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs).
In 2013, the United Nations invited INDCs by March 31, 2015, from governments “ready to do so” – the early, informal deadline was meant to give time to compare pledges and toughen weak ones.
Late submissions complicate the Paris summit because it will be far harder to judge late INDCs.
“The earlier the better,” said Jake Schmidt, of the U.S. National Resources Defense Council. “It allows people to look at each others’ targets and judge whether or not they pass muster.”
The White House official noted that both the United States and China already outlined plans last year, saying: “That adds up to a fantastic running start.”
http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/03/29/climatechange-emissions-idINKBN0MP0D020150329
The lack of enthusiasm by major CO2 emitters strongly suggests that the Paris meeting will simply be a dreary repeat of the pointless Lima circus – but then, we already knew that, didn’t we?

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeologist and climate science site “Die kalte Sonne” operator Dr. Sebastian Lüning has written an e-mail to Deutsche Welle (DW) German public radio in response to their claims of “glaciers melting faster than ever before” made in a recent broadcast.

Mont Blanc Massif, Photo by Gnomefililiere, CC BY-SA 3.0
Just days ago Kenneth Richard posted on the subject here and showed using published scientific literature that this is likely far from being true.
In recent years, the documented rise in sea levels contributed from glacier and ice sheet melt has not come close to reaching the high levels attained during the 1920s and 1930s period as documented by Gregory et al., 2013.”
Unfortunately Deutsche Welle was sloppy in that they didn’t bother to fact-check, and so as a result they put out overly alarmist information to the public.
I translated Dr. Lünning’s e-mail message in English:

Sent: 22 March 2016
Topic: Film “Das große Gletscher-Schmelzen” [The great glacier melt] from 27 February 2016
Dear editorial board,
Concerning the above mentioned broadcast, the film commentary claims beginning at the 1:55 mark: ‘Globally glaciers are losing ice faster than ever before’. That is not correct, as in the past in the Alps there have always been characteristic ice melt phases – the last 1000 years ago during the Medieval Warm Period. 5000 years ago (during the mid-Holocene climate optimum) Glaciers in the Alps were in fact almost completely melted away. The claim made in the film does not meet the latest level scientific knowledge. I also very much wondered as to why you completely left out the crucial paleo-climatological context in the report, thus as a result making the current ice melt appear more threatening than it really is.
I would like to receive your comment on this, which I would like to publish at www.kaltesonne.de.
Yours sincerely
Dr. habil. Sebastian Lüning

"The arguments for increasing food demand are well publicised and well understood. By the middle of this century, the planet’s population will top nine billion, presenting a third more mouths to feed. Much of the world is getting richer, which leads to changes in diet such as increasing meat and dairy consumption, foodstuffs that use up more resources than crops. Countries are also becoming increasingly urbanised, leading people to want food that is cheap, convenient and, inevitably, wasted. Current trends project that by 2050 demand for food may increase 60-110%. On the other hand, there is a finite amount of land. The increase in yields from the Green Revolution of the 20th century has been driven by improvements in crops and agricultural techniques, not by putting more land into use for farming. There isn’t much scope to further increase the area of agricultural land globally. If we need more food and aren’t using more land to grow it, then increasing the overall crop yield must come through intensifying production. But – and it is a big but – the intensive nature of the Green Revolution has come at a high cost: soils are degraded in many areas, water bodies are polluted and the functioning of marine systems is affected, air quality is reduced, and biodiversity is affected by land clearance and heavy use of agro-chemicals. Agriculture accounts for about one third of all greenhouse gas emissions, which plays a major role in climate change. The land provides food, fuel, forage, fibre, water, flood protection, climate regulation and holds cultural value. These are goods and services which we value, but in many cases don’t pay the cost of. They are underpinned by environmental and ecological services, “ecosystem services”, that are like interest accruing from a capital sum in the bank. If we spend the natural capital, eventually the services will decline and fail. The trouble is that it is very easy to spend the natural capital, assuming it has little current or future impact. Soils can be mined for nutrients or allowed to erode. Fertilisers can be applied to boost yield, but which affect the quality of the air, nearby vegetation and water. Pests can be killed by pesticides, but can also affect pollinators like bees and the pest’s natural enemies, which in turn leads to the need for more pesticides. Biodiversity is eroded bit by bit until populations are driven locally, regionally, and nationally extinct. Recognising that intensive agriculture has often come at a high environmental cost, the argument goes that if demand drives us toward intensification we should do it sustainably and preserve the ecosystem services that we value. “Sustainable intensification” is promoted as the way out of the paradox. But is such a thing possible? It’s absolutely true that agriculture can do far more to be sustainable. Using resources more efficiently is clearly possible: applying fertilisers in the right amounts, in the right places and at the right times, minimising the impact of pesticides, using efficient irrigation systems and water storage to avoid unsustainable water extraction, and managing soils better. All these are possible, and technology is improving all the time to help. But going beyond “reducing the harm” to “improving the natural capital” means costs – either in investment, or in lost profits. To preserve natural capital means setting aside land managed as habitats to boost biodiversity. It requires forests to be left, not converted to timber yields, soils to be invested in loss-bearing fallow years, and so on. Organic farming, for many seen to protect natural capital best, yields 50-80% of conventional intensive practices. Producing food as sustainably as possible would require farming in ways similar to organic farming, but with some land taken out of production to provide sufficient habitat at the landscape scale. So can we have an intensified agricultural system that can feed our growing population and natural capital we can bank on? Where there is unlimited demand, there will always be an economic incentive to ensure land turns a profit. Profit and sustainability do not naturally go hand in hand, as sustainability implies forgoing the potential of gains from eroding – selling – our natural capital. “I’d like to be more sustainable but can’t afford to”. Until we recognise that the cost of food is subsided by the environment and find ways to pay the real value of what it is that we value, the economic incentive to profit will always trump sustainability. The tragedy of the commons is with us still. Tim Benton, the UK Champion for Food Security, discusses this topic tonight in a talk at UEA, Norwich, 7.30pm (free)."

In recent months, the most influential political party in the country may not be the Republican Party or the Democratic Party, but the Tea Party. This murky, largely leaderless grassroots movement has been the driving force behind the derailment of President Barack Obama’s dearest agenda items, notably health care reform and climate change legislation.



What are the goals of this movement? In part, that is the wrong question. The Tea Party effort rejects the notion that a politician or a pundit should define their movement. Rather, citizens themselves will tell us what the movement means.



As their name suggests, these citizens want to revive the ideas at the heart of the American Revolution: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. One chapter in Texas adopted these principles: limited government; fiscal responsibility; personal responsibility and the rule of law.





The quality that gives the Tea Party movement its legitimacy is that it is so fundamentally illegitimate.



Tea Party groups are conducting online polling and deliberations to determine the priorities of the movement. This process will create a “Contract from America” to serve as a template for reforms to come. The most popular ideas now include a flat tax, congressional term limits and abolishing the U.S. Department of Education.



Those ideals and policies sound like what the Republican Party once espoused but have not practiced for at least a decade.



Not surprisingly, establishment conservatives have recently tried to make hay of the Tea Party movement’s apparent lack of a recognizable face or national headquarters. Grover Norquist, the Rasputin behind countless conservative organizing activities, has offered tips to Tea Party organizers. Old (and perhaps new again) Republican apparatchiks like Dick Armey and Newt Gingrich have proclaimed their oneness with the Tea Party faithful and essentially offered their services as the movement’s leaders. No doubt many Republican leaders would like to direct the energy of the Tea Party against the Obama administration and to receive the votes of these idealists come November.



We pray thee, Tea Partiers: Do not go there.



The quality that gives the Tea Party movement its legitimacy is that it is so fundamentally illegitimate: outside the establishment, bereft of representation on K Street, and without an identifiable face to speak for it on _Meet the Press_. This is a movement that sprang deep from within the viscera of America, not from some political poll or focus group.



It is not Republican; it is not even conservative. It has no interest in debating the merits of No Child Left Behind, abstinence‐​only sex education or George W. Bush’s rationale for going to Iraq. Replacing a “spend and borrow” Democrat with a “spend and borrow” Republican is not the goal of the Tea Party movement.



This movement is simply saying: “We are fine without you, Washington. Now for the love of God, go attend a reception somewhere, and stop making health care and entrepreneurship more expensive than they already are.”



Machiavelli once said a republic stays healthy by returning to its first principles from time to time. The Tea Party movement is trying to get our nation back to its first principles to prevent our decline. For their trouble, they have been denounced by many in the media and the Obama administration.



But they will continue to fight. They still believe in the promise of America. That faith may spread as Election Day approaches in the second and perhaps final year of what is supposed to be the Age of Obama.



What began as angry town meetings and grew into a political movement may end as a third political party in 2012. Maybe then Washington will finally listen.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online German national daily Die Welt has a piece by business journalist Holger Zschäpitz on Germany’s sky-high, ever climbing electricity prices.
Hat-tip: Reader Stefan B.
Awhile ago it looked as if prices had finally stabilized. But now Zschäpitz writes that German electricity prices, already among the highest in the world, have jumped once again.
To put the situation in perspective he writes: “Power consumers are now more burdened than automobile drivers” — who are brutally taxed to begin with. In Germany, even in these times of rock-bottom petroleum prices, motorists still cough up some 5 euros ($5.60) every single US gallon for gasoline they buy. Recently, proposals have been made to tax large cars even more, and to massively subsidize electric cars (which would be forced to charge up on the exorbitantly expensive electricity).
According to a recent analysis, writes Zschäpitz, “Consumers are now paying more for their power than ever before” — some 30.27 euro cents per kilowatt hour. Families today are paying 21% more for electricity than they did 5 years ago.
So what is driving the rapid upward price spiral?

Zschäpitz reports that it’s due mostly to the “Energiewende” – Germany’s push away from nuclear and fossil generated power to renewables such as wind, solar and biogas. Also driving the price are the energy price breaks that are granted to big power consumers, and liability costs for offshore wind parks. Moreover Zschäpitz reports that consumers are also forced to pick up the tab for upgrading the power grid so that it is able to handle the wildly fluctuating power supply from wind and sun.
In the meantime, Germany’s CO2 emissions have been rising, and thus consumers are not really getting anything for the massive amounts of money.
To illustrate the distortion gripping the German power market, Zschäpitz tells readers that today only 27% of the power price is made up of “pure raw material costs”. The electricity production cost by itself has in fact “fallen by 25% over the past few years“. However this cost reduction has been offset and more by other feed-in and grid operating surcharges levied as a result of the Energiewende. This leads Die Welt’s Zschäpitz to conclude:
Thus power consumers are now more burdened with state taxes and fees than automobile drivers.”
For relief, power consumers do have the option of switching to private power providers, and doing so is non-problematic, Zschäpitz writes. However one thing is sure: Electricity prices are expected to keep rising.

"For decades the UK has been accustomed to filling its coffers with the bounty from North Sea oil and gas, and the jobs and tax receipts it has brought. At one time exports helped balance the books and provided energy security on our doorstep. But production peaked at the equivalent of 4.72 million barrels per day in 1999 and the subsequent decline has in recent years accelerated, as the figures from BP’s statistical review of world energy 2013 show (below). These days the UK is a net importer of oil and gas, and coal, accounting for £22 billion of the £59.8 billion deficit in the 2012 balance of payments. These spiralling energy costs are what led the energy minister, Ed Davey, to invite Sir Ian Wood to conduct a review of the North Sea oil industry in order to make recommendations that would ensure the maximum resource is recovered from the North Sea.  It’s worth noting that Sir Ian’s interim report, published in November, presents a figure of 41 billion barrels equivalent to the end of 2012, while the official government estimate is 42 billion, and BP’s data suggests 43.6 billion (based on BP’s conversion ratio of 1 billion cubic metres of gas = 6.6m barrels of oil). Since statistics are very important (and an error margin of a billion or two is fairly significant), the Wood Review might want to start by addressing the quality of energy reporting standards. Sir Ian’s review team interviewed 40 companies that account for 95% of the North Sea’s oil production and examined the Department of Energy and Climate Change’s role as regulator. They found that the conflicting private interests of the many private companies extracting resources from the UK continental shelf do not necessarily line up with the UK’s sovereign interest in extracting the most resources possible. The report found DECC as regulator was “significantly under-resourced and under-powered to effectively manage” North Sea operations.  Looking at the department’s organisational structure you have to look hard to find three posts of 109 that are assigned to oil and gas – extraordinary considering the North Sea meets two-thirds of UK oil and half of UK gas demand. Only 50 personnel are assigned to the task of overseeing more than 300 UK oil and gas fields, compared with 220 personnel in Norway and 100 in The Netherlands. A key recommendation of the report is to create a new “arms-length” regulator staffed by top industry professionals and funded by the industry itself. It would promote and facilitate collaboration between licence holders to develop resources that are currently stranded and ensure the maximum return for the UK over the next 30 years. For example a small field may lie close to a platform owned by a third party or parties. The new regime would require the platform owner to assist the field owner to bring the field into production to the benefit of both parties and the State. The report lists eight commitments that operating companies would be expected to make, including commitments to Maximum Economic Return for the UK, infrastructure sharing, and collaborative working with the regulator and each other. The interim report suggests there is the potential to extract at least 3 to 4 billion barrels of oil more than would otherwise be recovered, worth around £200 billion to the UK’s economy at today’s prices. One of my main criticisms of the report is that it does not define what “would otherwise be recovered” actually means. I have suggested that UK Oil and Gas Reserves would produce about 4.5 billion barrels at current extraction rates, similar to proven reserves reported by DECC and BP. So “3-4 billion more” would mean around 8.5 billion barrels if Sir Ian’s recommendations were to be implemented, totalling perhaps 10 billion if we reasonably allow a further 1-2 billion more in reserves yet to be found. There will be one or two undiscovered giant fields lurking out there somewhere. Sir Ian is explicit about where this additional oil comes from, naming enhanced oil recovery (1-6.5 billion in best case scenario), increased exploration (1-1.5 billion), better use of infrastructure (0.5-2 billion), and postponing decommissioning by five years (1 billion). Enhanced oil recovery is necessary to retrieve the remnants of oil from mature fields. The bulk of the oil is left behind as micro-droplets either stuck to mineral grains or encased by water in rock pores. A variety of chemical methods can be used to get this oil moving up to the surface. For example, BP injects methane gas in the Magnus Field, and is proposing to inject fresh, as opposed to salt, water in their west of Shetland fields. Potentially the greatest reward comes from injecting CO2. In my opinion, the government would do well to divert its attention from carbon capture and storage to using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery. But Sir Ian also estimates “a further 12-24 billion” barrels, without giving any reference or figures. If state regulation of the North Sea and operating practises of the companies are to be overhauled then there must be a means for measuring the effectiveness of Sir Ian’s changes. We need to know what will happen if we do nothing – and what will happen if we act boldly and quickly as he proposes."
"For much of the 20th century, faith has rested in bigger and better defences to hold back floodwaters. But repeated flooding has shown that large defences cannot, and should not, be the sole focus. The first, and for most people the only, tools in the box to protect homes have been the thousands of sandbags handed out over the past few weeks. While some householders have taken great steps to fashion makeshift defences, sometimes with the aid of mechanical diggers, perhaps most magnificent is the 600-metre-long inflatable Aqua Dam erected by engineers in Chertsey in Surrey, quickly nicknamed the Chertsey Sausage. There has been much analysis of how the Environment Agency has commissioned flood defences, with it requiring works to demonstrate a cost-benefit ratio where each £1 spent should reap £8 in savings. This naturally tends to lead to spending in urban areas where higher populations mean greater damages. Perhaps it indicates that different approaches may be necessary in town and country. With increasing urbanisation comes brick and paving in place of fields and vegetation that could help soak away water, which exacerbates the effects of flooding. This has revealed a newly identified risk, that of surface water flooding, caused not by inundation from rivers or the sea but from the over-development of land, where water builds up faster than it can drain away.  It’s something that already affects thousands of homes around the country: in 2001, surface water was not a recognised threat, but by 2011 3.8m properties were considered at risk. Surface water flooding can occur often but might only affect one or two streets at a time, meaning that it’s rare that incidents get national attention. But importantly, it’s something that substantial flood defences – sea walls, canalisation, embankments – cannot prevent, as it emerges behind these flood defence “frontlines”.  A report from the UK’s Climate Change Committee indicated that over the past ten years, new building and development on flood-risk areas has increased by 12%, compared to an increase of 7% in areas not at risk. We are setting ourselves up for problems later.    Our project, SMARTeST examined how the latest flood protection measures could be retrofitted to properties to make them more resilient to flooding, or how similar defences could be incorporated at a street level. The flood resilience industry is an emerging sector in Europe whose products – such as door guards, air brick covers, and temporary perimeter barriers – are promising, when used correctly. For example, water can come through permeable brickwork which may require waterproofing. Air brick covers can also prevent water from coming in but still allow ventilation. The pressure of floodwaters often causes drainage systems to back up through toilets or plugholes, so one-way valves or toilet bungs are easy ways to prevent sewerage backflow that can cause horrible and expensive damage. There are technologies that can be directly applied, which include sealants for potential areas of ingress through walls and floors, waterproofing materials and membranes, and integrated warning systems. It is now possible to get cavity wall insulation that also prevents water penetration. The costs of retrofitting vary depending on the type of building, and the level of protection required. Many properties will require a package of technologies. Those that are manually rather than automatically operated tend to be cheaper, but rely on good warning systems and community flood groups to ensure they are activated when needed. More complex considerations include terraced or semi-detached housing: where there are shared party walls, protection applied to one property may be compromised if neighbours do not take similar steps.  The average cost of fitting flood defence equipment to a property in a trial government scheme amounted to just under £5,000, but some estimates can go up to £30,000. While expensive, this higher up-front cost is compares well to the financial damage, estimated at between £30,000-40,000 on each occasion, and especially the emotional damage of being flooded out of house and home. Taking into account the rising sea levels and more extreme weather that climate change is expected to bring, these products could start looking like a smart investment. While not a replacement for large scale flood defences, they may be more appropriate in the countryside, or in low-lying areas and where surface water is prevalent. Unfortunately, the flood resilience industry is not well supported by standards or regulations. These products are hard to acquire, cannot be bought off-the-shelf, and often properties will need to combine a number of different measures to be protected. The National Flood Forum charity provides advice for householders looking for flood protection measures, or who are having trouble getting insurance. They publish the Blue Pages, a directory of companies that provide flood defence products. And we also found householders were often let down: poor-quality property surveys, recommending inappropriate devices, or poor installation. Property owners complained that impartial advice was hard to find, leading to a general lack of trust in the industry’s products. One of our project’s outcomes was the Six Steps guide, to help navigate these difficult waters. There are many missed opportunities: if households are being retrofitted for energy efficiency measures, it seems sensible to consider their resilience to flooding too. Building regulations need to be strengthened, and the public need to be more aware of what is available. The example “flood resilient” home currently planned at BRE’s innovation park in Watford as a joint venture between BRE, Aquobex and Baca Architects will be demonstration of what is possible. One hope to emerge from these floods is that the opportunity is taken to provide a considered and measured response to improve the flood resilience of those most at risk, and ultimately decrease the financial and emotional costs that flooding brings. The authors thank Stephen Garvin, scheme director at BRE for his expertise."

 **Viv Forbes**  
Executive Director, The Saltbush Club



 _Viv Forbes has been an explorer and pastoralist in Queensland and NT for most of his long life. He has lit fires (accidentally and deliberately), and he and his wife have fought fires and had their camps, fences and pastures wiped out by fires. They were both members of a local bush fire brigade for over 25 years. (Judy was even qualified)._



There was a time when Australian foresters kept Australian forests safe and productive. They maintained access tracks bridges and fire breaks, undertook prescribed burning, cleared flammable litter from the forest floor, cut suckers, manned fire lookouts and maintained their own fire-fighting crews in decentralised districts. University-trained professional foresters were supported by tough experienced rangers who learned their job in the bush.



Almost every advance in bushfire management in Australia, from the science of fire behaviour to aerial burning was thanks to our foresters. Into the 1980’s they were regarded as international leaders.



To pay for good forest management, sections of the forest were logged, allowing ground space and sunlight for the swift re-growth of new trees.



And those fading die-hards still beating alarm drums about man-made global warming should be reassured – the use of hardwood and softwood timber in power poles, telephone poles, bridges, wharves, posts, sleepers, haysheds and houses provided long term sequestration of the dreaded carbon. Moreover, growing trees extract CO2 more quickly than mature trees. Win, win, win.



Then we entered the Green Era. Foresters and timber-getters were demonised by urban greens, their tame bureaucrats and academics, and their ABC mates. State forests were converted to National Parks and Wilderness Areas and John Howard created the hated Kyoto Protocol Forests on private land. Timber imports rose.



Every locked-up, un-managed, un-burnt forest inevitably breeds disastrous wild-fires. The combination of heavy fuel load, poor access for fire fighters, drought, hot winds, arsonists and dry lightning has only one assured outcome – a bushfire tragedy for the forest and the neighbours. (Why are no greens chaining themselves to trees now?)



This must change. No enquiries are needed. Anyone without green blinkers can see the evidence daily. So, cut the locks, open the tracks and remove the trash. Then call tenders from local people to use recreation, tourism, timber getting or hunting feral animals to fund proper care and maintenance of our forests. A well-managed forest can pay for its own management and also keep the community safe and happy.



Control must be local. Local Foresters and local fire Wardens must call the shots on when/how to reduce flammable litter, weeds and suckers. Everyone should have the right (maybe the obligation), to fire proof their own properties and boundaries. There should be no more national parks – just local parks. And arson should be treated as terrorism.



The State governments can provide weather forecasts, bushfire warnings, radar information, aerial support and TV performances.



The Feds should return some of their tax receipts to help us to restore the forests we have lost, but otherwise they should keep out of the way.



The urban greens have had their moment in the sun. They seized management of Australian forests from Australian Foresters, and have had every opportunity over the last 25 years to apply their evergreen theories on bushfire management. The result is there for everyone to observe – **total and tragic failure.**



Far too many bushfires start in National Parks. Few stay in the Parks.



It’s time to get sensible forest policies and professional forest managers back on the job.



Get rid of the Red Bull and the Green Fairies – bring back the White Knights.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate science critics Dr. Sebastian Lüning and professor Fritz Vahrenholt here present today some findings that climate alarmists are not very amused over: Climate alarmism has waned and is no longer making any headlines.
The two co-authors of “The Neglected Sun” write at their site:
========================================
“People aren’t dumb. Climate alarmism just isn’t working. The public is fed up with the constant unending apocalypse, for which there are still no reliable indications. Gradually the alarm has been disappearing from the headlines.
Here the UN is getting very worried because with the help of climate panic they wish to justify huge finance transfers from the rich to the poor. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has expressed these concerns in a press release. It is indeed absurd that the climate change is being hyped as the ‘greatest problem for humanity’ at a time when the world is currently suffering from rampant terrorism and migration crises. What on earth is going through the heads of the climate romanticists? Do they not want to or are they just unable to see the reality? Is it all about money? Or power? Read the following from the IFAD press release April 6, 2016, which will leave you amazed:
‘Despite being “the biggest threat facing humanity” climate change and its impacts fail to make headlines, says IFAD study
Even as 60 million people around the world face severe hunger because of El Niño and millions more because of climate change, top European and American media outlets are neglecting to cover the issues as a top news item, says a new research report funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) today.

“It’s incredible that in a year when we have had record temperatures, 32 major droughts, and historic crop losses that media are not positioning climate change on their front pages,” said IFAD President, Kanayo F. Nwanze. “Climate change is the biggest threat facing our world today and how the media shape the narrative remains vitally important in pre-empting future crises.”
The report, “The Untold Story: Climate change sinks below the headlines” provides an analysis of the depth of media reporting around climate change in two distinct periods: two months before the 21st session of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, and two months after. Specifically, it explores whether issues connecting climate change, food security, agriculture and migration made headlines, and if so, how much prominence these stories were given.
Among some of its key findings:
• Climate change stories were either completely absent or their numbers decreased in major media outlets in Europe and the United States before and after COP21.
• Coverage on the consequences of climate change, such as migration, fell by half in the months after COP21 and people directly impacted by climate change rarely had a voice in stories or were not mentioned at all.
• News consumers want climate change issues and solutions to be given more prominence in media outlets and, in particular, want more information on the connections between climate change, food insecurity, conflict and migration.
The release of the report comes just days before world leaders gather at the United Nations in New York to sign off on the Paris Agreement coming out of COP21. In December, the agreement made headlines and led news bulletins across the globe. But leading up to COP21 and in the months following it, coverage on climate change significantly fell off the radar of major media outlets across Europe and the United States. […]

Share this...FacebookTwitterO/t today. I want to share how I lost 20 lbs and totally reduced my triglyceride level, an important factor for heart health.
In his video here, Prof. Ken Sikaris explains why triglyceride level in the blood today is a critical barometer for monitoring your cardiovascular risk and why cholesterol levels are not the crucial factors to watch. Almost everything we’ve been told about evil fat and cholesterol over the past 4 decades is wrong.
So much for consensus.
Sikaris gives us insight on why a high-fat/low-carb diet is healthier for most people. LDL cholesterol, he says, is actually good and has been given a bad name. The real enemy is sugar and refined carbohydrates.
I also used to believe all the cholesterol, low-fat consensus nonsense and 4 years ago found myself some 20 pounds overweight at the age of 52. I had resigned to accepting a future of deteriorating health – just all part of getting older. Then one day my blood pressure got stuck at 180 over 110, and I had the feeling my heart was threatening to go on strike. After an EKG and other tests my doctor put me on beta-blockers and advised me to lose weight by cutting out fat from the diet. Immediately I intensified the old low-fat diet – but no matter how hard I tried to lose weight, nothing worked.
Then 2 years ago, (age 54) I saw a video by Dr. David Diamond (hat-tip DirkH) which resonated, and it showed me how for years and years I had had it all wrong. In it Diamond tells the story of how he solved his weight and heart problems: by going on a high-fat / low carb-diet.
So I also gave it shot and eliminated much of the high carb foods, replacing them with the very foods we were told were killers: eggs, cheese, butter, meat, high fat dairy products, etc. Potatoes got replaced by lots of vegetables and moderate levels of fruit. Nuts and dark (80+%) chocolate has since become a common snack for me.

//-->




The results were almost immediate. Everything Diamond said was indeed true. Some two years later, today, I’m pleased to present the latest results:

As the chart shows, 2 years ago I was closing in on 90 kilograms (198 lbs.) and my triglyceride level was at an unhealthy 285 mg/dl. In late March 2014 I switched over to the HFLC diet and within 4 months (by August 2014) lost over 6 kilograms (close to 15 lbs) and triglycerides dropped to 122, below the recommended 150 upper limit.
The best thing is that I didn’t need to count calories. I simply ate until I felt satisfied. The cravings and blood sugar roller coaster disappeared. I avoid glutens as well, which for surprisingly many people can make a big difference.
Last week I got back the latest blood results and I’ve plotted my triglycerides, which is now down to a very healthy 94, see above. I’m also off the beta blockers and blood pressure is back to normal. There have been also lots of other benefits, like more energy, better digestion, much happier, etc. Today my weight is stable at about 175 lbs (80 kg).
What’s shocking is that there are still lots of doctors who still believe and preach all the cholesterol nonsense from 40 years ago.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn the today’s hard copy edition of the Nordesee Zeitung, a north German daily, in a letter to the editor veteran and retired German meteorologist Klaus-Eckard Puls writes a 3-point response to recent alarmist claims made by IPCC climate scientist Prof. Mojib Latif.
Image: partial shot of letter appearing in the 22 March 2016 edition of the Nordsee Zeitung.
Prof. Latif recently claimed in Bremerhaven that the future of the planet was at stake, and unless drastic action is taken quickly, “the basis for existence for many people will be destroyed by climate change”
Pause has not ended
In his letter to the daily Nordsee Zeitung, Puls reminds readers that the IPCC confirms the 15-year pause in global temperature in its most recent report and that “the warm 2015 El Nino year changes nothing“. Puls notes that even IPCC climate scientist Latif was correct in characterizing the El Niño phenomenon as a “weather event” and that “it has nothing to do with climate“.
Climate refugees claims false

In the second point, concerning climate refugees, Puls reminds: “Previous UN prognoses of 50 million environmental refugees by 2010 proved to be false. In countries that are in the so-called danger zone the number of inhabitants is actually growing.”
No detectable anthropogenic sea level rise signal
In his third point of rebuttal, Puls tells readers that sea level rise has steadily slowed down since the end of the last ice age, and that there has been “no detectable anthropogenic rise signal“.
Interestingly the newspaper left out Puls’s title as a degreed meteorologist. Titles are rarely left out in such situations in Germany.
Klaus-Eckard Puls is also the staff of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE).

"They treaded water for seven hours before a neighbor heard their screams. On Oct. 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded Staten Island. As the storm surge peaked at 14 feet in the borough  —   among the highest levels across New York City  —   the water crashed through the walls of their house, and DeBraan Varvaro and her younger sister, Carolyn Varvaro, clung to the gutter of their roof and did not let go. They waved frantically as helicopters circled overhead, but no one saw or heard them over the roaring water. “We could swim before we could walk,” the elder Ms. Varvaro said of her childhood on Staten Island’s beaches and teenage years as a lifeguard. “We’re ocean people. That’s why we survived. ” Her sister grew tired in the water, and Ms. Varvaro held her up as she treaded water. In the second hour, a garden statue of the Virgin Mary floated past. The younger Ms. Varvaro saw it as a sign they would survive. She kicked with renewed hope. Finally, at 6 p. m. a neighbor, crouched in his attic, heard the women’s screams. He helped them get the attention of more neighbors, and a young man swam through the water, filled with sewage, dead fish and gasoline, to pull them out. They were safe. But everything changed after the storm. They no longer felt safe. Over four years later, the night of the hurricane, and all the nights after, still haunt them. The elder Ms. Varvaro, now 61, a pack of her favorite Seneca cigarettes within reach, recalled in a recent interview the continuing terror, while propping her legs on a stool to ease back pain from a 1993 car accident. She cried, stopping at times midthought to find the words to describe her ordeal. Ms. Varvaro had feared displacing her sister, who is schizophrenic, so they decided to stay. The night before Hurricane Sandy hit, however, they called 911 for help, but the line was busy and they could not get through. They were among 236, 000 residents in impacted zones who did not evacuate their home before the storm, according to city estimates. Now, the sound of sirens still puts Ms. Varvaro in a panic, jolting her back to the hours spent treading water and praying for help. When she tries to sleep, she said, she hears “the    of the helicopters circling overhead. ” She did not return to the beach until last summer. “I couldn’t even get to the boardwalk,” she said. “I’d have to stop. I could still smell the storm. ” In 2012, Ms. Varvaro was told that she had   stress disorder. Even before the storm, her life had its difficulties. Pregnant at 23, she almost lost the pregnancy twice because of medical complications, but gave birth to a healthy daughter. The next year, in 1979, she learned she had cervical cancer, underwent surgery and fought it off. But it returned aggressively 10 years later, and she fought it again. Everything seemed fine until 2000, when the cancer returned a third time. She has been free of cancer since surgery in May 2000, and hopes to keep the disease in the past. “I’ve met the devil and survived,” she said with a shrug. “I came out the winner. ” Before her last bout with cancer, she met Kevin Killea, a sales representative, and they were together for 16 years. He died of pneumonia in 2010, and she has been alone since, except for her sister. Ms. Varvaro has been protecting and caring for her sister, who is four years her junior, since they were young. As a child, her sister often had high fevers and seizures that led to a loss of hearing Ms. Varvaro learned sign language so they could communicate. Surgery restored her hearing several years later. Ms. Varvaro has also helped her sister cope with paranoid schizophrenia and clinical depression, diagnoses she received after their mother died in 1999. “They’re only labels,” Ms. Varvaro said. “I tell my sister, ‘Other people need them. You don’t. ’” She added: “I’m a shy person until it comes to my sister, and then the bulldog comes out. I fight for the people I love. I will go for the jugular and ask God for forgiveness later. ” When her sister, who had been living in a supportive apartment program, had a nervous breakdown in 2003, after verbal abuse and neglect, she moved her to another such program. Ms. Varvaro said she had lodged a complaint with local officials against the previous program. It was later shut down. But in August 2009, her sister had another breakdown at the second residence. Ms. Varvaro then brought her home to live with her in her apartment on Staten Island. When they moved in together, Ms. Varvaro promised to keep her sister safe. After the storm, she felt she had failed her. She asked for her sister’s forgiveness. “I think all the struggles I’ve survived in life were in preparation for taking care of my sister,” Ms. Varvaro said. By attending to her sister’s needs, however, Ms. Varvaro suppressed her own anxiety. In 2014, a friend referred her to an art class and other services provided by the Jewish Community Center of Staten Island, a beneficiary agency of   of New York, one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Working in watercolors and pastels, she painted a small sailboat flitting in the choppy water of a dark storm. “I’m no Picasso,” she said. “But it got me out of this house. It got me out of myself. ” The art classes have been a welcome break from financial troubles that were compounded after the hurricane. The family received $10, 000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to cover losses  —   well under what the sisters needed. They were unable to return to their first apartment together and the garden they tended daily with colorful annuals and window boxes by the kitchen. Since 2009, Ms. Varvaro’s back injury and other health problems have kept her from working as an emergency medical technician, a job she had held for 13 years. Her sister has never been able to work because of her mental illness. Together they receive $1, 736 in Social Security income and disability benefits. They also receive $375 a month in food stamps and a $575 rent subsidy from the city. They now share a     apartment that is accessible only by a long, narrow staircase, which is difficult for the elder Ms. Varvaro to climb because of her arthritis and fibromyalgia. The Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, another   beneficiary, provided them with $850 in Neediest funds to cover one month’s rent in 2014. In September, they also received $1, 170 from the fund to replace the younger Ms. Varvaro’s broken bed and to buy a therapeutic mattress for her sister, which has greatly improved her sleep. The elder Ms. Varvaro hopes they can eventually move into a     apartment. “I’ve been to hell and back,” she said. “Now I just want to help my sister have peace of mind. I’m ready to live again. ”"

The GISS-Institute of NASA is playing a shady role in the climate debate. For years it was directed by creedal climate activist James Hansen, and has since squandered much credibility. Now his years-long colleague Gavin Schmidt is at the helm, also an activist. Dubious data alterations with the GISS datasets will likely become interesting material for science historians.
GISS went public with a press release on December 18, 2015. The first part of the release was quite reasonable. Indeed we should not neglect calibrating the models with the known temperature history. Various climate factors have been at play and all had impacts in their own way:
Examination of Earth’s Recent History Key to Predicting Global Temperatures
Estimates of future global temperatures based on recent observations must account for the differing characteristics of each important driver of recent climate change, according to a new NASA study published Dec. 14 in the journal Nature Climate Change. To quantify climate change, researchers need to know the Transient Climate Response (TCR) and Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of Earth. Both values are projected global mean surface temperature changes in response to doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations but on different timescales. TCR is characteristic of short-term predictions, up to a century out, while ECS looks centuries further into the future, when the entire climate system has reached equilibrium and temperatures have stabilized.”
Very good, we thought. Did GISS finally realize that CO2 sensitivity had been over-estimated for years? See our earlier reports on the subject:

Climate debate turning point? Climate models moving closer to reality
Late but important recognition: CO2 climate sensitivity, extreme heat models being scrapped, ocean cycles seen as an important systematic climate factor
Studies from 2014 provide hope: Warming effect of CO2 indeed very much over-estimated. Official correction forthcoming

No chance. After the good introduction came the return to the climate alarmism mode: Climate sensitivity is not lower, rather it is higher than previously thought, Schmidt & Co spin. Anyone wishing to read the sad story in its entirety can do so at their press release.

"New York City apartments are notorious for their quirks and annoyances, from awkward layouts to windows that face a brick wall. When it’s time to sell, these can be major turnoffs for potential buyers. But, with a little creativity, many of these issues can be minimized, and you don’t have to spend a lot of money to do it. THE PROBLEM Low ceilings THE SOLUTION White paint, tall window dressings and   furniture Using a lighter shade of paint on the ceilings than the walls tends to draw the eye upward and make the ceiling look higher. “Use flat, not semigloss, on the crown molding, in the same shade as the ceiling,” recommends Pat Christodoulou, who stages   homes in Connecticut and New York. “This gives you an uninterrupted perspective, which results in visually raising the ceiling. ” If you don’t have moldings, she said, adding a cove molding, which begins on the wall and extends to the ceiling, will create an elongating effect. Minimalist furnishings that sit low to the floor will help increase the impression of height.    sheers will also “give the illusion of larger windows and higher ceilings,” said Elizabeth Kee, a broker at CORE in Manhattan, who recently hung   curtains in a $   rental in Chelsea to “create an optical illusion that the ceilings are soaring. ” THE PROBLEM Windows that face a brick wall or let in scant light THE SOLUTION Pops of bright color, strategically placed   bulbs or decorative window film “At a window that faced an alleyway or brick wall, we’ve had success with placing a fixture with a daylight florescent bulb behind the curtain,” said Jeff Schleider, the senior vice president of Business Development for Citi Habitats. “It gives the illusion of natural sunlight. ” In a small   on the Upper West Side, where all the windows faced out on an air shaft, Joseph G. Sheehan, a salesman with Bond New York, used “cheery yellow drapes” and sheer white curtains to dress up the windows, and bright throws, pillows and rugs to offer “a nod to sunlight and brightness” in the dark space. The apartment, which had originally been listed by another broker for $399, 000, went into contract for $435, 000 just two weeks after Mr. Sheehan brightened it up. Deanna Kory, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group, recommends white shutters or white wooden Venetian blinds with   to   slats. “Any light that hits the windows will be reflected favorably and create a lighter feeling within the apartment,” she said. Another option: decorative window film, which lets in light while obscuring an unattractive view it can be found at Home Depot from about $25 for elderberry or etched lace designs. Hanging a framed   panel in front of the window offers a similar effect. If you’re willing to splurge, a custom   window may be the solution. That’s what a client of Madeline A. McKenna, a broker at Stribling  Associates, did more than a decade ago in a Midtown apartment with “a very depressing view” from the living room. It wasn’t a cheap fix, she said, noting that the multipane frosted window with    inlay cost about $10, 000. But the investment eventually paid off: In 2005, the client was able to sell the apartment quickly, for about $975, 000. “We didn’t have to apologize or make excuses for the ugly window view onto the ugly, dark, dank air shaft. It became a beautiful centerpiece for the living room instead,” Ms. McKenna said, adding that the unit sold again, in 2012, for $1. 25 million and was   in 2014, at $1. 35 million, with the same frosted window. “Seems everyone likes the aesthetic. ” THE PROBLEM An awkward layout THE SOLUTION Rework the floor plan The Yorkville, Manhattan, duplex apartment that Jai Lee, a saleswoman at Mdrn. Residential, listed for $599, 000 in July had plenty of assets: “The bathroom was amazing, with heated floor, enormous deep, deep tub and shower heads on both sides,” she said. But to get to it, “you had to walk past the open kitchen into the barely   bedroom. ” Down a spiral staircase from the living room was a finished basement area with a   and small adjoining den. “It certainly was not ideal,” said Ms. Lee, who came up with the idea of recasting the downstairs space as an unconventional master bedroom, with the master bathroom upstairs, along with a spacious closet (in what was the old master bedroom). “I started selling the idea of using the ‘master’ as your own dream   closet, with spa bathroom,” she said. To help potential buyers picture her vision, she drafted a new floor plan showing the lower level as a potential bedroom with a   and adjacent office or hobby room. “I made sure to only show the listing by appointment,” she added. “This way I could control the narrative and envisioning process. ” The unit sold within a month for the full asking price. THE PROBLEM A   unit with windows facing the street THE SOLUTION Curtains, decorative film or window boxes For   homes, especially those with bars on the windows, Anna Kahn, an associate broker at Halstead Property, recommends installing window boxes. “Live flowers add color and take away from the starkness of the grates,” she said. Another option: “ ” curtains, which are opaque near the floor and sheer at the top, to “allow sunlight to enter the apartment while still providing a sense of privacy,” suggested Mr. Schleider of Citi Habitats. Or consider using opaque film: “We sold an apartment with razor wire outside the bedroom windows,” said Vivian Ducat, a saleswoman at Halstead, who had covered part of the window, obscuring the wire. “Even though everyone opened the windows to see what was out there, they seemed satisfied that the apartment had integrity and could look good, from the look we gave it. ”"

Ah, spring!



I know it’s here when swarms of red‐​breasted robins descend on my Virginia farm, rooting for every worm that survived winter.



No one gains much political traction writing about global warming’s threat to turkey buzzards, but robins are cute, so they’re more often the subject of climate change speculation.



Global warming is not pushing the robin to extinction. Au contraire: It’s expanding the robin’s range northward, into places where it’s never been seen. Robins are venturing so far north that they’ve even been sighted in the Inuit territory of northern Canada, where, Sen. John McCain tells us, there isn’t even a word for the birds.



Yes, even John McCain has feathered his political nest with the robin’s expansion. Back in 2004, after a hearing McCain organized as chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, _The New York Times_ ’ Andrew Revkin noted that he was particularly concerned about the rapid warming of the Arctic.



“The Inuit language for 10,000 years never had a word for ‘robin,’ ” McCain lamented, “and now there are robins all over their villages.” The BBC even titled a program on arctic warming “No Word for ‘Robin’: Climate Change in the Canadian Arctic.”



What a shame! Pretty little birds invading the Arctic, bringing joy with their whoop of spring!



But, of course, it’s not true. Like the tale of the endangered polar bears that happen to be at or near record population levels, the robin story is yet another climate confabulation. It ranks with the death of frogs in the mountains of Colombia now shown to be caused not by global warming, but by the introduction of fatal fungus on the shoes of concerned ecotourists.



It’s always instructive to consult the wisdom of our elders about climate change, and so I found an article, “The Naming of Birds by Nanamuit Eskimo,” by Laurence Irving of the U.S. Public Health Service in Anchorage, Alaska, in a 1953 edition of the refereed journal _Arctic_.



Irving describes his extensive visits with the people of Northern Alaska, residing in the Brooks Range — the most northerly mountain chain in the United States. He compared English names for birds with the Eskimo names of the ones they encountered.



Irving noted that the bird names were given by the Nanamuit elders. They were no birdie‐​come‐​latelys.





The lack of due diligence on the subject of climate change can be breathtaking.



Irving’s list brings us the Nanamuit word for “robin”: “Koyapigaktoruk.” While this may surprise Sen. McCain or the BBC, the Nanamuits saw robins, and this is their phonetic way of describing the tones of an arriving redbreast looking for a mate.



Nesting, and not just some windblown flotsam? Irving designated the robin’s status as “NM,” meaning “nesting migrant.”



The lack of due diligence on the subject of climate change can be breathtaking. In 1913, Vilhjalmur Stefansson published a book, now available at Ama​zon​.com, called _My Life With the Eskimo_. Look it up online and search for “robin,” and on page 493 you will find text describing robin sightings, obviously before 1913 (and before global warming), all over the Canadian Arctic.



Stefansson gives the word as “Kre-ku-ak’tu-yok,” which sounds suspiciously like the 1953 word given by Irving. That’s the Canadian word. It’s “Shab’wak” in Alaskan Eskimo.



There are plenty of words in Inuit, or Eskimo, describing our red‐​breasted harbingers of spring. What’s a little disturbing is how the myth of the robin persists, when it is so easy to find the truth.



My minions in Charlottesville informed _The Times_ of the error six months ago. Finally, on April 3, Andrew Revkin posted an acknowledgement on his blog, but no correction in the newspaper itself. We’ve been holding our breath waiting for it to appear in print, only to turn robin’s-egg blue.



At the same time, how about a little truth‐​telling about the hoax of “Warming Island,” an islet off Greenland that was — erroneously — thought to be a part of Greenland, connected by land lying beneath the ice.



As Greenland warmed over the last decade, the ice melted and revealed open water underneath, thus giving birth to a “new” island. Climate change enthusiasts claimed the channel between island and mainland had not been revealed for countless millennia.



As it turns out, maps show that Warming Island, indeed, was very much an island a mere 50 years ago, when Greenland, in fact, was warmer than it has been for the last 10 years.



As sure as the robin’s song of spring, we continue to hope that America’s best newspaper (and the BBC) will sing out the truth about climate change and the bob, bob, bobbin’ of the red, red Koyapigaktoruk in the North American Arctic.

When the smoke finally clears from the fires burning along Australia’s east coast, there will be the inevitable government inquiries, almost certainly a royal commission. The findings of which will almost certainly be stealthily ignored.



“The amount of prescribed burning occurring in Victoria is inadequate. it is concerned that the State has maintained a minimalist approach to prescribed burning despite recent official or independent reports and inquiries, all of which have recommended increasing the prescribed-burning program. The State has allowed the forests to continue accumulating excessive fuel loads, adding to the likelihood of more intense bushfires and thereby placing firefighters and communities at greater risk.”



– 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission.



In the meantime, though, the rush is to control the narrative, get in first on the blame game. “Our” taxpayer-funded national broadcaster is shamefully joining the scramble, by throwing certain inconvenient facts down the Memory Hole.



It was reported on social media on Monday that ABC Gippsland deleted a news story they shared in September about members of the local Nowa Nowa community protesting strategic asset protection burns in the region.



As the photos show, it was the usual crowd of nosey-nannas and grey-bearded hippies and the rest of what Orwell derided as “that whole, dreary tribe”.



During the protests, ABC Gippsland reported, “The protesters held up signs, positioned themselves in the area that was planned to burn.”



One of the protesters allegedly commented to the ABC, saying she hoped she wouldn’t be fined, but she was more concerned about climate change.



“I’m more worried about climate change, and the impact the burns are having…”



Well, there’s certainly an [impact being felt **now**.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-29/people-told-to-leave-east-gippsland-as-bushfire-risk-rises/11831304)



It should be noted that these Green malcontents stood in the way of reducing the fuel loads which have inflamed the mega-fires now burning in the region, not once, but **twice**.



The burn was stopped according to the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning, awaiting another opportunity to complete it.



On October 23, the ABC reported on a second protest that took place at Nowa Nowa in relation to the rescheduled backburn that was meant to take place in September.



As a result, ABC Gippsland reported that the local community were relieved at the results of their protest…



I wonder how “relieved” their neighbours are feeling now?



After the September story was recently shared on social media in light of the current bushfire emergency, ABC Gippsland allegedly removed the post.



This is not the first time “our” government-funded broadcasters have tried to [hide inconvenient truths about these bushfires](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/australias-taxpayer-funded-media-hide-the-truth-about-bushfires/) from the Australian public.

Yesterday’s DC Court of Appeals ruling throwing out an omnibus petition against EPA’s first tranche of carbon dioxide restrictions rested largely on the Court’s decision that EPA’s “Endangerment Finding” from related global warming stands as is. In particular, it noted that the petitioners’ argument that “uncertainty” about climate change was not sufficient grounds to void the Finding.   
  
  
Indeed, “uncertainty” is thin ice if EPA is in the business of saving us from almost‐​certain doom. A better argument would have been a direct assault on the Finding’s science, or rather, selective science.   
  
  
But this is beyond the capabilities of most litigators, who simply aren’t trained to wade through the enormous technical literature on global warming and its effects. That’s about to change.   
  
  
The next battle with EPA is likely to come over their proposed regulation that would essentially outlaw coal‐​fired electrical generation. Here at Cato, we are preparing the definitive answer to its Endangerment Finding.   
  
  
With regard to climate change impacts in the U.S., the Finding relies primarily on one document, Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States. It was produced by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), a mélange of agencies all dependent upon climate change dollars. This document is about as inclusive as one would expect it to be—i.e. it avoids a massive amount of inconvenient science. You can find it here.   
  
  
Since April, 2011, along with several colleagues around the country, I have been working on the scientific counter to the USGCRP document. It looks like it, section by section. It flows exactly like it. It has more references and notes—almost twice as many—as the USGCRP document. As in the adage, “you can take it to court.”   
  
  
While it’s not yet in final copy, the latest draft is sufficient to give you the idea: this is the document to take down the Endangerment Finding. You can download it here.   
  
  
We expect this document is going to figure heavily in the next round in the fight to prevent EPA from imposing scientifically senseless but economically disastrous restrictions on energy use.

"Australia’s 20-year-old national environmental laws need to be modernised to address climate change as part of the statutory review now under way, the chief minister of the Australian Capital Territory, Andrew Barr, has said. Speaking in Canberra on Friday, Barr also called on the Morrison government to increase funding for agencies responsible for environmental assessments for major projects, saying budget cuts had caused delays to assessments.  “There is and has been quite an important review of that piece of legislation that’s now 20-odd years old,” Barr said. “[The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act] has no reference at all to climate change, for example, which it absolutely has to as part of a review and modernisation of that act.” An interim report from the review, chaired by the former competition watchdog chairman Graeme Samuel, was published in July and found governments had failed to protect Australia’s unique native species. The government is now planning to establish bilateral agreements that would devolve national environmental approval powers to the states and territories. Samuel’s review has recommended this occur under a new set of national environmental standards that set legally enforceable rules for environmental protection. The Morrison government has said devolving approval powers to the states would streamline environmental assessments and cut bureaucracy, a reform it is pushing as part of its economic response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It intends to put legislation to the parliament in late August. Last month the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said there had been “a great deal of enthusiasm” from state and territory leaders at a national cabinet meeting where the plan was discussed. Barr said on Friday it was “a sensible reform that should be talked about” but lengthy assessment times were not necessarily due to the design of the assessment process. “One of the ways to address some of these potential delays is around resourcing for the commonwealth agencies that need to undertake the relevant assessment,” Barr said. “I think it’s pretty well documented that the National Capital Authority has been stripped of resources over the years. “It’s also clear, given the number of major infrastructure projects that will need to go through the EPBC process, that the relevant commonwealth departments there also need some additional staff.” The ACT has major infrastructure projects, including the next stage of the city’s light-rail construction through the parliamentary triangle, that require assessment by multiple government agencies. Its government already has a bilateral agreement with the federal government for EPBC Act assessments but it does not cover projects such as the light rail which occur partly or entirely on commonwealth land. If it were to enter a bilateral agreement with the commonwealth for EPBC Act approvals, major projects including the light rail would still require additional federal signoff, including from both houses of parliament, agreement on land licences, and a works approval from the National Capital Authority. A report by the national audit office found a correlation between funding and staffing cuts in the environment department and a blowout in the time it was taking to make decisions. Guardian Australia has previously reported that the budget for the divisions of the department responsible for these assessments has been cut since the Coalition won government from $63m in 2014-15 to $56.4m in 2018-19. Barr’s comments follow remarks by the New South Wales environment minister, Matt Kean, last month that the Morrison government should not “smash through” changes to national conservation laws. Kean said it was also premature for the government to rule out an independent regulator that would be responsible for monitoring compliance and enforcement of national laws. The federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, declined to comment on Barr’s remarks."

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
The press release from the White House, Office of the Press Secretary is here.  It reads:
FACT SHEET: U.S. Reports its 2025 Emissions Target to the UNFCCC
State Department Submits President Obama’s Ambitious 2025 Target to Cut U.S. Climate Pollution by 26-28 Percent from 2005 Levels
To view the INDC submission, click HERE.
Building on the strong progress made under President Obama to curb the emissions that are driving climate change and lead on the international stage, today the United States submitted its target to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The submission, referred to as an Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), is a formal statement of the U.S. target, announced in China last year, to reduce our emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025, and to make best efforts to reduce by 28%.
Last November, President Obama and President Xi – leaders of the largest economies and largest polluters – made the historic announcement of the respective post-2020 climate targets for the United States and China. For the first time, China committed to limit its greenhouse gas emissions, with a commitment to peak emissions around 2030 and to make best efforts to peak early, and to increase its share of non-fossil energy consumption to around 20 percent by 2030.  Following that historic announcement, the European Union put forward an ambitious and achievable INDC to cut their emissions 40% by 2030.  And just last week, Mexico announced that it would peak its overall net greenhouse gases by 2026, backed by strong unconditional policies and a new bilateral task force to drive climate policy harmonization with the United States.
With these actions, as well as strong INDCs submitted by Norway and Switzerland, countries representing over 50% of global CO2 emissions have either announced or formally reported their targets. Today’s action by the United States further demonstrates real momentum on the road to reaching a successful climate agreement this December in Paris and shows President Obama is committed to leading on the international stage.
The U.S. target will roughly double the pace of carbon pollution reduction in the United States from 1.2 percent per year on average during the 2005-2020 period to 2.3-2.8 percent per year on average between 2020 and 2025.  This ambitious target is grounded in intensive analysis of cost-effective carbon pollution reductions achievable under existing law and will keep the United States on the pathway to achieve deep economy-wide reductions of 80 percent or more by 2050. The Administration’s steady efforts to reduce emissions will deliver ever-larger carbon pollution reductions, public health improvements, and consumer savings over time and provide a firm foundation to meet the new U.S. target.
Building on Progress
Our leadership at the international level starts at home. In 2009, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were projected to continue increasing indefinitely. When entering office, President Obama set an ambitious goal to cut emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels in 2020.  Throughout the first term, the Administration took strong actions to cut carbon pollution, including investing more than $80 billion in clean energy technologies under the Recovery Act, establishing historic fuel economy and appliance energy efficiency standards, doubling solar and wind electricity, and implementing ambitious energy efficiency measures.
Early in his second term, President Obama launched an ambitious Climate Action Plan focused on cutting carbon pollution, preparing the nation for climate impacts, and leading on the international stage to bring nations large and small to the table to pledge to act on climate change.  In addition to bolstering first-term efforts to ramp up renewable energy and efficiency, the Plan is cutting carbon pollution through new measures, including:
Clean Power Plan: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed guidelines for existing power plants in June 2014 that would reduce power sector emissions 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 while delivering $55-93 billion in annual net benefits from reducing carbon pollution and other harmful pollutants.
Standards for Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles: In February 2014, President Obama directed EPA and the Department of Transportation to issue the next phase of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles by March 2016. These will build on the first-ever standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (model years 2014 through 2018), proposed and finalized by this Administration.
Energy Efficiency Standards: The Department of Energy set a goal of reducing carbon pollution by 3 billion metric tons cumulatively by 2030 through energy conservation standards issued during this Administration. The Department of Energy has finalized multiple measures addressing buildings sector emissions including energy conservation standards for 29 categories of appliances and equipment as well as a building code determination for commercial buildings. These measures will also cut consumers’ annual electricity bills by billions of dollars.
Economy-Wide Measures to Reduce other Greenhouse Gases: EPA and other agencies are taking actions to cut methane emissions from landfills, coal mining, agriculture, and oil and gas systems through cost-effective voluntary actions and common-sense regulations and standards.  At the same time, the State Department is working to slash global emissions of potent industrial greenhouse gases, called HFCs, through an amendment to the Montreal Protocol; EPA is cutting domestic HFC emissions through its Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program; and, the private sector has stepped up with commitments to cut global HFC emissions equivalent to 700 million metric tons through 2025.

"A group of moderate Conservative MPs has joined green groups in calling for the government’s ban on new fossil fuel vehicles to be brought forward by five years to 2030 as part of a plan to ignite a green economic recovery. The recently reformed caucus of centrist Conservatives has called on ministers to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles as part of a comprehensive green policy report aimed at bringing the UK in line with the official advice of the government’s climate tsars.  The One Nation group of about 100 Conservative MPs, or a third of the parliamentary party, formed in opposition to a hardline no-deal Brexit under Theresa May and relaunched late last month in a bid to steer Boris Johnson away from the hard right of the party. Jerome Mayhew MP, the lead author of the report, said the caucus supports the prime minister’s ambition to “build back greener” in the wake of pandemic and rejects “the anti-capitalist assertion” that economic growth is incompatible with tackling the climate crisis. “Offshore wind, electric vehicles, carbon capture and other clean technologies have the potential to create millions of jobs, attract private investment and grow UK exports,” he said. “Economic growth and innovation go hand in hand, and by investing in green skills, jobs, and technologies we can support an accelerated recovery of our economy and our environment,” he added. The rollout of electric vehicles is a key pillar of the government’s plans for cutting carbon emissions to virtually zero by 2050 to end the UK’s contribution to the climate crisis. Sales of electric vehicles are climbing quickly but official figures show they still accounted for only 2% of new car registrations last year. In February the government launched a consultation on whether to ban all cars with internal combustion engines by 2035. The group’s 25-point plan to kickstart a green economic recovery calls for the government to mandate electric vehicle charging points as standard in new homes, and help support greater private investment in electric vehicle supply chains. The report from the One Nation MPs also calls for the government to boost green homes, cycle lanes and jobs training for the low-carbon economy and includes a greenhouse gas removal strategy. Mayhew suggested using overarching fiscal measures including an economy-wide carbon tax combined with a “carbon border tax” on imported manufactured goods to raise funds for the green infrastructure projects. One Nation member Anthony Browne MP, the former chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association, said the fresh funds should be channelled not only to reducing energy demand and using cleaner sources to help remove greenhouse gases which are already in the atmosphere. By using carbon capture technology and the planting of 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of trees a year, more than six times the the government’s existing target, the UK should be able to capture and store 10m tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030, he said. The report calls for the government to set out a clear greenhouse gas removal strategy, which brings together carbon capture, tree planting and soil improvements to set out how it can contribute to the target of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. “We have the opportunity to reboot our economy and create jobs, by accelerating the rollout of clean and resilient infrastructure and stimulating low-carbon industries across the UK,” Mayhew said. “A clear majority of the public supports this agenda too.” The latest report from the One National Conservatives follows previous reports published in recent weeks on spurring an economic recovery and boosting social mobility."

From NASA/GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
California’s accumulated precipitation “deficit” from 2012 to 2014 shown as a percent change from the 17-year average based on TRMM multi-satellite observations. CREDIT NASA/Goddard Scientific Visualization Studio
A new NASA study has concluded California accumulated a debt of about 20 inches of precipitation between 2012 and 2015 — the average amount expected to fall in the state in a single year. The deficit was driven primarily by a lack of air currents moving inland from the Pacific Ocean that are rich in water vapor.
In an average year, 20 to 50 percent of California’s precipitation comes from relatively few, but extreme events called atmospheric rivers that move from over the Pacific Ocean to the California coast.
“When they say that an atmospheric river makes landfall, it’s almost like a hurricane, without the winds. They cause extreme precipitation,” said study lead author Andrey Savtchenko at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.
Savtchenko and his colleagues examined data from 17 years of satellite observations and 36 years of combined observations and model data to understand how precipitation has varied in California since 1979. The results were published Thursday in Journal of Geophysical Research – Atmospheres, a journal of the American Geophysical Union.
The state as a whole can expect an average of about 20 inches of precipitation each year, with regional differences. But, the total amount can vary as much as 30 percent from year to year, according to the study.
In non-drought periods, wet years often alternate with dry years to balance out in the short term. However, from 2012 to 2014, California accumulated a deficit of almost 13 inches, and the 2014-2015 wet season increased the debt another seven inches, for a total 20 inches accumulated deficit during the course of three dry years.
The majority of that precipitation loss is attributed to a high-pressure system in the atmosphere over the eastern Pacific Ocean that has interfered with the formation of atmospheric rivers since 2011.
Atmospheric rivers occur all over the world. They are narrow, concentrated tendrils of water vapor that travel through the atmosphere similar to, and sometimes with, the winds of a jet stream. Like a jet stream, they typically travel from west to east. The ones destined for California originate over the tropical Pacific, where warm ocean water evaporates a lot of moisture into the air. The moisture-rich atmospheric rivers, informally known as the Pineapple Express, then break northward toward North America.
Earlier this year, a NASA research aircraft participated in the CalWater 2015 field campaign to improve understanding of when and how atmospheric rivers reach California.
Some of the water vapor rains out over the ocean, but the show really begins when an atmospheric river reaches land. Two reached California around Dec. 1 and 10, 2014, and brought more than three inches of rain, according to NASA’s Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)’s multi-satellite dataset. The inland terrain, particularly mountains, force the moist air to higher altitudes where lower pressure causes it to expand and cool. The cooler air condenses the concentrated pool of water vapor into torrential rains, or snowfall as happens over the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where water is stored in the snowpack until the spring melt just before the growing season.
The current drought isn’t the first for California. Savtchenko and his colleagues recreated a climate record for 1979 to the present using the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, or MERRA. Their efforts show that a 27.5 inch deficit of rain and snow occurred in the state between 1986 and 1994.
“Drought has happened here before. It will happen again, and some research groups have presented evidence it will happen more frequently as the planet warms,” Savtchenko said. “But, even if the climate doesn’t change, are our demands for fresh water sustainable?”
The current drought has been notably severe because, since the late 1980s, California’s population, industry and agriculture have experienced tremendous growth, with a correlating growth in their demand for water. Human consumption has depleted California’s reservoirs and groundwater reserves, as shown by data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, leading to mandatory water rationing.
“The history of the American West is written in great decade-long droughts followed by multi-year wet periods,” said climatologist Bill Patzert at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. He was not involved in the research. “Savtchenko and his team have shown how variable California rainfall is.”
According to Patzert, this study added nuance to how scientists may interpret the atmospheric conditions that cause atmospheric rivers and an El Niño’s capacity to bust the drought. Since March, rising sea surface temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific have indicated the formation of El Niño conditions. El Niño conditions are often associated with higher rainfall to the western United States, but it’s not guaranteed.
Savtchenko and his colleagues show that El Niño contributes only six percent to California’s precipitation variability and is one factor among other, more random effects that influence how much rainfall the state receives. While it’s more likely El Niño increases precipitation in California, it’s still possible it will have no, or even a drying, effect.
A strong El Niño that lasts through the rainy months, from November to March, is more likely to increase the amount of rain that reaches California, and Savtchenko noted the current El Niño is quickly strengthening.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which monitors El Niño events, ranks it as the third strongest in the past 65 years for May and June. Still, it will likely take several years of higher than normal rain and snowfall to recover from the current drought.
“If this El Niño holds through winter, California’s chances to recoup some of the precipitation increase. Unfortunately, so do the chances of floods and landslides,” Savtchenko said. “Most likely the effects would be felt in late 2015-2016.”

"The UK’s wheat harvest is likely to be down markedly this year, according to the National Farmers’ Union, capping a tumultuous year for British farming after consecutive seasons of extreme weather. Yields could be down by about a third, with the worst harvest since the 1980s predicted, the farmers’ organisation said.  “We’ve seen very challenging conditions across the country,” said Tom Bradshaw, vice-president of the NFU, and an arable farmer in Essex. “Yields are down and this looks like the lowest harvest in about 30 years. The quality seems variable, but we won’t know what we’re looking at until it is all in.” Good growing conditions over the summer, when about half the wheat harvest was brought in across the country, ended for many regions in the past week with severe thunderstorms following the mini-heatwave, which saw the longest period of temperatures over 34C (93.2F) since comparable records began in 1961. But the problems with the harvest started at the beginning of the year. While this spring was the sunniest since comparable measurements began in 1929, and substantially drier than usual, it followed the wettest February ever recorded. Storms Ciara and Dennis battered many regions of the UK in the early and middle of the month, causing widespread flooding, followed by Storm Jorge at the end. The ground was already wet in many areas, after a sodden winter, and the further downpours seen in February left many farmers unable to plant seeds and a poor start to the growing season for many. All of that was followed by a dry spring that meant germination was difficult and in many places delayed, Bradshaw told the Guardian. The result could be the lowest wheat harvest in 30 years, according to Bradshaw, who estimated that yields would be down by about 30-35% across the country and possibly lower in some places. That would leave the UK this year as a net importer of grain rather than a net exporter. While there are unlikely to be any problems importing grain, as harvests have held up in other parts of the world, for many farmers it means a difficult end to the year after the disruptions of lockdown. Some grain farmers face an additional pressure: if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of the year, a tariff regime would spell disaster for farm exports. For that reason, many will want to sell their barley crop before the end of December, which may mean having to accept lower prices. “We have a known export market now, but there are then unknowns beyond January,” said Bradshaw. The lockdown affected some sectors far more than others. Dairy farmers were forced to throw away fresh milk that could not be collected, as the catering trade came to an abrupt halt and supply chains could not be immediately remodelled to redirect the production to retailers. People eating all their meals at home ate differently than they would normally: the milky cappuccinos and lattes demanded from coffee shops were out, and the steaks ordered in restaurants gave way to thrifty ways with mince at home. The latter caused particular headaches for meat producers, as normally they strive to “balance” the carcass between expensive and cheap cuts. Potato farmers saw farmgate prices halve, as the chip shop and catering trade disappeared overnight. Many farmers sought out innovative ways to market, from veg boxes to vending machines. Meanwhile, farmers who had diversified into offering accommodation and tourism, with children’s play areas or farm visits – as successive governments had encouraged them to do – have had a seesaw year. That side of their business broke down completely as lockdown prevented travel, but they are enjoying a late resurgence with staycations favoured over foreign trips. While the lockdown was a temporary measure, in the longer term farmers were being forced to grapple with the impact of the climate crisis, said Bradshaw. “What we are seeing is more extremes of weather,” he said. “Dry and wet weather seem to get stuck in patterns.” He pointed to the long drought of 2018, which made growing conditions difficult and left many farmers with a severe shortage of fodder for livestock. Last year, a wet autumn drenched the soil and caused flooding in many areas, destroying or delaying crops across the country. Aidan McGivern, a meteorologist at the Met Office, confirmed that the UK was experiencing a changing climate, with warmer and wetter winters, and rainfall coming in heavier bursts during summers. He said the season of summer thunderstorms – like those currently seen in the southern half of the country - was likely to extend in future from spring to autumn, and heatwaves would become more common. “When we experience a summer heatwave, it is more extreme than in the past,” added Mark McCarthy, the head of the National Climate Information Centre at the Met Office. “Climate change also increases the intensity of rain fall during the summer months, and heatwaves are followed by convective downpours. The challenge is knowing how to manage that.” In future, farmers might have to look at growing different crops, said Bradshaw. Maize and even soya beans might become an option, where previously they were rarely seen in the UK. Farmers were also looking to improve their own land management to account for a more variable climate, he added. “There has been more focus on soils, how they can store more water to be more resilient,” he said. “And we are looking at more spring crops to spread the risk across the year.”"

From the University of York:

A new study led by a University of York scientist addresses an important question in climate science: how accurate are climate model projections?
Climate models are used to estimate future global warming, and their accuracy can be checked against the actual global warming observed so far. Most comparisons suggest that the world is warming a little more slowly than the model projections indicate. Scientists have wondered whether this difference is meaningful, or just a chance fluctuation.
Dr Kevin Cowtan, of the Department of Chemistry at York, led an international study into this question and its findings are published in Geophysical Research Letters. The research team found that the way global temperatures were calculated in the models failed to reflect real-world measurements. The climate models use air temperature for the whole globe, whereas the real-world data used by scientists are a combination of air and sea surface temperature readings.
Dr Cowtan said: “When comparing models with observations, you need to compare apples with apples.”
The team determined the effect of this mismatch in 36 different climate models. They calculated the temperature of each model earth in the same way as in the real world. A third of the difference between the models and reality disappeared, along with all of the difference before the last decade. Any remaining differences may be explained by the recent temporary fluctuation in the rate of global warming.
Dr Cowtan added: “Recent studies suggest that the so-called ‘hiatus’ in warming is in part due to challenges in assembling the data. I think that the divergence between models and observations may turn out to be equally fragile.”
Dr Cowtan’s primary field of research is X-ray crystallography and he is based in the York Structural Biology Laboratory in the University’s Department of Chemistry. His interest in climate science has developed from an interest in science communication. This is his second major climate science paper. For this project, he led a diverse team of international researchers, including some of the world’s top climate scientists.

"WASHINGTON  —   A federal judge in Brooklyn came to the aid of scores of refugees and others who were trapped at airports across the United States on Saturday after an executive order signed by President Trump, which sought to keep many foreigners from entering the country, led to chaotic scenes across the globe. The judge’s ruling blocked part of the president’s actions, preventing the government from deporting some arrivals who found themselves ensnared by the presidential order. But it stopped short of letting them into the country or issuing a broader ruling on the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s actions. The   legal case played out on Saturday amid global turmoil, as the executive order signed by the president slammed shut the borders of the United States for an Iranian scientist headed to a lab in Massachusetts, a Syrian refugee family headed to a new life in Ohio and countless others across the world. The president’s order, enacted with the stroke of a pen at 4:42 p. m. Friday, suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said that the order also barred green card holders from those countries from   the United States. In a briefing for reporters, White House officials said that green card holders from the seven affected countries who are outside the United States would need a    waiver to return. Mr. Trump  —   in office just a week  —   found himself accused of constitutional and legal overreach by two Iraqi immigrants, defended by the American Civil Liberties Union. Meanwhile, large crowds of protesters turned out at airports around the country to denounce Mr. Trump’s ban on the entry of refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Lawyers who sued the government to block the White House order said the judge’s decision could affect an estimated 100 to 200 people who were detained upon arrival at American airports. Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, ruled just before 9 p. m. that implementing Mr. Trump’s order by sending the travelers home could cause them “irreparable harm. ” She said the government was “enjoined and restrained from, in any manner and by any means, removing individuals” who had arrived in the United States with valid visas or refugee status. The ruling does not appear to force the administration to let in people otherwise blocked by Mr. Trump’s order who have not yet traveled to the United States. The judge’s   ruling came swiftly after lawyers for the A. C. L. U. testified in her courtroom that one of the people detained at an airport was being put on a plane to be deported back to Syria at that very moment. A government lawyer, Gisela A. Westwater, who spoke to the court by phone from Washington, said she simply did not know. Hundreds of people waited outside of the courthouse chanting, “Set them free!” as lawyers made their case. When the crowd learned that Judge Donnelly had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, a rousing cheer went up in the crowd. Minutes after the judge’s ruling in New York City, another judge, Leonie M. Brinkema of Federal District Court in Virginia, issued a temporary restraining order for a week to block the removal of any green card holders being detained at Dulles International Airport. In a statement released early Sunday morning, the Department of Homeland Security said it would continue to enforce all of the president’s executive orders, even while complying with judicial decisions. “Prohibited travel will remain prohibited,” the department said in a statement, adding that the directive was “a first step towards   control over America’s borders and national security. ” Around the nation, security personnel at major international airports had new rules to follow, though the application of the order appeared chaotic and uneven. Humanitarian organizations delivered the bad news to overseas families that had overcome the bureaucratic hurdles previously in place and were set to travel. And refugees already on flights when the order was signed on Friday found themselves detained upon arrival. “We’ve gotten reports of people being detained all over the country,” said Becca Heller, the director of the International Refugee Assistance Project. “They’re literally pouring in by the minute. ” Earlier in the day, at the White House, Mr. Trump shrugged off the sense of anxiety and disarray, suggesting that there had been an orderly rollout. “It’s not a Muslim ban, but we were totally prepared,” he said. “It’s working out very nicely. You see it at the airports, you see it all over. ” But to many, the government hardly seemed prepared for the upheaval that Mr. Trump’s actions put into motion. There were numerous reports of students attending American universities who were blocked from returning to the United States from visits abroad. One student said in a Twitter post that he would be unable to study at Yale. Another who attends the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was refused permission to board a plane. A Sudanese graduate student at Stanford University was blocked for hours from entering the country. Human rights groups reported that legal permanent residents of the United States who hold green cards were being stopped in foreign airports as they sought to return from funerals, vacations or study abroad. There was widespread condemnation of the order, from religious leaders, business executives, academics, political leaders and others. Mr. Trump’s supporters offered praise, calling it a necessary step on behalf of the nation’s security. Homeland Security officials said on Saturday night that 109 people who were already in transit to the United States when the order was signed were denied access 173 were stopped before boarding planes heading to America.   people who were stopped were eventually given waivers to enter the United States, officials said. Legal residents who have a green card and are currently in the United States should meet with a consular officer before leaving the country, a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters. Officials did not clarify the criteria that would qualify someone for a waiver, other than that it would be granted “in the national interest. ” But the   administration appeared to be implementing the order chaotically, with agencies and officials around the globe interpreting it in different ways. The Stanford student, Nisrin Omer, a legal permanent resident, said she was held at Kennedy International Airport in New York for about five hours but was eventually allowed to leave the airport. Others who were detained appeared to be still in custody or sent back to their home countries. White House aides claimed on Saturday that there had been consultations with State Department and homeland security officials about carrying out the order. “Everyone who needed to know was informed,” one aide said. But that assertion was denied by multiple officials with knowledge of the interactions, including two officials at the State Department. Leaders of Customs and Border Protection and of Citizenship and Immigration Services  —   the two agencies most directly affected by the order  —   were on a telephone briefing on the new policy even as Mr. Trump signed it on Friday, two officials said. The A. C. L. U.’s legal case began with two Iraqis detained at Kennedy Airport, the named plaintiffs in the case. One was en route to reunite with his wife and son in Texas. The other had served alongside Americans in Iraq for a decade. Shortly after noon on Saturday, Hameed Khalid Darweesh, an interpreter who worked for more than a decade on behalf of the United States government in Iraq, was released. After nearly 19 hours of detention, Mr. Darweesh began to cry as he spoke to reporters, putting his hands behind his back and miming handcuffs. “What I do for this country? They put the cuffs on,” Mr. Darweesh said. “You know how many soldiers I touch by this hand?” The other man the lawyers are representing, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, who was en route to Houston, was released Saturday night. Before the two men were released, one of the lawyers, Mark Doss, a supervising attorney at the International Refugee Assistance Project, asked an official, “Who is the person we need to talk to?” “Call Mr. Trump,” said the official, who declined to identify himself. While the judge’s ruling means that none of the detainees will be sent back immediately, lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case expressed concern that all those at the airports would now be put in detention, pending a resolution of the case. The White House said the restrictions would protect “the United States from foreign nationals entering from countries compromised by terrorism” and allow the administration time to put in place “a more rigorous vetting process. ” But critics condemned Mr. Trump over the collateral damage on people who had no sinister intentions in trying to come to the United States. Peaceful protests began forming Saturday afternoon at Kennedy Airport, where nine travelers had been detained upon arrival at Terminal 7 and two others at Terminal 4, an airport official said. Similar scenes were playing out at other airports across the nation. An official message to all American diplomatic posts around the world provided instructions about how to treat people from the countries affected: “Effective immediately, halt interviewing and cease issuance and printing” of visas to the United States. Internationally, confusion turned to panic as travelers found themselves unable to board flights bound for the United States. In Dubai and Istanbul, airport and immigration officials turned passengers away at boarding gates and, in at least one case, ejected a family from a flight it had boarded. Seyed Soheil Saeedi Saravi, a promising young Iranian scientist, had been scheduled to travel in the coming days to Boston, where he had been awarded a fellowship to study cardiovascular medicine at Harvard, according to Thomas Michel, the professor who was to supervise the research fellowship. But Professor Michel said the visas for the student and his wife had been indefinitely suspended. “This outstanding young scientist has enormous potential to make contributions that will improve our understanding of heart disease, and he has already been thoroughly vetted,” Professor Michel wrote to The New York Times. A Syrian family of six who have been living in a Turkish refugee camp since fleeing their home in 2014 had been scheduled to arrive on Tuesday in Cleveland. Instead, the family’s trip has been called off. “Everyone is just so heartbroken, so angry, so sad,” said Danielle Drake, the community manager for US Together, an agency that resettles refugees. A Christian family of six from Syria said in an email to Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, that they were being detained on Saturday morning at Philadelphia International Airport despite having legal paperwork, green cards and visas that had been approved. In the case of the two Iraqis held at Kennedy Airport, the legal filings by his lawyers say that Mr. Darweesh was granted a special immigrant visa on Jan. 20, the same day Mr. Trump was sworn in as president. A husband and father of three, Mr. Darweesh arrived at Kennedy Airport with his family. Mr. Darweesh’s wife and children made it through passport control and customs, but agents of Customs and Border Protection detained him. In Istanbul, during a stopover on Saturday, passengers reported that security officers had entered a plane after everyone had boarded and ordered a young Iranian woman and her family to leave the aircraft. Iranian green card holders who live in the United States were blindsided by the decree while on vacation in Iran, finding themselves in a legal limbo and unsure whether they would be able to return to America. “How do I get back home now?” said Daria Zeynalia, a green card holder who was visiting family in Iran. He had rented a house and leased a car, and would be eligible for citizenship in November. “What about my job? If I can’t go back soon, I’ll lose everything. ”"

ACT leader David Seymour was dead right when he didn’t pull his punches and described the new New Zealand [climate change curriculum ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/non-satirical-image-of-the-day/)as ‘state-organised bullying of kids’



[…] Seymour, leader of the ACT Party, said he’s concerned the curriculum doesn’t allow for students to debate the science, telling Magic Talk he fears it’s designed to **suppress opposing views.**



“There is a supporting document that is all about how to deal with kids that disagree and one of the things it says is that if you’ve got a difficult kid that disagrees just change the seating plan.”



Seymour was referring to the “wellbeing guide” provided to teachers, which tells them: “With angry or obstructive students (depending on your understanding of them), consider seating plan, offer choices for ways to proceed, or share authority by delegating a student.”



The Epsom MP also criticised an activity in the syllabus called “myth buster role-play” where one student will play the role of an ‘activist’ for climate change and the other a ‘sceptic’. 



“I just think that sort of exercise, given that it doesn’t provide any sort of resource or credence to why people might be sceptical, amounts to state-organised bullying of kids,” Seymour said. 



[…] “I think one of the biggest challenges we have in New Zealand and across the Western world is the ability to have civil disagreement and respect that people have other views,” Seymour added. 



Free speech is under attack in every aspect of our lives now including in education. _Stuff_ will not publish dissenting viewpoints or facts about climate change that counter their world view, and now we have an unscientific New Zealand curriculum that basically tells teachers to isolate students who disagree with the rest of the class!



“What this curriculum does and the supporting document basically says ‘this is the way to think and if anybody disagrees it has built-in strategies for **suppressing their views’.**



[…]The new climate change teaching resource was announced on Sunday by Education Minister Chris Hipkins and Climate Change Minister J **ames Shaw.**



A more accurate job description for Mr Shaw would be **Minister of Green Propaganda.** There is no climate emergency, just a Green gravy train and an agenda to take us backwards.



[…] Seymour said while it’s not a bad thing for students to learn facts about climate change so they can understand what they hear in the news, he said **the curriculum doesn’t allow room for any debate.**



“Let’s do it in a way that actually allows kids to respectfully disagree rather than one that is basically set up to clobber them into a way of thinking, because that doesn’t help them at all.”



[…] Louis Holbrooke [ _sic_ ] from right-wing lobby group the Taxpayers’ Union had a similar view. 



“A student who displays scepticism, instead of being taken seriously, **they’re assumed to be displaying a psychological or emotional reaction to the distressing information,”** he told Magic Talk. 



That’s is just sick! As an ex-high school teacher I can tell you all right now that I would refuse to teach a curriculum that contains falsehoods and unproven science and that tells me to suppress students who want to question and respectfully disagree with the curriculum.



“It’s certainly not teaching them how to think because **there is no room for debate.”**



Shaw said students will be able to disagree, but they will “have to go to town against the entire New Zealand scientific community and suggest that they were wrong”. 



What…a…wanker! The science is settled according to Mr Shaw despite all evidence to the contrary.



Beef + Lamb New Zealand has also criticised the syllabus for advising students to eat less meat and dairy to help save the planet. 



This is not a science curriculum, it is Green propaganda and social engineering. It should be tossed into the wastebasket where it belongs.

"Last Saturday, swarms of women (and more than a few men) marched in Washington and around the world following Donald Trump’s inauguration. Some readers were concerned that The Times did an inadequate job estimating how many people showed up when it described the number as more than a million worldwide. Estimating crowd sizes has long been a fraught topic. Large gatherings of people can be difficult to estimate in precise terms  —   and no one will be happy with the outcome. There’s even a group of scientists who specialize in “crowd estimates,” as a Times piece comparing the sizes of the Washington women’s march to Trump’s inauguration noted. The Times used estimates compiled by the police, as well as figures from mayoral, public safety and homeland security offices. For greater accuracy in estimating the Washington numbers, editors asked Marcel Altenburg and Keith Still, crowd scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University in Britain, to analyze aerial photographs and video. The Times incorporated all this material to reach its final estimate of “more than one million. ” Since march organizers have a vested interest in a high turnout, The Times only included their estimates parenthetically, through a link to a website reporting a total turnout of nearly five million: “(March organizers offered a worldwide tally for the 673 ‘sister’ marches, but when asked, could not provide an explanation of how the tally had been calculated. )” An editor who helped anchor the coverage in New York said: The marches here in the States drew foreign protesters, too, but some were denied entry on questionable grounds. That story did not appear in The Times’s pages, and several readers noticed. The public editor’s take: Not a huge story, but from what I’ve read on other news sites, it seemed like a compelling one. Unfortunately, Times readers missed out.  Readers also noticed a story that is a repeated issue for The Times and one on which the public editor has written about previously. The public editor’s take: I’m with Schafran on this one, for the reasons she states. Then there were Trump’s views on women during the presidential campaign, which came up again last weekend during the marches, such as his remarks about Megyn Kelly, Carly Fiorina, Hillary Clinton, and that infamous recording in which he brags about groping women. The issue? That The Times did not   say that Trump’s statements were misogynistic. “Many participants,” The Times wrote, “believed Mr. Trump expressed misogynistic views during the presidential campaign. ” The public editor’s take: Hmmm. I’m generally reluctant to think that a journalist’s work is achieved through labels, but it’s hard to look at many of Trump’s statements and not find them misogynistic. It depends on which statement we’re referring to, but to say “some” of his statements about women are misogynistic is unequivocal. The issue of Trump and labels came up in a different context this week when The Times called one of his baseless claims a lie in a   headline: “Trump Repeats Lie About Popular Vote in Meeting With Lawmakers. ” The majority of readers who wrote in wrote to applaud The Times for doing so. Some other readers, however, were warier, arguing that The Times would never be able to find its way inside Trump’s mind. We went to the associate managing editor for standards, Phil Corbett, for his take on the issue. The public editor’s take: These parameters make sense to me. My vote is for using the word “lie” in a highly limited way, under specific circumstances and with   approval, as I’ve written before. As some of our readers point out, the intent of the person called out for lying matters. It can’t be just the routine stuff of the spin room. Shortly after the election, The Times ran an   piece by Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, in which he wrote, “When you call us the Rust Belt, you demean our work and diminish who we are. ” A reader wrote in then to applaud. This week, Derck wrote in again when The Times ran a story on the front page with the headline: “In a Rust Belt Town, the Women’s March Draws Shrugs and Cheers From Afar. ” “No, I’m not going to give this up,” she wrote. “I know how much work is left to do but are you still going to be calling us Rust Belt when we may be the leader in alternative energy or something else in 2090?” We shared Derck’s letters with the national editor, Marc Lacey, who said: The public editor’s take: Lacey’s answer is spot on. Last Monday, the public editor criticized a story on dads taking care of their kids while the moms marched against Trump, arguing that it should have never run. The column drew some wry responses from fathers, which we decided to highlight here. Here’s to dads."
"MANILA  —   When Lizel Torreras, 35, became pregnant with her third child, she mixed a tincture of bitter herbs and mahogany bark, a home remedy said to induce abortion. Her husband, who worked as a garbage scavenger, did not make enough money to buy a regular supply of birth control pills, much less raise another child. “With just two kids, we were already struggling,” she said. “The children were going to have a hard time. We might not have been able to send them to school. ” But after three attempts, Ms. Torreras, a churchgoing Catholic, could not bring herself to drink the potion. Like millions of other women in the Philippines who have no access to contraception, Ms. Torreras had the baby. Then another one. The Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, signed an executive order this month calling for the full and immediate enforcement of a 2012 law that would give six million women like Ms. Torreras free   contraception and reproductive health services. Mr. Duterte portrayed the order as an antipoverty measure, with an official calling it “      and   development. ” But the order was also Mr. Duterte’s latest jab at the Roman Catholic Church, which wields significant power in the Philippines and has fought for years to keep the law from taking effect. Under the law, government agencies will provide modern family planning services, including free contraceptives and prenatal care to all women and families. The measure also mandates that sex education be taught in schools and that companies offer reproductive health services to their employees. But the law, which took more than 13 years to be passed by Congress before being signed into law in 2012, has yet to fully take effect, a testament to the power of the Catholic Church,   groups and allied lawmakers. The church and other contraception opponents filed petitions with the Supreme Court, which issued several rulings blocking parts of the law. The court continues to prevent the Health Department from procuring, distributing or selling birth control implants, a ban that women’s health groups fear could be extended to the pill and other forms of hormonal birth control when existing certifications expire in 2018. Last year, Congress cut the Health Department’s budget for contraceptives, citing the court order halting the distribution of implants. Local agencies have administered the law differently in different districts, and sex education in particular has varied widely by school district. This month, Vicente Sotto III, the Senate majority leader, vowed to stop the distribution of condoms in high schools, arguing that they encouraged promiscuity. The battle is not over, but Mr. Duterte’s order provides clear guidance to government agencies and local health officials that they should uphold the law, eliminating some of the ambiguity the various court decisions have caused. And while the church still opposes the law in principle, it has scaled back its public campaign against it. Two archbishops, in interviews, acknowledged defeat. The Duterte administration says it can provide desperately needed services that are vital to lifting millions of people out of poverty. It estimates that there are six million women, two million of whom are poor, who do not have access to modern forms of contraception. Mr. Duterte’s order aims to achieve “zero unmet need for family planning” by 2018, helping to meet his goal of reducing the poverty rate to 14 percent by the end of his administration in 2022, down from the 2015 level of 21. 6 percent. Sex education, advocates say, has been a failure. The Philippines is the only country in Asia where teenage pregnancy increased over the last two decades, according to the United Nations Population Fund. “A lot of the existing education in the Philippines is abstinence only, and this contributes to teenage pregnancy,” said Hope   project coordinator for Likhaan, a nongovernmental organization dedicated to women’s health. Stephanie Carmen, 15, is the kind of teenager Ms.   has in mind. Ms. Carmen, who has a    daughter, says she did not know that sex could result in pregnancy. She has learned the hard way, and says she will get an intrauterine device from Likhaan, which distributes free birth control using private funds and cooperation from the Health Department, as soon as she heals from the birth. “I don’t want any more children,” she said. “It hurts too much. ” Mr. Duterte’s executive order is not his first clash with the church in his seven months in office. He has called the church “the most hypocritical institution,” accusing priests and bishops of graft, corruption and taking mistresses. He called Pope Francis a son of a whore (and later apologized) openly accused the church of pedophilia and claimed to have been sexually abused by a priest as a teenager. And he has accused the church of doing nothing to combat drugs, which he sees as the country’s biggest problem. For its part, the church has opposed his push to reinstate the death penalty and has begun to publicly criticize his antidrug campaign, which has left more than 3, 600 people dead. “We will continue to oppose those because they are inhuman,” said Archbishop Ramón Argüelles of Lipa. He added, of Mr. Duterte, “I think whether he knows it or not, whenever we do anything bad, you are the tool of the devil. If you bring harm to others, you are the devil’s tool. ” Priests across the Philippines have urged citizens to speak out against the killings in the drug campaign. In the days before Christmas, the Redemptorist Church of Baclaran in Manila mounted a photo exhibition of its victims,   corpses strewn in the streets and grieving families, aimed to prick a sense of outrage among churchgoers. Fighting the church is not without risk. More than 80 percent of Filipinos identify as Catholic, and the church was instrumental in toppling two presidents, Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 and Joseph Estrada in 2001. But Mr. Duterte appears to be winning this fight. Rather than repelling Catholics with his sacrilegious outbursts, his willingness to confront the church has endeared him to Filipinos. According to a pair of 2016 polls by Pulse Asia, 86 percent of Filipinos support   reproductive health services, and 55 percent want the administration to prioritize programs to combat poverty. While the church may have lost this battle, Archbishop Argüelles says Mr. Duterte has not won the war. “He said he was going to destroy the church,” the archbishop said. “The only thing I can tell him is that Hitler tried to do that, Bismarck tried to do that, Napoleon tried to do that. The church is still there, all these people are gone. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt Facebook here Belgian organic chemistry professor Istvan Marko responded to Kenneth Richard’s post from yesterday citing very recent literature showing that glacier melting today is actually happening much more slowly than over much of the past 10,000 years.
Prof. Istvan Marko, photo source: Facebook
The literature thus refute the often heard media claims that glaciers and ice caps are “melting faster than ever“.
In his comment Prof. Marko, a native of Hungary, wondered that the studies cited by Richard were even able “to pass through the meshwork of pro-anthropogenic warming peer reviewers“.
Summarizing the results of the papers, Marko writes that the observations once again “contradict the sordid theories of the IPCC” and that atmospheric CO2 concentrations “absolutely do not correlate with the fluctuations of the levels of the oceans and the movements of advances and withdrawals of glaciers“. He writes that the IPCC science “failed again”.
Marko has been a harsh critic of the man-made climate change theory, appearing in a number of interviews.
In a recent English-language interview he blasted COP 21, claiming that it essentially resulted in nothing … “The result of COP 21 is no result” … “because there is nothing binding in this particular treaty“.  He adds the only thing to motivate CO2 reductions is “shame”, adding: “To my knowledge no politician knows what shame is at all. They are totally not subject to shame.”
In the interview he reminds listeners that the long-term temperature trend over the Holocene has been downward, and that today’s temperatures were exceeded by a number of other periods over the past 10,000 years. He dismisses the claim that CO2 plays a major role and believes that other far more powerful natural factors and cycles are at work.
Clearly the papers presented by Richard are just the latest evidence on a mountain of literature, which sadly the government-funded IPCC refuses to acknowledge.

"Organic farming is a trade off: it prohibits the use of certain chemicals and inorganic fertilisers, which usually results in lower yields, and hence higher prices. With arguments about health benefits inconclusive, one might ask what reasons there are to pay the organic premium. One reason may be in organic farming’s effects, not on us, but on the environment. In our study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, we re-analysed data collected on biodiversity, one potential environmental benefit of organic farming. We looked at data from 94 previous studies dating back to 1989 covering 184 farms with different crops, in which biodiversity on conventional and organic farms was compared. This was measured in terms of species richness (the number of different species in a particular area or time) rather than the number of individuals. Our meta-analysis of all the results from similar studies weighted them according to their sample size and reliability. It revealed clearly measurable benefits: organic fields and farms typically contain on average between 26%-42% more species than fields managed using conventional methods. With respect to pollinators such as bees, it was up to 50% more. However, the magnitude of the effect varies between different types of organism, and between fields growing different crops. Incidental plants, those not being grown as crops, seem to benefit the most from organic farming, while the largest differences in diversity between conventional and organic is seen in areas of intensive cultivation of cereal crops such as wheat, maize and barley. So consumers who choose to buy organic food can be sure they are paying towards a method that generates an environmental benefit.  One of the criticisms often levelled at organic farming is that while there are benefits to biodiversity, lower yields mean more land is required to grow the same amount of food. But it’s precisely those reduced yields that provide the benefits to other organisms: those crop calories that don’t end up in human mouths probably end up in the mouths of other mammals, insects and birds.  So is organic farming a zero-sum game? This is a much harder problem to address, and there probably isn’t a simple answer. For example, in Europe arable farming has a very long history, and many of our treasured and familiar species such as turtle-doves and corncrakes can thrive in extensively managed farmland. But many of these species are now threatened: there have been spectacular declines in formerly common birds such as skylarks, turtle-doves and grey partridges, as shown in the RSPB State of the UK’s Birds Report, which tracks bird numbers since the 1990s. Organic farming has been shown to maintain species diversity on farmland, so it probably does provide one solution to these declines, in Europe at least. But in the tropics, the situation may be different. A meta-analysis of published studies such as ours can only work with the literature available. When we also compared the area of organic crops in which studies had taken place to the actual area under agricultural production worldwide, we found a startling mismatch: three-quarters of the studies that compared organic to conventional methods were carried out in Europe, while three-quarters of the land under organic production is outside Europe. This means that the biodiversity benefits, or otherwise, to many familiar tropical crops such as bananas or cacao beans, simply haven’t been assessed. Of course we would expect to see benefits, given the strength and consistency of results in Europe. But the fact that organic crops may need more land is potentially a bigger problem in the tropics, given that new farmland comes at the expense of clearing natural habitats. This makes the trade-offs between yield and biodiversity even more important and this should be the focus of further research. A new aspect to our study was to use maps obtained from Google Earth to quantify land use in the areas surrounding the study farms.  Although such estimates can only ever be crude, our study revealed that organic farming had greater benefits in areas with high land-use intensity. This is probably because the biodiversity on conventional farms in such areas is correspondingly lower. In which case perhaps we should  deliberately encourage the scattering of organic farms around the landscape to maximise their impact. Or alternatively, group them together in conservation areas complete with footpaths and other amenities in order to maximise the enjoyment and benefits they can offer the public – perhaps it’s a point that should go out for public consultation. But even now efforts are being made to improve the natural biodiversity of conventional farmland, such as through the European Common Agricultural Policy’s new “greening” measures that came into force in January. These recognise the disastrous effect intensive agriculture has had on biodiversity, and acknowledge the current failure to prevent further losses. Compared to the effects of organic farming, the evidence that greening measures which encourage strips of wild habitat, fallow land, forests or hedgerows, and wider crop diversity provides biodiversity benefits is variable. Much will depend on the way they are interpreted and implemented farm by farm. Given the current state of farmland and the limited spread of organically farmed land, we can only hope they’re successful."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeologist Dr. Sebastian Luning and chemist Prof. Fritz Vahrenohlt have recently looked at the so-called climate “Tipping Points” hypothesis, one that is heavily promoted by the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
The idea of the climate irreversibly tipping into something completely different and potentially hostile once certain thresholds are reached is one often put forth by PIK head Prof. Hans-Joschim Schellnhuber, architect of the proposed “Great Transformation of Society“.
============================================
Good bye “Tipping Points”?
By Sebastian Luning and Fritz vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Do you recall the horror reports of imminent climate tipping points?  They are often used to paint doomsday scenarios:


Figure: The tipping elements of the world’s climate, Source: PIK
A requirement is that critical thresholds be surpassed, due to the warming of the planet, and thus lead to a tipping of the climate system. This would be similar to the transition over to a new quality from the piling up of smaller quantities, as postulated by Karl Marx in his 3rd Development Law Of Dialectical Materialism. But there is one problem with this assertion in climatology: even the IPCC models (in the last report the CMIP5 models) aren’t playing along. They are forecasting (at least until 2100) more of a linear, steady development. The proponents of the catastrophe theories in fact use simpler modeling constructs for underpinning their Cassandra proclamations: most of them have been energy balance models showing a “catastrophic” shifting over. However, recent scientific studies have been published and they clearly refute the “tipping” claims. In the case of India’s summer monsoons it is written in the conclusion of a paper by Wiliam R. Boos of Yale University, PNAS:
Thus, outside of a theory that omitted a dominant term in the equations of motion, we know of no evidence supporting the idea that monsoons will shut down in response to anthropogenic forcings. Monsoons may have a strong response to anthropogenic forcings, but current theory and numerical models indicate that this response will be nearly linear.”

In another case concerning the “death spiral of Arctic sea ice” another published paper reached a similar conclusion: simple models exaggerated the possibility of a non-linear tipping point:
This result may help to reconcile the discrepancy between low-order models and comprehensive GCMs in previous studies. Specifically, it suggests that the low-order models overestimate the likelihood of a sea ice “tipping point.”
Authors Till J. Wagner and Ian Eisenman of the University of California also concluded that the non-linearity (collapse) of the AMOC (see our post here) was a mere artifact of an overly simplified model.
In another case depicted in the figure above we can also see that one tipping point theory predicts that from one year to the next only El Nino conditions will prevail in the Eastern Pacific. Look at the following figure: Nino 3.4  shows a trend of zero and the observation of sea surface temperatures has not diverted from the trend.

Figure: Monthly Nino 3.4 index
There’s no need to expect a shift over to some new quality, and thus follow in the footsteps of Karl Marx, who was accurate like no other in his analysis of society. His predictions failed spectacularly!

Ocean algae will cope well in varying climates, study shows

From the UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH
Tiny marine algae that play a critical role in supporting life on Earth may be better equipped to deal with future climate change than previously expected, research shows.
Scientists investigated the likely future impact of changing environmental conditions on ocean phytoplankton, a microscopic plant that forms the basis of all the oceans’ food chains.
Phytoplankton is important for absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, while generating much of the oxygen needed to sustain life on Earth.
The study grew phytoplankton at the high carbon dioxide levels predicted for the year 2100 and beyond. The algae was allowed to evolve through 400 generations, with some exposed to varying levels of CO2 and some kept at constant CO2 levels.
Researchers found that phytoplankton exposed to fluctuating CO2 levels was better able to cope with further changes in conditions, compared with algae grown in stable CO2 levels. The finding suggests that populations of the algae will adapt more to the varied conditions expected in future than was previously thought based on experiments at stable conditions.
Scientists found however that the algae developed in changing CO2 conditions evolved more and were smaller than those grown in stable conditions. These factors may impact on how well marine animals can feed off phytoplankton, and how efficiently the algae is able to take carbon out of the atmosphere and sink to the deep ocean. Plankton in some regions of the ocean may evolve more than others under global climate change, because some regions of ocean are currently more variable than others.
The studies, published in the International Society for Microbial Ecology journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society B, were supported by the Royal Society, the European Commission, and the Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance.
Dr Sinead Collins, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of Biological Sciences, who led both studies, said: “Predicting how populations of ocean algae will respond to changing ocean conditions is difficult, but these results suggest that populations from highly changeable environments are better placed to deal with additional environmental change than previously suspected.”

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been named ‘Pacific Person of the Year’ by regional publication Islands Business magazine.



[…] Mr Pareti said Ms Ardern was given the 2019 title because of her work at the Pacific Islands Forum to bring consensus around the issue of climate change.



[…] Mr Pareti said her handling of the Christchurch terror attacks was also commendable.



[…] Mr Pareti said Ms Ardern had been a breath of fresh air in terms of political leadership in the islands.



“ **She is a young person, she is a woman, she is a mother. She has got everything that I guess one would wish upon a Pacific Island leader.**

"The newly formed Carbon Sense Coalition today described the Global Warming Policies of both Federal and State government and opposition parties as “Policies for Poverty”.
Chairman of the new group, Mr Viv Forbes, says that at a time when scientific and informed opinion was becoming more sceptical of the apocalyptic prophecies of the Global Warming Industry, politicians and the media were competing to propose the most extreme and expensive options to “solve” a non- problem.

“A coalition of big business, big government and state funded media and research bureaucrats is colluding to impose job losses, power shortages and increased costs for electricity, transport and food on the unsuspecting Australian community – a well designed total package of Policies for Poverty.
“Ordinary workers, consumers and taxpayers will be sacrificed on this Altar in the vain hope that it will have some beneficial effect on earth’s future climate.
“Even casual analysis of the evidence will show that even if Australia closed every coal mine and power station, and stopped all cars, trucks, ships and aeroplanes, it would be impossible to detect any effect on world temperature.
“Politicians seem prepared to impose enormous costs on the Australian people in order to achieve miniscule effects on a non problem.
“Professor Lance Enderbee has published graphs of mean temperatures from 27 rural recording stations in Australia for 100 years from 1890 to 1990. The trend is horizontal, with mean temperature in 1990 below that for 1880. This has occurred during the century of the motor car, two world wars, and massive growth of coal burning for steel production and power generation. Rising carbon dioxide levels have had no effect on temperatures.
“A similar data set for six Australian capital cities shows a generally rising trend in temperature since 1950 – that is, rising temperature in Australia is an urban effect, not a result of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
“Urban heating is caused by air conditioners pumping heat into or out of buildings, motors cars exhausting hot fumes, hot factories, millions of hot bodies, politicians emitting hot air, hot concrete and bitumen, polluted air, fewer breezes and less cool pastures, swamps and scrub.
“This urban heating will be made worse by the silly proposal to replace electric appliances (whose source of heat and emissions is controlled in an isolated power station in the countryside) with millions of small open fires burning in gas stoves and hot water systems in every home all over the city.
“The federal government and five state governments have six different programs and models covering emissions trading, carbon caps, carbon taxes and renewable energy schemes. Each jurisdiction is rushing to set up new energy, greenhouse and climate change offices with hierarchies of expensive public officials to staff them.
“Merchant banks are gearing up for the easy profits to be generated by carbon trading. Lawyers are preparing for the rush of new business from the disputes, legal challenges and shady deals which will follow the complicated sets of laws and regulations on carbon caps, emissions trading rules, conditions covering free permits, penalties, exemptions, offset policies, early abatement rules, reporting requirements and international trading rules.
“All of this is creating a totally artificial industry living on the sweat of ordinary workers, farmers, miners, foresters, consumers, tax payers and shareholders.
“Every carbon cap or tax will increase the cost of electricity in every home, farm and factory. Every increase in power costs will drive one more business and its jobs to China or India. Every subsidy for playthings like solar collectors or wind farms will cause an increase in taxes. And every ethanol plant built will increase the costs of every bit of food on the table of every home in the country – all of these are Policies for Poverty.
“The long term effects on the community will be obvious, but different. Emission traders and regulators will get bonuses in their pay packets. The beautiful people in the leafy suburbs will cut back on cappuccinos. Grain and sugar farmers supplying ethanol plants will prosper. All other farmers and consumers will suffer losses as grain, sugar and electricity costs rise. Coal miners will lose their job. Factory workers will lose their house. Politicians will lose office.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterFear mongering no longer pays: Climate alarmist John Church sacked by Australian government
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
Translated by P Gosselin (NASA image added by P Gosselin)

NASA image showing 6-meter sea level rise. Public Domain image.
Website ClimateChangePredictions.org has taken on the task of recording climate change forecasts in order to compare them to the real, observed developments. A nice example is sea level rise. Currently sea level is rising at about 2-3 mm per year, a trend that would mean about 25 cm by the end of the century. However that does not keep some from publicly trumpeting much higher sea level amounts with the aim of getting publicity.
You’ll find a very interesting list of all prognoses at the named website here. For example Australian climate scientist John Church projects 3 meters by the year 2100.
No room for “extreme, activist views”
With respect to this unbearable climate alarmism, the Australian government has pulled the emergency brake. While Church was on an expedition ship halfway between New Zealand and Antarctica, he was informed by Australian Research authority CSIRO that he was “potentially redundant” and that he would lose his position. That is an overdue signal that unrestrained climate alarmism is no longer tolerable. Society is entitled to balanced science. There must not be any room for extreme, activist views.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported on May 14, 2016:
Global sea-level expert John Church made to walk the plank by CSIRO
For John Church, a leading authority on sea-level rise caused by global warming, there was much that was fitting – and yet callous – about being sacked at sea. The veteran scientist was well into one of dozens of research voyages he had taken since joining CSIRO as a post doctoral student in 1979. His vessel, the RV Investigator, was midway between Antarctica and New Zealand and steaming north on the 170 degree longitude when he received Thursday’s call to tell him he was “potentially redundant”.
Read more: Sydney Morning Herald.
The sacking of Church is part of a large trimming down, which is seeing a wave of hundreds of scientists moving from the climate sciences over to other highly relevant science fields.
In Germany we are still a long way from that point. To the contrary the state-supported and climate activism-tinged IASS Institute Potsdam is searching a scientific staff member through an advert auf stepstone.de:
The Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies e.V. (IASS) in Potsdam is an institution supported by the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung and the state of Brandenburg and is dedicated to an all encompassing transdisciplinary and international research of climate change, the earth system components and sustainability.

"Even before President Trump issued an order on Friday banning immediate entry into the United States by people from several predominantly Muslim countries, immigration lawyers, having heard rumors of coming action from the White House, were on alert. On Wednesday, lawyers from the International Refugee Assistance Project at the Urban Justice Center who were concerned that the action would affect the project’s clients sent out an email calling for lawyers who could volunteer immediately to go to airports where refugees were scheduled to enter the United States. “It occurred to us that there were going to be people who were traveling who would land and have their status affected while in midair,” said Betsy Fisher, the group’s policy director. And that is exactly what happened. Across the country, people were detained on Sunday after being caught up in the aftermath of Mr. Trump’s order, even though a petition filed on Saturday in federal court in Brooklyn led a judge to block part of the order. Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, the plaintiffs named in the petition, were originally clients of Ms. Fisher’s organization. The email received a tremendous response, Ms. Fisher said, with “well over a thousand people” expressing interest and availability. By Saturday morning, the lawyers who heeded the call were at about a dozen airports around the country. Others who heard about the effort through colleagues or the news media went to airports on their own to pitch in. By early Sunday morning, Ms. Fisher said, lawyers offering services and advice were at “most international airports in the United States. ” Andre Segura, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, arrived at Kennedy International Airport in New York at 1:30 p. m. on Saturday. He said that the outside section of Central Diner, a restaurant in Terminal 4, was “entirely taken over by attorneys,” all working to file petitions for individual clients with the help of the clients’ families. “There were attorneys from numerous major law firms, nonprofits, all working together,” Mr. Segura said. “I’ve never seen that immediate coming together of teams to start filing actions to try to protect people. ” He added, “The dynamic between what was happening inside the terminal with all the attorneys, and outside with massive protests and people holding signs  —   I’ve never experienced anything like that. ” Mr. Segura said he arrived home around 2 a. m. on Sunday. He woke up at 5:30 and began answering emails from lawyers who had stayed overnight at the airport. While lawyers gathered at airports on Saturday, others were working furiously on litigation. Cecillia Wang, the A. C. L. U.’s deputy legal director, described the scene at her office as “complete chaos. ” “I was sitting at my desk working on a template habeas petition that could be used by lawyers at airports all around the country,” she said. Omar Jadwat, the director of the A. C. L. U.’s Immigrant Rights Project, which worked on the petition that led to the judge’s stay, said the litigation had not been prepared ahead of time. “That was not something we had on the shelf ready to go, waiting for the right plaintiffs to come along,” he said. “It was a case of: There’s this emergency, and people have to work together to figure out a response as quickly as we can so that these people and other people around the country didn’t get deported. ” Even after word of the federal court’s order reached the airport in New York, confusion reigned. Alina Das, a professor of clinical law at New York University School of Law, said she had arrived at the airport at 7 p. m. on Saturday and stayed overnight, working to get a client released. Ms. Das, who said she could not comment on her client’s situation, described the scene on Sunday morning, saying that it was “incredibly difficult to get an answer on whether our clients were going to be sent back or whether they were being processed for release” and that people remained detained even after the court order blocked part of the president’s actions. Avi Gesser, a partner at the law firm Davis Polk  Wardwell, described the process in Terminal 4 on Saturday, saying that a group of people had been deployed to search for those whose family members were detained. “If they found people, they referred them over to us and we onboarded people as clients if we could, and then filed habeas petitions,” he said. Mr. Gesser, who is originally from Canada, did not leave the airport until 4:30 a. m. on Sunday, he said. “Our firm has a lot of people who were not born in the United States,” he said. “We felt that people who were being detained needed legal representation. And that’s something that we do very well. ” Rebecca Heller, who was coordinating lawyers’ efforts on the ground for the International Refugee Assistance Project on Saturday, said that by Sunday afternoon, her services were far less in demand. “They’re   now!” she said excitedly in a brief phone call. “That’s how a movement starts. ”"
"A group of Australian and New Zealand organisations and scientists today called on the governments of Australia and New Zealand to set up an Australia New Zealand Royal Commission on the Science of Global Warming (to be known as “The ANZIG Royal Commission” – the Australia New Zealand Inquiry into Global Warming).
The chairman of Australia’s Carbon Sense Coalition, Mr Viv Forbes, said that many groups and individuals in Australia and New Zealand had listened with alarm and disbelief to plans of both governments to saddle their people and industries with the burdens of carbon taxes and the risks of carbon trading which he described as “an open invitation to massive fraud”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski held an interview with climate modeling scientist Edouard Zorita of the GKSS Research Center in Geestacht near Hamburg, Germany.

Eduardo Zorita, paleoclimatologist, GKSS Research Centre Germany tells Spiegel climate models have a long way to go, much remains poorly understood and that they are hardly trustworthy. Photo:  http://coast.gkss.de/staff/zorita/; CC BY-SA 3.0.
The interview focused on the reliability of climate models, particularly their ability to forecast precipitation trends in response to warming. Earlier models have suggested that arid regions would simply become drier, while wet regions would get wetter. Other models suggested some regions would see more of both. The result: lots of confusion and uncertainty.
“Hardly trustworthy”
The interview focusses on a new study authored by Fredrik Charpentier Ljungqvist of Stockholm University, which was recently published in Nature. The paper’s result now casts lots of doubt over the models and their ability to project the future. In the study the scientists examined the past 1200 years of precipitation across the northern hemisphere and they found that the models do very poorly, and that they are still at a very embryonic stage in their development – far from being mature enough to be of much use for future prognoses. Hence the title and photo caption of the Spiegel article:
Faults in the climate models: “Drought prognoses are hardly trustworthy”
A consequence of global warming is supposed to be drought. However an analysis shows: climate models can barely calculate precipitation.”
Obviously the climate system is far more complex than what some scientists, policymakers and media would like to have us to believe. The models are in fact more uncertain than ever.
Bojanowski writes:
In the case of precipitation the data contradict the model results, the scientists report.”
Mismatch between models and observations
When asked about the reliability of projections for more drought, Zorita, a scientist who has co-authored numerous publications, tells the German Spiegel news weekly that the prognoses are “hardly trustworthy” and that their new study shows that “the climate model results clearly deviated from the climate data on precipitation“.

The scientists based their findings on 1200 years of climate data from the northern hemisphere, much of it from proxy records. The mismatch between the models and observations are in fact profound, it turns out.
No 20th century precipitation signal
When asked if a man-made signal could be found in the precipitation over the 20th century, Zorita replied:
In our data we do not see anything unusual. There was nothing special concerning precipitation. It was similarly arid from the 9th to the 11th century, and back then there was no man-made climate change. Also harsh droughts such as the recent ones in Western USA were put into real perspective. Precipitation amounts actually fluctuate more greatly than previously assumed – that’s what the data show for the past 1200 years.”
When you boil it down: droughts are no worse today than they have ever been in the past 1200 years back when CO2 was some 30% less. Zorita adds:
But for the past 1200 years we were not able to find a relationship between global warming and changes in precipitation. That’s something that raises concern.”
“Hardly able to model the water cycle”
Zorita then tells Spiegel that the results of the study should be seen as a “warning signal“, elaborating:
It shows that we need to do a better job testing the climate models. They have been hardly able to model the water cycle, the crux of the climate phenomenon.”
That’s black on white. The models thus cannot be relied on to come anywhere close to forecasting the future as they cannot even properly simulate crucial precipitation cycles. The modelers of course cannot be blamed here as the system is indeed enormously complex. They are doing a good job getting the task started, but it has to be acknowledged that it is only a start and that there is in fact a very very long way to go before they produce useful long-term forecasts.
Large knowledge gaps in other areas
In the interview Zorita also brings up the knowledge gaps in other crucial areas. He tells Spiegel there’s still much to learn about clouds and aerosols, and that much more research is required here. Moreover much remains poorly understood in yet more areas:
Also our understanbding of how moisture between the ground and air is exchanged is insufficient. That is really something to think about because these factors determine the climate of the future.”
The results of this paper really ought to be embarrassing for policymakers who insist the science is settled and that we need to heed what the current (embryonic) models are telling us.

"How much would you pay for staying alive? How much would you pay for breathing pure air? That may seem a silly question since air is everywhere, accessible to all. Air is a global public good, part of the commons – and yet in China a smart entrepreneur is already selling canned air at around 50p a can. People also have to pay for water, after all. And there’s a huge range in food expenditures between countries, from the £2,724 a Norwegian spends every year to the £132 typically spent by an Uzbek. So the essentials of life – air, food and water – must all be paid for. And while some nations have social welfare to provide the essentials, for everyone else no money means starving to death. Today, purchasing power determines how much and which type of food can be accessed or produced by one’s own hand. Food is regarded as a private good. And yet some aspects of food production are considered part of the commons – agricultural knowledge accumulated over thousands of years, or from publicly funded research institutions, cooking recipes and national gastronomy, ocean fisheries, wild fruits and animals, and seedbanks and genetic material of plant and animals. Others are seen as a common, shared goal – food safety considerations, or maintaining food price stability and security.  And going even further, as my recent paper proposes, why not consider food itself as a commons, an earthy resource essential for each human being, to be produced, consumed and governed in common? Such a thought would embrace, perhaps even surpass the individualist approach to human rights. For example the right to clean water, the desirable right to clean air and the well-established right to food? Food has been completely commodified, from a common local resource to a private, transnational, industrial commodity, to be speculated without moral consideration to achieve the best price. A race for land and water to support commercial food production has torn up vast areas of Africa and Latin America, while corporations drive obesity epidemics from increased consumption of ultra-processed food and drink. The value of food is no longer based on the fact it is a basic human need that should be available to all, a fundamental human right that should be guaranteed to every citizen, a pillar of every national culture, certainly a marketable product that should be subject to fair trade and sustainable production, and a global good that should be enjoyed by all. Instead these multiple dimensions are superseded by food’s tradeable features; value is confused with price. Some of the means to produce food are private goods – land, agro-chemicals – while others such seeds, rainfall, agricultural knowledge are not. Land enclosure, privatisation, legislation, excessive pricing and patents have all played a role in limiting the access to food as a public good. The industrial food system exists mainly to maximise profit for a few, not to maximise the nutritional benefits of food to all. And the failure of this food system to feed the world, adequately and sustainably, cannot be ignored. The paradox is that half of those who grow 70% of the world’s food are hungry, hunger kills 3.1 million children per year, and increasingly food is used as livestock feed or biofuels. Up to a third of all the world’s food is wasted – enough to feed 600 million hungry people each year. Hunger still prevails in a world of abundance even as obesity grows steadily. A food system anchored in market principles of supply and demand will never feed the world, because the private sector is not interested in feeding people who cannot pay. No analysis or research of recent decades has ever questioned this nature of food as a private good, and so the perception is that access to food is the problem. The standard economic definition of public goods is anchored in the idea of non-rivalry and non-excludability. Many societies have and still consider food as a common good, as well as forests, fisheries, land and water. As long as the replenishment rate outpaces the consumption rate, any resource – forests, fish, fresh air, food – can be considered an always available, renewable resource.  Bringing food back into the commons is essential for making the system more sustainable and fairer for food producers and consumers. The political economist Elinor Ostrom, a commons expert, suggested polycentric governance as a novel means to solve global problems, such as climate change. To bring about food production and supply as a global public good would require something similar; a three-part hybrid institutional arrangement formed by state institutions, private companies, and self-organised groups. Such a major transition will require experimentation, at personal, local, national, and international levels. It will require diverse approaches to governance, whether by the market, state or by collective actions for food. It will take several generations, and will require all three working together, as no single element can carry out the transition by itself. Governments have a vital role in countering the tendency toward wealth concentration, redistributing economic power towards the poor through genuine tax, credit, and land reforms. Two recent examples that might help are a meat tax to reduce meat consumption, or highly taxing junk food that contains high levels of sugar, fat and salt. Nevertheless, governments’ leading role should shift towards self-negotiated collective action from groups of producers and consumers. The benefit consumers receive by protecting, producing and using their own resources through their self-organised actions is key to understanding the value, not just the cost, of the food they eat. It requires civic engagement, community and equal stewardship of resources. There are already many initiatives worldwide that demonstrate how a right combination of collective action, government regulations and incentives, and private sector entrepreneurship yield good results for food producers, consumers, the environment, and society. The challenge is how to scale up those local initiatives to national level.  People’s capacity for collective action can complement the regulatory mandate of the state, and the demand-driven private sector. After all, millions of people innovating have far more capacity to find solutions than a few thousand scientists in laboratories. What’s more, collective action for food also helps rebuild the infrastructure of civic life eroded by individualistic behaviour, as philosopher Michael Sandel explains in What’s The Right Thing? Some practical recommendations: keep food out of trade agreements that deal with purely private goods. Instead, new production and distribution models for food are required. It would entail, among others, binding legal frameworks to fight hunger, obesity, and guarantee the right to food. It would include fraternal ethical and legal frameworks, universal Basic Food Entitlements or Food Security Floors guaranteed by the state. A minimum salary could be levelled with the costs of a typical food basket, financial speculation of food would be banned, and the non-consumption uses of food such as biofuels limited.  These are all geared towards establishing Universal Food Coverage, as called for by Amartya Sen, a social scheme that parallels the universal health and education that is the basis of the welfare state. Navigating the path between these arrangements will be one of the major challenges of the 21st century, as long as the population continues to grows. A fairer and more sustainable food system is possible; I do not expect to see it during my lifetime, but I hope my descendants may."
"**A conflict between the government of Ethiopia and forces in its northern Tigray region has thrown the country into turmoil.**
Fighting has been going on for almost two weeks, destabilising the populous country in East Africa, with reports of hundreds dead.
A power struggle, an election and a push for political reform are among several factors that led to the crisis.
Here, we've broken them down to explain how and why this conflict has flared.
In simple chunks of 100, 300 and 500 words, this is the story of the crisis so far.
The conflict started on 4 November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray.
He said he did so in response to an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray.
The escalation came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy's government and leaders of Tigray's dominant political party.
For almost three decades, the party was at the centre of power, before it was sidelined by Mr Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests.
Mr Abiy pursued reforms, but when Tigray resisted, a political crisis ensued.
The roots of this crisis can be traced to Ethiopia's system of government.
Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions.
Remember that powerful party from Tigray? Well, this party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - was influential in setting up this system.
It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power.
Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy.
Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister.
Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression.
Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.
These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray.
Tigray's leaders see Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system.
The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election. The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal.
The rift grew in October, when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray. Tigray's administration said this amounted to a ""declaration of war"".
Tensions increased. Then, in what the International Crisis Group termed a ""sudden and predictable"" descent into conflict, Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a ""red line"".
He accused Tigrayan forces of attacking an army base to steal weapons.
""The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,"" Mr Abiy said.
Ethiopia, Africa's oldest independent country, has undergone sweeping changes since Mr Abiy came to power.
A member of the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, Mr Abiy made appeals to political reform, unity and reconciliation in his first speech as prime minister.
His agenda was spurred by the demands of protesters who felt Ethiopia's political elite had obstructed the country's transition to democracy.
The Tigrayan politicians that led the ruling coalition for 27 years were deemed to be part of the problem.
In the 1970s and 1980s their party, the TPLF, fought a war to wrest control of government from a military junta known as the Derg. The party succeeded, becoming a leading member of the coalition government that took power in 1991.
The coalition gave autonomy to Ethiopia's regions, but retained a tight grip on central government, with critics accusing it of repressing political opposition.
Now the party finds itself in opposition.
In 2019, it refused to participate in Mr Abiy's new government and merge with his Prosperity Party.
This snub was followed by further escalations.
Tigray's decision to hold its own election in September, for example, was an unprecedented act of defiance against the central government.
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate"".
Tigray argues that the central government has not been tested in a national election since Mr Abiy's appointment as prime minister.
Tigray has also called out the prime minister for his ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
There has long been animosity between Tigray and the government in Eritrea, which shares a border with the region.
A dispute over territory along this border was the cause of a war fought between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 1998 until 2000.
You may remember this dispute making headlines in 2018.
That year, Mr Abiy signed a peace treaty with Eritrea's government, ending the territorial spat.
A year later, Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize. Now it is war, not peace, that is drawing attention to Ethiopia.
Thousands of civilians have been displaced since 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered his military to strike forces in Tigray. Hundreds more are reported to have died, with reports of a civilian massacre.
With the communications largely cut in Tigray, the exact number of casualties is not clear.
The Ethiopian government has announced a six-month state of emergency in Tigray. A full-blown civil war could last far longer.
""Given the strength of Tigray's security forces, the conflict could well be protracted,"" International Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation, says. ""Tigray has a large paramilitary force and a well-drilled local militia, thought to number perhaps 250,000 troops combined.""
As Africa's second-most populous country, Ethiopia is pivotal to stability in the Horn of Africa.
If the conflict intensifies, there are fears it could spill over into neighbouring countries. There have already been reports of missiles fired into Eritrea and 27,000 refugees fleeing to Sudan.
There is also a concern that the conflict could exacerbate ethnic tensions elsewhere in Ethiopia."

Many people, maybe most people in the media won’t care what an 81-year-old has to say about the roots of freedom in a democracy. And that is the problem; the failure to see the necessary connection between tradition, wisdom and freedom.



Every young journalist in New Zealand should carefully read Tom Holland’s recent and ambitious historical commentary “[Dominion; the Making of the Western Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Dominion-Making-Western-Tom-Holland/dp/1408706954)”. They would discover the inestimable debt they owe to the Jewish and Christian Scriptures. They would learn from the agnostic Holland that the West cannot be understood outside its Biblical foundation. They might discover why “in a West often doubtful of religion’s claims, so many of its instincts remain–for good or ill–thoroughly Christian. It is–to coin a phrase–the greatest story ever told.”



The young journalist might discover, or at least be prepared to consider, that the universal message of the Christian gospel has been recallibrated into a disconnected and incoherent human rights theory which would retain and enforce the universality it has rejected.



Holland reminds us that the West is unique in its “visceral and momentous suspicion that God is closer to the weak than to the mighty, to the poor than to the rich. Any beggar, any criminal, might be Christ. ‘So the last will be first and the first last.”’



Holland points out that many of the human rights we hold to be self-evident, the equality of men with women, justice for the weak, freedom of religious belief and expression as well as free speech, are not self-evident at all. They are entirely biblical and are reinforced specifically from the life and teachings of Christ.



It would be gratifying to think that a deeper knowledge of our roots might restore some kind of equilibrium to the New Zealand media because it is being increasingly unbalanced by a usurping wokeness. 



Having lost belief in their own history, journalists are easily tempted by the chronological snobbery of the post-truth age. “We’re in the 21st century for goodness sake.” It has become very difficult to have a balanced debate in mainstream media on multiculturalism, human rights, climate change, transgenderism, same-sex marriage. Indeed, New Zealand is probably the worst country in the English-speaking world to have such a debate. Whatever happened to the fourth estate’s declared objectivity?



The media appears to take for granted a progressive (more accurately de-Christianising) consensus on what is right and what is wrong. For example, it is not self-evidently true that the individual man or woman has his or her own intrinsic dignity. The progressive mind might believe that everyone should be equal under the law but it has no foundation for thinking so; it is enthralled by the political subjectivism of contemporary ideology. The personal story assumes an authority above that fortuitous blend of tradition, accumulated knowledge and reason. The media no longer has the capacity to be the conscience of society; it has become the instrument of woke.



The Progressive de-Christianisers ridicule Christian history from the very perspective of the Christian morality they think out of date. Advocates of same-sex marriage and transgenderism reject Christian teaching but embrace a vision of monogamous marriage that has its origin in the same rejected teaching. Even the right for women to consent in sexual matters has its origin in their shared dignity with men.



Pro-choice abortion activists who argue for the right of women to control their bodies do so on the basis of the Christian explanation of human dignity. Feminists claim a common dignity with men but deny the authority of having been created in God’s image.



Presumably, in the alleged search for social justice, a point will be reached when we arrive at the promised Utopia and will hardly need government anymore. However, democracy is not “like a train that you get off once it has reached its destination”. We will not be met by peace, joy and freedom. 



Having rejected the redemptive concept of sin and forgiveness it must be replaced by an incoherent mix of victimhood and belief in essential human goodness. When everything is a social construction, equality cannot be the consequence. Instead, we will breed a virtue-signalling elite more hypocritical than the one rejected. Dissenters by their very nature must be evil, fit only for the rubbish dump.

The Thai people voted on the latest constitution pushed by the reigning military junta. A no vote was the only way to protest General/​Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s dictatorship, but a majority of Thais apparently hoped to return to at least nominal civilian rule. No one knows what would have followed rejection of the military’s handiwork, though few believe the generalissimo was prepared to acknowledge his many mistakes and yield power.



Thailand long was characterized as the land of smiles: a friendly people, warm climate, and informal atmosphere all beckoned backpackers and businessmen alike. But politics has become less hospitable in recent years.



In 1932 the all‐​powerful king was turned into a constitutional monarch. However, military coups were frequent and the court, along with the military, bureaucracy, and business, long dominated democratic politics. Well‐​connected elites prospered while the rural poor languished, seemingly forgotten by their own government.



That came to a dramatic end in 2001 when flamboyant business mogul Shinawatra Thaksin (the latter his given name, by which he is known), ran a populist campaign and won the support of the long‐​suffering rural poor. The usual governing elites refused to accept their loss of control and complained about his spend, spend, elect, elect policies, a staple of modern democracy. Thaksin was charged with corruption, but his adversaries, including in the military, also appeared to do well while supposedly doing good. In contrast, his government’s most serious misbehavior, some 2000 extra‐​legal killings in Thailand’s drug war, was largely ignored.



An extended, often violent political struggle ensued, culminating in a coup in 2006. The military’s constitutional rewrite preserved democracy, albeit with elite‐​dominated commissions, courts, and other institutions designed to thwart the popular will. Despite the military’s hopes, however, Thaksin’s allies (he was in exile abroad) regained power in the next election.





Thailand’s only hope for the future is to end the wannabe dictator Prayuth’s starring role in the country’s political comic opera.



Members of the opposition remained frank about their hostility toward giving Thaksin’s voters any say in the nation’s future. Acting as a modern variant of Mussolini’s Blackshirts, his opponents made the country ungovernable and invited military intervention. While refusing to back prime ministers allied with Thaksin against violent street mobs, in 2010 the military shot down scores of Thaksin supporters who protested the forced ouster of the government they had voted into office.



But this soft coup only led to a large majority voting for Thaksin’s sister, Yingluck, in the election that followed a year later. So the opposition again deployed mobs in a successful attempt to destroy democracy. When she called another election which the Thaksin‐​friendly Puea Thai Party was certain to win, the opposition Democrat Party demonstrated that its name was an oxymoron by refusing to contest the poll. Worse, anti‐​government protestors blocked voting. In May 2014 Gen. Prayuth seized power, while proclaiming that he had a “democratic heart.”



However, he channeled George Orwell when establishing the National Council for Peace and Order. The anodyne name mimicked the fraudulent titles promulgated by the Burmese military to cover its brutality. The Thai junta challenged anyone who called it a junta or said it took power in a coup. The NCPO also engaged in the usual repression accompanying a military putsch: banned public protests, prohibited political meetings, seized radio and televisions stations, censored print media, blocked websites, threatened dissidents, detained critics, and tried opponents in military courts.



So far more than 1300 people have been detained for “attitude adjustment” and even more have been charged with criminal offenses. More than 1600 people have been tried in military courts, not noted for procedural fairness. Those punished include academics, students, politicians, and journalists. The junta dropped charges against officials indicted in the 2010 massacre of pro‐​Thaksin demonstrators while filing criminal charges against his sister for the political offense of pork barrel politics.



Although many detainees were released after promising to eschew criticism of the military dictatorship, others were held incommunicado and likely tortured, though anyone reporting such incidents faces prosecution. For instance, Amnesty International has taken up the cause of three activists arrested in July for exposing torture and other ill‐​treatment by the army and police; they have been charged with criminal defamation and computer crimes. In July the regime filed criminal charges against 25‐​year‐​old Naritsarawan Kaewnopparat for seeking justice for her uncle, a military conscript beaten to death by other soldiers in 2011.



The junta also has targeted opponents with Thailand’s oppressive lese‐​majeste laws. Although the king criticized criminalization of virtually any discussion of the monarchy, the military treats even harmless comments as threats to “national security.” Freedom House observed: “The charges have been used to target activists, scholars, students, journalists, foreign authors, and politicians.” Sentences tend to be long—two recent ones involving Facebook messages ran 28 and 30 years—and scores of cases are pending.



Earlier this month the government charged 40‐​year‐​old Patnaree Chankij for responding to a private Facebook message critical of the monarchy with “ja,” the equivalent of “yeah,” meaning either yes or noncommittal, depending on the context. For this word she faces trial before a military court and a possible 15‐​year‐​sentence. The charge likely is intended to silence her son, Sirawith Seritwat, a student member of both the New Democracy Movement and Resistant Citizen group, which oppose military rule.



The brutality of generalissimo Prayuth’s rule cannot be disguised by his cartoonish nature. The generalissimo appears to be a character in a Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera. One of his first acts was to send service personnel out to sing and dance while proclaiming the return of happiness to Thailand. He penned a song on the subject and hosts a weekly television show in which he lectures the nation. All the while he appears to be genuinely befuddled, even shocked and outraged, that the people do not adore him and follow his orders without question.



The human rights group Freedom House reports that Thailand has regressed from “partly free” to “not free.” Human Rights Watch concluded: “Thailand’s military junta has used dictatorial power to systematically repress human rights throughout the country.” (For its trouble, HRW’s website was blocked in Thailand.)



In its latest human rights report the State Department was blunt and comprehensive. The NCPO had imposed an interim constitution and decrees “severely limiting civil liberties, including restrictions on freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.” People could not choose their government and security forces often abused human rights, while largely enjoying “official impunity.”



Moreover, added State, other “human rights problems included arbitrary arrests and detention; poor, overcrowded, and unsanitary prison and detention facilities; restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, and association; corruption;” and limits on worker rights. Also evident was insufficient protection for “vulnerable populations.”



Perhaps most shocking is how Bangkok leapfrogged backward over Burma, which is now freer than Thailand. After decades of brutal misrule, the Burmese military yielded much control. Although the civilian government has yet to gain full authority, the Burmese people are mostly free to speak and write; in last fall’s election they gave the opposition an overwhelming majority in parliament. Contrast that with life under Thailand’s NCPO.



Alas, generalissimo Prayuth and his minions were not content with the usual repression. The regime broke new ground in treating almost everything as a prohibited protest. People were detained for placing duct tape over their mouths, making the Hunger Games three‐​finger salute, holding papers and placards with anti‐​coup messages, and aiding those arrested. Nor is that all. The military also detained people for standing, eating, wearing black on the king’s birthday, holding blank paper, selling goods decorated with Thaksin’s face, reading George Orwell’s 1984 in public, publicizing a poem on democracy, playing the French national anthem “La Marseillaise,” and talking to journalists.



Another prohibited act was wearing t‐​shirts with political slogans and other messages interpreted as political. I’ve worn my Lord Acton t‐​shirt, with his aphorism about power’s corrupting effect, all over the world, including in China. But I have not taken it to Thailand since the coup, given the junta’s extreme sensitivity to any criticism.



Last year the dictator wannabe complained about critics of the first draft of a new constitution—to succeed the 19 others used since 1932, when the monarchy was first limited. People were “harsh” towards him and had no right to comment. He added ominously, “I will have to be harsh in return.” In December generalissimo Prayuth whined that newspapers “made me lose my manners and have ruined my leader image.” His outrage burned: “I will shut them down for real. I cannot allow them to continue their disrespect.” Yet he insisted that he was restrained in using his authority since, he informed journalists, he had the power to shoot them! His comments did not convince skeptics.



To General/​Prime Minister Prayuth’s credit, he quickly gave up his democratic pretenses. In March 2015 he proclaimed: “Our country has seen so much trouble because we have had too much democracy.” The problem? Thaksin and his allies won five straight elections. The generalissimo originally promised a new vote within 15 months, which was last August. But he quickly pushed that deadline back. Then last summer after an advisory panel rejected the military’s first constitutional try, the NCPO continued on, taking its time to produce another version no less dictator‐​friendly, which was just ratified.



In essence, the military will continue to dominate the state. There will be elections, but those chosen will not rule. Complained Sunai Phasuk of Human Rights Watch, the constitution “essentially enshrines the abuse of power and impunity.” Indeed, the referendum “is a redo of a military coup, using fear and intimidation to force Thai people to grant an extension of their control of power.” Even past juntas generally appointed technocrats to office, allowed dissent, and returned power to the people. Generalissimo Prayuth has taken a far more repressive approach on every particular, including the new constitution.



While presumably allowing a nominally free vote—no one really knows, since Bangkok refused to allow independent election monitors—on its “roadmap to democracy,” the military did everything else possible to force the population to ratify its continued rule from the shadows. The regime promulgated propaganda in the name of explaining the document. Conscripts were deployed to promote a yes vote.



Most important, anyone opposing the constitution, whether online, in print, or in public, faced up to ten years in prison. In his finest dictatorial form, General/​Prime Minister Prayuth declared that the Thai people “have no rights to say that they disagree” with him: “I don’t allow anyone to debate or hold a press conference about the draft constitution. Yet they still disobey my orders. They will be arrested and jailed for ten years. No one will be exempted, not even the media.” No longer any pretense of a having “democratic heart!”



Journalists admitted avoiding reporting on the referendum to avoid causing official offense. One of the courageous activists willing to take a stand, Rangsiman Rome, co‐​founder of the New Democracy Movement, told the Guardian that “The main thing [the draft constitution] represents is the NCPO, the main thing it will do is prolong the power of the NCPO.” But at least 120 people, including former cabinet ministers and parliamentarians, were arrested for criticizing the document. The youngest defendant was an eight‐​year‐​old girl charged with obstruction for tearing down a poster because she liked its (pink) color. The generalissimo’s minions were not amused.



With many real democrats boycotting the poll, the outcome comes as no surprise, even though despite the military’s gag on the entire nation it was evident that the document was a blueprint for continued repression. Even former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, who originally acted as an enabler of dictatorship, criticized the draft document for violating people’s liberties and failing to confront corruption. Some who initially favored or accepted military rule now recognize that the generals intended to take power for themselves, not the old elites.



However, enacting the constitution is the quickest, and perhaps only, way back to nominal civilian rule, but only nominal. General/​Prime Minister Prayuth, with his Gilbert and Sullivan routine, will remain in power in the background. Moreover, the junta will argue that a yes vote ratified its manifold and severe violations of human rights. Finally, constitutionalizing the suppression of the Thai people’s civil and political liberties will be the most destabilizing step of all. Refusing to allow people to choose their path, warned former cabinet minister Chaturon Chaisang, means “there will be conflict in the future.”



In fact, the best outcome would be for the next elected government to propose its own constitution, one true to democracy rather than autocracy. That would ensure a confrontation with the Generalissimo & Co. Such a course is not for the faint of heart, but otherwise democracy will be dead.

"**After launching the most ambitious reforms in his country's history Ethiopia's Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, is under threat. The murder of his army chief of staff amid an alleged coup attempt in the Amhara region has highlighted the vulnerability of the reform process. The BBC's Africa Editor, Fergal Keane, analyses the challenge facing the continent's youngest leader.**
Just a few weeks ago, Abiy Ahmed was riding high and feted across Africa as a reformer.
He had released political prisoners, appointed women to more than half of his cabinet posts, persuaded a noted dissident to head the country's election board, and staged an historic rapprochement with neighbouring Eritrea after decades of conflict.
When I met him in December last year he was brimming with confidence, even telling me that the world should look to Ethiopia ""to see how people can live together in peace.""
Now after an alleged coup attempt against the Amhara regional government which killed his army chief of staff and close ally, General Seare Mekonnen, Mr Abiy's position and the future of his reforms look much less secure.
The alleged instigator of the coup was shot dead and a wave of arrests followed. But nobody with any knowledge of Ethiopia believes this is the end of the matter.
With nearly 2.5 million people displaced by ethnic violence and deep divisions within the ruling EPRDF coalition, Mr Abiy is acutely vulnerable.
He is to some extent a victim of his own reformist zeal.
Ethiopia is made up of nine different self-governing ethnic regions.
Ethnic nationalism was kept ruthlessly in check under the Marxist Dergue regime and during the two decades of EPRDF rule that followed. The opening of the political space under Mr Abiy has lifted a lid on ethnic tensions.
Ethiopia's system of ethnic federalism was always going to be vulnerable to politicians playing on atavistic sentiments.
And the speed of Mr Abiy's reforms has unsettled the four party coalition that makes up the ruling party. There is acute alienation among Tigrayans who comprise just 6% of the population but dominated the previous government.
In Oromia and Amhara - the two most populous states - smaller parties have emerged appealing to crude ethnic sentiment. The man suspected to have masterminded the Amhara coup attempt was also accused of recruiting an ethnic militia.
In the Somali ethnic region I visited a refugee camp that was host to some of the 700,000 people who had fled ethnic clashes with their Oromo neighbours. Think of the scale of those numbers and the individual suffering involved.
I recall the words of an elderly woman who had travelled for weeks to reach the camp.
""We were living in peace but the Oromos living in that area said: 'Your numbers along with other Ethiopians is growing and we want you to leave.' Then conflict started afterwards and they slaughtered our men and killed our children, and that is why we came here looking for peace.""
Having reported on ethnic conflict in Europe, Asia and Africa I found her words chillingly familiar.
The experience of Ethiopia under Mr Abiy underlines the old truism that the most vulnerable moment for any authoritarian state is when it starts to reform. Under dictatorship ethnic hatred does not vanish. It simply gets driven underground.
The examples throughout history are numerous. Consider the case of the former Yugoslavia which descended into a series of savage civil wars after the end of Joseph Broz Tito's long reign.
But Yugoslavia did not descend into civil war simply because of so-called ""ancient hatreds"". It took unscrupulous leaders - notably Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia - to create the horrors of ethnic cleansing in late 20th Century Europe.
**You may also be interested in:**
Mr Abiy is not of the same ilk. His broad vision is progressive and inclusive.
But I recall a conversation with one of his critics in Tigray, Getachew Reda: ""Abiy is a very driven, very ambitious man. He symbolises the kind of ambition, the kind of courage to storm the heavens that youth would represent, but he also represents the kind of tendency to gloss over things, the kind of tendency to try to telescope decades into months, yearsâ¦ to rush things.""
Ethiopia's prime minister now needs to move carefully. The wave of arrests that followed the attempted coup - more than 250 people are in custody - runs the risk of deepening resentment in Amhara.
The blockage of the internet in recent weeks may have been intended to frustrate the mobilising capacity of his enemies, it felt very far from the open government Mr Abiy promised. The country is awash with rumour and speculation.
**Key facts: Abiy Ahmed**
Elections are due next year but already senior officials are doubting whether they can go ahead. Last year's local elections were postponed because of unrest.
I met the head of the election board, Birtukan Mideksa in Addis Ababa last December when there was still optimism about polls. She is a former dissident invited home from exile by Mr Abiy.
""To have, like, a former opposition leader, former dissident, to lead an institution with, you know, significant independence of action, you know, it means a lot,"" she told me.
""So, of course, it needs a lot of collaboration, to institutionalise democracy, and have meaningful election and free media on, you know, independent institutions. But I'm very hopeful we will do differently this time around.""
Now she is warning that elections may have to be delayed, telling Reuters news agency that if ""the security of the country is not going to improve, we can't tell voters to go and vote"".
Yet cancelling elections is likely to increase polarisation. The balance between security and freedom could not be harder to achieve.
Mr Abiy's great challenge is to build a coalition for change across the ethnic groups. That will take persuasion.
It will demand restraint. And it will require balancing of groups and interests in government. Besides his abundant youthful energy Mr Abiy is going to need more of the wisdom of age."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLooking at the English-language media, one might be led to think that the latest CERN experimental results show that trees alone dominate cloud formation, by supplying the necessary cloud seeding medium. Little reference is made to cosmic rays acting as the cloud formation modulator, initiating the cloud seeding process, as hypothesized by Henrik Svensmark.
Lubos Motl at the Reference Frame noted that factions of the mainstream media seem to have spun the recent CERN papers in a “bizarre” way.

Climate models way off target. CERN’s latest CLOUD experiment results further underpin Svensmark’s cosmic ray-climate theory. Image: Maximillien Brice/CERN
German press reports cite cosmic rays
Yet looking at the reporting by German-language scientific media, one finds plenty of mention of cosmic rays as a major player in cloud formation, which has a large cooling effect on our climate, and that erosols have been grossly misweighted in the recent climate models.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Professor Fritz Vahrenholt here write that the latest CERN results confirm what they claimed already in their 2012 book: The Neglected Sun. Today they write:
Already one year ago, in April 2015, scientists warned that the cooling effect by aerosols had been exaggerated (see our blog article “Director of the Hamburg Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology: Aerosols cool less than previously assumed“). This appears to have been confirmed further. Within the scope of the CLOUD Project at CERN, scientists have found more indications that the aerosol effect in the models must corrected strongly downwards.”
Scinexx.de here writes that trees earlier “provided the means for lots of clouds before industrialization” and that “man obviously has influenced cloud formation [Industrialization] less than previously thought.”
So if it wasn’t human emitted particles seeding clouds before industry; and causing cooling like in the mid 20th, what could it have been? The answer according to CERN is “organic vapours emitted by trees that produce lots of aerosol particles in the atmosphere when there’s no sulphuric acid.”
How does the cloud seeding by organic tree particles work? Through nucleation-inducing cosmic rays.

Cosmic rays as the amplifier
Scienxx.de writes that scientists used the CLOUD experiment to discover this in a controlled environment and so “determine how strongly certain components in the air or certain molecules contribute to cloud formation” and “how strongly these are amplified by the energy influx through cosmic rays.”
Adding:
Although the product of alpha pines occurred only in concentrations of one molecule per one trillion air molecules, they effectively contributed to cloud formation as the experiment showed. Through the influence of ions from cosmic rays, the effect increases even 10 to 100 times.”
That means cloud cover (and so cooling) would be the likely result in conditions of high cosmic ray influx into the lower atmosphere, as is the case during periods of low solar activity. Thus it appears Svensmark’s theory strengthens further.
Germany’s online wissenschaft-aktuell.de also points out the essential role of cosmic rays.
In the artificial atmosphere, scientists directed a beam of positively charged particles, so-called pions, which were generated by a Proton-Synchrotron. With this they simulated the effect of cosmic rays, which are constantly penetrating into the atmosphere. This stream of particles caused the organic molecules to ball up into approximately 2-nanometer size particles. More measurements confirmed that these volatile organic compounds grew further to form efficient condensation nuclei. In parallel the scientists underpinned the mechanism with computer models. ‘These results for me are the most important so far that the CLOUD experiment yielded so far,’ said Kirkby.”

The online Austrian science.orf.at here tells us more of the same: cosmic rays are at very much at play:
The experiment also showed that the nucleation rate rose by one or two orders of magnitude under the influence of cosmic rays. ‘This allows one to conclude that cosmic rays had a greater role on aerosols and cloud formation in preindustrial times than under today’s relatively dirty conditions,” said Paul Winkler of the Department of Aerosol Physics and Environmental Physics at the University of Vienna.”
In their press releases the government-paid scientists can add the mandatory “the-warming-continues” remarks all they want, but one thing is clear: The models have a long way to go and they are in dire need of major revamping. CO2 is nowhere near as important as some want us to believe it is. Cosmic rays, modeulated by the sun’s magnetic field, are together a factor that need to be accounted for.
It’s time for the habitual solar-denying so-called “experts” to acknowledge this and to start modelling much more accurately. We’ve known this for years already.

In a way, everything is technology,” noted one of the world’s greatest economic historians, Fernand Braudel, in his monumental study _Civilization and_ _Capitalism_. “Not only man’s most strenuous endeavors but also his patient and monotonous efforts to make a mark on the external world; not only the rapid changes … but also the slow improvements in processes and tools, and those innumerable actions which may have no immediate innovating significance but which are the fruit of accumulated knowledge,” he continued. Yes, land, labor, and capital (that’s to say, the factors of production) are important components of economic growth. In the end, however, human progress in general and global enrichment in particular are largely dependent on invention and innovation. That is surely even clearer now that humanity’s hopes for the end of the pandemic and for our liberation from the accompanying lockdown rest on further scientific breakthroughs within the pharmaceutical industry. Let’s take a brief look at the impact of technology on health care, food supply, work, and sociality in the time of COVID-19.



 **HEALTH CARE**  
The impact of modern technology is surely most keenly felt and anticipated within the sphere of human health care. Consider some of the worst diseases that humanity has had to face in the past. Smallpox, which is thought to have killed an estimated 300 million people in the 20th century alone, originated in either India or Egypt at least 3,000 years ago. Smallpox variolation, it seems, was practiced in China in the tenth century, but it was not until the late 18th century that Edward Jenner vaccinated his first patient against the disease. Smallpox was fully eradicated only in 1980. Similar stories could be told about other killer diseases. Polio, which can be seen depicted in Egyptian carvings from the 18th dynasty, is of ancient origin. Yet the disease wasn’t properly analyzed until the year of the French Revolution, with Jonas Salk’s vaccine appearing only in 1955. Today, polio is close to being eradicated (just 95 cases were reported in 2019).



Malaria, probably humanity’s greatest foe, is at least 30 million years old (the parasite has been found in an amber‐​encased mosquito from the Paleogene period). It was only after the discovery of the New World that knowledge about the fever‐​reducing benefits of the bark of the cinchona tree spread to Europe and Asia. Quinine was first isolated in 1820, and chloroquine was introduced in 1946. Artemisinin drugs, which we still use, were discovered in the late 1970s. That’s to say that humanity lived with deadly diseases for millennia without fully knowing what they were, how they were transmitted, and how they could be cured. The fate of humanity, our ancestors thought, fluctuated under the extraneous influence of the “wheel of fortune” and there was nothing that anyone could do about it. One day you were alive and next day you were not.



Let’s take a brief look at the impact of technology on health care, food supply, work, and sociality in the time of COVID-19. 



Contrast that glacial pace of progress, and the fatalistic acceptance of disease and death, with our response time to the current pandemic. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reported the existence of a cluster of cases of “pneumonia” in Wuhan on December 31. On January 7 the Chinese identified the pathogen (novel coronavirus) responsible for the outbreak. On January 11 China sequenced the genetic code of the virus, and the next day it was publicly available. That enabled the rest of the world to start making diagnostic kits to identify the disease. To take one example, the first COVID-19 infection in South Korea was identified on January 20. On February 4, the first test kit (made by Kogene Biotech) entered production. On February 7, the test kit was available at 50 locations around the country. Other countries followed suit.



The World Health Organization, which declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, may have acted too late. Still, it is noteworthy that just two months expired between the first sign of trouble and the time when the entire world put measures in place to retard the spread of the disease. In the meantime, we have learned a lot about governmental incompetence and regulatory overreach. But we have also learned a great deal about the spread and symptoms of the disease. Instead of starting from scratch, medical specialists in Europe and America can draw on the expertise of their colleagues in the Far East. Before the telegraph appeared midway through the 19th century, it took up to a month for a ship to carry information from London to New York. Today, we learn about the latest COVID-19 news (good and bad) and research in seconds.



By mid April, thousands of highly educated and well‐​funded specialists throughout the world were using supercomputers and artificial intelligence to identify promising paths toward victory over the disease. Some 200 different programs are underway to develop therapies and vaccines to combat the pandemic. They include studies of the effectiveness of existing antiviral drugs, such as Gilead’s Remdesivir, Ono’s protease inhibitor, and Fujifilm’s favipiravir. The effectiveness of generic drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, is also being evaluated. Takeda is hard at work on convalescent plasma (TAK-888) in Japan, while Regeneron works on monoclonal antibodies in the United States. New vaccines, such as Moderna’s mRNA‐​1273, Inovio’s INO-4800, and BioNTech’s BNT162, are under development.



We don’t know which of these treatments (if any) will work, but here is what we can be sure of: There has never been a better time for humans to face and defeat a global pandemic. The world is richer than ever before, and money is what enables us to sustain a massive pharmaceutical industry and pay for highly sophisticated medical research and development. Coronavirus may be deadly, but it is not the bubonic plague, which had a mortality rate of 50 percent. Luckily, it is a far milder virus that has reawakened us to the danger posed by communicable diseases. Once the immediate crisis is behind us, researchers will collect billions of data from dozens of countries and analyze the different governmental responses to the pandemic. That knowledge will be deployed by governments and the private sector to ensure that best practices are adopted, so that next time we are better prepared.



 **FOOD**  
When the Black Plague struck Europe in 1347, the disease found the local population ripe for slaughter. Following the close of the Medieval Warm Period at the end of the 13th century, the climate turned cold and rainy. Harvests shrunk and famines proliferated. France, for example, saw localized famines in 1304, 1305, 1310, 1315–17, 1330–34, 1349–51, 1358–60, 1371, 1374–75, and 1390. The Europeans, weakened by shortages of food, succumbed to the disease in great numbers.



The people of yore faced at least three interrelated problems. First, the means of transport and the transportation infrastructure were awful. On land, the Europeans used the same haulage methods (carts pulled by donkeys, horses, and oxen) that the ancients had invented. Similarly, much of Europe continued to use roads built by the Romans. Most people never left their native villages or visited the nearest towns. They had no reason to do so, for all that was necessary to sustain their meager day‐​to‐​day existence was produced locally. The second problem was the lack of important information. It could take weeks to raise the alarm about impending food shortages, let alone organize relief for stricken communities. Third, regional trade was seldom free (France did not have a single internal market until the Revolution) and global trade remained relatively insignificant in economic terms until the second half of the 19th century. Food was both scarce and expensive. In 15th‐​century England, 80 percent of ordinary people’s private expenditure went for food. Of that amount, 20 percent was spent on bread alone. Under those circumstances, a local crop failure could spell the destruction of an entire community. (Those who think that COVID-19 exposed the fragility of modern society should look up the Great Famine.)



By comparison, by 2013 only 10 percent of private expenditure in the United States was spent on food, a figure that is itself inflated by the amount Americans typically spend in restaurants. Speaking of restaurants, while most have been forced to close their doors, the restaurateurs use apps to deliver excellent food at reasonable prices. Moreover, months into the COVID-19 pandemic, the shops are, generally, well stocked and regularly replenished by the largely uninterrupted stream of cargo flights, truck hauling, and commercial shipping. Due to the miracle of mobile refrigeration, fresh produce continues to be sourced from different parts of the United States and abroad. Shortly before writing this piece, I was able to buy oranges from California, avocados from Mexico, and grapes from Chile in my local supermarket. Globalization may be under pressure from both the left and the right of the U.S. political spectrum, but should the pandemic impair U.S. agricultural production, many will be forced to acknowledge the benefits of the global food supply and our ability to import food from COVID‐​19‐​unaffected parts of the world.



This extensive and, at this point, still sturdy supply chain is, of course, a technological marvel. Computers collate information about items on the shelf that are in short supply, adjust the variety and quantity of items shipped between stores, fill new orders, etc. And so, commerce that’s still allowed to go on goes on. So does charity. Feeding America, a network of more than 200 food banks, feeds tens of millions of people through food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, etc. Since 2005, the organization has been using a computerized internal market to allocate food more rationally. Feeding America uses its own currency, called “shares,” with which individual food banks can bid on the foods that they need the most. Grocery‐​delivery services bring food to the doorsteps of those who cannot or do not want to leave their homes. The old and the infirm can also use phones, emails, and apps to call upon volunteers to do their shopping and delivery.



 **WORK**  
The nature of work has changed a lot over the last 200 years or so. Before the industrial revolution, between 85 percent and 90 percent of the people in the Western world were farm laborers. Their work was excruciatingly difficult, as witnessed by one 18th‐​century Austrian physician who observed that “in many villages [of the Austrian Empire] the dung has to be carried on human backs up high mountains and the soil has to be scraped in a crouching position; this is the reason why most of the young people are deformed and misshapen.” People lived on the edge of starvation, with both the very young and the very old expected to contribute as much as they could to the economic output of the family (most production in the pre‐​modern era was based on the family unit, hence the Greek term _oikonomia_ , or household management). In those circumstances, sickness was a catastrophe: It reduced the family unit’s production, and therefore its consumption.



The industrial revolution allowed people to move from farms to factories, where work was better paid, more enjoyable, and less strenuous (which is largely why people in poor countries continue to stream from agricultural employment to manufacturing jobs today). Moreover, wealth exploded (real annual family income in the United States rose from $1,980 in 1800 to $53,018 in 2016). That allowed for ever‐​increasing specialization, which included a massive expansion of services catering to the desires of an ever‐​more‐​prosperous population. The service sector today consists of jobs in the information sector, investment services, technical and scientific services, health care, and social‐​assistance services, as well as in arts, entertainment, and recreation. Most of these jobs are less physically arduous, more intellectually stimulating, and better paid than either agricultural or manufacturing jobs ever were. Crucially, many of these service‐​sector jobs can be performed remotely. That means that even in the midst of the government‐​imposed economic shutdown, some work (about a third, estimates suggest) can go on. The economic losses from COVID-19, in other words, will be astronomical, but not total.



My own organization, for example, shut its doors in mid March. Since then, everyone has been scribbling away at home or appearing on news shows around the world via the Internet. All of us are in regular contact via the phone, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams. Other organizations are doing the same. As we already discussed, a great deal of shopping is taking place online. Shipping and delivery companies are expanding, with Amazon hiring 100,000 additional workers in the United States. Home entertainment, of course, has grown tremendously, with Netflix adding millions of new customers and expanding its offerings with thousands of new films and television shows. With over 30 million American children stuck at home, online learning companies are booming, and educators from high‐​school teachers to college professors continue to perform their jobs remotely. Telehealth is expanding, allowing patients to see their doctors in a safe and convenient way. Even minor medical procedures, such as eye exams, can be conducted remotely, and multiple companies will deliver your new specs to your front door. Banking and finance are still going on, with many people taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages. Finally, the often unfairly maligned pharmaceutical industry is expanding as we all wait and hope for the release of a COVID-19 vaccine or effective therapeutic treatment.



 **SOCIALITY**  
Aristotle observed that “man is by nature a social animal” and noted that without friends we would be unhappy. But the role of sociality (that is to say, the tendency to associate in or form social groups) goes much deeper than that. As William von Hippel explained in his 2018 book _The Social Leap_ , sociality is the mechanism by which _Homo sapiens_ came about. When early hominids were forced down from the trees (perhaps as a result of a climatic change that dried up African forests), they became more vulnerable to predators. To cover longer distances between the fast‐​disappearing trees while maintaining a modicum of protection against other animals, our ancestors developed bipedalism, which allowed them to free their upper body to carry weapons such as sticks and stones.



Even more important was the invention of cooperation. While a stick‐​wielding ape is slightly better‐​off than an unarmed one, a group of armed apes is much better at dispatching predators. Individuals in more cooperative bands survived to adulthood and bred more often, resulting in more‐​cooperative species. Furthermore, since living alone was tantamount to a death sentence, selfish apes who didn’t care about being ostracized for not pulling their weight died off, resulting in a desire for communal cooperation and a deep‐​rooted fear of rejection by the group.



The early hominids had brains more like those of chimps than those of modern humans. That’s because the evolutionary pressures that created the former — such as predation and food scarcity — could be overcome without tremendous intelligence. These pressures to survive were part of the physical landscape — a challenging but static environment that didn’t require a lot of cognitive ability to navigate. The environmental pressure that resulted in modern humans was the social system itself. The social landscape is much more dynamic than the physical one. Once they had banded together in groups, our ancestors were forced to forge relationships with, and avoid being exploited by, individuals with divergent and constantly shifting interests. Those who couldn’t keep up with the increasingly complex social game either died or were unable to mate.



This new pressure created a positive evolutionary cycle: Banding together created more complex social systems, which required bigger brains; bigger brains needed to be fed; and the best way to get more food was more cooperation and a more sophisticated social system. The main cognitive development that evolved from this evolutionary cycle is known as the “theory of mind.” In short, the theory of mind is the ability to understand that other minds can have different reasoning, knowledge, and desires from your own. While that seems basic, the theory of mind distinguishes us from all other life on Earth. It allows us to determine whether an affront, for example, was intentional, accidental, or forced. It allows us to feel emotions such as empathy, pride, and guilt — abilities that are keys to a functioning society.



So sociality and human beings are inseparable, as we have all been clearly reminded by the sudden restrictions on our ability to interact with others. As we sit at home, working away on our computers or watching television, most of us feel a tremendous sense of isolation (“social distancing”) from our family, friends, and colleagues. The urge to be around others is innate to us. It is who we are. Dissatisfied with impersonal modes of communication, such as email and texting, we have rediscovered the need for a face‐​to‐​face interaction with our fellow humans. To that end, we utilize digital platforms such as Zoom, Google Hangouts, Facebook Live, and FaceTime to catch up on the latest news in other people’s lives, or simply to complain about the misery of loneliness and the pathetic inadequacy of our public officials (of both parties). Throughout the nation, people engage in virtual happy hours, dinners, book clubs, fitness classes, religious services, and group meditation. As my Cato Institute colleague Chelsea Follett recently wrote, “Technology has made it easier than ever to hold a physically‐​distanced ‘watch party’ synchronized so that viewers in different locations see the same part of a movie at the same time. For those who like to discuss movies as they watch, technology also enables a running group commentary of each scene in real time.” In the saddest of cases, technology enables people to say goodbye to dying friends and relatives. In a very real sense, therefore, technology keeps us sane (or, at the very least, saner).



Technology, then, allows us to cope with the challenges of the pandemic in ways that our ancestors could not even dream about. More important, technology allows our species to face the virus with grounds for rational optimism. In these dark days, remember all the scientists who are utilizing the accumulated store of human knowledge to defeat COVID-19 in record time and all the marvelous (not to say miraculous) ways the modern world keeps us well fed, psychologically semi‐​balanced, and (in many cases) productively engaged.

I recently flew to China for an academic conference on some of the geopolitical and security issues dividing Washington and Beijing. I had attended the same event two years before and enjoyed the wide‐​ranging discussion. The conference was to bring together scholars from throughout Asia and beyond.



When I landed, however, my host informed me that the school needed higher approval to host any foreigners, so only domestic academics could participate in the next day’s sessions, and my separate talk scheduled for the following day was cancelled.



I wasn’t the only person affected, but I had traveled the furthest. I spent my two days playing tourist and chatting informally with some of the other scholars. It was a lost opportunity to consider approaches which might halt the seeming slide toward possible military confrontation. I was later told that the extra level of approval was always required for international participation but had been routinely ignored in practice. No longer, it seemed.





Beijing’s shift back toward suffocating totalitarianism is a great disappointment to China’s friends in the U.S.



Whatever the genesis of the restriction, it obviously reduced one set of unofficial contacts which have helped draw together the U.S. and People’s Republic of China. That comes on top of actions by both governments which threaten to further close the door to academic and other exchanges.



One of the most important, if low key, steps taken by the Obama administration in expanding Sino‐​American contacts was to initiate the issuance of ten‐​year visas by both nations. That eased requirements for participating in conferences, especially in response to last minute invitations, and the measure encouraged more routine travel, since the process to acquiring a visa had grown more difficult over time.



Yet Washington has shifted that process in reverse. The New York Times recently reported on the case of Zhu Feng, a well‐​known and well‐​traveled specialist in international relations, now teaching at Nanjing University and heading the China Center for Collaborative Studies of the South China Sea. As he prepared to board his flight back to the PRC two FBI agents accosted him, demanded his passport, and crossed out his oft‐​used ten‐​year visa without explanation.



Some scholars, such as Wang Wen, Director of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies in Beijing, were notified by email that Washington was cancelling their ten‐​year visa. He told National Public Radio that the U.S. embassy said he could apply for a single‐​entry visa in the future—if he disclosed his last 15 years of travel. His response: “It was too much personal information to [the] American government, so I rejected having to apply again.” The list of those whose travel privileges have been revoked include academics who have spent months or years studying and/​or working in America.



The new U.S. approach likely in part reflects the administration’s hostility to all things foreign. If Washington is prepared to reject already‐​certified Christian refugees fleeing Islamist persecution—as it has—then who will it allow to enter America?



More importantly, reported the Times, the FBI apparently is targeting academics it believes to have contacts with Chinese intelligence. However, that seems to be almost inevitable in an authoritarian dictatorship. Refusing to cooperate with the Chinese government would likely bar advancement topositions which lead people to travel to the U.S.. Said Zhu: “China is, by its nature, a police state. When a national security official comes to my office, I have no way to kick them out.” Indeed.



Moreover, those scholars with strong official connections offer an important and unofficial conduit of information between governments. Their attendance in conferences is particularly useful since they help participants grapple with what Chinese policymakers likely are thinking. Obviously, it is important to stop serious espionage, but that seems unlikely from academics attending policy‐​oriented forums.



Some advocates of a tougher approach complain that the PRC is not as open as America. Of course China is less open, but limiting the entry of Chinese scholars isn’t likely to cause Beijing to welcome American critics of PRC policies in Tibet and Xinjiang, for instance. That is no reason for Washington to bar from America foreign academics likely to be among those who best understand and appreciate the U.S.



There obviously is a limit to their influence: they haven’t prevented the ongoing crackdown by President Xi Jinping, who is waging a veritable war on liberal values in China.



Nevertheless, today’s climate makes sympathetic voices even more important. Argued Susan Shirk of the University of California, San Diego: “These people are among the most sophisticated in how the U.S. works and are some of the strongest advocates of good relations with the United States.” She worried that “We are alienating some of America’s best friends in China.”



That seems to be the case with Wang, who said that he had “often suggested to [his] audience and readers that China should learn from America.” After being stripped of his ten‐​year visa he said “I [will] never write such articles again.”



In any case, Beijing has not responded to the U.S. crackdown by opening the visa floodgates. To the contrary, they showed their willingness to play the opposite game, denying a visa to the Hudson Institute’s Michael Pillsbury, a China critic. A Chinese official he knows suggested it was in retaliation for the growing list of PRC scholars losing their visas. Pillsbury called for “a ceasefire in this visa war,” since “it is in both sides’ interest to have scholars on the topic of U.S.-China relations be able to understand what is going on and bring their experience to bear.”



He’s right.



Beijing’s shift back toward suffocating totalitarianism is a great disappointment to China’s friends in the U.S. However, it is vital to keep as many channels of communication open as possible. That includes academics and scholars, especially those with the most sophisticated understanding of the bilateral relationship.



Both governments need to act to halt the ongoing deterioration of relations almost across the board. Sometimes difficult disagreements will be inevitable. Violent confrontation is not. Yet as the foundations of the U.S.-China bilateral relationship crumble, conflict will become more possible.

"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."
"**A conflict between the government of Ethiopia and forces in its northern Tigray region has thrown the country into turmoil.**
Fighting has been going on for almost two weeks, destabilising the populous country in East Africa, with reports of hundreds dead.
A power struggle, an election and a push for political reform are among several factors that led to the crisis.
Here, we've broken them down to explain how and why this conflict has flared.
In simple chunks of 100, 300 and 500 words, this is the story of the crisis so far.
The conflict started on 4 November, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered a military offensive against regional forces in Tigray.
He said he did so in response to an attack on a military base housing government troops in Tigray.
The escalation came after months of feuding between Mr Abiy's government and leaders of Tigray's dominant political party.
For almost three decades, the party was at the centre of power, before it was sidelined by Mr Abiy, who took office in 2018 after anti-government protests.
Mr Abiy pursued reforms, but when Tigray resisted, a political crisis ensued.
The roots of this crisis can be traced to Ethiopia's system of government.
Since 1994, Ethiopia has had a federal system in which different ethnic groups control the affairs of 10 regions.
Remember that powerful party from Tigray? Well, this party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - was influential in setting up this system.
It was the leader of a four-party coalition that governed Ethiopia from 1991, when a military regime was ousted from power.
Under the coalition, Ethiopia became more prosperous and stable, but concerns were routinely raised about human rights and the level of democracy.
Eventually, discontent morphed into protest, leading to a government reshuffle that saw Mr Abiy appointed prime minister.
Mr Abiy liberalised politics, set up a new party (the Prosperity Party), and removed key Tigrayan government leaders accused of corruption and repression.
Meanwhile, Mr Abiy ended a long-standing territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, earning him a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.
These moves won Mr Abiy popular acclaim, but caused unease among critics in Tigray.
Tigray's leaders see Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to centralise power and destroy Ethiopia's federal system.
The feud came to a head in September, when Tigray defied the central government to hold its own regional election. The central government, which had postponed national elections because of coronavirus, said it was illegal.
The rift grew in October, when the central government suspended funding for and cut ties with Tigray. Tigray's administration said this amounted to a ""declaration of war"".
Tensions increased. Then, in what the International Crisis Group termed a ""sudden and predictable"" descent into conflict, Mr Abiy said Tigray had crossed a ""red line"".
He accused Tigrayan forces of attacking an army base to steal weapons.
""The federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation,"" Mr Abiy said.
Ethiopia, Africa's oldest independent country, has undergone sweeping changes since Mr Abiy came to power.
A member of the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, Mr Abiy made appeals to political reform, unity and reconciliation in his first speech as prime minister.
His agenda was spurred by the demands of protesters who felt Ethiopia's political elite had obstructed the country's transition to democracy.
The Tigrayan politicians that led the ruling coalition for 27 years were deemed to be part of the problem.
In the 1970s and 1980s their party, the TPLF, fought a war to wrest control of government from a military junta known as the Derg. The party succeeded, becoming a leading member of the coalition government that took power in 1991.
The coalition gave autonomy to Ethiopia's regions, but retained a tight grip on central government, with critics accusing it of repressing political opposition.
Now the party finds itself in opposition.
In 2019, it refused to participate in Mr Abiy's new government and merge with his Prosperity Party.
This snub was followed by further escalations.
Tigray's decision to hold its own election in September, for example, was an unprecedented act of defiance against the central government.
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate"".
Tigray argues that the central government has not been tested in a national election since Mr Abiy's appointment as prime minister.
Tigray has also called out the prime minister for his ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
There has long been animosity between Tigray and the government in Eritrea, which shares a border with the region.
A dispute over territory along this border was the cause of a war fought between Ethiopia and Eritrea from 1998 until 2000.
You may remember this dispute making headlines in 2018.
That year, Mr Abiy signed a peace treaty with Eritrea's government, ending the territorial spat.
A year later, Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize. Now it is war, not peace, that is drawing attention to Ethiopia.
Thousands of civilians have been displaced since 4 November, when Mr Abiy ordered his military to strike forces in Tigray. Hundreds more are reported to have died, with reports of a civilian massacre.
With the communications largely cut in Tigray, the exact number of casualties is not clear.
The Ethiopian government has announced a six-month state of emergency in Tigray. A full-blown civil war could last far longer.
""Given the strength of Tigray's security forces, the conflict could well be protracted,"" International Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation, says. ""Tigray has a large paramilitary force and a well-drilled local militia, thought to number perhaps 250,000 troops combined.""
As Africa's second-most populous country, Ethiopia is pivotal to stability in the Horn of Africa.
If the conflict intensifies, there are fears it could spill over into neighbouring countries. There have already been reports of missiles fired into Eritrea and 27,000 refugees fleeing to Sudan.
There is also a concern that the conflict could exacerbate ethnic tensions elsewhere in Ethiopia."
"President Trump’s executive order on immigration set off a widening political and legal crisis one week into his presidency. The order indefinitely barred Syrian refugees from entering the United States, suspended all refugee admissions for 120 days and blocked citizens of seven   countries, refugees or otherwise, from entering the United States for 90 days: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The immigration ban unleashed chaos on the immigration system and in airports in the United States and overseas, and prompted protests and legal action. It was condemned on Monday by former President Barack Obama, at least 100 American diplomats and the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, whom Mr. Trump quickly fired on Monday night. Here is a quick guide to what we know and what we don’t know about the order. The executive order was signed at 4:42 p. m. Eastern on Friday. The full text can be found here. It does not affect naturalized United States citizens from the seven named countries. After the order was signed, students, visitors and    legal permanent United States residents from the seven countries  —   and refugees from around the world  —   were  stopped at airports  in the United States and abroad, including Cairo, Dubai and Istanbul. Some were blocked from entering the United States and were sent back overseas. The order quickly prompted large protests across the country. On Saturday night, a federal judge in Brooklyn blocked part of Mr. Trump’s order, saying that travelers being held at airports across the United States should not be sent back to their home countries. Federal judges in three states  —   Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington  —   soon issued similar rulings. On Sunday morning, the Department of Homeland Security said it would comply with the rulings while it continued to enforce the president’s executive orders. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said on Sunday that   holders from the seven targeted countries would not be prevented from returning to the United States. Demonstrations against the ban continued on Sunday and Monday, and at least 100 diplomats at the State Department signed a dissent memo expressing opposition. Opponents of the ban got a boost on Monday from Mr. Obama, who criticized the executive order and endorsed the protests against it, and Ms. Yates, who ordered the Justice Department not to defend the executive order in court. She said she did not believe the order to be lawful. Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates just hours after she defied him, saying she had “betrayed” his administration and was “weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration. ” Mr. Trump replaced Ms. Yates with Dana J. Boente, United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. He will now serve as acting attorney general. Mr. Trump’s inner circle had left much of the administration in the dark about the executive order. It was created with little to no legal review or input from the departments most involved in carrying it out, in particular Homeland Security. It was written by a small White House team overseen by Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist and former Breitbart News executive. The order was widely condemned by Democrats, religious groups, business leaders, immigration policy experts, academics and others, but was praised by some Republican leaders, including the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, and supporters of Mr. Trump. The United Nations high commissioner for refugees estimated that 20, 000 refugees from all over the world would be affected immediately by the ban. The United Nations human rights chief said on Monday that the ban violated international human rights law. The abrupt firing of Ms. Yates left the Trump administration without a   leader at the Department of Justice. It was not clear how long the new acting attorney general, Mr. Boente, would remain in that position or what approach he would take toward the immigration ban, which is the subject of several lawsuits. The president has nominated Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, to be to attorney general. The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on his nomination on Tuesday. It was unclear how consistently airport officials across the country were complying with the court rulings that partly blocked Mr. Trump’s executive order. Mr. Priebus’s statements on Sunday morning did little to clarify how the executive order would be interpreted and carried out in the weeks ahead. He said border agents had “discretionary authority” to subject travelers, including American citizens, to additional scrutiny if they had been to any of the seven countries mentioned in the executive order, but it was not clear what that would look like in practice."
"**A former guerrilla fighter who used to jam the communication network of Ethiopian troops, Debretsion Gebremichael is now leading the fight against Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government for control of the northern Tigray region, described as the ""womb"" of the nation.**
Mr Debretsion leads the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the party which controls Tigray, and which has fallen out so dramatically with Mr Abiy.
Now married with a young child, Mr Debretsion cut short his studies at the University of Addis Ababa in the 1970s to join the TPLF in its 17-year war against Marxist ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam's Derg regime.
He then went on to be a government minister after the Derg had been defeated and replaced by a coalition of parties dominated by the TPLF until Mr Abiy came to power in 2018.
His close friend and comrade Alemayehu Gezahegn said that after they had both completed their military training in the rugged and mountainous terrain of Tigray and, noting his comrade's technical skills, he suggested to TPLF commanders that Mr Debretsion should be deployed to the ""technical unit"".
For Mr Alemayehu, this was the logical place for Mr Debretsion, as he was a bright, but reserved, ""city boy"" who grew up in Shire, which, in a major blow to the Tigray leader, is now under the control of federal troops.
Coming from an Orthodox Christian family, the Tigray leader was named Debretsion, which means Mount Zion, while his second name is that of his father, Gebremichael, meaning Servant of Saint Michael.
""When he was in primary school, he used to collect old batteries, radios, electric equipment, and fix them. When no-one had electric power in our town, he made a lightbulb for himself from scraps,"" Mr Alemayehu recalled.
Mr Debretsion excelled in the TPLF's ""technical unit"", playing a vital role in developing intelligence capabilities so that the TPLF could eavesdrop on the conversations of the Ethiopian army and jam their radio communications.
""This helped us to win because TPLF freedom fighters knew about enemy movements in advance, and, being jammed, they could not communicate with each other when they were attacked,"" Mr Alemayehu said.
To further develop his skills, Mr Debretsion travelled to Italy on a false passport and returned to set up the TPLF's first radio station - Dimtsi Weyane, meaning Voice of the Revolution.
Another TPLF guerrilla fighter, Measho Gebrekidan, recalled that they used to go to the mountains at night, when the chances of being spotted by government spies were slim, to install antennas.
""One night, he slipped... and it was me and another comrade who saved his life. I always thought that if this had happened, would this radio have been created?"" Mr Measho said.
Now Dimtsi Weyane is part of a multilingual and multiplatform media group based in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, broadcasting TPLF statements about its military confrontation with the federal government.
The media station has broadcast fierce criticism of Mr Abiy, and as the conflict began its signal was jammed, but Dimtsi Weyane was back on air the next day.
Mr Debretsion and Mr Abiy seemed to be friends at the start of the prime minister's time in office in 2018. The Tigray leader even arranged a rapturous welcome for the prime minister in Mekelle.
""Tigray is a place where the history of our country is cooked, and it's the region where foreign invaders [including Italians and Egyptians] had been defeated and embarrassed. In modern Ethiopia, it is the womb of Ethiopia,"" Mr Abiy said in 2018.
For his part, Mr Debretsion hailed the prime minister's peace initiative with Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki to end the ""no war-no peace"" situation that had existed between the two countries since the end of their 1998-2000 border conflict.
""[Mr Abiy] travelled to Eritrea and met Isaias. This was impossible for many years. It's a big deal because it is going to give a massive opportunity for the country,"" Mr Debretsion said when the deal was agreed.
But this display of comradeship appears to have masked the tensions that were brewing between the two men.
Mr Debretsion had ambitions to be prime minister himself and lost out to Mr Abiy in the 2018 contest within the ruling coalition.
**You may also be interested in:**
""I told him: 'You are immature. You are not the right candidate',"" Mr Debretsion told the UK-based Financial Times newspaper in 2019.
But his defeat did not come as a surprise, as the TPLF had become synonymous with repression and corruption during its 27 years as the dominant country's dominant political force.
Views about Mr Debretsion's performance when he was working in government are mixed.
His critics say that when he was the deputy head of the intelligence bureau in the 1990s, he was instrumental in spying on opposition figures, and helping to crush dissent.
But his supporters focus on the fact that he transformed Ethiopia's telecommunications infrastructure when elevated to the cabinet, where he served as deputy prime minister and as minister of communications and information technology.
He launched massive projects to expand mobile phone coverage across Ethiopia, though the state kept a monopoly over the industry, and the telecom company has been criticised for internet shutdowns aimed at curbing anti-government protests.
""Most of the power and telecom infrastructure projects were led by him,"" US-based public policy expert Dade Desta said.
""The IT Park that is now in Addis Ababa was his idea [and] his fingerprints can be found in many state-owned projects.""
This includes the building of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is now at the centre of diplomatic tensions with US President Donald Trump warning that Egypt might ""blow it up"".
The TPLF and the prime minister parted ways when Mr Abiy dissolved the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, the ruling coalition of ethnically based parties, to launch the Prosperity Party in 2019, arguing this would help unite the country.
The TPLF refused to join, arguing that Ethiopia's federal nature was a better way to manage the country's deep ethnic divides.
Mr Debretsion returned to Tigray where he was seen as a reformist. He allowed four new political parties to contest the regional election held in September in defiance of the federal government.
""My door is open to everyone,"" he often said.
""We want development; not war,"" was another common statement of Mr Debretsion.
But now, he finds himself at the centre of a conflict that is reported to have killed hundreds of people, forced more than 30,000 people to flee to neighbouring Sudan, and damaged crucial infrastructure - including roads and buildings - in a region with the highest levels of poverty in Ethiopia, according to the UN.
""Mr Debretsion counts this war as a curse,"" Mr Dade said.
But, he added, he expected the TPLF to strongly resist attempts by Mr Abiy to establish a new administration in Tigray.
""They [the TPLF] were in the war with Eritrea, and the struggle against the Derg. So they have enough experience. By its nature, war needs the will of the people to fight, which there is in Tigray,"" Mr Dade said, raising the prospect of a long conflict.
However, Mr Abiy is also confident that he can defeat the TPLF and bring Mr Debretsion, who is facing charges of treason and rebelling against the constitution, to justice.

"With much of the UK still underwater and flooding set to continue, knee jerk reactions abound. Politicians bicker, flooded communities and farmers lobby their causes and calls are made to dredge rivers and raise embankments. All efforts should be made to protect lives and infrastructure during the flood, but the real question is not how to stop the flooding now – that is disaster management. The real question is what happens after the floods have gone. The legacy of decisions made after flooding have long term implications and costs that are borne by future generations. A little look at history shows the types of flood prevention we should avoid and those we need to implement. One thing is clear, areas upstream and downstream of rivers are connected and must work together to tackle future flood risks.  The great floods of 1947 – still the worst in some rivers – led to wholesale dredging, the widening and embanking of watercourses, including the removal of bankside trees, and the construction of sluices. In short, the kind of response being suggested by some as an appropriate management for our rivers after this winter’s floods. But the 40 years of river and land management policy adopted after the 1947 floods and the flash floods in Lynton and Lynmouth in 1952 caused major environmental decline in our watercourses. The litany of loss includes swathes of wetland habitats, decline in species and the wholesale change in our rural landscape, as a result of intense agriculture production.  Rivers became characterised by higher temperatures (no shade), greater levels of silt deposits (more sources and routes for soil from intensive farming), more nitrate and phosphates (from fertiliser) and increased efficiency of flood water movement from field to flood channel. Consequently, channels were choked with vegetation and sediment, and river banks failed because they were undermined by dredging. The cost of maintaining these new watercourses was colossal to  environment, exchequer and on future generations. Geomorphology and hydrology, the sciences of sediment and water respectively, show us a different view of flooding to that portrayed by the scenes of flooded individuals and communities. They show that flooding is characterised by connections between atmosphere and land (rain), land and rivers (drainage), upstream management activity and downstream flooding, upstream communities and those living downstream. The water and silt in the kitchens of flooded houses passed over the fields, through the land drains and streams, and along the rivers of those people living in the upstream catchment. Flooding reminds us that people are connected to one another by water and sediment. In this respect, debates about town vs country are unhelpful – everyone in a catchment is involved in flood risk management now and in the future. A connected view shows us how floods are generated and how interventions we make in one place can be transmitted to other communities in the catchment. The fact is that flood peaks are a result of the intensity and amount of rainfall (climate), how quickly this water is transferred from upstream to a given downstream point (land surface characteristics and efficiency of drainage) and local factors such as the gradient of the river and the size of the channel.  Decades of government funded drainage and dredging has increased that rate of delivery of water and sediments to downstream communities. This brings with it the soils and fertilisers that build up in flood channels and require expensive dredging and weed clearance, reducing aquatic biodiversity. Similarly, urbanisation and development produces very rapid rates of water transfer into rivers, locally increasing flood levels.  Understanding connectivity also points us away from site-based solutions such as dredging, and instead opens up a much wider range of solutions that may well be cheaper to implement, more effective in the long term and under a changing climate, and less damaging to the environment. As we learned after the millennium floods and the much more damaging floods of 2007, we need a significant change in our approach to flood risk management. Crucially, we need to make it happen rather more quickly. The Slowing the Flow project is one example of what a new approach to flood risk management might look like. Developed following the 2007 floods, it is about working with nature to try and store more water in the landscape and slow its passage downstream. Here the community has been able to use a SimCity-style computer model that enabled them to see what solutions worked best and where. Local people were invited to simulate felling trees into rivers in the headwaters and then see how these affected the flood peak downstream.   So what to do after the flood? First and foremost there needs to be a full review to learn lessons both nationally and locally. This must have clear objectives to identify how better to deliver help to flooded communities under such events, what flood defences to repair and which to improve.  The entire range of options available for increasing the resilience of our catchments to future extreme events must also be reviewed. These should include zero tolerance of new floodplain development, identifying measures to trap and store more water and sediment in headwaters and on upstream floodplains.  It might include removing some old flood embankments or raising the bed levels in watercourses that were dredged in the past, where it can be demonstrated that it will reduce flood risk to communities downstream. A current example is being demonstrated by the efforts made to reduce flooding in Winchester by raising the bed of the River Itchen upstream in order to temporarily store water in meadows and wetlands.  We must also look carefully at the strategic planting of woodlands and using low berms (raised barriers) to slow the flow and store sediments upstream. We must also look at ways of offsetting the impacts of increased flooding on land upstream, ensuring that food and flood risk can operate together as part of a farm economy. For those in homes on the floodplain greater support is needed to improve flood proofing of properties, including the redesign of urban landscapes. Water storage must be increased in low risk areas and surfaces retrofitted to absorb more water.   Rising groundwater is a more difficult challenge to cope with. As these long duration floods are demonstrating, this is also a major cause of flooding. Groundwater flooding is pervasive and long lasting. New sustainable solutions for this are urgently needed. "
"**""Scores and probably hundreds"" of civilians have been massacred in the growing conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia, Amnesty International says.**
Witnesses blamed forces loyal to the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) for Monday's killings but Tigrayan officials have denied that pro-TPLF troops were involved.
Fighting between government forces and the TPLF broke out last week.
Getting information is hard, with phone lines and the internet down.
This would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the conflict.
There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state, and it has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces.
As a result, thousands of civilians have crossed the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
In a statement it said it could confirm that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town in the South West Zone of Ethiopia's Tigray region on the night of 9 November"".
It had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict.
Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's director for East and Southern Africa, called it a ""horrific tragedy"" and urged the government to restore communications and allow monitors access.
Amnesty said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
In a video statement on Thursday, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said his forces had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray from TPLF control.
He also accused TPLF-aligned fighters of ""cruelty"", and said when the army took control of the town of Sheraro they ""found bodies of executed defence force personnel whose hands and feet were tied"".
The prime minister ordered government forces to engage forces loyal to the TPLF on 4 November after he said military camps had been attacked.
There have been a number of clashes and air strikes since. Mr Abiy said government forces had made major gains.
The TPLF was the most powerful member of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018 and the TPLF refused to join a unified party.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run."

Study offers new insights on hurricane intensity, pollution transport
Researchers study currents that fuel hurricanes and transport pollutants to coastal beaches
The figure depicts the upper ocean warming (in red color) observed over the warm rings during the intensification of Isaac. CREDIT Benjamin Jaimes
MIAMI – As tropical storm Isaac was gaining momentum toward the Mississippi River in August 2012, University of Miami (UM) researchers were dropping instruments from the sky above to study the ocean conditions beneath the storm. The newly published study showed how a downwelling of warm waters deepened the storm’s fuel tank for a rapid intensification toward hurricane status. The results also revealed how hurricane-generated currents and ocean eddies can transport oil and other pollutants to coastal regions.
Tropical storms obtain their energy from the ocean waters below. As a storm moves across the Gulf of Mexico, it may interact with an upwelling of cooler waters from the deeper ocean or, in the case of Isaac, a downwelling inside rings of warm water that separated from a warm-water current, called the Loop Current, that moves through the Gulf of Mexico to join with the Gulf Stream along the U.S. East Coast. As the storm moves forward, ocean temperatures are fueling the storm’s intensity.
UM Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science researchers, in collaboration with NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, deployed a total of 376 airborne sensors during six NOAA hurricane hunter aircraft flights conducted before, during, and after the passage of Isaac over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The researchers observed a predominant downwelling of water inside these warm-water rings, or eddies, from the Loop Current, which caused its intensification from a tropical storm to a category 1 hurricane just prior to landfall.
“These results underscore the need for forecast models to include upwelling-downwelling responses to improve intensity forecasting and current transport,” said Benjamin Jaimes, an assistant scientist at the UM Rosenstiel School.
“Isaac moved over the region of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill where we observed both upwelling and downwelling processes that can re-suspend hydrocarbons lying on the seafloor,” said Nick Shay, professor of ocean sciences at the UM Rosenstiel School. “This may have resulted in tar balls being deposited on beaches by hurricane-generated currents.”
Tropical storm Isaac gradually intensified in the Gulf of Mexico to reach category 1 hurricane status as an 80 mph (130 km/h) storm, making landfall along the coast of Louisiana. The storm was estimated to have caused $2.39 billion in damage along its track.
###
The study, titled “Enhanced Wind-Driven Downwelling Flow in Warm Oceanic Eddy Features during the Intensification of Tropical Cyclone Isaac (2012): Observations and Theory,” was published in the June 2015 issue of the Journal of Physical Oceanography. The study’s co-authors include: Benjamin Jaimes and Lynn “Nick” Shay of the UM Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science’s Department of Ocean Sciences. BP/Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative to the Deep-C consortium at Florida State University supported the research.

When the popular media refer to “Global Warming”, or more recently “Climate Change”, both with Capitals, so You Know How Important It Is, they mean a combination of three related theories. These are:

The Earth is warming at an unprecedented rate.
This is happening because of human activity.
This is a bad thing.

None of these things can be shown to be true.

Guest essay by Ed Hoskins
Summary: By 2014 European Union countries had invested approximately €1 trillion, €1000,000,000,000, in large scale Renewable Energy installations.


This has provided a nameplate electrical generating capacity of about 216 Gigawatts, nominally about ~22% of the total European generation needs of about 1000 Gigawatts.
The actual measured output by 2014 from data supplied by the Renewables Industry has been 38 Gigawatts or 3.8% of Europe’s electricity requirement, at a capacity factor of ~18% overall.
However Renewable Energy production is dependent on the seasons, local weather conditions and the rotation of the earth, day and night.
So the Renewable Energy contribution to the electricity supply grid is inevitably erratic, intermittent and non-dispatchable.  It is therefore much less useful than dispatchable sources of electricity, which can be engaged whenever necessary to match demand and maintain grid stability.  That 3.8% Renewable Energy contribution to the grid is often not available when needed and obversely its mandatory use can cause major grid disruption if the Renewable Energy contribution is suddenly over abundant.
Accounting for capacity factors the capital cost of these Renewable Energy installations has been about €29billion / Gigawatt.  That capital cost should be compared with conventional gas-fired electricity generation costing about €1billion / Gigawatt.
The whole 1000 Gigawatt fleet of European electricity generation installations could have been replaced with lower capital cost Gas-fired installations for the €1trillion of capital costs already expended on Renewable Energy in Europe.
In spite of their being virtually no costs for fuel, Renewable Energy installations can still cost up to 1.5 – 2.5 times as much to operate and maintain as conventional Gas Fired plant.
When the capacity percentages are taken into account, the capital costs can be 15 – 50 times greater than Gas Fired plant.

Data Sources
Recent publications with data up to the end of 2014 have been used here.  These organisations are either neutral towards Renewable Energy (US  EIA) or actively promote it (EurObservER).

US EIA electricity_generation.pdf  2015   Table 1
EurObservER-Wind-Energy-Barometer-2015-EN-2.pdf
EurObservER-Photovoltaic-Barometer-2015-EN.pdf

These publications give an up to date indication of the current state of comparative data for the capital and running costs of different means of Energy generation, both Renewable and Fossil fuel based as well as Renewable Energy costs in Europe .  These illustrated notes are derived from the combination of these two up to date data sources.
The US  EIA data provides a useful yardstick for comparative costing and level of investment committed.  The comparative measure of US$ / Megawatt hour is used.  The US$ and the Euro are close to parity and used interchangeably here for cost estimation.


Major European installations
This note concentrates on the seven European Nations with significant commitments to Renewable Energy.  They account for more than 80% of European renewable investment.  Denmark is included in this analysis because of its preeminent position as a developer and supplier of Wind Power technology.

The following diagram shows the percentages of contribution for both solar and wind power in Europe.  The preponderance of PV Solar power in Germany at 44% of the total european installation is very clear.

Comparable Electrical Generation effectiveness
The EurObservER data give the current  base of Renewable Energy installations measured in Megawatts  and annual output by country in Gigawatt hours and also the actual installed level by three types of generation:

Onshore Wind Power
Offshore Wind Power
Grid connected Solar PV

The annual output in Gigawatt hours can be reduced to actual equivalent productive generation by dividing the output GWhr value by 8760, (365 * 24).  This value is then used to assess capacity  by comparing the actual generated output in Gigawatts with the nameplate value of the renewable installed generating sets.
The EurObservER data does not distinguish the output generated by Onshore and Offshore Wind Power but groups the outputs for both Wind Power types.  In general one would expect Offshore Wind Power to be rather more productive than Onshore installations even though Offshore has more onerous operating and maintenance expenditures at in excess of 30% capacity for offshore installations as opposed to about 20% for onshore Wind Power installations.
As the current EurObservER data does not distinguish between the generated outputs of Onshore and Offshore Wind Power, an overall Wind Power capacity figure of about 21% results from their data.
The aggregate (Wind Power and PV Solar)  productive capacities for the six European Nations are shown below and compared to conventional generating technologies.

The variations of efficiency between the seven European Nations shown above between arises as a result of:

their level of commitment to Solar energy as opposed to Wind Power:  Overall in Europe Wind Power has a capacity percentage of ~22% as opposed to Solar energy of only  ~12%
their latitude, Solar power being significantly less effective in Northern Europe.

Accordingly German Renewable installations perform at only ~13% overall.  They are by far the least performant in Europe because of their heavy commitment to Solar Energy at Northern latitudes.  Germany is followed by Italy with a more Southerly position but still with a heavy commitment to Solar Power.
Overall in Europe Renewable Energy is about 5 times less efficient (Energy Produced / Nameplate Capacity) than when fossil fuels are used, i.e. a capacity percentage of about 18% overall as opposed to some 85%.

The scale of Renewable installations and approximate capital costs
The  EurObservER data from 2014 is charted below showing the nameplate installations of different forms of Renewable Energy

And the actual Electrical output generated according to the EurObservER data is shown below.

It is estimated that 1 Gigawatt of gas-fired generating capacity costs about €1000,000,000 and the proportional capital costs derived from the EIA data is used to estimate the approximate capital costs of the European Renewable installations.  Accordingly the distribution of estimated capital investment totalling more than €1 trillion is shown below.

These prices are estimated using the EurObservER  reported nameplate capacity combined with the EIA differential values for capital costs.  No account is taken of the detrimental capacity factors applicable to Renewable Energy installations, i.e. operating at about 1/5 of rated nameplate capacity.

National commitments to Renewable Energy installations in Europe
The comparative commitments to Renewable Energy according to the data across Europe is shown as Megawatts installed / million head of population below.
Unsurprisingly Germany and Denmark are pre-eminent, whereas the UK and France have only achieved about a quarter of their levels of penetration.  In France which already has the lowest CO2 emissions levels/head of population in the developed world (substantially less (~60%) than China) because of its commitment to Nuclear electrical generation, the installation of Renewable Energy (Wind Power and Solar) in France would seem to be particularly costly and pointless.

The full gamut of European national commitments to renewable Energy in terms of Megawatts of nameplate generating capacity per million head of population is shown below.

Scoring cost effectiveness in Operation
The US  EIA data makes comparisons in terms of $ / Megawatt hour.  These data have been combined with capacity data derived from the EurObservER reports,  i.e. 21.8% for Wind Power overall and 12.1% for Solar Power.

For comparative purposes these $/MW hr values are normalised comparing them to the EIA Gas-Fired generation cost and the readjusted to account for the capacity factors recorded.  A fuel cost for Gas firing is about 50% more than than that for Coal.
This results in normalised comparative scores for both the Capital cost and Operation and Maintenance costs.  Using the EIA base data the Operation and Maintenance costs are marginally more for Onshore Wind and about double for both Offshore Wind and Solar Power.  On the other hand the capital cost scores range from 14 times onshore wind to almost 50 times for Solar energy.

When the capital and running costs are combined on the EIA basis, Renewable Energy comparative cost scores are 4 times higher for onshore wind and up to 12 times greater for both Offshore wind and rather more for Solar Power.  Coal and nuclear power are shown as the a useful comparison.


Conclusions
To date about € trillion, (€1000,000,000,000), has been spent on the installation of Renewable Energy technologies for electricity generation in Europe.
By Government and EU diktat, this expenditure has been extracted by extra charges imposed on utility bills throughout Europe.  Viewed as taxation this is very regressive form:  it imposes more burdens on poorer people whilst leaving wealthier people who are able to pay less affected.  It is also invisible in Government accounts as a tax income at all, as it is an industry price imposition on consumers.
These regressive “Green taxes” have already lead to significant fuel poverty throughout Europe.
Increased energy costs are also impacting on European industries with many major corporations seeking more congenial manufacturing locations outside Europe to the detriment of the European economies.
As a means of producing useful electrical power Renewable Energy is proven here to be very expensive, not only because its poor ~20% capacity factor but also because it is much less useful to the electrical grid because of its non-dispatchbliliy and inevitable intermittancy.
It is also questionable whether these Renewable Energy industries, when viewed “from cradle to grave”, including manufacturing, site works, installation, connection and demolition costs, does in fact reduce CO2 emissions to any significant extent overall.  The CO2 saved may never exceed the CO2 emissions generated to erect the total installation.  At t a maximum the use of Renewable Wins and Solar technologies only amounts to about a 4% saving in CO2 emissions in comparison to using Gas-fired power generation,
The USA has made significant CO2 emissions reductions over the past few decades by replacing Coal Fired generation with Gas Fired electricity generation with the feedstock provided by the fracking revolution.  It is estimated that using natural gas for electricity generation as opposed coal burning saves about 30% of CO2 emissions.  This outcome of this effect has been assessed to have been more effective means of CO2 emissions reduction than all actions worldwide arising from the Kyoto protocol.
The Renewable Energy industry could not exist without the Government mandated subsidies and preferential tariffs on which it depends.
Without Government subsidies and consumption mandates the Renewable Energy industry is not a viable business proposition.
Viewed from the point of view of the viability of a nation’s electrical supply grid, Renewable Energy would never be part of the generating mix without its Government mandate, Government subsidies and Government interference.

"More wet and windy weather arrives week after week, with the inundated areas of the south and southwest of Britain still at the mercy of the elements. Even while politicians begin the blame game, we should look further ahead to when the floodwaters recede, the clean-up begins – and talk turns to who will pay. In most countries, the government plays a role in covering flood losses. The UK is unusual because the government does not award compensation directly to individuals. Money is provided to local authorities through the Bellwin Scheme to reimburse the costs of emergency measures taken to safeguard life or property. But this is only intended to cover uninsurable risk. Damage to private property is considered insurable and is not covered, which means compensation is drawn from the insurance industry, or charitable aid. The Prince’s Countryside Fund and the Duke of Westminster were among the first to make donations to help the flood victims, donating £50,000 each. As the floods continue, other businesses have pledged support. The government has also announced new measures, including a £5,000 grant to households and businesses to pay for repairs which improve a property’s ability to withstand future flooding. But most of those with property underwater will have to rely on insurance. Big changes have swept through Britain’s flood insurance landscape. Until last July, flood insurance cover was available to households and small businesses as a standard feature of buildings and contents insurance under the Statement of Principles. Under this agreement, members of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) agreed to cover properties at risk of flooding in return for government commitment to manage flood risk. Following extensive negotiations a new flood insurance scheme, Flood Re, was announced last June. This establishes a stand-alone, industry-run, not-for-profit insurance fund due to begin in 2015. Flood Re will provide cover for about 500,000 properties deemed at risk by the Environment Agency that might otherwise be uninsurable, or whose premiums are unaffordable. But the limitations of the Flood Re scheme need to be recognised. While ABI members will continue to meet their commitments to existing customers, there’s no guarantee prices won’t rise between now and the implementation of Flood Re. In fact stories are already emerging about dramatic premium hikes, and the expectation is that these will rise further. The government needs to take responsibility in the event of a catastrophic flood, but Flood Re’s liability will be capped at an expected limit of about £2.5 billion per year, equivalent to a 1:200 year flood loss scenario. As to who will bear the costs beyond this, the government has made no commitment. But this is a question that needs an answer. PricewaterhouseCoopers have estimated the insurance losses for December and January at £630 million, and while it’s too early to count the costs of the current floods, insurance industry forecasts suggest losses could reach £1 billion if the rains continue. What is also needed from the government and insurers are incentives to reduce flood risk. Planning controls need to restrict development in flood risk areas, set higher standards for buildings on floodplains, and require that the best techniques to improve resilience against flooding are used when rebuilding and refitting after flood damage. As we argued in a paper published in Nature Climate Change, using the flood insurance market to drive better adaptation to flood risk and the effects of climate change needs to be part of a wider strategy that includes land-use planning, building regulations and water management. The Flood Re scheme needs to be clear whose insurance it will subsidise, and the effects on those not insured under the scheme. In fact many properties at risk will be excluded from the scheme. When Flood Re was first proposed, three categories of property owners were excluded from participation: small businesses, properties built after 1 January 2009, and properties in the highest council tax band. It has since emerged that Flood Re will exclude many more properties than originally thought, with any policy classed as “non-domestic” unable to participate in the scheme, regardless of the risk. This will include housing association and council properties, many leasehold or private rented sector properties where homes are not insured individually, and properties which are both a residence and a business. As it is, Flood Re does not reduce flood loss, but only spreads the risk, and therefore the costs, by protecting some policyholders at the expense of others. High-risk properties will be subsidised for decades by payments from low-risk households, with the financial risk still covered by the insurance industry, and government carrying no liability. Policyholders are unlikely to accept this situation without protest, and here the US experience may prove instructive. In the US, flood coverage is excluded from property policies provided by private insurers, and is only available through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), with the federal government acting as insurer of last resort. Following massive payments for flood claims related to Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, the NFIP is approximately US$26 billion in debt. This led to legislation to reform the program, phasing out subsidies over five years, and increasing the annual rate until premiums reflect the true risk. But as rates rose and homeowners faced huge bills, sometimes hikes of 600-1000%, they pressured congress to delay these rate hikes. Republicans and Democrats found common cause for once, with the proposal sailing through the normally divided senate in a matter of weeks. Less than two years after the flood insurance reform legislation was passed, the senate voted to delay premium increases for up to four years while the Federal Emergency Management Agency drafts a plan to make flood insurance premiums more affordable and re-evaluates the accuracy of its Flood Insurance Rate Maps. Flood insurance reform efforts in the US have shown the political implications of angry voters. With flooding in some parts of Britain about to enter a third month and costs spiralling, it is something the UK government is also learning the hard way, with Flood Re facing its first test before it even has come into operation."
"PARIS  —   The ability of an   Iranian director to attend the Academy Awards ceremony next month has been thrown into question by President Trump’s order temporarily banning citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. The director, Asghar Farhadi, whose film “The Salesman” is nominated in the best   film category, was not immediately available for comment. But early Saturday, Trita Parsi, director of the National Iranian American Council, based in Washington, said in a Twitter post: “Confirmed: Iran’s Asghar Farhadi won’t be let into the US to attend Oscar’s. He’s nominated for best   film. .. #MuslimBan” In a telephone interview hours later, Mr. Parsi said he had heard only second hand that Mr. Farhadi would not attend the ceremony on Feb. 26. Mr. Parsi said his intention with the message posted on Twitter was to show that under the new immigration policy announced on Friday, no Iranians would be allowed entry into the United States for 90 days. “The clarification of the law made it very clear that he can’t come, whether a green card holder or an Iranian citizen,” Mr. Parsi said of Mr. Farhadi, whose film “A Separation” won an Oscar for best   film in 2012. Mr. Parsi added that he had not meant to imply that the United States government had requested that Mr. Farhadi not come to the Oscars ceremony, but to call attention to the ban itself. “It is so stunning and shocking  —   so profoundly    —   that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around it,” Mr. Parsi said. It was unclear whether Mr. Farhadi would request an exemption to the visa ban or be granted one by the United States government. Earlier this week, one of the stars of “The Salesman,” Taraneh Alidoosti, said in a message on Twitter that she would boycott the Oscars to protest the visa ban, which she called “racist. ” The ban was not policy at the time. “I decided not to go even if I could, because it hurts me deeply to see ordinary people of my country being rejected for what might be their legal right to have access to their children abroad or to their school classes as students,” Ms. Alidoosti told The New York Times in an interview. The government of Iran approved the “The Salesman” for submission to the Academy Awards it is one of five films vying for best   film. The film tells the story of a couple in Tehran whose lives are upended when they move from one apartment to another while they are acting in an amateur production of “Death of a Salesman,” a play by Arthur Miller. In a statement, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said it was “extremely troubling” that Mr. Farhadi and the cast and crew of “The Salesman,” could be “barred from entering the country because of their religion or country of origin. ” The Academy gives an allotment of tickets to distributors and representatives of all nominated films, who are responsible for securing visas when necessary. The proposed ban has affected those connected to other films. The Iraqi director Hussein Hassan withdrew his visa application to the United States, where he was expected to attend the United States premiere of his film “Reseba  —   The Dark Wind” at the Miami Film Festival, Variety reported."

David Burton has already done a wonderful deconstruction of Bloomberg’s absurd global warming attribution graph, by Eric Roston and Blacki Migliozzi, contrived from data by the notoriously unreliable NASA GISS, purporting to demonstrate that 20th-century global warming was reely ’n’ truly all caused by our sins of emission, honest it was, guv’nor, cross me ’eart an’ ’ope to die.
What that graph really helps to indicate – though its fanatical originators would be horrified if they realized it – is just how little global warming we are likely to see this century, even if no one cuts emissions at all from now on and CO2 concentration continues inexorably to climb.
The usual suspects – such as the British Communist newspapers The Guardian and The Independent, for instance – have been telling us for the past few years that “scientists say” we are on track for 4 C° global warming this century. Well, we aren’t. Here’s why.
Version A of the Bloomberg graph shows the alleged temperature effects of various individual manmade forcings; version B shows the temperature effects of all the individual manmade forcings combined; and version C, scarcely different from B, shows the combined effect of all manmade and natural forcings.

David Burton has already pointed out numerous dodges deployed by GISS in the crafting of this characteristically misleading graph: the truncation of all but the temperature data after 2005 to conceal the rapidly growing and now irremediably serious divergence between prediction and reality, the GISS model’s estimates that in several of the past 100 years the greenhouse forcing actually fell; the model’s use of multiple pseudo-random number generators in the absence of sufficient climate observations; the bizarre choice of a faster greenhouse-gas influence half a century ago than today; the ex-post-facto guesstimates of both individual manmade and combined natural forcings; and the fiddled confidence intervals for greenhouse-gas influences on temperature that are as narrow for 140 years ago as they are for today.
But that’s not all, as the same graph overlaid with the natural 20-to-30-year cooling and then warming phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation reveals. The biggest omission from the GISS/Bloomberg graph is synoptic natural variability. Indeed, the graph goes to some lengths to conceal it, not least by removing the decade-lines (here reinstated). GISS also chose a negative or cooling PDO phase as its 30-year baseline, rather than the near-60-year baseline 1890-1946, which includes a full cooling and then warming phase of the PDO (all PDO dates are from JISAO).
The true baseline is a tenth of a degree above the artificially-chosen GISS baseline that makes the net 20th-century warming look quite a bit more severe than it was.

Note how the cooling phases (starting with green year-lines) show little or no global warming. See also how there was 0.3 C° warming coincident with the PDO warming phase from 1925-1946, when hardly any anthropogenic influence had been felt. See how the 0.7 C° global warming from 1977-2000 coincided with a positive or warming phase of the PDO.
See how little warming there has been since 2000, in the present negative or cooling phase of the PDO, even on the much-fiddled GISS temperature dataset, notwithstanding record increases both in CO2 emissions and CO2 concentration.
In the first PDO-influenced warming period, our influence was not large enough to cause all of the observed warming. Let us assume we caused as much as 0.2 C° of the 0.3 C° warming shown.
In the second PDO-influenced warming period, McKitrick & Michaels (2007) showed that warming over land had been overestimated by double, because the published data show a highly significant regional correlation with growth of population and urbanization that should not have been present if the urban heat-island effect had been properly allowed for. That alone leads to an overstatement of 0.1 C° in global temperature.
In addition, some 0.3 C° of the published terrestrial warming since 1900 arises from data adjustments by NCDC/GISS rather than from a real temperature change. Let us deduct from the record just one-third of that, or 0.1 C°:

Thus, out of the 0.9 C° 20th-century warming, 0.1 C° was natural; 0.1 C° was attributable to inadequate correction for urbanization; and at the very least 0.1 C° arose from over-enthusiastic tampering with the temperature record in a manner calculated artificially to steepen the apparent warming, leaving at the very most just 0.6 C° of anthropogenic warming over the 20th century.
Have we been reasonable in making this estimate of anthropogenic warming to date? We can check by reference to the IPCC’s estimates of total manmade forcings. These, given in Fig. SPM.6 of IPCC (2013), come out at 2.3 Watts per square meter since 1750 (or, effectively, since 1880, since our influence before that date was negligible):

The current best estimate of the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance caused by this forcing but thus far unresolved by increases in atmospheric temperature is 0.6 W m–2, so that the 0.6 C° anthropogenic warming realized to date was driven by the remaining 1.7 W m–2 of radiative forcing, implying a final or post-feedback transient-climate-sensitivity parameter of 0.6/17 = 0.353 Kelvin per Watt per square meter.
Now, the instantaneous or zero-feedback parameter is 0.313 K W–1 m2, and after 100 years the IPCC estimates that this will rise to 0.43 K W–1 m2, or about half, of the 0.86 K W–1 m2 that it expects to obtain at equilibrium.
Given that almost three-quarters of the anthropogenic forcing has arisen in the 70 years since 1950, so that much of the centennial forcing has not yet occurred, the implicit value 0.353 K W–1 m2 that we have derived on the back of an envelope for the transient sensitivity parameter is indeed in the right ballpark, suggesting that 0.6 C° is a reasonable estimate of the anthropogenic warming of the 20th century.
Armed with this information, we can proceed to work out whether we are going to see anything like the imagined 4 C° warming in the next 85 years.
The CO2 forcing for the remainder of the 20th century is 5.35 times the logarithm of the proportionate change in concentration, which is now 0.04% of the atmosphere by volume and, on business as usual, is projected by the IPCC to rise to 0.07%.
Thus, the CO2 forcing would be 5.35 ln 7/4, or 3.0 Watts per square meter. Since the IPCC’s current estimate is that CO2 accounts for five-sixths of all anthropogenic forcings, this should be increased by a fifth to 3.6 W m–2.
Next, one must allow for temperature feedbacks amounting to 1.55 Watts per square meter per Kelvin of direct warming:

That gives equilibrium warming of 1.8 C° as a result of 20th-century forcings.
If the forcings were to occur at once rather than spread over the coming century, only half of this, or 0.9 C°, would occur within a century, and the rest within 1000-3000 years (Solomon et al., 2009).
However, since the forcing will build up slowly over the century, perhaps with a slight increase in the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance as well, in practice only about a third of equilibrium warming is at all likely to appear by 2100. That is just 0.6 C°, of which precisely none has occurred in the first 15 years of the century.
One might add a little to this to allow for some further warming caused by past emissions, or take quite a bit away to allow for the strongly canceling influence from manmade particulate aerosols, the tiny parasols that increase the opacity of the atmosphere and shelter us somewhat from the Sun.
Murphy et al. (2009) go as far as to imagine that the negative aerosol forcing almost cancels out the CO2 forcing altogether.
If they are right, and if the increasing industrialization of China, India and Africa continue to increase particulate aerosols in step with CO2, very little warming can be expected in the 21st century:

So far, every step of our calculation has been rooted in mainstream, established climate science, published data and peer-reviewed papers.
Can one go still further? In one respect, no. As Roy Spencer pointed out with characteristic focus and concision in response to my previous posting, merely because the energy budget diagrams use the Stefan-Boltzmann equation at the Earth’s surface we must not assume that we can derive the Planck climate-sensitivity parameter from them. We must apply the equation at the characteristic-emission surface, which is the locus of all points at or above the Earth’s surface at which, under the assumption of a pre-existing radiative equilibrium, incoming and outgoing radiative fluxes are equal. We cannot take advantage of the far lower surface sensitivity parameter that obtains at the surface.
What if we assume that temperature feedbacks are net-zero, an assumption powerfully suggested by 810,000 years of near-perfect thermostasis, with global temperature varying by little more than 3 C° either side of the long-run mean (a variance about the same as that of your home thermostat)?
The “consensus” would have us believe that the temperature changes of the past 810,000 years, covering an interval of at most 6.5 C°, were driven by tiny forcings amplified by hefty feedbacks. It is no less likely, however, that the forcings from events such as supervolcano explosions and Milankovitch cycles were large and the feedbacks small – perhaps even net-negative.
If the feedbacks were net-zero, the instantaneous and equilibrium warmings in response to the 3.6 W m–2 manmade forcings expected in the remainder of this century, assuming none of the strongly negative forcings from aerosols, land-use changes and ozone effect that the GISS/Bloomberg graph assumes, will simply be 0.313 x 3.6 Watts per square meter, or 1.1 C°, of which about half would arise over a century because the change in concentration is not instantaneous but is spread over the next 85 years.
Result: about 0.5-0.6 C° of global warming, not much different in the medium term from the high-feedback case.
Whichever way you stack it, it is difficult to make a serious case for even 1 C° of anthropogenic warming by 2100, even on business as usual.
I shall probably not be around in 85 years’ time to find out. Yet perhaps the scholars of the future, peering at these postings at WattsUpWithThat, may one day marvel that, armed with nothing more than common sense, an ambition to find the truth rather than make a fast and dishonest buck, a pocket calculator and the simple model in Monckton of Brenchley (2015: just go to scibull.com, the website of the Science Bulletin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and click “Most Read Articles”, as more than 30,000 others have done), we were able to reach a far more reliable estimate of this century’s global warming than the billion-dollar brains of the profiteers of doom.
4 C° global warming by 2100? Fuggedaboudid. Will someone tell the sanctimonious global-government wannabes in Washington DC, London, Bonn, Rome, and – above all – Paris?

"Holidaying in Europe has never been more popular, with the increase in tourism driven by budget airline competition, rising incomes and relaxed visa requirements over the past 50 years. Last year Europe was the destination for more than half of all the world’s tourists. Tourism and recreation are big business, with Europe accounting for nearly 25% of the US$6.6 trillion that these industries contribute to global GDP. Such success means many millions more people visiting the continent, more pollution and carbon emissions from air travel, transport, and construction, and more changing land use and habitat destruction. These are all threats to Europe’s biodiversity, which extends to more than 20,000 species of native plants, from dragon trees to carnivorous sundews, from bee orchids to wild kale. Many are only found in Europe, and some are the original ancestors of today’s vital, staple crops. With the disappearance of traditional agriculture in many parts of the continent and rapid urbanisation, there has been a large decline in the populations of many native plant species, with 462 facing imminent extinction. The tourism industry in Europe, and everything that stems from it, is exacerbating the problem. In our latest study, Ballantyne and Pickering 2013, we systematically reviewed the IUCN Red List, the most comprehensive data on threatened species worldwide, and found that 194 (42%) of the 462 threatened plant species in Europe are at risk of extinction as a result of tourism and recreation. Some groups are more at risk than others, such as low-growing annual and perennial flowering plants like orchids, asters and sandworts. Those species endangered by tourism and recreation are concentrated within just a few regions of Europe. Around 80% are found around the Mediterranean, with almost half in Spain and the Canary Islands alone. This is likely to reflect both the regions’ high biodiversity, but also its popularity as a holiday destination. Up to 246 million tourists visit the beautiful, affordable Mediterranean countries each year, most notably Greece, Spain and Portugal. We also assessed which particular aspects of tourism and recreation threatened these species. Is it hotels and infrastructure built for tourists that causes the damage, or the activities tourists engage in at the destination? Well, the answer is both. In the Mediterranean, vast stretches of delicate limestone cliff, beach and dune ecosystems such as in the Iberian Peninsula have been cleared for tourist accommodation. This was an environment once teaming with botanical richness. Hotels, resorts, theme parks, golf courses and scenic roads have all dramatically reduced and fragmented the habitat area of many plant species. The tourist activities that then takes place within these areas further degrades the environment and damages native plants: hiking, plant collecting, beach-going and off-road driving are the worst offenders. Those plants most sensitive to disturbance such as small brittle shrubs and slender herbs are the first to disappear, with aesthetic species such as orchids also declining rapidly due to collecting. In contrast to the sunny Med, the rest of the European countries accounted for only around 20% of plants threatened by tourism and recreation. At the continent’s peripheries, countries such as Ireland, Norway and Latvia had no affected species at all. Most of the remaining species affected were in the central European countries, near the Alps, which attract 120 million visitors a year. Here, summer hiking and rock-climbing were the biggest issues: trampling summer-flowering alpine meadows and disturbing isolated cliff communities. But winter skiing, the Alps’ most popular activity, was rarely reported as a threat to plants due to the protection of snow cover. Eastern Europe and the Balkans also accounted for a small proportion of threatened species, mostly the scenic countries of Croatia and Montenegro on the Adriatic coast. Despite political turmoil during the 1990s, these nations are now experiencing fast tourism development. They retain much of their rich biodiversity and so the effects here need to be closely watched and managed in order to avoid a repeat of what has happened in the Mediterranean over the last 50 years. No one wants to give up their holiday. So for now, here are five tips that we as tourists in Europe can follow to reduce our impact on threatened plants and other species. Avoid using dirt bikes, quad bikes, beach buggies and other motorised vehicles on dunes and other sensitive ecosystems. Heavy, fast, motorised sports are the most damaging of all recreational activities. Avoid picking or uprooting plants on your holiday, even just leaves or flowers. Also avoid buying rare plants or parts of plants as souvenirs. Pictures can make for better memories and do less harm. Keep to designated walkways and don’t venture off-trail when walking in natural areas. In particular avoid easily-eroded ground such as cliff edges, dunes, bogs and river banks. Visit locally run, home-stay or eco-assured establishments that are more likely to have been there longer, know more about the region, and know how to reduce their impact on the environment. If you like a certain place, stay as a regular to avoid continual expansion of more and more hotels. Most of all, learn a little about what species are local and special to where you holiday, show an interest and respectfully enjoy them."

Phil Quin explains precisely [how counter-productive it is to abuse people on social media](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/118571161/dont-let-the-nasties-take-over-our-political-discourse) simply because they don’t agree with you:



“In an era of data overload and short attention spans,” _New York Times_ critic Michiko Kakutani writes in a superb decade’s-end [wrap-up](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.nytimes.com_interactive_2019_12_27_opinion_sunday_2010s-2Damerica-2Dtrump.html&d=DwMFaQ&c=N9aEhCy8U0rJkO1xCZf7rgM9fohfR5qe_N93viZd7O8&r=0G2QzzJZWnekkP534Ylif1aH_LkH-5vBjsDcsWPhAQA&m=LCuuzArDHXK8nnYUUUE6rq8msXr7-I4B28s9TUoaslI&s=9yk_ifZyEl1YFl_di_vK1DAsCOMPaBDLPr98P4EF8kQ&e=), “it’s not the most reliable, trustworthy material that goes viral – it’s the loudest voices, the angriest, most outrageous posts that get clicked and shared.” (On the upside, the sheer ugliness of #TurnArdern inspired me to undertake a Christmas detox from social media, something I’d recommend to everyone from time to time).



Given the season, I briefly wondered whether these Twitter “activists” carry over their favoured modus operandi of “dismiss, demean and disparage” to face-to-face interactions. But of course they don’t – unless they want to be shunned from any future Christmas get-togethers. Conversations have few places to go when you scream “transphobic” at your 80-year-old in-laws.



In real life, we simply don’t treat others that way, not only to avoid offence, but also because we know in our personal and family lives that people are not the sum of their most objectionable views. When I came out as gay in the 90s, it was my godmother, a fairly doctrinaire Catholic, who was first to call me, offering her love.



People almost never say face to face what they’d happily tweet or Facebook. This is one of the problems of social media as in real life you’d get a punch in the face for poor and rude behaviour. On social media, it never happens so people feel safe to say truly awful things.



You might be asking, why should we even care about the histrionics of a tiny cabal of swivel-eyed keyboard warriors? The truth is we can’t afford to look away. While it’s the case that most people have better things to do than engage in partisan online bickering, we shouldn’t ignore the outsized role social media plays in setting the tone of the discourse.



 **Increasingly, it drives the news cycle – and most politicians can barely take their eyes off Twitter for long enough to Google themselves. Most worryingly of all, this all serves to inspire cynicism, apathy, even disgust, among the wider public – conditions that always, always, serve the cause of the regressive politics.**



Much has been written, including by me, about the troubling rise of populist Right-wing and nationalist sentiment across the West. Reactionaries are emboldened like never before, in my lifetime at least. Who knows whether the clamour they generate is the death rattle of a beleaguered elite or the roaring engines of a new and enduring conservatism? Certainly, I don’t; my once-sharpish political instincts are scrambled beyond recognition.



The rise is because, in part, the left has been out of control, trying to dramatically change people’s way of life. Like pushing a globalist agenda, forcing people to recognise numerous and ridiculous genders, pandering to the minute percentage of the population who think that they are a different sex, seeing racism everywhere, re-writing history to expunge facts and replacing them with feelz. Of course, there is also the hijacking of the climate debate to blame global warming for everything and all the world’s ills to which the only solution is socialism.



But, on the Left, **casting our adversaries as stupid bigots strikes me as obviously misguided. Likewise, our tendency to lord it over others with a hyper-abundance of certainty in our superior virtue is obnoxious; our refusal to contemplate the possibility of good faith among those with whom we disagree, alienating. Liberal condescension, paired with an unforgiving approach to ideological purity, risks sending perfectly well-meaning people into the arms of our adversaries or to retreat from politics altogether.**



The recently shellacked Jeremy Corbyn offered himself as a case-study in Left-wing hubris when he recently claimed Boris Johnson may have won the British election, but Labour “won the argument”. In one soundbite, he managed to convey staggering arrogance, self-delusion, insufferable smugness and, ultimately, defeatism. It’s a recipe for electoral irrelevance that too many seem eager to replicate.



I wonder if politicians like Golriz Ghahraman, who is currently carrying on as if Donald Trump has just killed Mary Poppins and not [a really bad wog](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/irans-khamenei-taunted-trump-before-strike-you-cant-do-anything-nek-minit/), will listen to what Phil Quin has to say?



Somehow I doubt it. 



The one thing about social media though, is that it removes the control of the message from the very elites who have been part and parcel of the rise of nationalism because they deigned to suppress the truth or facts and instead ran their own agendas. The liberal elite and the globalists are the ones truly to blame for the rise of nationalism. I can’t see them changing though, can you?

"BHP has announced it plans to sell off its thermal coalmines within two years as part of moves by the global mining giant to ready itself for a low-carbon future. The move stops short of a complete exit from coalmining because BHP will retain its stake in a venture that produces the higher coking coal used to make steel. BPH said coking, or metallurgical, coal will be in higher demand in coming years as steelmakers clean up their processes.  It follows consistent pressure from investors including Norway’s mammoth sovereign wealth fund, which owns more than US$2bn (A$2.8bn) in BHP shares and in April registered its objection to the company’s continued thermal coal operations by putting it on an “observation” list that is the first step before selling its stake. Announcing a full-year profit of US$7.95bn on Tuesday, BHP chief executive Mike Henry also left the door open to supporting a resolution from activist shareholders that would require BHP to stop mining that would destroy Aboriginal cultural heritage sites in Australia until laws are changed to strengthen their protection. Henry said BHP agreed with the intent of the resolution, which was to prevent “another Juukan Gorge” – a reference to rival miner Rio Tinto’s decision to blow up 46,000-year-old-caves in the Pilbara to get access to higher quality iron ore. He said BHP already operated to a standard higher than legislation required and had been lobbying for the law to be beefed up. “But of course we want to understand the perspectives of all parties, including the Indigenous leaders who are participating in that registration, but also the most important voice in all of this is the traditional owners of the land on which we’re actually mining.” Henry said the board would decide its position on the resolution after consulting with Indigenous groups and the traditional owners. BHP’s exit from thermal coal would satisfy investment criteria laid down by Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, which owns about 3.8% of BHP’s London-listed arm and about 0.6% of the company’s Australian-listed entity. The company’s efforts to sell Mt Arthur have previously been widely reported, but it has never before publicly committed to selling its coal assets. In addition to the Mt Arthur mine, BHP owns a third of the Cerrejón mine in Columbia and 80% of BHP Mitsui Coal, a joint venture with Mitsui that mines coking and thermal coal in Queensland. The miner has previously been unable to find a buyer for Mt Arthur, which supplies coal to the Liddell and Bayswater power stations. Liddell is outdated and was slated to close in 2022 but late last year was given an extra few months of working life after owner AGL buckled to pressure to keep it open through the following summer. Environment groups say the high cost of remediation associated with Mt Arthur and Cerrejón may make them difficult to sell to a third party. In a note published earlier this month, Tim Buckley, of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said the mines might be worthless and as a result BHP might have to spin them off as a separate company, which would prevent it needing to find a buyer willing to take on the assets. Henry said yesterday that BHP was willing to do this. BHP has spun off assets before – in 2015 it handed its metals mining business over to its existing shareholders by giving them stock in a new company, South 32. “We will pursue all option in parallel,” Henry said. “Notwithstanding the fact that right now we’re kind of in a lull when we look at the coal market, that can all change very quickly, so we’re very open to all options.” The Lock the Gate group expressed concern that BHP might hand Mt Arthur to a smaller company that lacked resources to clean up the mine site. “The world is moving away from thermal coal, and large companies like BHP, which is among the top 100 greenhouse emitting companies of all time, should rehabilitate the land they have carved up for mining and diversify coalmining communities,” NSW coordinator Georgina Woods said. “There is a great risk that less experienced mining companies will move in on these assets and fail to adequately rehabilitate the land. “Adani is one of the companies that has been named as showing interest in Mt Arthur,” Woods said. “Selling Mt Arthur might make BHP’s greenhouse rap-sheet look better, but the pollution will still be created and leave the Hunter with an even more uncertain future.”"

Robert Bussard, one of the giants of the field, claimed to his dying day he had cracked the problem
Above: a homemade “fusor” similar to the Polywell nuclear fusion reactor
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
Not many people have heard of Robert Bussard, but he was one of the giants of nuclear fusion research. But if an engineering solution for viable small, household size nuclear fusion reactors is ever discovered, they will almost certainly be largely based on Bussard’s work.
Bussard’s focus was on a field of Nuclear fusion research known as electrostatic confinement. Unlike the better known magnetic bottle reactors, such as the $20 billion ITER project, electrostatic confinement can be applied to fusion plasmas which are the size of a small glass fish tank.
Electrostatic confinement has been well known since the 1930s. Small electrostatic nuclear fusion devices are sold commercially – as neutron sources. A small nuclear fusion reactor is an incredibly convenient way to produce a dense stream of neutron radiation, because as soon as you switch off the power, the plasma cools, and the radiation stops.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_generator
The problem is nobody has figured out how to extract more energy out of an electrostatic fusor, than you put into it. There is a long list of problems to be solved. One of the big problems with viable nuclear fusion is keeping the plasma hot enough – when you heat something to millions of degrees, it really wants to shed some of its heat. In electrostatic confinement systems, the violent acceleration / deceleration, as charged plasma particles bounce off the high intensity electric fields, causes a significant cooling of the core. There are also problems with the electrodes – keeping an electrode from melting, when it is in close contact with a superheated gas, is a significant engineering challenge.
Bussard at the end of his life, claimed to have solved these problems. He built a small prototype using a grant from the US Navy. Right up to his dying day, he was trying to raise funds, to build a full scale prototype, of his Polywell nuclear fusion reactor design.

The late physicist Robert Bussard worked for decades to try to show Polywell fusion could work, using a variety of Wiffle-Ball configurations. Just before his death in 2007, he claimed that he was getting close to solving the challenge with his WB-6 device.
After Bussard passed away, other researchers picked up the baton at EMC2 Fusion in New Mexico and continued building test devices. Most recently, Park and his colleagues used a redesigned Wiffle-Ball test device in a San Diego lab to show the Navy that their configuration could enhance plasma confinement even under incredibly high pressure — pressure levels that could not be achieved by, say, the ITER reactor.

Bussard’s prototype might not have worked. However Bussard was an extremely credible fusion researcher – unlike some rather dodgy characters in the “bubble” fusion field, Bussard really might have made that crucial breakthrough. When you consider the eye watering sums which are wasted on renewables, such as the huge loss sustained by the Federal Government when Solyndra collapsed, it really seems a shame that Bussard never got a chance to take the final step, to realise his dream of seeing his ideas tested in a full scale prototype.

"How hot was it at the Furnace Creek visitor center at Death Valley national park on 16 August 2020? It was so hot that the huge electronic temperature display (which serves as a ubiquitous selfie backdrop) went on the fritz. Parts of the blocky digital display malfunctioned, resulting in numbers even higher than the actual mind-melting high on what turned out to be a landmark day. An automated weather station at the visitor center recorded a preliminary high of 129.9F (54.4C) at 3.41pm PDT on Sunday. Even for heat-favored landscapes such as Death Valley, it is remarkable for temperatures to inch into such territory so late in the summer, when the sun is considerably lower in the sky than at the summer solstice in late June. According to weather records researcher Maximiliano Herrera, the previous global record high for August is 127.9F (53.3C), recorded in Mitribah, Kuwait, in 2011. If Sunday’s high at Death Valley is confirmed, it will be the planet’s highest temperature in almost a century and its third-highest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Owing to the fact that the two higher readings are in question, it may, in fact, be the hottest air temperature ever recorded on Earth. The 130F afternoon in Death Valley fits snugly in the “what next?” narrative of life in 2020. But because human-caused climate change is such a ubiquitous yet gradual process, it’s rarely at the top of the news. A surging societal issue will typically bump climate from the headlines. There’s been no lack of such US events in 2020, from the coronavirus pandemic to police brutality and the state of the US Postal Service ahead of the November elections. Climate science, and common sense, warn that it would be unwise, however, to skip over what has just happened in the California desert. While competing events jostle for our attention, the machinery driving the climate crisis lumbers onward. Even in a year when global carbon emissions are on track to dip by a few percent, thanks largely to reduced travel and shuttered workplaces, the total amount of carbon dioxide concentrated in the atmosphere will once again reach its highest value in millions of years, about half a percent more than in 2019. The effects are perceptible. The Arctic experienced its first 100F day on record on 17 June when the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk hit 100.4F (38C). July 2020 was the hottest single month in more than a century of recordkeeping at such far-flung US locations as Phoenix; Miami; and Portland, Maine. How can we be sure that the 130F reading really is the record-setter it appears to be? Even higher temperatures often make the rounds in newspapers or social media. However, these are typically drawn from thermometers exposed to the sun, which leads to readings higher than the actual air temperature, as was the case with the 145F (63C) reported from Kuwait in 2019. Official temperatures are collected from shaded instrument shelters, designed and outfitted under strict protocols established by the WMO (part of the United Nations). The WMO, which also serves as the global arbiter of major weather records, plans to investigate the Death Valley report. Such post-mortems typically involve double-checking the temperature sensor’s performance, evaluating the station and its landscape, and assessing nearby observations to make sure they support the case. The only readings hotter than Sunday’s that are recognized by WMO are 134F (56.7C) at Death Valley on 10 July 1913, and 131F (55C) at Death Valley on 13 July 1913, and at Kebili, Tunisia, in July 1931. Questions swirl around those early 20th century values, though. For decades, the world’s all-time record high was believed to be the 136.4F (58C) reported from Al Azizia, Libya, on 13 September 1922. Weather historian Christopher Burt was skeptical: the value didn’t comport with nearby stations, and the thermometer design made it easy to misread the temperature. Burt’s work with colleagues led to an overturning of the Al Azizia record by WMO in 2012, a saga documented in the Weather Underground film Dead Heat. Burt and Herrera have called out similar issues with the Death Valley and Kebili readings from the 1910s and 1930s. Thus far the WMO has not re-evaluated those. Parsing the planet’s highest temperature by degrees, or tenths of degrees, may seem like a pedantic task in the face of a global climate crisis with vast consequences. Yet without careful, consistent measurement, it will be all the more difficult to keep track of a changing climate as it careens through our lives. Death Valley is already a forbidding landscape, one where heat and dryness rule and few people spend more than a day or two. A warming planet is unlikely to yield more Death Valleys in our lifetimes. However, it is pushing saline water into the delicate freshwater landscape of the Everglades, attacking the namesake ice of Glacier national park, and triggering an onslaught of changes both subtle and profound to ecosystems across the continent. With all this in mind, perhaps we should linger over a 130-degree afternoon a little longer."

The moral compass of the Pacific Island nations appears to be in a spin. It is apparent that bearing children out of wedlock is fine if you are the Prime Minister of New Zealand but if it was one of their own, it would attract immediate condemnation and be labelled an act of immorality. 



Pacific nations are predominently **Christian** , yet it appears that Ardern’s immersion in the Muslim culture is not a problem either, even if she ignores the plight of thousands of Christians being slaughtered by Islamic terrorists around the world. 



The sanctuary of an unborn baby’s life is treasured in the Islands with the only exception being Samoa where a mother may be considered a candidate for an **abortion** , but only if her life is at risk. Ardern’s government is hell-bent on [freeing up abortion laws](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/the-abortion-legislation-bills-symbolic-war/) resulting in the extermination of thousands of unborn babies without question, so it is rather odd and completely inconceivable that Ardern should take out the accolade as **“[Pacific Person of the Year”.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/pacific-person-of-the-year/)** How low does one set the bar?



It is not my intention to debate the issues raised and I certainly understand that the lure of the limitless supply of NZ taxpayer money has to be lubricated in kind. My beef is where the hell is the media scrutiny on this issue? There is absolutely no evidence that Ardern has contributed anything. How is it possible that we are expected to bask in the glory of this “lovely young woman’s” achievements when they amount to zilch. 



Another sin within the Pacifica communities is to idolize false Gods.



It is becoming a farce that Ardern is held up as some luminary Goddess when in reality she is a socialist shyster, hell-bent on the exploitation of the vulnerable and naïve. I know the award was presented by some insignificant publication “Island Business” and that, in itself, is a perfectly good reason for it to be ignored. Our media though are either deliberately or ignorantly blinded by their own prejudice. It’s all about Ardern’s rhetoric about climate change and it’s all about money. Ardern gives our money to fight climate change meanwhile **China** , the biggest polluter on Earth is pouring billions of dollars into the Pacific. It doesn’t matter where the money comes from or the morality of its contributors as long as it keeps coming. I’m afraid Ardern and New Zealand have been conned again.

"Ash dieback, oak processionary moths, waterway minkes and parrakeets in Kew Gardens – there are plenty of species on and even above ground in the UK that didn’t originate in the country. The fifth Annual Report Card, drawn up by 150 experts at 55 institutions and released today by the Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership, provides a hit list of non-native and invasive species that live in British waters. The past few decades have seen an exponential increase in the spread of non-native species worldwide. In UK and Irish waters, alien species are on the increase, and many more are likely to come. Some will expand their range, some could have an impact on the environment or economy, and some are just plain revolting.  Non-native species are species that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced to regions outside their usual, natural range. The increasing number of species appearing in ecosystems far from home is linked to the huge increase of human mobility, particularly the growth of fast international shipping that can carry species around the world quickly enough that they survive the experience, and thrive. If a newly introduced species becomes established and begins to threaten biodiversity, cause economic damage, or both, they are called “invasive”. Biological invasions are one of the greatest threats to marine biodiversity and can be economically and ecologically devastating. There are now more than 90 non-native species known to live in British coastal waters and brackish waterways. Of these more than 60 are established, and several are considered to be high impact, either environmentally, economically or both, and some of them are still spreading. For example, the tiny zebra mussel enters and blocks industrial pipes that flow into the sea, on occasion shutting power stations down.  Alternatively, the carpet sea squirt Didemnum vexillum and leathery or Asian sea squirt Styela clava have become major problems to fishing and oyster beds – and look pretty horrible too. Already in Britain, non-native species are estimated to cost the economy £1.7 billion a year, with the annual cost to industries such as shipping and aquaculture estimated at almost £40m. This is probably an underestimate, as little distinction is made between native and non-native species when crews remove hull fouling organisms from ships, or carry out pest control at fish and shellfish farms. Most alien species in the UK were initially seen in the English Channel and have since expanded northwards into the North Sea to the east of the country, and the Celtic Sea to the west. Trade is mainly responsible, with creatures and plants transported in water and sediments sucked into ships’ ballast tanks, on fouled hulls, and in imported cargo. Port and marina developments, greater use of boats for leisure, and aquaculture all pose risks too. As our knowledge and understanding of invasion biology improves, we have learnt the origin of many species now in British waters, using DNA marker techniques to provide more precise methods of tracking alien species. The two main origins for non-native species are the North Pacific and Northwest Atlantic. Species from similar regions are more likely to become established and widespread. There are, however, species like the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha from the region around the Caspian and Black Seas, and the tubeworm Ficopomatus enigmaticus from the Indo-Pacific, that can tolerate a wide range of conditions and are successfully established in British waters. Climate change and some extreme weather conditions have also enabled some non-native species to become reproductively successful in the North Atlantic, such as the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Climate change can influence every stage of the invasion process, but because of a lack of data it is often difficult to attribute, for example, shifts in distribution or increased reproductive success, directly to climate change. Others, including the bryozoan Bugula neritina, have taken advantage of warmer waters to become established beyond the warm waters around the outflows of power stations. Regional climate models predict the current trend of warming will continue throughout this century, encouraging more and greater variety of non-native species into British waters. In order to avoid or lessen the impact of invasive species, it’s critical that we better understand how changes in seawater temperature, increased atmospheric CO2, increased rainfall, heat waves, storm frequency, and ocean acidification will influence how easy it is for invaders to establish themselves in British waters. Despite a full list of non-native species living in British waters, there’s still a lack of long-term data and in-depth biological information, a worrying shortage of skilled taxonomists to help identify species, and gaps in our knowledge – gaps that researchers at groups such as SAMS, the Environmental Research Institute, NAFC Marine Centre and Marine Biological Association are striving to fill."

Long‐​time establishment apologists Norman Ornstein (AEI) and Thomas Mann (Brookings) have generated a lot of ink lately, pro and con, over their claim that our “dysfunctional” government is the fault of Republican “extremists” whose party has become “an insurgent outlier in American politics,” blocking measures for economic recovery, climate change, health‐​care reform, and much else.



Well, for the legal branch there’s a more complex but not much more subtle variation of the Ornstein/​Mann thesis that academic lawyers of the progressive persuasion — I repeat myself — have been peddling in recent years. It’s that “a nascent movement of pro‐​business and libertarian federal judges and think tank activists” have been working for some time to resurrect “a series of legal doctrines that have been dormant since the New Deal,” all “to dismantle the post‐​New Deal regulatory state” and restore something called “the Constitution in Exile.” Coined by D.C. Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg in a 1995 Cato Institute article, that term refers to the limited government Constitution we all pretty much lived under for 150 years, before Franklin Roosevelt’s infamous 1937 Court‐​packing threat cowed the Court into crafting what now passes for “constitutional law” — not to be confused with the Constitution itself.



The legal version of the Ornstein/​Mann thesis is on display in, among many other places, The New Republic of May 4, in George Washington University Professor Jeffrey Rosen’s “Second Opinions,” from which the above quotes are taken. Rosen’s title alludes to the six and a half hours of Obamacare oral argument in the Supreme Court at the end of March — a “train wreck” for those who’d confidently predicted the Act’s constitutionality. But it alludes also, and more immediately, to an opinion that came down two weeks later from the D.C. Circuit, _Hettinga v. United States_. There the three‐​judge panel upheld a 2005 amendment to a complex system of milk marketing price controls dating back to 1937, the effect of which was to penalize an enterprising dairyman for the benefit of cartelized competitors — an egregious assault on economic liberty. As an inferior court, the panel had no choice, due to long‐​standing precedents, but to uphold the statute. But the decision generated a blistering concurrence by Judge Janice Rogers Brown, joined by Chief Judge David Sentelle, “notable not only for its anti‐​statist editorializing,” Rosen writes, “but also because it suggests that the Affordable Care Act will be far from the last federal regulation to be threatened by conservative judicial activism.”



And so we come to the heart of the problem for Rosen and his progressive colleagues — it’s the “conservative judicial activism” against which Obama himself railed after the High Court made it clear that his major legislative accomplishment was constitutionally suspect. Trouble is, though, you’ve got to say more than “activism” if you’re going to make the charge stick; you’ve got to show why, for example, it’s acceptable for judges to defer to the political branches when “mere” economic liberties are at issue, and Rosen’s piece is devoid of any such effort. As the Pacific Legal Foundation’s Tim Sandefur noted, nowhere in his article does Rosen even try to address the substance of the matter. Instead, he gives us a “caricature of a one‐​sided partisan cabal,” Sandefur says. He continues:



 _Rosen finds it easier to draw this conflict as a merely partisan one — and to emphasize not the broader legal debates, not whether or not Judge Brown’s criticism of modern constitutional law has merit, but instead simply to emphasize the vulgar personal benefits that the current, distorted constitutional doctrine brings to a specific class of people, and the risk to their personal income, should these disputes gain an audience at the Supreme Court._



Like the Ornstein/​Mann thesis, then, it’s all politics, not law. And for good reason: that’s what the New Deal constitutional revolution that Ornstein, Mann, and Rosen are defending was all about — politicizing law. This distinction between economic and noneconomic liberties, which so animates Judge Brown’s trenchant concurrence, stems not from the law of the Constitution but from the famous footnote four of the Court’s 1938 _Carolene Products_ decision. The Court drew it to enable the New Deal’s regulatory and redistributive schemes to pass constitutional muster — through a further distinction between “strict” judicial scrutiny, which the Court would give to statutes implicating noneconomic liberties, and “rational basis” scrutiny, which the Court would employ when _economic_ liberties were at issue, a test that in practice has removed virtually all constitutional protection from the kind of political assault Mr. Hettinga endured.



To be clear, it’s not that Rosen is oblivious to these issues — far from it. In fact, he asks why it was that “a relative moderate” like Judge Thomas Griffith, who did not join Judge Brown’s concurrence, would nonetheless “profess himself ‘by no means unsympathetic’ to the views of the most radical partisans of the Constitution in Exile.” He speculates:



 _Perhaps because the terms of legal debate have been so dramatically changed by [Georgetown University Law Professor Randy] Barnett. In less than two years, he has managed to transform the notion that the health care mandate was unconstitutional from a far‐​fetched idea into a principle that may soon be endorsed by all five of the Supreme Court’s conservatives._



Yes, Barnett has made a major contribution to shifting the constitutional debate over the health care mandate; and yes, that debate is just part of a much larger one about the role of the courts in restoring the “Constitution in Exile,” as Rosen goes on to say. But that debate has been going on for far longer than two years, since the mid‐​1970s, even if many in the insulated legal academy have been slow — or disinclined — to acknowledge it. (Cato’s 1984 conference on “Economic Liberties and the Judiciary” is but one example.) As Barnett wrote recently at the Volokh Conspiracy, comparing academic and media commentary on Obamacare:



 _The “mainstream” media coverage of the ACA lawsuits has been remarkably fair and balanced throughout. Not only have they been reporting what both sides say, and accurately conveying the color and substance of oral arguments below, but the reporters seem to have a more sophisticated grasp of the legal arguments — and their relative merits — than is evinced by some law professors._



This reluctance to grapple with the substance — casting opponents as “activists” pursuing a political agenda — comes starkly to the fore as Rosen draws his piece to a conclusion. “If the Roberts Court strikes down health care reform by a 5–4 vote,” he writes, the Court would be “resurrecting the pre‐​New Deal era of economic judicial activism with a vengeance” and returning us to “a time when crusading judges struck down progressive economic regulations in the name of hotly conservative economic doctrines that a majority of the country didn’t favor.”



There you have it. Echoing Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’s infamous _Lochner dissent_ , Rosen invites us to believe that the old, pre‐​New Deal Court was invoking _economic, not legal doctrines_ , that the Constitution is neutral on the question of economic arrangements, and that transient majorities can determine those arrangements as they wish, even to the point of cartelizing much of the economy, as progressives have done, and all of that free from any constitutional constraints. That’s politics trumping law with a vengeance, and it undermines the very point of a written constitution.

Europeans in general enjoyed a mild winter this year. But apparently it looks like it’s set to get colder and snowier as the calendar turns to March.
The site writes that the mild weather of the past weekend will be pushed out of Central Europe by Arctic wind and snow by Wednesday, as the following wetteronline chart illustrates:

 
Chart by http://www.wetteronline.de/14-tage-wetter
The reason for this of course is global cooling. Just kidding.
The late winter will be due to a low over positioned over Scandinavia and a high over Iceland. The two systems will act to pump polar air over a western and central Europe that is by now now longing for signs of spring. The gardening tools and are going to have to wait awhile longer.

Wetteronline.de says that today will see very springlike temperatures down in southern Germany, with readings reaching above 15°C. But it adds the weather will cool with each passing day – with “snow reaching down into the lowlands” already by Tuesday. It warns of heavy snowshowers by midweek.



Video by: http://www.wetteronline.de/14-tage-wetter
The good news is that Europe will have a chance to dry out as high pressure pumps in drier air. Early March is forecast to be more on the wintry side. Wetteronline writes of “snowfalls down to the lower elevations with high temperatures near 5°C likely“.

Australian bushfires are seasonal and as predictable as the sun rising in the east given favourable climatic conditions. The bushfire season in New South Wales and South Australia peaks in summer and autumn, meaning the worst may be yet to come. 



“The greatest danger occurs after the dry winter and spring. The worst conditions occur when deep low-pressure systems near Tasmania bring strong, hot and dry, westerly winds to the coastal districts. 



The end of the fire season is determined by the onset of moister conditions, sometimes the result of a tropical cyclone developing near the Queensland coast.”



Periods of drought create the perfect environment for fires whipped into uncontrollable fiery maelstroms by strong southeast to northeast winds, fires started by arson or dry lightning strike.



“In some parts of Australia lightning is the main source of bushfire ignition. The winds during thunderstorms can make it hard to predict the behaviour and movement of a bushfire.



Large fires can also create their own thunderstorms known as pyrocumulonimbus. They can cause erratic more intense and dangerous bushfire behaviour.”



The 2019-2020 Australian bushfires have so far, destroyed more bush and wildlife than previous fires but killed fewer people. MSM and the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology blame this year’s catastrophic fires on climate change,[ but rural landowners disagree.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/dickheads-cost-lives/) They blame the Greens’ influence on government policy restricting the cutting of wide fire breaks around homes and forbidding the removal of a buildup of flammable undergrowth in the bush.



According to the Greens, dead trees are a valuable animal habitat not to be disturbed. One hopes the Greens are sufficiently disturbed by the estimated half a million dead animals in the current fires as a result of their “environmentally friendly” policies. The Aborigines are much better at protecting wildlife and restricting bushfires than the Greens because they [“used fire for many thousands of years to ‘care for country’. The fires were a tool that encouraged the growth and extent of grasslands to enhance hunting, reduced levels of fuel, and kept vegetation from becoming dense and hard to walk through.”](https://www.ffm.vic.gov.au/history-and-incidents/past-bushfires)



Suitable conditions mean more of Australia is alight in the 2019-2020 fire season. As at 5 January 2020 [an estimated 6.3 million hectares are destroyed with over 2,500 buildings (including over 1,300 houses), and 25 people have died with a further six missing in the state of Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Australian_bushfire_season). Thankfully fewer lives are lost to date than in previous fires but much more bush and wildlife is being destroyed.



Some notable Australian bushfires: 



Last week the South Island was shrouded in smoke from the Australian fires and on Sunday mid-afternoon Auckland had an eerie “cloud” cover which darkened the day – a very small taste of our Aussie neighbour’s darkness. The uninformed [dialled 111](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/are-people-really-this-thick/) and MSM surmised on the concept of an apocalypse. They were momentarily distracted from their current favourite doom and gloom subject of the Don’s desire to start world war three.



On _TV1 News at Six_ on Sunday night, Laura James said, _“There seems to be **no record** of smoke from fires in Australia reaching New Zealand before,”_ despite _Stuff_ reporting **in March** that Smoke from Australian bush fires had reached New Zealand.



A _BFD_ reader, after being suitably unimpressed by the MSM claim that this was the first instance of Australian bushfire smoke shrouding New Zealand, researched _Papers Past_. 



Thanks to our reader we can enlighten the MSM and tell them to put this in their pipe and smoke it – this year’s Australian bushfire smoke covering New Zealand is **not** a New Zealand first and nor is it an example of worsening climate change. This clipping from the infamous **1939 fires** confirms a similar occurrence.



Australian bushfires were reported in New Zealand regional newspapers **as far back as 1894.** You can access these articles by clicking on [this link](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers?items_per_page=10&query=bush+fires+australia&snippet=true), this [link](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers?items_per_page=10&snippet=true&query=bush+fires+australia) and this [link.](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers?items_per_page=10&snippet=true&query=smoke+bush+fires+australia+auckland)



Our BFD reader captured [New Zealand articles recording Australian heatwaves](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers?items_per_page=10&snippet=true&query=heat+wave+australia), some occurring over a century ago. [The temperature in Eucla, New South Wales](https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZTIM19121219.2.76?items_per_page=10&query=heat+wave+australia&snippet=true) was 122 degrees Fahrenheit, or 50 degrees Celsius, on December 18, **1912.** But [Australia’s highest maximum temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Australia) was recorded in South Australia as 50.7 °C (123.3 °F) at Oodnadatta on 2 January **1960**.



So much for global warming.

Alex Sen Gupta, a biological scientist, has written an article (reviewed by John Cook) which attempts to defend the validity of climate models which can’t predict the climate.
According to Gupta;
To understand what’s happening, it is critical to realise that the climate changes for a number of reasons in addition to CO₂. These include solar variations, volcanic eruptions and human aerosol emissions.
The influence of all these “climate drivers” are included in modern climate models. On top of this, our climate also changes as a result of natural and largely random fluctuations – like the El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, [IPO] – that can redistribute heat to the deep ocean (thereby masking surface warming).
Such fluctuations are unpredictable beyond a few months (or possibly years), being triggered by atmospheric and oceanic weather systems. So while models do generate fluctuations like ENSO and IPO, in centennial scale simulations they don’t (and wouldn’t be expected to) occur at the same time as they do in observations.
Read more: http://theconversation.com/factcheck-are-95-of-models-linking-human-co-emissions-and-global-warming-in-error-41671
The problem with this claim is that, as Gupta says, the climate models are supposed to take these random fluctuations into account. Climate models are supposed to accommodate randomness, by providing a range of predicted values – the range is produced by plugging in different values for the random elements which cannot be predicted. However, observations are right on the lower border of that range. The divergence between climate models and predictions is now so great, that climate models are on the brink of being incontrovertibly falsified.
As Judith Curry recently said, If the pause continues for 20 years (a period for which none of the climate models showed a pause in the presence of greenhouse warming), the climate models will have failed a fundamental test of empirical adequacy.
This is important, because it strikes at the heart of the claim that climate models can detect human influence on climate change. If climate models cannot model climate, if the models cannot be reconciled with observations, how can the models possibly be useful for attributing the causes climate change? If scientists defending the models claim the discrepancy is because of random fluctuations in the climate, which have pushed the models to the brink of falsification, doesn’t this demonstrate that, at the very least, the models very likely underestimate the amount of randomness in the climate? Is it possible that the entire 20th century warming might be one large random fluctuation?
Nature is certainly capable of producing large, rapid climate fluctuations, such as the Younger Dryas, an abrupt return to ice age conditions which occurred 12,500 years ago. You can’t use climate models which demonstrably underestimate the randomness of climate change, to calculate how much of the observed 20th century warming is not random.
If current mainstream climate models cannot predict the climate, then scientists have to consider the possibility that other models, with different assumptions, can do a better job. It is no accident that Monckton, Soon, Legates and Brigg’s paper on an irreducibly simple climate model, which does a better job of hind casting climate than mainstream models, has received over 10,000 downloads. As every scientific revolution in history has demonstrated, being right is ultimately more important than being mainstream, even if it sometimes takes a few years to win acceptance.
For now, mainstream climate scientists are mostly hiding in the fringes of their estimates. When they acknowledge it at all, they claim that the anomaly, the pause, is a low probability event which is still consistent with climate models. Hans Von Storch, one of the giants of German climate research, a few years ago claimed that 98% of climate models cannot be reconciled with reality – which still, for now, leaves 2% possibility that climate scientists are right.
Is the world really preparing to spend billions, trillions of dollars, on a 2% bet?

In the September/​October issue of _Renewing American Civilization,_ Frank Gregorsky, while suggesting that Gingrich probably has read some Hayek, maintains that other books offer a better understanding of the professor turned-Congressman’s mind. At the top of the list: science fiction author Isaac Asimov’s epic Foundation trilogy. Since the top Republican is quick to pass out reading lists to college and Congressional freshmen alike, this battle of the books merits serious attention.



 **Hayek’s Order**



F.A. Hayek was perhaps this century’s greatest classical liberal thinker. His insights into the nature of free societies helped to preserve the West as it indulged in socialist and welfare state policies, and are key to restoring it to healthy freedom.



A first crucial insight of Hayek and other classical liberal thinkers is that the actor and unit of analysis for any study of human history, society, or institutions is the individual. Society is constituted by aspects or priorities in the action of individuals that are shared with others. There is no collective entity, be it material, dialectic, Weltgeist, or historical wave apart from individuals.



A second Hayekian insight concerns the nature of order. Most people conceive of order in the world as falling into one of two categories. First trees, mountains, and solar systems arise and evolve naturally. Second, watches and tables, statues and rockets result from intentional human planning and action. This latter conception gives rise to the belief among socialists and statists that all‐​wise, caring bureaucrats can plan and benevolently guide economies to prosperity, and among social conservatives that censors and vice squads can create civil societies.



But Hayek identifies a third type of order: spontaneous order that arises from human action but is not specifically planned by men. A classic example of this type of order is money. In primitive societies, individuals might need to travel long distances to trade with one another. But it is difficult and costly to tote four cows, seven bales of hay, and a slab of copper over a mountain, all to be exchanged for a dozen sheep, six large jars of barley, and a handful of gold nuggets. Many merchants hit on the strategy of trading their goods simply for those small yellow pieces of metal rather than sheep, which tend to wander off, and the rest of it. Gold is easy to transport, difficult to counterfeit, durable, rust‐​resistant, and easily divisible. Traders can take the metal home to exchange for what they really need. Thus as individuals sought to exchange goods more efficiently, the institution of money emerged and became an economic institution as an unintended consequence. No one invented it.



A third Hayekian insight, best seen on the market, concerns the limits of individual knowledge. It is impossible for any individual to know what mix of goods and services will best satisfy consumer needs, what prices goods, services and labor should fetch, and which individuals are most efficient at performing particular jobs. As with science and other human institutions, the market is a discovery process with workers and owners, merchants and manufacturers— entrepreneurs all—experimenting to determine what they can offer in trade to others to maximize their own values.



What Hayek’s insights imply is that at best men can glimpse the probable outcomes of proposed public policies. For example, a welfare system that pays people not to work and punishes productive people will produce a lazy and unproductive population. Attempts to use political power to manipulate entire systems will result in adverse, unintended consequences; most certain, political power rather than mutual consent and free exchange will become the social coin of the realm



Hayek thus maintains that individuals in a society would do best to establish very general rules, protecting individuals from assault, theft, fraud and the like, and leave individuals free to work out the best ways to meet their various needs and the challenge of life.



 **Foundation and Fallacies**



Hayek’s views can be contrasted with some of those presented in fictional form by Isaac Asimov. Asimov is one of the all‐​time greatest science fiction authors. At his best he is highly imaginative, with an intelligent style and well‐​integrated plots.



The first three Foundation novels, written in the early 1950s, trace the decline of the Galactic Empire. To save humanity, the brilliant Hari Seldon develops the science of psychohistory, which can predict the behavior of masses of human beings. Seldon engineers the establishment of a Foundation on the planet Terminus, isolated at the edge of the Galaxy, to serve as the core of a second Galactic Empire a thousand years in the future. After various crises over the ensuing centuries, the prerecorded image of Seldon appears to explain what had just occurred and to ensure them that history was preceding according to the Seldon Plan.



The events in the first three Foundation novels contain aspects of spontaneous order and unintended consequences. For example, Asimov’s description of an Empire growing stagnant, corrupt and repressive, weighted down by heavy bureaucracy, certainly rings true.



In another example, after the periphery of the Galaxy breaks away from the Empire, the region’s strongest planet seeks domination over defenseless Terminus. But other, weaker armed worlds in the region also fear attack. A clever Terminus mayor plays the planets off one another in a classic balance‐​of‐​power strategy to preserve his planet’s freedom. Terminus, over centuries of history predicted by Seldon, at various times uses religion and economic manipulation to stave off attacks and rise to dominate its sector of the Galaxy.



But in his fictional universe, Asimov conceded that perfect prediction was not possible. He hides in the Galaxy a Second Foundation of psychohistorians as guardians of the Seldon Plan. They possess powers to detect and manipulate human emotions, and intervene to place the Plan back on course when it strays.



Asimov’s fiction reflected two fundamental premises of 1950s liberalism: (1) social and economic sciences can predict the future of a society; and (2) philosopher‐​kings with knowledge of how societies can or should work should rule. Hayek calls such premises fatal conceits.



Starting in the early 1980s Asimov added four more Foundation novels to the original trilogy. In these he shows the Seldon Plan collapsing and a nascent collective galactic consciousness as the only hope for a peaceful human future. This reflects the New Age mysticism that is still festering in popular culture. From a science fiction perspective the device had its place in Asimov’s work. But clearly it provides no useful insight into political and social reality.



 **Toffler’s Constitution**



Asimov’s faulty premises are also found in part in the works of Gingrich’s favorite futurists, “Third Wave” theorists Heidi and Alvin Toffler. The Tofflers maintain that human history’s first great wave of advance was the agricultural revolution some 10,000 years ago, with the second wave, the industrial revolution, beginning some 250 years ago. Men are now moving into the third wave, the information revolution. So far, so good.



But the Tofflers maintain that futurists such as themselves were able to predict this coming wave, and will be able to accurately predict about tomorrow. Yes, some have glimpsed trends 20 or 30 years out. Some have seemingly seen centuries ahead. Da Vinci attempted to invent a submarine and flying machine. Jules Verne saw men traveling to the Moon. Yet just as many predictions have been wrong as right. Perhaps one could argue that the head of IBM who, in the 1950s. maintained that the country would never need more than five or six computers, was not, after all, a college trained “futurist.” But surely a capitalist has a strong incentive to predict correctly.



Even granting that some futurists are better than others, how do men in society separate the best from the worst or, to put it in contemporary parlance, a good operating system from a computer virus? The only way, as with products, ideas, or institutions, is through competition in a free, open society—Hayek’s way.



This does not suggest that it is a useless enterprise to try to determine, however imperfectly, what the future will bring. It does, however, call into question the role that the government should play in helping the third wave along. While the Tofflers openly distinguish themselves from Gingrich on a number of issues, the futurists seem to accept a more active role for government than would others on the right of the political spectrum.



The Tofflers, for example, would amend the U.S. Constitution, which they say is a second‐​wave document. They are not clear about just what must be changed. But which Constitution are they talking about? The one we study in high school has long since been eroded. The tenth amendment which states that “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited to it by the States, are reserved for the States respectively, or the people” has been inoperative for many decades. Article I, which lists the limited powers given to the federal government, also gives the U.S. Congress the exclusive power to make federal laws. But for decades Congress has abrogated this power, giving broad and open‐​ended mandates to un‐​elected bureaucrats in federal agencies who then, in effect, make laws. America has a government of would‐​be philosopher kings, the kind of which the Tofflers might approve.



A Hayekian approach suggests that the country return to the original Constitution of limited federal powers, with more responsibilities left to the states, localities and, most important, most freedom left to individuals. Such a system is best able to deal with the future complexities.



 **Connecting Technologies**



Those who are intrigued by the future but who want a Hayekian perspective on things to come would do well to consult the popular science works of James Burke. In his television series and accompanying books “the Day the Universe Changed” and “Connections,” Burke traces the development of television to telecommunications, aircraft and atomic weapons. He shows how seemingly unrelated events and inventions build on one another to produce unpredictable results. He shows how the silk loom and the 1890 U.S. census helped give birth to the computer, how gaslights and the American Revolution were responsible for raincoats, and hoe Italian Renaissance water gardens contributed to the invention of the internal combustion engine.



Consider an example of Burke’s connections. In Florida in the 1830s John Gorie experimented with curing illnesses believed to be caused by “bad air,” from whence we get the word malaria. Since tropical diseases do not occur in winter or in cold climates, he reasoned that cold air was the answer. (It wasn’t) To avoid the high costs of obtaining ice cut from lakes and stored in New England during winters for shipment South in the summer, he used the fact that compressed air heats up and reducing compression cools air to produce air conditioning.



Later in that century, Germans sought a way around the fact that their bottom‐​vat brewing of beer required very cold temperatures and thus could only be done in the winter. Using Gorrie’s piston approach, as is found in Von Linder compressed ammonia. The result: refrigeration as is found in nearly every kitchen today.



But to refrigerate and keep liquefied large quantities of ammonia and other gasses for industrial use, James Dewar, knowing that a vacuum does not transmit heat or cold, invented a flask with two walls containing a vacuum in the space between. The resulting thermos bottle is found in millions of lunch boxes.



Finally, Robert Goddard in the United States, and in Germany Herman Oberth with his young protégé Werner von Braun essentially burned huge quantities of liquid hydrogen with oxygen, both stored in what amounted to giant thermos bottles, to produce the type of rockets that eventually lifted off from Florida and landed on the Moon.



Burke’s review of the actual history of science and technology confirms the basic Hayekian insights. First, knowledge is always uncertain. Experimentation best facilitates progress. Predictions about the unintended consequences of particular discoveries are impossible. Second, advances usually come as individuals, doing their best in the face of uncertainty, trying to solve a particular challenge facing them, build on the works and discoveries of the past.



 **Future Philosophy**



The fascination on the part of Gingrich and others with the future and with science and technological innovation is in keeping with the American tradition. But equally part of this tradition is the freedom of individuals to act in entrepreneurial manners.



While it is not possible to predict specifics of the future, it is possible to determine which institutional arrangements best allow for change in the face of uncertainty and innovation in the face of needs. The genuinely forward‐​looking policy‐​maker should look to Hayek. This thinker, born in the last year of the 19th century, is a true philosopher of the 21st.

"
"In his Autumn Statement the Chancellor fulfilled the pledge to roll back the “green taxes” in order to “save” families £50 a year from their household energy bil. In doing so he has missed an opportunity to properly address the fundamental issue that keeps low income families cold: the poor quality of the buildings in which many live. To put these in perspective, earlier this year Ofgem estimated that the green levies and taxes added £82, around 6%, to the average household dual-fuel bill of £1,342. The carbon tax, levied on firms generating electricity from fossil fuels, will generate an estimated £1 billion this year – about £40 per household, on average – and brings the total added to bills by these green taxes and levies to £122, or 9%. The largest element of these green schemes is the Energy Company Obligation, ECO, that requires energy firms to insulate and improve the energy efficiency of hard to treat homes and those with low incomes. The Chancellor has allowed the firms to carry out their obligations over longer periods, essentially increasing the bills to be paid by those whose homes need improvements. ECO and the other schemes are essential for the UK to address the energy priority of this century: to move to low carbon, secure energy sources, and to use them with far greater efficiency. The strength and basic good sense of this priority saw the government back away from the more drastic cuts proposed, but even so the dilution of ECO simply pushes back the moment Britain’s building stock is brought up to a standard that allows people to keep warm at a price they can afford.  Rather than procrastinating, the Chancellor could have seized the initiative at very little extra cost by reformatting an only recently introduced levy, the Warm Home Discount, which knocks money off the electricity bill of households characterised as vulnerable to fuel poverty, that is, with high energy bills and low income. The discount is funded through consumer bills, but the Chancellor could have paid for it from tax expenditures, which is more progressive and where it should have been in the first place. Osborne could have wrong-footed the opposition completely and broken away from the current, sterile debate centred on cuts and freezes with a Warm Home Guarantee. Such a scheme should guarantee an energy efficiency makeover and insulation upgrade to any fuel-poor household. And until the work is completed, this guarantee should come with a significantly higher rate of Warm Home Discount. For example, if the Warm Home Discount for such households was doubled from the current rate of £135 to £270, and if five million households qualified for it, this would cost an extra £650 million, paid for through the extra revenue forecast to come next year from the carbon tax. The energy efficiency upgrade could be carried out as a priority under the ECO funding, which is what it is for anyway, although it would need to be restored to its original level.  Arranged like this, the spending would be targeted more closely at those most in need of it. As the energy efficiency work was carried out, the extra funding from the Warm Home Discount would be reduced, as the promise of warmer homes and lower bills finally reached more and more low-income households. As a bonus, Britain would need to build fewer new power stations as demand dropped. Unlike a price freeze, this measure would institute the virtuous circle of greater energy efficiency, leading to lower bills, warmer homes, and better protection from rising energy prices. Gradually the historic situation at the root of the problem of poor quality, poorly insulated homes that leave low income households at the mercy of the winter weather and price spikes would be improved. The Chancellor missed the opportunity to set this virtuous circle in motion yesterday, but the opportunity remains for the Budget, or next year’s Autumn Statement. Will a Conservative chancellor ever find the vision to be the champion of low-income households, or must that always be left to the Labour Party?"
"Natural history museum records are most often associated with preserved specimens, kept with information about the place and time of collection. From these we can generate a record of a species’ geographical distribution, and indicators of its life-cycle timing – events such as the flowering of plants, bears rising from hibernation, or butterflies pupating and flying for the first time. Museums hold hundreds of thousands of specimens and observations collected around the world for centuries – even in places that lack other conventional, modern record-keeping. We can use museum collection records as a window into the past, into areas that are not as well studied. This approach is especially useful for understanding how biodiversity is responding to climate change. A team including myself at the University of British Columbia and colleagues at the University of Ottawa and the Université de Sherbrooke in Canada recently published a paper in the journal Global Change Biology that used museum records. We found that the timing of butterflies’ flight season is sensitive to spring temperature. Climate change has led spring to begin earlier in many parts of the world, and this has brought forward many butterflies’ species flight seasons too. We took advantage of the efforts made back in 1998 to digitise Canadian butterfly collection records. Our analysis paired around 48,000 unique observations from across Canada between 1871-2010 with weather station data to examine the sensitivity of flight season timing of 204 butterfly species to spring temperatures. To our knowledge, this is the first study to do so. Butterflies work well as indicators for how climate change is affecting wildlife since their physiology and behaviour is so sensitive to the environment around them. This means they act as an early signal for other species. We found with each degree of warming, butterflies took flight 2.4 days earlier. For most species this means an average shift of 0.2 days per decade over the past hundred years, but this average hides the wide disparity of temperature changes and species responses across Canada. Given that temperatures are expected to continue rising, this shift will only get bigger. This sensitivity to temperature can be used to predict species’ vulnerability to climate change. For example, highly sensitive species that start their flight season too early could be more likely to be killed by stressful weather such as frost. Or it may mean that they become active before their host plants have flowered that season and are ready for them, meaning they’d starve.  We also found we could predict which species are likely to be more sensitive than others. This is valuable information for those species where historical data is patchy. We particularly found species with earlier flight seasons, that is, spring fliers not summer fliers, and those that can fly longer distances are likely to more more sensitive to change than others. This shows how helpful museum collections can be in understanding how climate change has influenced species life-cycles. Herbarium (plant) records have similarly revealed how flowering times in plants have responded to warming, but few have considered records for animals. Given the massive number of museum collection records available around the world, this represents a very under-used resource. Unfortunately, as science budgets are slashed the funding for compiling, digitising and housing these records disappears. For example, most of the butterfly specimens at the University of British Columbia’s Beaty Biodiversity Museum have not been assembled and organised and couldn’t be included in this study. Instead, I had to rely on private collections in British Columbia. Fortunately, there are initiatives such as Canadensys and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility that are working to make this data accessible to everyone. This work reinforces the value of museum collections and the efforts to archive and appreciate our natural history."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe more volatile supply wind and solar energy that comes online in Germany, the more insane the market prices become. Too often the wind blows and the sun shines when power is unneeded, or they are simply AWOL when demand is high like in the wintertime.

Germany’s wildly fluctuating wind and solar energy are creating grid and market havoc. Source: Agora.
Earlier this month Germany saw a spate of both sunny, windy days, thus leading to huge power grid surges during the Ascension holiday weekend, a time when many factories were running close to idled (see chart above).
Despite billions annually in subsidies, wind and sun still puny
And for a few minutes last Pentecost Monday afternoon – a holiday that saw very low national electricity demand – wind and solar provided almost enough power to cover all of the country’s electricity needs, reported Die Welt here. Leading Greens cheered, and proclaimed that coal and nuclear had not been needed for a time. But they cheered “too early” writes Die Welt’s business journalist Daniel Wetzel, pointing out that market and technical conditions became dangerously precarious and that in total “electricity represents only 21% of Germany’s total energy need.”
While Germany’s installed solar and wind energy may be able to get fairly close to fulfilling total electricity demand for a few minutes in rare instances that weather and demand conditions are just right, their share of total primary energy is still depressingly measly. Die Welt puts it all in true perspective:
Despite billions in subsidies, ‘renewable energies’ wind and sun covered only 3.7% of Germany’s primary energy needs last year.”
Negative wholesale prices becoming rampant

Another debilitating feature of the weather-dependent renewable energies are the havoc they create on the electricity exchanges. Last week’s power grid overloading by wind and sun led to deep negative wholesale prices.
Spiegel here writes that the wholesale power price plummeted to -130 euros per megawatt (see blue curve in the right chart)! Literally, foreign consumers were being paid to take the power. (The black curve shows total German demand).
Moreover the phenomenon of negative wholesale prices (i.e. excessive power feeding uncontrollably into the grid) occurred a record 25 times in 2015, Spiegel writes. That was 4 times more often than in 2011.
Among the highest electricity prices in the world
With wholesale electricity prices dipping into negative territory, one might think that power must be very cheap for the consumer. Unfortunately this is not the case. At negative prices power companies lose money, and so are then forced to pass along these extra costs along to the end consumers. German consumers are paying close to €0.30 for each kilowatt-hour they consume – among the highest in the world.
The situation has gotten so alarming that leading politicians of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU conservative party are now demanding an end to subsidies for new wind and solar installations.
Denmark slams brakes on wind projects
Not only Germany is struggling with wildly fluctuating grid and market conditions, which are leading to massive costs and pain for consumers, but so is Denmark. Die Welt writes:
The situation has also led wind energy leader Denmark to a rethinking. Press reports say that Energy Minister Lars Christian Lilleholt has stopped the planned construction of five large offshore wind farms in order to protect consumers from large cost increases.”

"Floods happen. Rivers have always inundated their floodplains and the sea has always tried to reclaim land that has been taken from it. This is certainly true in Somerset, whose name derives from the Old English word for “land of the summer people”; so called because it was too wet in winter. In 1607 a major storm caused floods that killed about 2,000 people and swept away whole villages in Somerset and down the Bristol Channel. This was probably the greatest ever loss of life from British weather.  In the great flood of 1872, more than 100 square miles of land were flooded between October and the following March, and again in 1919. So while this month’s rainfall figures record that parts of England have had the wettest January on record, in the south-west it is only the fifth wettest. However, the previous winter of 2012-2103 also saw parts of the Somerset Levels similarly underwater for more than 100 days. So the floodwaters are not unprecedented – and this raises two questions: could the damage have been reduced and can we expect more frequent flooding in the future? Undoubtedly damage can be reduced, but at a cost – politically and financially. For example, the standards of coastal and river flood defences in the Netherlands are much higher,and much more costly. With much of the population living below sea level, the reasons for this willingness to spend so much to avoid catastrophic damages is readily apparent. When flood defences failed during the great storm of 1953 it led to 350 deaths in Britain, and 1,800 in the Netherlands. During the storms in December 2013, the highest storm surge since 1953, there were 26 breaches of the sea defences in East Anglia. But forward warning saw timely evacuations, properties protected and the Thames Barrier raised to counter the highest water level since it was built. Because there had been the will to protect and money to do so, nobody died. How much are we prepared to spend now, especially if as climate models suggest flooding will increase in the future?  Flood protection in London is much higher, justified by the huge cost were central London to be flooded. But protection is not total, and defences could be overcome by a sufficiently strong flood, albeit rare. While this indicates how flooding can be devastating even without causing deaths, the investment in flood defences must be warranted, particularly if losses can be met by insurance. The balance that must be made depends on our estimates of risk, probability and damages, and each is uncertain since we have barely 100 years of data on which to base our estimates, and often much less. Models of the impacts of future change cannot yet provide robust estimates of how flood frequencies might be changing. In a sense it does not matter, because floods happen anyway. There were major floods on the Thames and Severn in 1924, 1947 and 1960, and in 2000, 2007 and 2013. The decision that needs to be made is how far people living in flood-risk areas should expect to be protected.  Low-lying areas at risk were avoided as sites for permanent habitation in the past. Flood plains were left as water meadows, and crops were planted in spring time to avoid winter flooding. With nothing to be damaged, the impact was minor. In 1954, the UK’s record highest annual rainfall was recorded at Sprinkling Tarn in the Lake District. The total that year was over 6,500 mm, the equivalent of 21 Cockermouth floods falling in a single year. Yet a trawl through the Cumberland and Westmoreland Gazette for 1954 reveals discussion of the fact that it did not stop raining, but little in the way of reports of damages – because there was little on the flood plains to be damaged. Flood defences change that approach, bringing an unwarranted air of invincibility. Defences lower the risk of damage from moderate flooding, but this year, or the next, or within 10 years, at some point a flood that exceeds their capacity will arrive. The aim should be to reduce the impact of a flood when it does happen by limiting the amount of people and property at risk behind the defences. Instead, building defences tends to encourage development behind the embankments or walls. In this way, even if overtopping floods occur rarely, the damages from those that do occur rapidly increase, even with major investment in flood defences. Where’s the sense in spending more on defences if the damages will increase in the long term anyway? The most fundamental question is why society as a whole should pay to protect the one in six households in flood risk areas, many built in the last decade, and some such as at Kendal in Cumbria and Ruthin in Wales flooded within months of their occupants moving in. Under the government’s new flood insurance plans, from 2015 all household insurance policy holders will pay a levy to do so, alongside hundreds of millions of pounds allocated every year to flood management from taxation. Since the floods in 2000 there has in fact been a policy shift towards mitigating damage rather than trying to build hard defences aimed at protection. Strategies that provide storage for flood waters in areas where damage will be minimised, land management to reduce runoff, restoration of natural river channels, and sustainable urban drainage schemes are being implemented as ways of coping with the impact of a risk that cannot be entirely eliminated.  These are more “natural” ways of dealing with excess water, but may leave some properties and land less well protected or dependent on costly flood proofing. Perhaps if people who wish to live in flood risk areas were required to install flood proofing measures before moving in, it might focus attention to the areas’ vulnerability. The emabattled Environment Agency has been accused of neglecting drainage and defences in the Somerset Levels for years, and it does seem that this rural area has not been a priority for expenditure – something exacerbated by the current budget cuts. Without a sudden change in priorities, this government will have cut channel maintenance spending by 45% by 2015. Groups such as the Floods on the Levels Action Group and National Farmers Union have suggested that such cuts represent a false economy when the costs of emergency pumping, disruption to the local population, and need to produce food are taken into account. Results of studies commissioned by the Environment Agency after the 2012 winter floods, presented in an open letter by the Somerset Drainage Board, suggest that dredging would have significantly reduced the period of flooding in parts of the levels from months to days (although having seen only results I cannot comment on the assumptions made). But dredging is not always the right solution, and in some places might increase the risk to bridges or to areas downstream, and can allow the tides to move faster and reach further upstream, backing up flood waters in the rivers. This was one reason why London’s flood defences have had to be raised in the 20th century following dredging in the Thames estuary. Nevertheless, the government has promised the Somerset rivers will be dredged as soon as possible. Just as the flood defences in Carlisle were redesigned after the floods in 2005, this must be considered a political decision in response to the misery of those affected – and the resulting media coverage. After all, when flood defences succeed it’s not nearly so newsworthy as when they fail. But more spending on protection still poses the question as to whether this will lead to more flood plain development and more potential damage in the future. It does not appear as if we are managing the potential for future flooding that well, particularly in communicating to people in flood risk areas that they cannot be completely protected and that – even with flood defences in place – they should expect floodwaters, and prepare for them."
"**The UN has urged Ethiopian authorities to ensure the protection of civilians as the army plans to attack the capital of the northern region of Tigray.**
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Sunday announced a 72-hour deadline for the region's fighters to surrender.
The army warned Mekelle's 500,000 residents that soldiers would ""encircle"" the city and attack it.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the mountainous region, has vowed to keep fighting.
The conflict has reportedly killed hundreds and displaced thousands in recent weeks. The UN has warned it could trigger a humanitarian crisis.
The authorities have to guarantee the safety of aid workers and civilians, Catherine Sozi, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator for Ethiopia, told news agency Reuters.
Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth said that ""Ethiopia has a duty to spare from harm even those who stay in Mekelle, not just threaten that 'there will be no mercy'.""
On Sunday an Ethiopian army spokesman told residents of the city to ""save themselves"" before an offensive in the city began.
The Ethiopian government has accused TPLF forces of destroying infrastructure including the airport in the ancient tourist town of Aksum, state-affiliated Fana news site reports.
It shared images of a ploughed runway, accusing the fighters of harming the region's economy.
The TPLF has not commented on the accusations but its leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters news agency on Sunday that his forces had managed to stall advancing federal troops.
""They [are] sending waves after waves but to no avail,"" he said.
The government said its troops took over the towns of Adwa, Aksum, Raya and Shire last week. However, information is difficult to confirm and claims cannot be independently verified because phone and internet connections have been down since the beginning of the conflict.
In a statement on Sunday aimed at the TPLF leadership, Mr Abiy said: ""Your journey of destruction is coming to an end, and we urge you to surrender peacefully within the next 72 hours, recognising you are at a point of no return. Take this last opportunity.""
Mr Abiy said TPLF forces should ""surrender peacefully"" and that the population of Mekelle should support government forces ""in bringing this treasonous group to justice"".
The United Arab Emirates, an influential ally of the Ethiopian government, said it was concerned about the conflict and that it was making contacts around Africa and the world to try to end it.
And on Friday, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the African Union chairman, announced the appointment of three former presidents to broker talks to end the conflict.
But Ethiopia has rejected the offer because it sees the operation as an internal ""law enforcement"" mission.
""We don't negotiate with criminals... We bring them to justice, not to the negotiating table,"" Mamo Mihretu, a senior aide to Mr Abiy, told the BBC.
""Our African brothers and sisters would play a more significant role if they put pressure on TPLF to surrender and for that, you know, nobody needs to go to Tigray or Mekelle to make that point clear to them.""
Mr Mamo said that former leaders from Mozambique, Liberia, and South Africa - who are due to arrive in the country in the coming days - would not be able to visit Tigray because of the ongoing military operation.
Transport services has been severely hampered since fighting broke out.
Mr Mamo said that the government was doing its ""utmost"" to allow UN agencies to provide assistance to people in Tigray.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the TPLF, the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, tensions escalated. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing that Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate. It held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal"".
On 4 November the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle.
The TPLF has rejected the claims.
Its fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000.
Aid agencies have no access to the conflict zone, but they fear that thousands of civilians may have been killed since fighting erupted at the beginning of November.
At least 33,000 refugees have already crossed into Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
On Friday, the TPLF was accused of firing rockets into the city of Bahir Dar in the neighbouring Amhara region. The Amhara government said there were no casualties and no damage caused.
But the reported incident in Amhara, which has a long-running border dispute with Tigray, has raised concerns that the conflict could extend into a wider war after regional forces were sent to support federal troops.
Meanwhile, the UN has raised concerns about the influx of refugees into Sudan, which it says could destabilise a nation already supporting about a million people displaced from other African countries.
Many of the refugees arriving in Sudan are believed to be children. Aid agencies say an immediate ceasefire would allow them to help thousands of civilians still trapped inside Ethiopia.
Aid agencies are appealing for $50m (Â£38m) for food and shelter for the new arrivals.
**1\. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region.** Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires.
**2\. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site.** The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant.

"**Reports of the mass killing of civilians in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region ""would amount to war crimes"" if confirmed, the UN human rights chief has warned.**
Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in one town.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre.
Its officials have denied involvement.
Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"".
Mr Abiy said that fighters backing Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra, a town in the South West Zone of Tigray.
Witnesses blamed forces loyal to TPLF for Monday's killings - first reported by human rights group Amnesty International.
If confirmed, this would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the fighting between government forces and the TPLF which broke out on 4 November.
Getting information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down.
In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings.
It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident.
Ms Bachelet said she was ""alarmed"" about the situation in Ethiopia, but added that the ""first priority"" was to stop the fighting and prevent further atrocities.
There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state. The tension has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces.
Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen said on Friday that the military operation was going on as expected and would end ""in a very short period of time"".
He added that order had to be restored and ""criminals caught"" before dialogue was possible.
The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
Amnesty said the killings happened on the night of 9 November.
The human rights group said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"".
It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from.
It said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
Civilians were also killed in a government air strike in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, and in the city of Adigrat close to the border with Eritrea, Mr Debretsion told AFP.
""People are running in every corner. So the most important consequence of the conflict currently is displacement. Of course there are casualties, but we don't have the numbers. This is too big to manage,"" he added.
**By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya**
Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut.
There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed.
In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped.
Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders.
On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region.
I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.
As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible.

Ethiopia's prime minister said his forces had liberated an area that had been subject to ""gruesome and fatal attacks"" at the hands of the TPLF.
""Committing crimes and injustice is very normal for the greedy junta,"" Mr Abiy said in a Facebook statement.
Referring to army soldiers he said were shot when their hands and legs were tied, he added, ""the cruelty was heart-breaking"".
Mr Abiy's government later announced it had appointed Mulu Nega Kahsay as an interim administrator for the province as part of its efforts to oust the regional leadership.
His government has also issued arrest warrants for Tigray officials.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"".
He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.
There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray, with Mr Abiy saying government forces had made major gains.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, and ran Tigray.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
However, Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018, while the TPLF refused to dissolve and merge with the other three parties to form the Prosperity Party, as pushed for by the prime minister.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run, but they say they have been unfairly targeted.
The disagreement represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, served in the central government for long periods of time. Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea - but the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked.
Mr Debretsion has accused Eritrean forces of siding with Ethiopia. Ethiopia and Eritrea both deny this.
For his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority."

"**The Ethiopian prime minister, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, has rejected a request for peace talks as the conflict in Tigray deepens.**
Tigray's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael, wrote to the African Union (AU) last week to request talks.
But PM Abiy Ahmed said in a tweet that there would be no dialogue ""until our efforts to ascertain the rule of law are achieved"".
Hundreds have died since the conflict in Ethiopia's northern region erupted.
Last Wednesday, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive after an army base in the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, was taken over by forces loyal to the regional government of Tigray, following months of worsening tension between Tigrayan leaders and the federal government.
On Friday Mr Debretsion wrote to the AU asking for help. The chairman of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, on Monday urged the federal government and the Tigray state authorities to engage in dialogue.
But on Tuesday Mr Ahmed said in a series of tweets that he wanted ""to assure Ethiopians again"" that there would be no dialogue until after rule of law was achieved.
He added: ""Our law enforcement operations in Tigray are proceeding as planned: operations will cease as soon as the criminal junta is disarmed, legitimate administration in the region restored, and fugitives apprehended & brought to justice - all of them rapidly coming within reach.""
In other developments:
It is difficult to say but reports indicate hundreds of deaths on both sides.
The national armed forces have killed 550 Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) fighters, the state broadcaster in Ethiopia has said.
The claim has not been independently verified.
In addition, government forces took control of Humera Airport in Tigray, state media reported on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, 17 military personnel, including senior officials, have been arrested, the federal police say.
They are accused of disrupting communications between the Northern Command and the rest of the national armed forces when the Northern Command was attacked last week.
Residents have fled Tigray.
Officials in Sudan, which shares a border with the Tigray region, say at least 6,000 Ethiopians have arrived in the country.
The Sudanese authorities are preparing for a further 200,000 people to cross in the coming days.
Al Sir Khalid, a commissioner for refugees in Sudan's Kassala state, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that some of those fleeing had walked for two or three days to escape ""bombardment"", and that they included Ethiopian soldiers.
The federal government has cut off the phone lines and internet, Alula Solomon, the director of a Tigray media house based in the US told BBC Newsday.
His family, who live in Tigray the border near Sudan, were able to contact him by using Sudanese telephone lines. They have now fled to Sudan.
On Tuesday, Mr Debretsion accused the neighbouring Eritrean government of launching attacks on the Tigrayan state.
The accusation was denied by both the Eritrean government and the Ethiopian national army.
Mr Abiy won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade conflict with Eritrea, which began when the TPLF dominated the Ethiopian government. Relations between the TPLF and Eritrea remain extremely bad.
The TPLF was the most powerful bit of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after winning power in 2018 on the back of anti-government protests.
Relations got worse last year after Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, which was made up of several ethnically based regional parties.
He merged them into a single, national party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption, and say Mr Abiy is an illegitimate leader, because his mandate ran out when he postponed national elections due to coronavirus.
The simmering row boiled over in September after the TPLF defied the nationwide ban on elections, and held a vote which was declared illegal by the central government.
Mr Abiy won the prize in 2019 for his role in resolving the border conflict with Eritrea.
Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a bitter border war from 1998-2000, which killed tens of thousands of people.
Although a ceasefire was signed in 2000, the neighbours technically remained at war until July 2018, when Mr Abiy and Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki signed a peace deal."
"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."
"**The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has denied accusations made by Ethiopia's army chief that he helped to procure weapons for the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).**
The TPLF is fighting federal troops.
Dr Tedros is Tigrayan and was health minister in a previous Ethiopian government, which was led by the TPLF.
""There have been reports suggesting I am taking sides in this situation. This is not true,"" he wrote on Twitter.
""I want to say that I am on only one side and that is the side of peace,"" he added.
His comments come after Gen Berhanu Jula said in a press conference that Dr Tedros had ""left no stone unturned"" to support the TPLF and help get them weapons. He did not provide any evidence to support his allegations.
Hundreds have died in the conflict in Tigray since the beginning of November.
""My heart breaks for my home, Ethiopia, and I call on all parties to work for peace and to ensure the safety of civilians and access for health and humanitarian assistance,"" Dr Tedros tweeted.
Earlier, Gen Berhanu said: ""We don't expect him to stand on the side of Ethiopians and condemn these people. He has been doing everything to support them, he has campaigned for neighbouring countries to condemn the war,"" said Gen Berhanu.
""He has worked for them to get weapons.""
After being voted in as the head of the WHO in 2017, Dr Tedros became well known at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic and is now arguably the highest-profile Tigrayan abroad.
Meanwhile, US President-elect Joe Biden's foreign policy aide has appealed for both sides to end the fighting.
""Deeply concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, reports of targeted ethnic violence, and the risk to regional peace and security,"" Antony Blinken tweeted.
The UN's refugee agency warns that a full-scale humanitarian crisis is unfolding.
More than 30,000 people have crossed the border from Ethiopia into Sudan.
Thousands of civilians are continuing to flee across the border, the UN Refugee Agency's representative for Sudan, Axel Bisschop told the BBC's Newsday programme.
""I spoke to a banker, some teachers, health workers, and they all say that it was too dangerous to be there... and they left by foot,"" he said.
The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and politics for decades before Abiy Ahmed became prime minister in 2018.
He pushed through major reforms which some say sidelined the TPLF.
The feud escalated in September when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr Abiy called the vote illegal.
Then fighting broke out on 4 November after Ethiopia's central government accused the TPLF of attacking a military base to steal weapons.
The TPLF has denied the attack.

"The UK has had its longest stretch of temperatures exceeding 34C since records began in the 1960s, as warnings of thunderstorms and heavy rain remain in place across the country. The Met Office said the scorching temperatures were recorded in parts of southern England for the sixth day in a row – the first time Britain has experienced such a spell since records started in 1961.  A thunderstorm warning for much of Wales, the West Midlands and parts of the north-west was upgraded to amber on Wednesday evening after severe storms caused disruption in some areas. The Met Office warned that flooding, damage to buildings, travel disruptions and power cuts are to be expected, as well as 30 to 40mm (1.1in to 1.6in) of rainfall in less than an hour in some places. Meanwhile, a yellow thunderstorm warning covers much of England and Wales owing to unsettled conditions caused by the current heatwave. It comes as water firms advised customers in certain areas to restrict their usage in the sweltering conditions. Thames Water urged customers to use water for essential purposes only in the coming days, while Essex and Suffolk Water said that because of “record water demand” it was working to maintain supplies but users could notice lower than normal pressure. Temperatures reached 34.6C in St James’s park in central London on Wednesday, marking the first time since at least 1961 that there have been six consecutive days of 34C and above. It was also the third day in a row of the mercury hitting 35C or above across the UK, with Wednesday’s highest temperature of 35.4C recorded at Heathrow, according to the Met Office. Forecaster Greg Dewhurst told PA Media: “It’s not often we get temperatures this high over several days, and that is triggering thunderstorms across parts of England and Wales. “If rain is falling on places that have been quite hot and dry, and the ground is quite hard, the rain doesn’t have anywhere to go, and from that we can see flash flooding.” Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue Service said it was experiencing “high call volumes” due to bad weather and had been made aware of flash flooding in Gloucester on Wednesday evening. “Whilst the bad weather continues, please be careful and only travel if absolutely necessary and with extreme caution,” it tweeted. Elsewhere, Cheshire police said on Twitter they were dealing with a number of weather-related incidents in the village of Tarporley, including fallen trees and flash flooding, and advised nearby residents to avoid all but essential travel. Some 10 flood alerts covering areas in the West Midlands were issued by the Environment Agency on Wednesday evening, while three flood warnings were in place – meaning immediate action is required. Two of the warnings, which indicate flooding is expected, cover the River Trent, while third was issued for Sandyford Brook in Stafford. Severe storms could cause 30 to 40mm of rain to fall in less than an hour in some places, which would follow the heavy downpours that lashed large parts of Scotland and caused flooding on Tuesday evening. Three people died in a train derailment near Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire after a ScotRail service crashed on Wednesday after heavy rain and flooding. The train’s driver and conductor and a passenger were killed and six people were injured. Perth and Kinross, the Lothians, Forth Valley and the north-east were among the most affected by overnight lightning strikes and heavy rain. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed it was called to multiple reports of flooding in the Perthshire area, affecting many properties. Vehicles were recovered from busy roads after they were abandoned and there were reports of internet services being disrupted. Thunderstorms are expected to clear overnight, while temperatures could remain above 20C for “warm and humid” conditions, according to Dewhurst. “Parts of the UK will see some very heavy thunderstorms with torrential rainfall and a chance of flash flooding from Wednesday, this could result in landslides and problems with travel,” added Met Office forecaster Bonnie Diamond. “Yellow thunderstorm warnings will remain in place until Sunday, affecting most of the UK.” Similar conditions were expected to be seen in parts of Northern Ireland, England and Wales from Wednesday afternoon, with drivers warned of delays on the roads caused by standing water. Police forces and the RNLI have warned about the dangers of entering water after the heatwave led to a number of weather-related accidents across the country over the past week. Following a grey start to Thursday, there will be sunny spells across much of the country with maximum temperatures of up to 32C in the south-east of England. “It’s still going to be warm and humid and that could then trigger some thunderstorms across parts of England and Wales through the afternoon and evening tomorrow,” Dewhurst said. A yellow thunderstorm warning which covers the majority of England, excluding parts of the north-east, has been issued by the Met Office for Thursday. Further unsettled weather is predicted throughout the afternoon and evening. Dewhurst added: “Generally, the rest of the week remains unsettled with showers, some of them thundery and heavy, but there will still be some warm, sunny spells at times too.” • This article was amended on 14 August 2020 to clarify that the record-breaking stretch of temperatures exceeding 34C was not since 1961, but since records began that year."

To commemorate Henry David Thoreau’s 200th birthday on July 12, the _New York Times_ last week featured an essay by historian Douglas Brinkley based on a complete misinterpretation of one of Thoreau’s most famous quotes: “In Wildness is the preservation of the world.”



Brinkley equates “wildness” with “wilderness,” thereby connecting Thoreau with today’s environmental movement. While that’s a mistake I myself once made, in fact that is not what Thoreau meant at all.



Thoreau used the phrase in an 1851 lecture called “Walking” that was reprinted by the _Atlantic Monthly_ in 1862. The lecture mentions both _wildness_ and _wilderness_ and it is clear they have two different meanings.





Thoreau understood something about government that today’s environmental leaders have forgotten: government itself is the greatest threat to the wildness, the human individuality, and the freedom that Thoreau cherished and most Americans still cherish today.



Thoreau would agree with today’s environmentalists that _wilderness_ is a state of nature, but he uses _wildness_ to refer instead to a state of humanity. The lecture encourages people to be wild, which he equates with “absolute freedom” as opposed to the limited freedom available in a “culture merely civil.”



Brinkley cites a variety of political and environmental leaders, including Theodore Roosevelt, John Kennedy, John Muir, and David Brower, who were inspired by Thoreau in general and this misinterpretation in particular to support government actions creating national parks, monuments, and wilderness areas. Yet it is not clear that Thoreau himself would have supported those actions, and it is absolutely clear that he would have opposed many policies promoted by environmentalists today.



This is important because Thoreau understood something about government that today’s environmental leaders have forgotten: government itself is the greatest threat to the wildness, the human individuality, and the freedom that Thoreau cherished and most Americans still cherish today. In their seemingly desperate efforts to preserve things that are often relatively abundant, today’s environmentalists are willing to sacrifice that individuality and freedom.



The whole idea behind wilderness and national parks is to freeze nature in one particular state. Yet Thoreau’s most important scientific discovery was the theory of ecological succession, the idea that ecosystems are continuously changing. As modern‐​day ecologist Daniel Botkin says, “There is no balance of nature, but we keep acting as if there was.”



Where today’s environmentalists regard wilderness as something separated from people, Thoreau saw people as “a part and parcel of nature,” and he valued nature and wilderness not just as ends in themselves but as ways for people to express their wildness or freedom.



Thoreau would have supported private efforts to preserve natural areas, such as the Trustees for Reservations in Massachusetts or Save the Redwoods League in California. Private property is the basis of capitalism, and unlike today’s environmentalists who are often skeptical of capitalism, Thoreau relished it.



“What recommends commerce to me is its enterprise and bravery,” he said. “It does not clasp its hands and pray to Jupiter.” In other words, it is wild, and it is more likely that he would admire wild capitalists such as Richard Branson and Steve Jobs than communitarian environmentalists such as David Brower or current Sierra Club leader Michael Brune.



Thoreau was less likely to have supported programs setting aside government land as wilderness, as he was deeply suspicious of government. “Government never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of the way,” he said.



He would have absolutely opposed government regulation of private land, such as the Endangered Species Act or state land‐​use laws, aimed at protecting wildlife, scenery, farm lands, or other supposedly public values. Government regulators, he wrote, “deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons who put obstructions on the railroads.” Thoreau well knew what today’s environmentalists have forgotten: that when you give a government power over others in the name of “the greater good,” that government quickly becomes a dictatorship.



So the next time you read, “In Wildness is the preservation of the world,” don’t substitute the term _wilderness_ for _wildness_. Instead, substitute the word _freedom_ and understand that efforts to restrict freedom in the name of some greater good, whether open space, wildlife, or climate, are the greatest threat to the world.

Fifteen years ago, how many Americans or Bulgarians would have imagined that in 2003 Bulgaria would be one of America’s closest allies in Europe, that Bulgarian and American troops would be serving together in Iraq and that Bulgaria would have a smartly growing market economy? 



How did this change from Cold War enemies to new NATO allies come about, and will the good economic news from Bulgaria continue? 



Bulgaria overthrew its last communist dictator in November 1989. Early in 1990, I was invited by the Bulgarian government to become the co‐​chairman of the Bulgarian economic transition project. We assembled a group of U.S. economic, legal and industry experts and, working with our Bulgarian counterparts, developed a plan to move Bulgaria from a communist country to a free‐​market, democratic, capitalist one. The plan, which even included a proposed constitution and updated commercial code, was submitted to the Bulgarian people, government and parliament in October 1990. 



Unfortunately, few economic reforms were made because Bulgaria suffered a series of weak coalition governments and a chaotic political situation in the early 1990s. The so‐​called reformed socialists made a comeback in 1994, but were a thoroughly corrupt gang that looted the country and left it with hyperinflation. A second Bulgarian revolution took place in 1997 that ultimately installed a free‐​market‐​leaning democratic government. 



A major reform was made with the installation of a currency board in 1997 that tied the value of the Bulgaria currency to the German mark (and now the euro). Back in 1990, our transition team had recommended that Bulgaria establish a currency board. Unfortunately, it took a second bout of hyperinflation to finally convince the political forces we had been correct. The currency board has been an almost unqualified success, giving Bulgaria six years of currency stability. 



Two and half years ago, the former Bulgarian King, Simeon Saxe‐​Coburg‐​Gotha (who was exiled by the communists when he was a child) returned and ran for prime minister. He was elected and has continued much of the economic reform program of his immediate predecessors. The result has been an economy growing by about 5 percent annually. However, despite the good economic news, the former king did suffer a defeat in the local elections last month, probably due to having over‐​promised how quickly most people would see their standard of living improve. 



Despite continuing problems with corruption, particularly in the judicial system, there are now many reasons for optimism about Bulgaria. The country has a brilliant and very able young finance minister, Milen Velchev, who has managed to not only balance the budget but begin to pay down Bulgaria’s debt. The government has just introduced a flat 19 percent corporate tax rate (far lower than the U.S. rate of 35 percent, and lower than in most European Union countries), which will encourage much more foreign and domestic investment and, ultimately, many new well‐​paying jobs. 



We, Americans who served as economic advisers in the early days of the transition, were naive about how difficult it would be for the Bulgarians to adopt our proposed reforms. Bulgaria had become a highly corrupt society, like other countries that suffered under communism. Even though most Bulgarians understood that communism and socialism did not work, they did not fully appreciate that for a capitalistic society to succeed, it was necessary to have honest courts that protect private property and that the people need to fulfill their contractual agreements. 



We foreign advisers stressed privatization, tax and regulatory reform, free markets, free trade and sound money. We should have given more emphasis to the rule of law and the importance of honesty in all business relationships in order to have a properly functioning economy and civil society. 



The critical mass of economic reforms and institutions have now been put in place, even though there is still much left to do. The first free‐​market think tank in Bulgaria, the Institute for Market Economy, was established in 1992. The most recent policy institute is the Bulgarian Council for Capital Formation, co‐​chaired by an American, Mark Bloomfield, who was a member of our original transition team. 



Bulgaria should be a prosperous country. It has rich agricultural land, natural resources, great scenic beauty, a pleasant climate, and a well educated, talented population. The bet is, with its entry into NATO, preparation for entry into the EU, and continued economic reform, Bulgaria will grow even more rapidly and finally fulfill its potential as an affluent, free and civil society.

"The Carbon Sense Coalition today claimed that mis-guided government policies on global warming were going to cause a crisis in food.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that subsidising ethanol, taxing carbon fuels and covering grasslands and farms with trees would cause massive dislocation of rural industries and shortages and runaway prices for food.

“The ethanol swindle has sucked in many people, but the costs will far exceed the benefits. Demand for ethanol feedstock has already caused massive increases in prices for corn in USA and similar things will happen with sorghum and sugar in Australia. If the current foolish policies persist, these problems will also infect the soy industry, palm oils and other grains.
“Australian taxpayers will subsidise a huge ethanol plant being built at Dalby which will gobble 500 tonnes of grains per day – that is a lot of chook feed.
“Rising prices for grains, sugar and soy will feed through into higher prices for all food produced in farms, feedlots and factories. Beef, lamb, dairy products, chicken, eggs, breakfast cereals, bread and confectionery will all become more expensive, to the detriment of every consumer. The biofuels mania has caused price increases for pasta in Italy, cornflakes in Kansas, tortillas in Mexico and croissants in Paris.
“According to a recent EU report: ‘The current push to expand the use of biofuels is creating unsustainable tensions that will disrupt markets without generating significant environmental benefits’.
“Ethanol contains less energy than is used to produce it. Making alcohol from corn is a good way to make whiskey, but a terrible way to make motor spirit.
“Moreover, to produce one litre of ethanol uses 4 litres of water, so ethanol plants will cause increases in the prices of both food and water.
“Naturally there are vocal beneficiaries of the ethanol boom, but the net cost to the whole community will be negative – it will always be cheaper to produce motor fuel from oil or coal than to use fossil fuels to produce organic fuels via ethanol.
“We should plant our seed corn, not turn it into motor fuel. Burning food for fuel is a very fuelish policy. What do we do as an encore? Pay subsidies to oil companies to produce pizzas from petroleum?
“Even more foolish than subsidising ethanol is the process whereby people are encouraged to evade carbon taxes by planting trees.
“These force fed forests will result in a creeping infestation of woody weeds into land currently producing grass, pastures and crops.
“If some extremists had their way, Australia would become a monoculture of unproductive eucalypts, which are rightly regarded as invasive weeds in other countries. And the rules for carbon credits will probably dictate that they stay there forever, becoming a haven for feral pests and weeds and a magnet for bushfires.
“There is a place for trees in any productive landscape, and previous stupid government policies caused excessive clearing of trees on government controlled leasehold land. But banning all land clearing and subsidising tree planting is just as stupid.
“Farm forestry or wildlife refuges should be allowed to flourish on a fair basis alongside all other land businesses – none should receive discriminatory tax breaks. Well managed grasslands can extract just as much carbon from the air as will tree plantations (unless the trees are harvested and turned into timber houses).
“The final stupid food policy will be carbon taxes, which will push up the already high costs for fuel and power for every farming operation. Soaring prices for diesel, petrol and electricity will escalate the cost of operating tractors, harvesters, trucks, dozers, road trains, water pumps, feedlots, food processing plants and supermarkets. The end result will be seen at every checkout.
“The world has always depended for most of its food on great grasslands of Australia, the savannas of South America, the prairies of North America and the farmlands on the European plain. And the key food resource is the native and domesticated cereals and grasses and the grazing animals that live in harmony with them. Turning these ancient grasslands into forests will have far reaching and costly consequences.
“All of this is justified to calm a world hysteria about the modern era of global warming which started long before man started burning fossil fuels and will continue to rise or fall irrespective of what puny vote-seeking politicians do.
“Despite the recent Ignobel awards to Al Gore, more and more independent scientists are concluding that the facts and the evidence do not support the hysterical claims that the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere by mankind will cause runaway warming.
“A Judge in Britain got it right recently when he called Gore’s film a biased political document with eleven specific claims not supported by any evidence.
“Politicians are about to inflict huge Greenhouse costs on the whole community, for nothing.”

"There’s a scene in Fight for Planet A that is both absurd and thrilling. The host, Craig Reucassel, has tracked down the prime minister, Scott Morrison, at an event at a Sydney beach. A pile of black balloons representing Australia’s carbon emissions have been attached to the back of his shirt and as he runs down the beach chasing Morrison, one really does wonder if he’ll just lift off and float away. The prime minister’s minders stop Reucassel before he can tackle the prime minister who, in bare feet and boardshorts, is walking away as quick as you can in soft sand. But the metaphor is obvious: Morrison does not want to engage with Australia’s outsized emissions problem. Over three episodes, the team that made the ABC’s highly successful War on Waste delve into the more abstract but urgent issue of carbon emissions, and with it a vital question: how do you convince Australians that something they cannot see represents their greatest existential threat?  Fight for Planet A uses balloons to give Australia’s emissions a visual representation, and right from the first episode, we’re left in no doubt that there are too many of them. But what to do about it? And do we have the bandwidth to deal with the climate crisis now given everything else that’s going on in the world? The onset of the coronavirus pandemic initially meant the air date for the show, which was filmed last year, was pushed back from June to August. Stephen Oliver, manager of documentaries at the ABC, thinks that now is the time to get the climate back on the agenda. “No one knew how long the pandemic would last, how serious it would be, how it would change people’s psychology. It’s still bad, but to some extent, with the exception of the situation in Melbourne, we have come to terms with it,” he says. And although global lockdowns have caused emissions to plummet, it is long-term behaviour and policy change that will make a difference in the long term. So how do we make that happen? Fight for Planet A is a solutions-based show that aims to empower viewers to cut their own emissions at home and in their communities. By way of example, five Australian households were chosen to take on the show’s “climate challenge” to reduce the carbon emissions generated by the energy they used, their modes of transport and their food production. Can the wealthy family with underfloor heating and a massive TV for their pets cut their electricity bill? Can the share house of five blokes use less hot water and skateboard to uni instead of driving an old banger? Those strategies for individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint include everything from changing showerheads so less water is used, to ditching the car, to switching to solar panels. There’s a good segment on how easy it is to cut emissions in schools by turning off power points at the end of the day. Other solutions are more expensive and thus more difficult – such as trading in your old fossil-fuel-guzzling car for an electric vehicle (the cheapest in Australia starts at around $50,000). When asked if a lot of the individual environmental fixes are geared towards the rich, Reucassel told Guardian Australia: “People who are wealthier – say, in the top 50% of income – have a larger carbon footprint. They travel more, their houses are bigger, they use more energy. We need to call on the rich people first – we shouldn’t be putting more of the burden on poorer people.” But does all this community and individual empowerment let the government and big business off the hook? Reucassel says: “I wouldn’t have done this show if it had only been about individual change. But people becoming involved and interested in an issue changes the political debate and more strongly influences the business debate. We can underestimate the role that the public can take in leading.” Councils too have proven to be proactive when it comes to grassroots climate action, says Reucassel, “much more so than leadership at a federal level, which tends to be really depressing”. “Unlike coronavirus, we know the solutions to climate change,” says Oliver. “We can actually do something about climate change, whereas with the pandemic we’re sitting there waiting for the experts to find a vaccine. We wear a mask and stay distant but we’re not actually solving the problem, we’re waiting for experts to solve the problem. “But we can all solve the problem of climate change. This is empowering. We can give people solutions rather than just bunker down waiting for more horror to hit us.” “The hardest part is getting people to visualise emissions,” says Reucassel. But knowledge is power. “In Australia, change is up against far more vested interests – that’s why we need a population that is knowledgeable and engaged.” Oliver agrees. “It’s about getting people to be more engaged in the issue instead of feeling a bit angry and hopeless. If you only focus on the big corporations and the government you can get angry, frustrated and just kind of retreat from the conversation.” • Fight for Planet A is showing on ABC on Tuesdays at 8.30pm"

The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Joseph Biden (D‐​Del.), recently claimed that an American‐​led nation‐​building effort in Central and South Asia is the long‐​term solution to the terrorism problem. For Biden, this nation‐​building effort should focus on changing the economic and social climate of Afghanistan and its neighbors, and include something akin to the Marshall Plan’s reconstruction of Europe after World War II. Besides setting an awkward precedent — that harboring terrorists will eventually bring new roads and heaps of foreign aid — Biden’s nation‐​building recommendation overlooks the obvious: Postwar Afghanistan will look nothing like postwar Germany, or for that matter, postwar Japan.



For starters, the high level of education and industrial know‐​how in postwar Germany and Japan helped launch an economic recovery in both countries that is inconceivable almost anywhere else. Germany also had a strong tradition of the rule of law, property rights, and free trade before the Nazi era. Japan’s elite embraced an honorific culture that respected and obeyed the wishes of the victor in battle. Afghanistan and its neighbors, in contrast, have little in the way of either liberal traditions or cultural attitudes that are agreeable to massive foreign interference.



What’s more, the leaders of Germany and Japan were not just utterly defeated in war. Their ideology was totally discredited in the eyes of their own people by war’s end. This made both countries prime candidates for nation building. It’s premature to assume the same pattern will hold for the leaders of the Taliban. Radical Islam could remain dominant, and its defenders could be seen as national heroes or martyrs.



Another probable difference: Even before World War II ended, the Germans and Japanese had become amenable to Washington’s policy prescriptions. In fact, according to University of Illinois political scientist Richard Merritt, by the time the war ended, substantial numbers of Germans “were disgusted by what the Nazis had done and increasingly realized that Nazi actions were not accidental but were consistent with and even prefigured by Nazi ideology.… To some measure, then, the American Military Government enjoyed a ready market for its product.” By the end of the war the Japanese, too, had become receptive to profound political change in ways not replicated since.



There’s little evidence the United States will enjoy a “ready market” for its product in Afghanistan. History, in fact, points in the opposite direction. The Afghans did not attack Moscow’s puppet regime in Kabul and fight a war with Soviet invaders in the 1980s because they wanted democracy, liberalism, and free markets. They did it because they opposed forces trying to secularize and modernize their country; i.e., nation build. This presents a major problem for those who would equate nation building in Afghanistan with nation building in postwar Germany or Japan.



Or take Biden’s idea of a Marshall Plan. It is telling that one has to go back more than 50 years to find an example of such a scheme that worked. Similar plans since then have routinely failed. Indeed, since World War II the United States alone has provided $1 trillion in foreign aid to countries around the world. The result? According to the United Nations, 70 of the countries that received aid are poorer today than they were in 1980, and an incredible 43 are worse off than in 1970. Good intentions must be matched by an effective, non‐​corrupt administration on the receiving end.



The failures are not so surprising if one studies the Marshall Plan experience in detail. If massive government spending could work anywhere, it was in 1948 Europe: Skilled labor was largely available, the rule of law and property rights had a long history, and the customs of a commercial society were recoverable. All it needed was physical capital. But even under those circumstances, there is no real evidence that the Marshall Plan alone was responsible for Europe’s regeneration. U.S. assistance never exceeded 5 percent of the GDP of any recipient nation, and there seemed to be an inverse relationship between economic aid and economic recovery. In fact, France, Germany, and Italy all began to grow before the onset of the Marshall Plan, and Great Britain, the largest recipient of aid, performed the most poorly.



The real lesson of the Marshall Plan is that the rule of law, property rights, free markets, and an entrepreneurial culture are what are necessary for economic success. Afghanistan has none of these things. And well‐​meaning senators in Washington can’t make it otherwise.

"By Emeritus Professor Lance Endersbee, AO.
The accompanying paper, Climate Change is Nothing New [PDF, 1.2MB], was published in the March 2007 issue of the journal, New Concepts in Global Tectonics (http://www.ncgt.org/).
I was invited to prepare the paper by the Editor as a scientific response to the IPCC report, Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, Summary for Policy Makers, issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, February 2007. The paper can also be regarded as a response to the movie by Al Gore, and to the report on carbon trading by the London financier, Sir Nicholas Stern.
The key points of the paper are:-


The Earth, the Sun, and indeed the Cosmos, comprise an inter-acting, dynamic, and evolving system. It is all in a state of continuing change. There is no steady state. In contrast, the IPCC assumes that the Earth was in a steady state until 250 years ago, which was upset by Man through increasing use of carbon fuels, and that led to atmospheric changes and consequential global warming.
In geological time, the climate of the Earth has been influenced by the immediate environment of the solar system as it travels through our Milky Way Galaxy. There were times when the solar system was enveloped in vast clouds of gas and dust, causing extreme cooling on Earth, and ice ages lasting for millions of years. In recent times the solar system has been travelling through space that is virtually empty, enabling a benign climate in which our civilization has flourished.
The Sun is the dominating influence on the climate of the Earth. That simple fact is not recognised by IPCC. The Sun is a churning, quivering body of hot plasma, generating intense electromagnetic fields in space that envelop the Earth. The electromagnetic behaviour of the Sun dominates and determines the electromagnetic and geotectonic response of the Earth, and thereby climate.
The climate of the earth has always changed. There have been times lasting centuries when the Earth was warmer or colder than now. The period of 500 years from 800 to 1300 AD was warmer. It brought prosperity to Europe. It is known as the Medieval Warm Period. Many great cathedrals were built, the Vikings discovered a verdant land they called Greenland, and there were vineyards in England. After that, for the next 450 years from 1300 to 1750 AD, Europe experienced a progressively colder climate. It is known as the Little Ice Age. It was especially cold for 100 years from 1600 to 1700 AD, when there was famine and starvation in the northern parts of Europe. In London, the River Thames often froze in winter.
A key part of the IPCC report is the presentation of evidence of parallel increases in both global temperatures and levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is claimed by IPCC that the increased carbon dioxide emitted by Man is causing global warming. In my paper it is shown that the cause and effect relation is exactly the opposite; that natural global warming has caused an increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, simply because of the reduction in solubility of carbon dioxide in sea water with increasing sea temperatures.
It is the vast surface area of the oceans that determines the interchange of gases between the oceans and the atmosphere. The oceans breathe carbon dioxide and methane in and out with the seasons, and the oceans release carbon dioxide and methane with the natural warming caused by the Sun. If in the future there is a significant decrease in the electromagnetic radiation from the Sun, the Earth will cool down, and the levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere will then decline.
IPCC refers to a rise in sea levels over the past century as evidence of global warming caused by Man. I show that the rise is due to the great exploitation of non-rechargeable groundwater over the past century which has led to a net addition to the hydrosphere, and thereby, the oceans.
Air pollution and global warming are scientifically separate issues. Global warming is natural and global. Atmospheric pollution is man-made and mostly close to the sources of emission. The IPCC have locked themselves into a scientifically untenable position by interweaving air pollution and global warming.
The deadly pollution of dust, acid gases, and water vapour entering the atmosphere in many cities of the world should be the focus of action. A large number of cities are most unhealthy places, with a lower expectation of life. The problems are not global but local. The correction of the problems must be industry and city-centred.
Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, it is essential to all life. There is no need for carbon trading or geosequestration. The concept of carbon trading has been advocated by IPCC, and by many governments signing the Kyoto agreement, and is being welcomed by the financial community. But carbon trading has not arisen from the normal operation of the market. It is the result of fears about global warming created by IPCC and others. It thereby presents risks to investors. If it comes to be recognised that global warming has a natural cause, and the fears subside, the value of carbon credits will then drop to zero, and the market in carbon trading will collapse.

http://www.antarctica.gov.au/news/2016/aurora-australis-successfully-refloated
===================================
Schneefan at German skeptic site wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de here writes about how yet another ice-breaker has gotten stuck in summertime Antarctic sea ice.
The Antarctic “Aurora Australis” with 68 people on board became stranded in sea ice in the West Arm in Horseshoe Harbour last Wednesday, and rescue efforts were prevented by a snowstorm. According to reports that the ship’s rump has a tear, but its structural integrity is thought not to be at risk.

For some readers the Aurora Australis may ring a bell. This is because it is the ice breaker that ultimately helped rescue the 52-person crew on board the sea-ice trapped research vessel Akademik Shokalskiy which ferried a global warming/polar ice melt expedition led by a hapless Prof. Chris Turney back in early 2014. That expedition devolved into a highly publicized folly attracting much worldwide ridicule. Eventually a helicopter from the Chinese ice breaker Xue Long succeeded ferrying Turney and his crew to safety.
Today the German Handelsblatt here reports that 37 scientists on board the Aurora Australis were rescued on Friday and that the remaining crew has stayed on board in order to try to free the injured ship.
Schneefan writes that it should be clear to global warming/polar researchers that sea ice at the South Pole is not melting, but has in fact been growing for 37 years!

Arctic sea ice, surrounded by large land masses has, on the other hand, been declining:

We all know there are some very unintelligent people roaming this earth. I mean we have a Labour-led coalition for goodness sake so that’s proof positive that there is at least a discernible lack of joined-up thinking going on amongst a large portion of the people we share our space with.



We have people who thought Winston might be a good handbrake to National’s fourth term excesses, and drongoes like has-been actress Rose McGowan who [apologised ](https://pluralist.com/rose-mcgowan-apologizes-iran/)to Iran on behalf of Americans because their Orange Man was so mean to them blowing up their most revered, lovable and most successful General.



But I think they all pale into insignificance when compared with the _‘high number’_ of dimwits who called Auckland emergency services on 111 to let them know that the sky was a bit yellow!



There were so many of these retards that Police had to issue a statement asking people not to call them and to keep the line clear for emergencies only. 



I wonder what sort of response they were expecting? You can imagine how those calls go? 



_Triple One Emergency, do you require Police, Fire or Ambulance?_



Umm, I’m not sure, I just wanted to tell you that the sky looks a bit weird. 



_Ok, ahh, what emergency service do you require?_



Umm, I don’t know what you mean, you need to do something. 



_‘What exactly do you want us to do?_



Umm, I don’t know, I just, Umm, I just thought that you should, you-know, know that the sky is kind of orange. It’s like, I dunno, is it because Trump killed Iran?



So this got me thinking. The people ringing emergency services for this kind of rubbish are probably mostly of voting age. These nincompoops get to have a say in deciding who runs our country. How many votes really should have been discounted and removed from the tally last election due to the voter not being of sufficient intelligence to make an informed choice? How many votes were cast for made-up candidates like Batman, Mickey Mouse or Jesus? 



Surely everyone who shows disdain for the voting process by frivolously wasting their precious vote should be identified and banned from exercising this most important of duties until they can show they are grown up enough to take their role seriously. 



I think a compulsory **“I’m too stupid to vote”** filter should also be required to be added to their Facebook and Twitter pages.



The left of course, think that we should lower the voting age to sixteen! This is utter madness. Hell, I was playing Cards Against Humanity with a 15-year-old this week and she was so immature, she couldn’t even force herself to say the word ‘penis’ out loud, so quite how she was going to be able to digest the intricacies of figuring out who deserves her vote at the next election I have no idea. 



And she is an intelligent kid. I am certain that she is about one thousand times more intelligent than all of these 111 calling numpties put together.



So please, don’t waste your vote this year. And if you look out the window just now and see that the sky is a different colour to last week and think that the good folk at the other end of the 111 line should really hear about it, just go to your bedroom, pop your head under the duvet, and come out again in a few days as everything will be ok and back to normal by then.



Oh, and it’s not caused by bloody climate change, it’s caused by rampant ideological Green fascists who value the lives of gnats over humans. Well, I mean that and arsonists.

It is **unequivocal** that it is **very likely**.



Everything the IPCC says must be true as there is an appeal to authority further down the page:



The Panel is made up of 2500+ scientific expert reviewers, 800+ contributing authors,  
and 450+ lead authors from 130+ countries.



Can’t argue with those numbers!



So let’s check on the [principles governing](https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/ipcc-principles/ipcc-principles.pdf) the IPCC shall we?



The role of the IPCC is to assess on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of **human-induced climate change,** its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation. 



If one only looks for human-induced, aka man-made, aka anthropogenic, climate change, take a wild guess at what you are going to find.

Green Folly closed forest tracks and gates, expelled foresters and timber-workers and prevented property owners from removing flammable fuel from their own land and adjacent roads, parks and forests. Those responsible for these follies should face Class Action.



Green Folly promotes electric vehicles but not one fire truck, dozer, water bomber, helicopter, ambulance or naval vessel ran on batteries. They all used hydro-carbon fuels – diesel, petrol or avgas. And with so many power lines down, electric toys could not have recharged their batteries anyway.



Green Folly believed that widely scattered wind turbines, solar panels and their spider-webs of transmission lines would continue to produce power in gale-force firestorms and thick smoke. Many will be burnt. Blackouts are inevitable.



Green Folly promotes “green” building materials like timber which adds fuel to fires while using fake CO2 scares to denigrate steel and concrete which won’t burn.



For decades, Green Folly opposed every new dam proposal and wasted stored water on another Green Folly – “Environmental Flows”. Dams were emptied, farmers suffered, towns ran out of water, food prices increased and some fire-fighting water bombers had to take water from private dams.



It was criminal Green Folly that babbled on about “the Climate Emergency” while they sponsored forest conditions that caused agonizing deaths for so many innocents – residents, firefighters, live-stock, koalas and other native animals, birds and insects.



Australia cannot afford any more Green Follies.



Politicians must stop sacrificing Australians on the Green altar.

I’d like to thank the members of the subcommittee on energy research, development, production, and regulation and the subcommittee on national economic growth, natural resources and regulatory affairs for the opportunity to testify today on the administration’s compliance with statutory requirements relating to their budget requests to address global climate change.



My remarks today will examine the administration’s compliance with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 as it relates to global climate change programs in this year’s budget request, primarily the budget requests of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In sum, I believe that the administration is not in compliance with the stipulations of that Act. In particular:



 **Introduction to the GPRA**



The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 directs federal agencies to offer “objective, quantifiable, and measurable” goals for each of their appropriation accounts during the budget process. It was enacted to “systematically hold federal agencies accountable for achieving program results.” The Act is ambitious. It attempts to promote, when possible, real‐​time budget accountability that the public can grasp. As The National Journal explains, the GPRA requires “specific performance measurers [such] as increasing the lead time on tornado warnings from 8 minutes in 1994 to 11 minutes in 1997, with accuracy growing from 53 to 66 percent.”



In sum, the GPRA demands that performance measures be specific, quantifiable, measurable, and directly connected when possible to the well being of the American people. As President Clinton remarked when he signed the Act into law, we need to ask:



“Does this work? Is it changing people’s lives for the better? Can we say after we take money and put it into a certain endeavor that it was worth actually [taking] away from the taxpayers [and putting] into this endeavor and [that] their lives are better [sic]? These may seem like simple questions, but for decades they haven’t been answered in a very satisfactory way. We are determined to do that.1



 **Federal Climate Change Expenditures and Performance Metrics**



Rather than provide performance and results measures for each appropriations account, the administration in its April 20, 1999 report to Congress offers performance and results metrics on a program‐​by‐​program basis. This makes it difficult to examine the performance metric for any specific appropriations account given that each appropriations account is typically involved in a myriad of programs. Accountability thus suffers and outside analysts are largely unable to zero‐​in on specific budgetary successes and failures. This alone should be a red flag to lawmakers that something is amiss.



That having been said, the administration chooses to organize its activities to address global climate change in four major programs: the Climate Change Technology Initiative (CCTI); the U.S. Global Change Research Program; International Assistance programs; and other more tangentially climate‐​related programs. I briefly discuss the three DOE-EPA related program elements below.



 _Climate Change Technology Initiative_



The CCTI is made up of an amalgamation of tax credits for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments, energy efficiency and renewable energy R&D, labeling and public awareness programs, demonstration projects, industry subsidies, and regulatory programs to mandate tighter energy efficiency standards for appliances and machine equipment. Five separate cabinet departments and over a dozen appropriation accounts are involved in the CCTI.2



Instead of providing performance and results measures for each of the appropriations accounts engaged in the CCTI, the administration provides performance and results measures for each industrial sector targeted by the CCTI. The administration primarily suggests that increases in energy efficiency will be the main program output of the CCTI. It then calculates how many tons of carbon emissions will be saved by this increased efficiency.



According to the administration, the EPA’s activities will reduce energy consumption by approximately 59 billion‐​kilowatt hours and thereby reduce greenhouse gases by 58 million metric tons of carbon equivalent next year. By 2010, the administration suggests that those programs will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 354 million metric tons of carbon equivalent. Likewise, the administration believes that DOE’s activities will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 112 million metric tons of carbon equivalent by the year 2010.



 _U.S. Global Change Research Program_



The U.S. Global Change Research Program involves six separate cabinet departments (the Department of Health and Human Services, DOE, USDA, the Department of Commerce, the Department of the Interior, and EPA) and three agencies (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, and the Smithsonian Institution). Virtually no concrete performance or result measures are provided by the administration for the various activities of this program, much less for the various appropriation accounts of the DOE (biological and environmental research) or the EPA (general science and technology work).



 _Other Climate‐​Related Programs_



The DOE and EPA are engaged in a host of disparate programs that the administration considers related to global climate change. DOE programs include the Weatherization Assistance Program (which subsidizes energy efficiency investment for low income households) and general R&D directed to coal, natural gas, and nuclear technologies, and the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. EPA programs include the Clean Air Partnership Fund. Myriad appropriation accounts are involved from both agencies, yet no concrete performance or result measures are provided by the administration for the various activities of this program, much less for the various appropriation accounts of the DOE or the EPA.



 **Inappropriate Performance and Results Measures**



There are so many problems with the performance and results measures offered by both the DOE and EPA that it’s difficult to know where to begin. I will start with the smaller problems first.



 _No Third‐​Party Verification is Possible_



Congress will find it impossible to ascertain whether the administration’s performance goals have been met because both the DOE and EPA rely heavily upon conjecture, assertions, and theoretical — not actual — measurements of performance.



First, the administration relies upon engineering calculations to estimate energy savings for the technologies it claims responsibility for in the marketplace. The actual performance of technologies is unexamined. Numerous studies at the state and local level demonstrate that engineering calculations are wildly inaccurate predictors of the performance of technologies.3 Indeed, they typically overestimate energy savings by a large degree.



Second, DOE and EPA programs implicitly assume that, were it not for those programs, the worthy technologies being subsidized would not attract enough research, development, or marketing dollars to penetrate the marketplace. In other words, both departments take full responsibility and credit for the technologies being promoted. This, of course, ignores the possibility that “free riders” are being attracted to the programs (it’s certainly possible that some of the technologies in question would have been produced by the market without government help; perhaps immediately, perhaps only a few years down the road), or that the federal assistance perhaps contributed only at the margin and thus is due only a small part of the credit and not the full degree of credit sought by the DOE and EPA. In fact, when the U.S. General Accounting Office reviewed a recent document by the DOE regarding its R&D success stories, it found that such faulty assumptions destroyed the credibility of DOE cost benefit analyses.4



The Energy Information Administration recognizes the difficulty of connecting government R&D subsidies to concrete performance goals. In testimony last month, EIA administrator Jay Hakes frankly conceded that “we are not able to link research and development expenditures directly to program results or to separate impacts of incremental funding requested for FY 2000 from ongoing government expenditures.“5 Likewise, Hakes noted that “it is also difficult to analyze the impacts of information programs, voluntary initiatives, and partnerships on realized technology development and deployment.“6



Thus, Congress will find it impossible to verify whether most CCTI programs actually achieved the goals laid out by the administration.



 _Flawed Cost‐​Benefit Analysis_



While the GPRA does not require cost‐​benefit analysis for appropriation accounts, the administration frequently offers benefit estimates for the various programs of the CCTI. Typical is the administration’s claim that a 20 percent tax credit to encourage the purchase of residential electric heat pumps and air conditioners will benefit the economy by encouraging investments that will ultimately save consumers billions of dollars in energy costs.



The claim is misleading because it is divorced from any discussion of the investment required to obtain those energy savings. For instance, the EIA estimates that the cost of a current model heat pump is $4,400 while the cost of a model that would qualify for the tax credit is $5,500 (the 20 percent tax credit would, conveniently enough, cover the differential in cost). EIA data suggests that the energy‐​efficient heat pump will save an average of 1,676 kWh per year on average. Assuming a 10 percent discount rate, electricity prices of 8.3 cents per kWh, and an 11‐​year operating life for the heat pump, the consumer will save a total of $783 in energy costs.7 At the very least, spending $1,100 to save $783 hardly represents a net plus for the economy. The calculation also indicates that “market barriers” are not necessarily the primary obstacles faced by many energy efficient technologies; high cost is.



A calculation of consumer benefit would require a consideration of total costs: in this case, $1,100 times the total number of rebates provided plus management expenses that would probably add another 10–15 percent. The total consumer benefit from purchasing the more efficient heat pump would require a calculation of the total willingness to pay minus actual payments. Once we consider the fact that a number of participants are likely to be “free riders” (households that would have purchased the technology even without the rebate), it’s likely that the benefit to consumers who otherwise would not have purchased the heat pump save for the tax credit will be one‐​half the cost or less.



For the purposes of the CCTI, however, a cost‐​benefit test requires us to consider the cost of the program in relation to the amount of greenhouse gas emission reductions achieved. In this case, dividing the cost of the tax credit ($1,100) by the amount of greenhouse gas emissions avoided through more efficient energy use results in a total cost of $349 per ton. With a 10 percent discount rate, the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions via the tax credit rises to $666 per ton.8



Since no credible economist would support a carbon tax of $666 per ton to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (most proposals range from $5–50 per ton), why should the Congress accept a program that levies an implicit tax that they wouldn’t be caught dead advocating explicitly?



Contrast the above calculation with the administration’s argument that for every tax dollar invested in the CCTI, $70 dollars of economic benefits will result (if such figures were actually seriously believed, one could make a pretty strong argument that ALL discretionary federal spending should be plowed into the CCTI). If the administration is determined to argue the economic merits of the CCTI, it appears that a refresher course in Econ 101 would be in order.



 _Programs Aim at Solving Problems that do not Exist_



Underlying the CCTI is the belief that market barriers — such as lack of information, shortage of investment capital, and inexplicably negative consumers biases against energy efficiency investments — prevent the market place from investing optimally in the technologies peddled by the two departments. The administration’s heavy reliance on product labeling, demonstration projects, public awareness, and subsidized research, development, and marketing is largely designed to overcome those market barriers. DOE and EPA’s energy efficiency performance goals will only succeed if those market barriers truly exist. Otherwise, consumers will continue to reject those technologies.



Economists, however, are deeply skeptical about the underlying assumptions of the CCTI.9 First, market barriers do not necessarily contribute to economic inefficiency or sub‐​optimal investment. As economist Ronald Sutherland explains, “A fallacy in the conservation paradigm is the presumption that market barriers produce inefficient outcomes that justify government policy. So‐​called market barriers may not be sources of inefficiency, but rather are benign characteristics of well functioning markets.“10



Second, studies of consumer behavior involving home heating and cooling find that the implicit rates of return used by consumers in making energy conservation investment decisions are consistent with returns available on other investments.11



Third, the variance in energy prices over time creates uncertainty about the return on energy conservation investments. Because such investments are irreversible and much more illiquid than other investments, consumers rationally demand high returns on home conservation investments to compensate for the uncertainty that they face.12



Fourth, the estimates of alleged energy savings that consumers pass up are based on engineering estimates rather than actual changes in use. A study based on changes in actual use of electricity, rather than engineering estimates, concluded that consumers actually choose conservation investments rationally in light of the cost of capital and the returns on alternative investments.13



Think of the CCTI as being made up of a bunch of economic “carrots.” If the rabbits (consumers) cannot be induced by the “carrots” to purchase favored technologies, then the programs will largely fail. Since the administration’s “carrots” are designed to remedy problems that don’t exist, its unlikely that the technologies will gain enough consumer acceptance to make much difference in overall greenhouse gas emissions.



 _Performance Measures Are Implausible on Their Face_



The EPA estimates that its programs will reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 354 million metric tons of carbon equivalent by 2010.14 DOE estimates that its programs will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by another 112 million metric tons of carbon equivalent,15 yielding an estimated reduction of 452 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. Those performance measures are so unrealistic that they cast doubt on the seriousness of the administration’s attempts to comply with the GPRA.



To put this in perspective, the DOE’s own “5‐​Labs” study estimates that a “high efficiency” scenario for the economy would reduce emissions by only 120 million metric tons of carbon equivalent by 2010. The EIA is less bold, suggesting that reductions of only 79 million metric tons of carbon equivalent are possible under a “high efficiency” economic scenario.



The fundamental explanation for the administration’s wildly inflated program estimates is two‐​fold. First, the administration overestimates the potential for government directed R&D, marketing, and technology deployment to improve economic performance. Second, it engages in unrealistic projections about the speed with which new technologies can migrate into the marketplace.



As to the former, the DOE and EPA evince the mind‐​set of those entering into a second marriage: the triumph of hope over experience. Numerous third‐​party examinations of the history of government technology‐​forcing programs conclude that programs such as the CCTI have failed miserably over the past 30 years.16 Typical is the assessment by M.I.T.‘s Thomas Lee, Ben Ball, Jr., and Richard Tabors: “the experience of the 1970s and 1980s taught us that if a technology is commercially viable, then government support is not needed; and if a technology is not commercially viable, no amount of government support will make it so” [emphasis in original].17



As to the latter, we need to remember that the potential for new energy‐​efficient technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — especially within a decade — is limited because new technologies are only incremental additions to the capital stock, capital stock turns over slowly, and total capital stock increases with economic growth. Thus, even if the administration is correct about the benefits of their technology investments and promotional activities, there is only so much that those technologies can accomplish in the short or mid term.



The above problems are so severe that when the Energy Information Administration ran the administration’s tax credit proposal through its computer models, it found that rebates proposed in the CCTI would reduce energy consumption by less than 0.1 percent and greenhouse gas emissions by 0.17 percent by 2010, figures far less than the performance measures offered by the administration.18



Moreover, when the President’s Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) produced a plan to comply with the Kyoto Protocol at the lowest possible economic cost, they ignored the claims peddled by the DOE and EPA regarding the potential for the CCTI to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The CEA report instead relied upon a liberal emissions trading program to reduce greenhouse gases and made no mention of the CCTI’s ability to contribute to Kyoto compliance.19 If the DOE and EPA claims of program savings could not persuade the administration’s own economists to include them in its main planning document, they should probably not be taken seriously by Congress.



 _Energy Efficiency May Hinder Carbon Efficiency_



Another fundamental problem with the CCTI its focus on energy efficiency rather than carbon efficiency. For instance, if electricity were generated largely by natural gas and nuclear power, it would make little difference how efficient our end‐​use technologies were; greenhouse gas emissions would be minimal either way. In fact, the president’s Council of Economic Advisors relies upon the elimination of the domestic coal industry and the accelerated emergence of natural gas fired electricity to meet the standards of the Kyoto Protocol.20 Correspondingly, if electricity were generated largely by coal, all the increased efficiency in the world would do little to control total greenhouse gas emissions.



Consider, for instance, advanced water heaters. Among the most efficient water heaters on the market are electric heat pumps with an “energy factor” of 1.65. The most efficient gas water heaters, however, have an “energy factor” of only .54. Under the administration’s plan, the electric heat pump would qualify for a 20 percent tax credit and would be aggressively promoted to consumers by the government. According to the DOE’s own data, however, the electric heat pump would generate 4,872 pounds of carbon dioxide a year compared to 3,862 pounds of carbon dioxide generated by the natural gas heater.21



The reason is simple. Approximately 70 percent of the total energy consumed by an appliance is actually consumed in the production, generation, transmission, and distribution of energy. Since more electricity is generated from coal than any other fuel source, the “energy efficient” electric heat pump would be inferior — from a greenhouse gas emissions standpoint — than the less efficient natural gas heat pump.



 _Energy Efficiency Improvements Do Not Necessarily = Reductions in Greenhouse Gas Emissions_



Aside from the difficulty in reconciling energy efficiency with carbon efficiency, the suggestion that increased energy efficiency as a program output will lead to energy consumption as an intermediate outcome is questionable. The reason is that energy efficiency reduces the marginal cost of consuming energy. If the marginal cost of energy goes down, energy consumption at the margin will increase. The increased energy consumption that results will offset some if not all the gains achieved by enhanced energy efficiency.



For example, assume that DOE helps develop and market an incredibly energy efficient air conditioner. The upshot for the residential consumers is that they will be able to substantially reduce the cost of keeping their homes at 75 degrees in the summertime. Perhaps, however, they are most comfortable if indoor temperatures are 70 degrees. They might not have been able to afford to keep the thermostat down that low in the past, but thanks to DOE’s new air conditioner, now they can. So the thermostat is lowered, energy consumption increases, and the greenhouse gas emissions go back up.



Economists who have studied the phenomenon of energy efficiency and increased energy consumption (sometimes known as the “snap‐​back effect”) have documented the relationship.22 We can also see it by examining macroeconomic data. According to the EIA, energy efficiency (measured as total energy consumption per unit of GDP) improved by 57 percent from 1949–1997. Yet total energy consumption increased by 323 percent over that same period. Population growth, economic growth, and yes, the “snap‐​back” effect are the main reasons for the lack of correlation between energy efficiency and energy consumption.



 _No Outcome Measurements of Success Offered_



Finally, the administration failed to comply with the spirit of the GPRA by refusing to directly connect the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to the well being of the American people. Recall President Clinton’s desire to ask of his budget, “Is it changing people’s lives for the better? Can we say after we take money and put it into a certain endeavor that it was worth actually [taking] away from the taxpayers [and putting] into this endeavor and [that] their lives are better [sic]?” In the case of the CCTI, there are two appropriate questions to ask. First, how much global warming will be abated by these programs? Second, how will the American public then benefit from the alleviation of global warming?



In a spirit of generosity, I will attempt to do the administration’s homework for them. For the sake of argument, assume my critique of the program is incorrect and the administration’s claims can be taken at face value. Assume, therefore, that the CCTI meets all the performance measures and results offered by the administration.



If every nation meets its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, the world’s most advanced climate model predicts that temperatures will be 0.07 degrees Celsius cooler than they otherwise would be under a business as usual scenario by the year 2050.23 Since the U.S. emits 20 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases, we can infer that U.S. compliance with the Kyoto Protocol would reduce global temperatures by 0.014 degrees Celsius.24 According to the DOE and EPA, their contribution to the CCTI will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 452 million metric tons of carbon equivalent annually by 2010 (the midpoint of the Kyoto compliance period). That means that about 65 percent of the greenhouse gas emission reductions required of the United States under the Kyoto Protocol can be met through the budgetary programs we’re discussing today, implying that the CCTI will reduce temperatures by .0091 degrees Celsius (16–1,000ths of a degree Fahrenheit) below where they otherwise would be by the year 2050.



Such a change in temperature is too small to measure. Moreover, I defy the administration to argue that this infinitesimal reduction in temperature will affect the lives of the American people one whit.



 **Conclusion**



The importance of stepping back from the GPRA budgetary “trees” to appreciate the policy “forest” was perhaps best articulated by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous description of the intellectual opportunity costs of examinations such as ours today:



The administration of political affairs itself becomes in time so full of complications that it requires an incredible number of persons to devote their time to its supervision, in order that it may not fall into utter confusion. Now, by far the greater portion of these have to deal with the mere symbols and formulas of things; and thus, not only are men of first‐​rate capacity withdrawn from anything which gives scope to thinking, and useful hands are diverted from real work, but their intellectual powers themselves suffer from this partly empty, partly narrow employment.25



There are serious doubts about whether the administration has complied with the GPRA in its budgetary request for its global climate change programs. But more importantly, there is no doubt that the performance and measurement yardsticks presented by the administration are so dubious and disconnected from reality that they discredit the programs themselves. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today and I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

"Much has been said in recent weeks about the death toll of cyclists in London. Yet the only immediate response media coverage seems to have produced is police on street corners handing out tickets to cyclists. Whatever the merits of greater enforcement, demanding constables hit cyclist ticket targets will certainly raise hackles and give a sense of victim blaming. More importantly, such knee-jerk reactions guarantee that more appropriate provision is once again shunted further down the list of priorities. It would be better to take swift action to adapt our cities’ infrastructure to changing demands. But while the long-term aspirations may be clear, we need measures that can be implemented more quickly – what would help convert highways into a system managed in a more even-handed way for the benefit of all users? Making changes quickly runs counter to our expectations about what is feasible, where possibilities are limited by regulations and competing demands. The current, long drawn-out review of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions will hopefully usher in changes that make rolling out road schemes designed with cycle traffic in mind more straightforward. But this programme of change stretches over decades, in contrast to the one or two years in which local highway authorities are required to demonstrate value for money from Local Sustainable Transport Funding. There need to be steps to deliver capacity and safety improvements that can be taken more quickly than this. In the magazine Local Transport Today, Transport for London’s Brian Deegan and Paul Lavelle, authors of TfL’s Cycling Design Standards, suggest ways to improve the safety of cycle-friendly traffic schemes. Among them are the use of planters as a flexible means to separate the carriageway – how about a large scale programme of “coning off” critical sections of the network for cycle traffic with planters? They also talk about traffic regulation orders to restrict vehicle use along certain streets, reinforced with physical measures such as bollards. How quickly can these traffic orders be used to plan and implement a network of high capacity and safe cycle routes? Such an approach would remain flexible enough to adapt to permanent solutions. A major safety issue is the “left-hook problem”, where cyclists in the left lane have traffic, including lorries, buses or other vehicles whose drivers have limited visibility, turn across them. Deegan and Lavelle suggest a range of measures, particularly at signalled junctions. Some could be put in place quicker than others – for example using deeper advanced stop lines to enlarge the size of the bicycle-only box at traffic lights and junctions. For many years cyclists have had to be content with a blunt “give way” where cycle lanes end, even when these lanes are within the carriageway. Why not reverse the priority, demanding motor traffic give way when joining a lane with cycle traffic? These subtle-yet-obvious approaches have been used in Copenhagen and New York. Perhaps the reason they have not been used in the UK is simply because the country is not yet ready to acknowledge cycling as a worthwhile mode of transport that needs to be given its own space and priority. Perhaps, if planners are not yet prepared to make motor traffic yield to cyclists even though the reverse has been true, even for schemes apparently designed expressly for cyclists, for years, an alternative is to give neither priority. The award-winning shared space scheme in Poynton, Cheshire, defied expectations and continues to successfully handle large volumes of traffic, including increasing amounts of cycle traffic. At the same time it provides quality urban realm and an “even playing field” where rights are not assumed but gently negotiated by more vigilant, safer, road users. If a busy junction can be redesigned this way, then we should bring in such changes more widely so we can all benefit from the better road user behaviour. "
"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called for an end to all government promotion and subsidies for the domestic production of ethanol.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that all taxpayers, all consumers of food and most farmers will be harmed by the creation of an artificial industry producing subsidised ethanol.
“Subsidising the production of ethanol will waste taxes, harm the environment, cause sharply increased costs for everyone in the food chain, and do nothing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or air pollution.

“Many people think that ethanol production will provide wins for the whole community – farmers, the community and the environment. But there is no free lunch.
“As usual with government promotions, the benefits are obvious but the costs are hidden.
“Most of the benefits will go to large corporations set up to harvest ethanol subsidies, and some will trickle down to those growing cereals and sugar cane – they will get higher prices for their products than they would otherwise.
“The majority of farmers will be losers – all those using grains or molasses for supplementary feeding of cattle, horses, chooks, sheep and pigs will see their feed prices increase – this has already happened in America.
“Higher prices for grains and sugar will then pass thru farms, feedlots and factories to show up as rising costs for cereals, bacon, eggs, milk, meat and all sweets – a hidden ethanol tax on every breakfast table.
“In addition, the inevitable government subsidies or tax breaks for ethanol will consume tax dollars, giving higher taxes for tax payers or lower services for tax consumers.
“Then there are environmental costs. We will use heaps of diesel tractor fuel to bring marginal land, either grassland or bush, into a dead mono-culture of cereals or cane. (Professor Ausubel of the Rockefeller University in New York has calculated that each car would need 1-2 hectares of pasture to produce its motor fuel in this inefficient way.) And the excessive cultivation and chemical fertilisers used will reduce the soil organic matter and produce – – – – – more greenhouse gases.
“Then when we burn ethanol in cars, we get the same old dreaded greenhouse gases, water vapour and carbon dioxide – releasing exactly the same amount of these gases as were removed from the environment by the growing plant a few months before.
“Moreover, the cultivation, harvesting, transport and processing of the ethanol inputs adds more pollutants to the atmosphere – in fact, careful energy audits show that there is less energy in a gallon of ethanol than is required to produce it from plant material (see reference below).
“And what do we do in times of drought – burn our cereals and sugar in ethanol cars and import food to eat?
“Finally, who pays for the damage or modifications required to many engines to allow them to use ethanol?
“If people think ethanol can be produced profitably in a competitive market with no tax breaks or subsidies, they should be free to try with their own dollars.
“But taxpayers and consumers should not be forced to subsidise the ethanol industry – any full audit will show that the costs outweigh the benefits.
“If the government wants to increase energy security or reduce the price of motor fuel they should remove all the barriers to exploring for oil in Australia or producing gas or liquid fuels from Australian coals.”

There is a little [graph, which is updated daily](https://globalcryospherewatch.org/state_of_cryo/snow/fmi_swe_tracker.jpg), that I have been watching for a couple of months now. It seems that the northern hemisphere has not yet gotten the memo about global warming melting all the snow.



The snow was all meant to have gone by now and yet this year the snow mass is well above average.



As you can see, the dotted line is the average snow mass for the years 1982-2012, the shaded area is ±1 standard deviation from the average and the red dots are the daily data for this northern hemisphere winter. Almost all of them above the one standard deviation line.



Note also the much earlier start with the dot in early October.



We know that “one swallow does not a summer make” but this clearly seems to be heading in the wrong direction from that predicted by the doomers.



With the sunspot cycle heading for a grand minimum, the future versions of this graph are going to be very interesting.

According to recently published scientific papers, the current sea level highstand, as well as the rate of glacier retreat and sea level change, are now significantly lower than they have been for much of the last 10,000 years — back when CO2 concentrations were stable and considerably lower (at about 265 ppm).

A flurry of new papers show today’s sea level rise is slower than in the Holocene past. Photo Tiago Floreze, CC BY-SA 3.0.
The most recent IPCC report (2013) indicates that sea levels have been rising at a rate of 1.7 mm/year, or 6.7 inches per century, since 1901 (through 2010).  This rate occurred synchronously with an approx. 100 ppm increase in atmospheric CO2 levels.
In contrast, scientists Hodgson et al., 2016 have determined that sea levels rose at rates of 1.2 to 4.8 meters per century (47 to 188 inches, or about 4 to 16 feet per century) between about 10,500 and 9,500 years ago near East Antarctica.  This sea level rate change occurred while CO2 levels were stable to modestly declining *.
In the paper: Rapid early Holocene sea-level rise in Prydz Bay, East Antarctica, the authors write:
Prydz Bay is one of the largest embayments on the East Antarctic coast and it is the discharge point for approximately 16% of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. […] The field data show rapid increases in rates of relative sea level rise of 12–48 mm/yr between 10,473 (or 9678) and 9411 cal yr BP [calendar years before present].”
The recently published scientific literature also indicates that not only was the historical rate of sea level rise significantly higher than it has been since the 20th century began, glaciers and ice sheets continued to rapidly retreat during the late Holocene, or within the last few thousand years.  During the Medieval Warm Period, for example, scientists Guglielmin et al., 2016 determined that glacier retreat rates in the Western Antarctic Peninsula were as high or higher than they have been in recent decades.
In the publication here, the authors write:
Here, we present evidence for glacial retreat corresponding to the MWP [Medieval Warm Period] and a subsequent LIA [Little Ice Age] advance at Rothera Point (67°34′S; 68°07′W) in Marguerite Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula. … Based on new radiocarbon dates, during the MWP, the rate of glacier retreat was 1.6 m yr−1, which is comparable with recently observed rates (~0.6 m per year between 1993 and 2011 and 1.4 m per year between 2005 and 2011).”
Prior to the Medieval Warm Period, scientists Yokoyama et al., 2016 indicate that “the world’s largest ice shelf” collapsed due to a warming ocean and atmosphere, with ice shelf retreat rates of 100 km within a thousand years.
In the publication Widespread collapse of the Ross Ice Shelf during the late Holocene, the authors write:
The Ross Sea is a major drainage basin for the Antarctic Ice Sheet and contains the world’s largest ice shelf. … Breakup initiated around 5 ka [5,000 years ago], with the ice shelf reaching its current configuration ∼1.5 ka [1,500 years ago]. In the eastern Ross Sea, the ice shelf retreated up to 100 km in about a thousand years. … [I]ce-shelf breakup resulted from combined atmospheric warming and warm ocean currents impinging onto the continental shelf.”
According to other scientists Bradley et al., 2016, the melt water from the Antarctic ice sheet continued to contribute up to 5.8 meters of sea level rise equivalent until about 1,000 years ago.
In another recent paper here the authors found:
…a slowdown in melting at ∼7 kyr BP associated with the final deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, followed by a continued rise in ESL [Holocene ice volume equivalent sea level] until ∼1 kyr BP of ∼5.8 m associated with melting from the Antarctic Ice Sheet.”

Due apparently to the high glacier-melt rates and warmer ocean temperatures (Rosenthal et al. [2013]** indicate that 0-700 m Pacific Ocean temperatures were still ~0.65° C warmer than present ~1,000 years ago), recently published scientific papers document that sea levels stood from 1 to 4 meters higher than now as recently as a few thousand years ago (see citations below).
The big mystery
These scientific conclusions beg the question: If CO2 is a primary determinant of changes in sea level, why is it that sea level highstands (and sea level rise and glacier melt rates) were significantly greater when CO2 concentrations were stable and low than they have been in recent decades?

The configuration suggests surface inundation of the upper sediments by marine water during the mid-Holocene (c. 2–8 kyr BP) [2,000-8,000 years before present], when sea level was 1–2 m above today’s level.

Human settlements were common on the ridge crests before and after the highstand. Regression to present-day sea level commenced after the highstand, which is when the sabkha began forming.”

Highlights

We present a sea level change curve for mid Holocene in Uruguay.
Sea level reached 4 m amsl[above mean sea level today]between 6000 and 5500 yr BP [years before present].
A rapid sea level fall to about 1 m amsl was inferred for 4700-4300 yr BP.
A further sea level increase to about 3 m amsl [above mean sea level today]was inferred after 4300 yr BP

"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump spoke by telephone with the acting director of the National Park Service the day after his inauguration to ask why someone from the agency had shared someone else’s Twitter post giving an unflattering comparison of his inaugural crowd, according to Mr. Trump’s deputy press secretary. “It was a, ‘What’s going on?’ type of thing,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said on Thursday evening. “Why is the National Park Service tweeting out comparison photos? That was the bigger issue there. ” During the call, Mr. Trump also asked the National Park Service’s acting director, Michael T. Reynolds, if he could produce further photographic evidence of the size of his inaugural crowd, according to a second person briefed on the Jan. 21 telephone call between the two men. Since becoming president, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed outrage toward the news media for what he believes is a deliberate attempt to undermine his legitimacy by understating the size of the crowd that attended his   and speech. One of those instances happened on Inauguration Day, when an employee of the National Park Service used the agency’s Twitter account to share someone else’s post of images comparing the inaugural crowds in 2009 and 2017. The images, originally posted by a New York Times reporter, showed the 2009 crowd to be much larger. Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, expressed outrage the next day during a forceful statement at the White House in which he lashed out at the press and claimed, inaccurately, that Mr. Trump had drawn “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration. ” Mr. Spicer later said he was talking about a combination of   television and online audiences. That same morning, before Mr. Spicer’s statement, Mr. Reynolds received a message from the White House that the president wanted to talk to him. They connected in the early afternoon, according to one of the people who was briefed on the call and asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it. The new president asked for additional photos that could confirm his view of his crowd size. A park service spokesman, Tom Crosson, said he could confirm that a call took place between Mr. Reynolds and the president, but he would not describe the content. The call was first reported by The Washington Post. Mr. Reynolds could not be reached for comment. The fact that Mr. Trump sought out Mr. Reynolds to discuss the Twitter message and seek more proof of the size of his crowd during his first full day as president is further evidence of the anxiety that he has demonstrated when people raise questions about the extent of his public support. As a candidate, he frequently commented on the size of his rallies, and when he became   he repeatedly spoke about the magnitude of his Election Day victories in states that few people thought he would win. Some political commentators had speculated that Mr. Trump’s focus on the magnitude of his support would fade once he took office, as the election became less important than the issues facing him. But his frustration about the size of the inaugural crowd is continuing. During an interview with David Muir of ABC News this week, he talked about it, saying: “We had a massive crowd of people. We had a crowd  —   I looked over that sea of people and I said to myself, ‘Wow.’ And I’ve seen crowds before. Big, big crowds. That was some crowd. ” He also walked Mr. Muir over to a panoramic picture of the crowd hanging in a hallway in the West Wing. Ms. Sanders said Mr. Trump’s decision to call Mr. Reynolds is a reflection of what his supporters find appealing: his willingness to do something himself when he thinks it needs to be done. “The reason that people like him is because he takes action himself,” she said. “If he sees something that’s an issue, he picks up the phone and directly engages to fix it. ”"
"**Reports of the mass killing of civilians in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region ""would amount to war crimes"" if confirmed, the UN human rights chief has warned.**
Michelle Bachelet called for an inquiry into reports that scores and maybe hundreds of people had been stabbed and hacked to death in one town.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of the massacre.
Its officials have denied involvement.
Tigray leader Debretsion Gebremichael told AFP news agency that the accusations were ""baseless"".
Mr Abiy said that fighters backing Tigray's ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), went on the rampage after federal troops had ""liberated"" the western part of Tigray, ""brutally"" killing innocent civilians in Mai-Kadra, a town in the South West Zone of Tigray.
Witnesses blamed forces loyal to TPLF for Monday's killings - first reported by human rights group Amnesty International.
If confirmed, this would be the first large-scale killing of civilians in the fighting between government forces and the TPLF which broke out on 4 November.
Getting information about the clashes is hard because phone lines and internet services are down.
In a statement, the Tigray government denied that its forces were behind Monday's killings.
It added that it would welcome and co-operate with an independent international investigation into the incident.
Ms Bachelet said she was ""alarmed"" about the situation in Ethiopia, but added that the ""first priority"" was to stop the fighting and prevent further atrocities.
There has been long-standing tension between Ethiopia's government and the TPLF, which controls Tigray, the country's northernmost state. The tension has boiled over into military clashes, including air strikes by federal forces.
Ethiopia's Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen said on Friday that the military operation was going on as expected and would end ""in a very short period of time"".
He added that order had to be restored and ""criminals caught"" before dialogue was possible.
The conflict has forced thousands of civilians to cross the border into Sudan, which says it will shelter them in a refugee camp.
Amnesty said the killings happened on the night of 9 November.
The human rights group said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town"".
It said it had seen and ""digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers"".
Amnesty said the victims appeared to be labourers not involved in the conflict. It is not clear where they came from.
It said witnesses had spoken of wounds ""inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes"". Some witnesses said the attacks were carried out by forces loyal to the TPLF after they had been defeated by federal troops in an area called Lugdi.
Civilians were also killed in a government air strike in Tigray's capital, Mekelle, and in the city of Adigrat close to the border with Eritrea, Mr Debretsion told AFP.
""People are running in every corner. So the most important consequence of the conflict currently is displacement. Of course there are casualties, but we don't have the numbers. This is too big to manage,"" he added.
**By Hana Zeratsyon, BBC Tigrinya**
Communication is difficult at the moment because internet and mobile phone services have been cut.
There are already reports of a shortage of flour and fuel - and, worst of all, water, which was already rationed.
In Mekelle, which has a population of between 400,000 and 500,000, homes used to get piped water once a week, but the supply has stopped.
Families used to buy water from vendors, but with phones disconnected they can no longer call to put in orders.
On Thursday it was reported that a power-generating dam had been damaged in an air strike, cutting electricity supply in the region.
I am anxious about the safety of my family, especially 11-year-old brother who is suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
I am extremely worried about whether he will get his medication.
As he cannot talk, I used to see him during video calls but that is now not possible.

Ethiopia's prime minister said his forces had liberated an area that had been subject to ""gruesome and fatal attacks"" at the hands of the TPLF.
""Committing crimes and injustice is very normal for the greedy junta,"" Mr Abiy said in a Facebook statement.
Referring to army soldiers he said were shot when their hands and legs were tied, he added, ""the cruelty was heart-breaking"".
Mr Abiy's government later announced it had appointed Mulu Nega Kahsay as an interim administrator for the province as part of its efforts to oust the regional leadership.
His government has also issued arrest warrants for Tigray officials.
The UN has said that vital aid supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia are at risk because of the conflict there.
Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"".
He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp.
There have since been a number of clashes and air strikes in Tigray, with Mr Abiy saying government forces had made major gains.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, and ran Tigray.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
However, Mr Abiy curbed its influence after coming to power in 2018, while the TPLF refused to dissolve and merge with the other three parties to form the Prosperity Party, as pushed for by the prime minister.
Mr Abiy accuses some TPLF leaders of being ""fugitives from justice"" and opposing his moves to reform the way Ethiopia is run, but they say they have been unfairly targeted.
The disagreement represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, served in the central government for long periods of time. Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea - but the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked.
Mr Debretsion has accused Eritrean forces of siding with Ethiopia. Ethiopia and Eritrea both deny this.
For his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority."
"PARIS  —   At the end of the Jean Paul Gaultier couture show  —   after a stream of etched tuxedo suits, 1980s Crayola leathers and   furs with hibiscus prints after the models had finally left the runway and the audience started packing up  —   a man with a guitar slung around his neck appeared and perched on a stool by the side of the stage. Oops. Guess it wasn’t over after all. Then up the curtain went again, to reveal   …     a barefoot girl standing on a swing in an angelic silken nightie with a long blond braid trailing down her back and lacy sleeves like wings. She swayed to and fro for awhile to the strumming, then hopped off the swing and twirled down the catwalk before being swept off her feet by a shirtless stud in denim overalls, deposited in a wheelbarrow and carted off with great fanfare, into the sunset. Or at least backstage. It was a vignette sweetly meant. But couture bills itself as “the dream. ” And are women’s dreams these days really about being spirited into the future by a    of burning man flesh? That was mostly a rhetorical question. There’s a reason that Isabelle Huppert, just off her best actress Oscar nomination for playing a woman in “Elle” who, instead of falling to pieces after an attack, takes her vengeance into her own hands, attended the Armani Privé show not in the usual elaborate cocktail gown that celebrities favor for the front row, but rather a turquoise trouser suit and black mock turtleneck, and looked the cooler for it. When her fellow   celeb, Nicole Kidman, in a classic little black dress with statement jewels, knelt down to pay homage, you thought, “I know what you mean. ” It was, on the other hand, more difficult to figure out what Mr. Armani meant with the tangerine dream on the runway, from orange croc jackets to orange sequined slithers to long jeweled orange vests (there was some black, too). To paraphrase Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, it’s 2017. The issue of how relevant a historic discipline that is defined by making handmade clothes to order for the very few can be in a world roiled by social and political disruption was unavoidable this week  —   in part because the couture shows began just after the Women’s March on Washington, not to mention its sister marches all over the world, including Paris, and ended just before the March for Life. It seemed, at least to start, an unfortunate juxtaposition. It was hard not to think we were in the middle of a Marie Antoinette moment in the making. Especially when Giambattista Valli situated his show of   ball gowns, minidresses cut to the thigh in front and streaming trains of mousseline and silk faille behind, in the Archives Nationales. The historic venue, that is to say, where the young queen’s papers are kept (including the final letter she wrote before her beheading). The idea did not go over well with a French national trade union, which handed out leaflets in protest of the   . Still, after it was all over, after we had finished the trek from one cultural monument to the other  —   from the Musée Rodin, Invalides, the Centre Pompidou, the Palais de Chaillot, the Cirque D’Hiver (in case, you know, anyone was in any doubt about whether the French consider this particular discipline part of their patrimony)  —   it was clear that behind the tulle and chiffon, the crystals and crepe, efforts were being made to bridge the gap between escapism and the contemporary. Couture is often treated as synonymous with the most extreme form of   in part because of designers’ own tendency to   with the decoration (more sequins! more encrustation!) and the show décor. But at its essence it is, or is when it succeeds, about empowering the individual. A point made crystal clear by John Galliano in a perfectly judged Maison Margiela show that was a graceful meditation on the connection between foundation and presentation. Silk trench coats were sliced away and reduced to checkerboards to give glimpses of the garments beneath a tweed blouse over a bias satin skirt unspooled on one side. Faces, from the filters we use to transform ourselves on social media, were traced on sheer overcoats or cut into cascading gowns, or imprinted on tulle. In those eyes, you saw yourself. Elsewhere, the difference was in the details. At Christian Dior, the first woman to run the house, Maria Grazia Chiuri, performed a deceptive sleight of hand. In a tent in the gardens of the Musée Rodin, she constructed a verdant   maze around a magical tree dripping jewels and trinkets that recalled nothing so much as “A Midsummer Night’s Dream. ” She populated it with Little Black Riding Hood tailleurs and an array of evermore romantic evening dresses clasped at the waist by sculptural belts and crowned at the head. Yet, fancy though they were, the clothes had a   insouciance. Oh, this old ball gown? Paired with barely there kitten heels that kicked up the moss as the models strode along, they looked as comfortable as a sweatshirt. Ms. Chiuri said she had been fascinated by the concept of transformation (hence the masked ball theme, and the set) but the real transformation was in taking a formal garment and giving it a palpable ease, so the woman inside could just, well  —   get on with it. Likewise, at Valentino, Pierpaolo Piccioli accessorized his Grecian columns and palazzo pants and Aphrodite dresses with flat   sandals, the kind found at many an Italian resort, and loosed  —   or lost  —   the structure from his clothes. Instead of being armored, or preserved in amber, femininity was being unbound, shrouded in crepe pleats and veils of tulle. (Mr. Piccioli and Ms. Chiuri worked together as design partners for more than two decades, and this season marked each of their solo couture debuts, so, if they were thinking along the same lines, it’s understandable. The separation process is probably going to take a while.) The idea that flat shoes could represent progress may seem absurd. But this is a world where words like “fairy and “princess” are used so often they have become clichés. In that context, a sandal and absolute simplicity can be a radical move. So was swapping out the paillettes and bugle beads, the way Riccardo Tisci did at Givenchy, and instead using small circular fabric “mirrors” as adornment on     silk gowns. The most complicated dress in the collection, one that took 2, 000 hours to make, was made solely of linked dream catchers, each woven from black thread by hand in a different pattern. It all made the corsetry and elaborate hip swathing on view at Ulyana Sergeenko seem stiff and   by comparison  —   situated at one end of the continuum that terminates on the other with the mesmerizing garments made from   polyurethane, injection molding and laser cutting at Iris Van Herpen, which are   in the most interesting way. Somewhere in the middle is Schiaparelli, where Bertrand Guyon is in the process of a slow shift away from   surrealism. And though Karl Lagerfeld constructed a mirrored Art Deco salon complete with cream suede sofas and calla lilies for Chanel, transposing rooms at 31 Rue Cambon to the echoing environs of the Grand Palais, what was most notable was not the surround, but rather the way the silhouette had been altered by adding a plain leather belt, cinched just at the lower ribs, to everything from bouclé suiting to crystalline slips finished in a flounce of feathers. It could have been a discordant note amid the sparkling sophistication but instead it created an impression of streamlined modernity, and kept nostalgia at bay. It’s worth noting that, while Chanel (like Gaultier) is one of the few houses left that still closes its show with a bride  —   Elie Saab and Ralph  Russo also cling on, but most have jettisoned that anachronism  —   this time around she had lost her veil and simply strode the runway in a long pink dress. There was a cascade of ruffles at the sleeves and skirt, but look closer and the latter was cut just high enough in the front to allow freedom of movement. Or, put another way: progress."
"A group of bushfire scientists have used an article in one of the world’s leading scientific journals to call for Australia to establish a national agency to monitor the scale, severity and impacts of fires. The eight scientists from Australia and Spain say inconsistencies in how the scale and severity of bushfires are measured across the states had led to confusion over how much of the country actually burned.  Analysis of satellite data for the article, published in Nature, shows 18% or 7.5m hectares of the country’s eucalyptus forests burned – a figure 7.5 times higher than the average over the past 18 years of the satellite record, but about 600,000 hectares smaller than government data. At a time when climate change was driving more frequent dangerous bushfires, the lack of a consistent approach meant “we’re navigating uncharted territory without a compass”, the authors wrote. The scientists from the University of Tasmania, the University of Wollongong, the Australian National University and the University of Alcalá in Spain, said the ongoing royal commission into the bushfires should recommend a national fire monitoring agency be established. Such an agency, the group writes, could agree a consistent approach to measuring the frequency, size and severity of fires, as well as investigating their causes, the greenhouse gas emissions they generate and the public health and economic issues they raised. “The 2019–20 fires marked a historic crossroads. A national crisis of this magnitude, which will probably happen again, requires a national solution,” the authors conclude. Their own analysis, using only satellite data, showed that 30.38m hectares had burned in the 2019 and 2020 fire season, across all types of land cover. This compared to a government estimate of 39.8m hectares. Government records often included unburnt patches within a single perimeter, the scientists said, whereas satellite data was more consistent but was also prone to missing fires, particularly those less-severe burning under dense canopies. “Both approaches have strengths and weaknesses,” the scientists write. “It will thus be crucial to monitor fires with a method that can produce internally consistent data at the national scale, and that can be repeated many times during a fire crisis.” Without such a consistent approach, the scientists said it was more challenging to assess the environmental impacts of the fires and verify claims. As many as 3bn animals have been estimated to have been in the path of the fires. Three ecologists concluded that the fires caused “the most dramatic loss of habitat for threatened species and devastation of ecological communities in postcolonial history”. The lead author of the article, Prof David Bowman of the University of Tasmania, told Guardian Australia the purpose of the satellite analysis was to illustrate how the different approaches could deliver inconsistent results. “In the eucalyptus forests, there’s no question these fires were unprecedented in the satellite record,” he said. Dr Grant Williamson, a co-author of the article, also of the University of Tasmania, said he did not think the satellite data used for the article should be relied on either. He said: “The satellite data can miss low-severity fires. If there’s a fire burning under a dense forest, the satellite can’t pick that up. We need a combination of approaches.” Bowman told Guardian Australia a more careful record of Australia’s fire history was needed. For example, some official sources have stated that Victoria’s Black Thursday fires of 1851 had burned across 5m hectares of the state, but don’t define what was burned. A reference used for those reports says only 1.5m hectares of forest burned that year, with the rest being scrub and grasslands. Adjunct Prof Jim McLennan, a bushfire safety expert at La Trobe University, who was not an author of the article, said he supported the proposals for a national approach. He said: “Historically, response to natural hazard emergencies, and associated data collection, has been a matter for individual states and territories. “However, future increases in hazard frequency and severity, driven by global warming, mean that weather-related hazards require a national response capability, and the basis for this must be an appropriate national database.” Also commenting on the proposals, Dr Michael-Shawn Fletcher, an associate professor at the University of Melbourne, said a nationally consistent approach was “crucial for guiding efforts at mitigation and post-fire response”. He said satellite imagery was useful for tracking fires in the more open tropical savanna in the country’s north, “but these systems are very different to the temperate eucalypt forests that, arguably, present the greatest risk for Australia’s firey future.” He also cautioned against moving away from independent assessments of fire area, severity and impacts in favour of a national approach. He added: “Finally, it could be argued that the solution needs to reach beyond a simple national monitoring agency, to an independent and nationally-coordinated agency aimed at informing government about prediction, mitigation and monitoring of fire in Australia.”"
"Germany, one of the world’s leading users of solar power, is set to charge people generating their own solar-powered electricity for access to the national grid. The move is part of the package of reforms aimed at, among others, driving down the costs of the Energiewender, Germany’s renewable revolution. At first, this seems an apparently unintuitive step, as it reduces the incentives for new renewable deployments. The proposed reform would require new clean energy installations larger than 10kW – including solar, wind, or other renewables – to pay a portion of the fee to access the electricity grid from which they are currently exempt. This would make Germany the first EU member state to do so, with similar measures proposed in recession-hit Spain. They are among the only jurisdictions in the world to do so – only a few US states have a similar policy. This fee is already paid by other energy consumers in Germany, incorporated into their electricity bills. Known as the EEG-Umlage, this pays towards the costs of transmission lines and the distribution network that connects electricity consumers to power stations and producers. It amounts to €0.0624 (£0.051, US$0.085) a kilowatt in 2014. A similar charge is levied in other countries at varying rates – it accounts for about 20% of the average UK electricity bill. What’s controversial is that the charge will be paid per kilowatt generated, whether or not there is any excess to deliver to the network after the business or household has consumed the energy required for their own needs. If 20kw is generated and 20kw used, the fee is still raised against 20kw. It will in effect be a tax on electrical self-sufficiency. The effect will be that the net subsidised price of electricity paid to renewable energy producers will be less. And from this it is basic economics to assume that a lower price will lead to fewer new installations of renewables, as suggested by renewable trade organisations and environmental groups, and consequently a slowdown in the rate at which Germany reduces its carbon emissions. Is this move justified? Does its financial logic stand up to scrutiny? There is no doubt that being grid-connected is valuable: connected energy producers are able to rely on the grid being able export their electricity if they have a surplus, or import if they are consuming more than they can produce. In either case the network operator bears the costs of ensuring the network is available – whether or not producers are producing. Another aspect is that as more businesses and households become generators of electricity, and so become exempt from the charge, the costs fall disproportionately on a shrinking pool of non-exempt consumers. This is a positive sign if the government’s objective is to promote renewables, but those not willing or able to do so face ever increasing costs. Taken to its extreme, if every electricity consumer were to become a producer, there would be no non-exempt consumers to pay for the network at all, which is counter-productive. There is also, importantly, the fact that national electricity grids were largely designed for a few, large power stations. Maintaining grid stability and balancing a network of many thousands of small electricity generators increases complexity and costs. This is especially so when there those generators have little ability to control or predict the amount of energy generated or its timing. This is commonly called the intermittency problem, and is particularly associated with energy produced by wind and solar power. When the total contribution of intermittent energy sources is low, below 20%-30%, this is a relatively minor, but at higher levels it can become a very significant problem to manage and maintain system stability. But Germany’s proposed fee is based on electricity produced, not electricity transmitted, which is likely to impose a greater cost on the producer than other means of charging. For example, a potentially superior alternative would be to impose a single fee, comprised of a fixed annual charge for network availability, and a charge determined by the volume of electricity drawn from and dispatched to the grid. This would meet the financial costs of maintaining the system, while potentially lowering the costs and reducing the uncertainty of how much would be payable under the new scheme. The fact is that the costs borne by businesses and consumers to support Germany’s renewable energy subsidies has increased to €24 billion, a cost that naturally poses the question as to whether it is a cost worth paying."

Wall of infamy Art Installation
James Delingpole, and other prominent British skeptics, have been immortalised on an art installation “wall of infamy”.
According to James;
I am one of several climate change sceptics to have been celebrated and immortalised in an exciting new, prizewinning art installation at Anglia Ruskin, one of Britain’s largest universities. (h/t Liam Deacon)
It comprises a faux-stone slab (made out of plywood) engraved with my own name and that of five other British climate sceptics – Christopher Booker, Nigel Lawson, Christopher Monckton, Melanie Phillips, Owen Paterson – beneath the legend “Lest We Forget Those Who Denied.” The sculpture has been described as an “oil painting with a difference” because a continuous stream of engine oil drools symbolically over the “deniers’” names, like tragic sea otters after an Exxon spill.

I must say I’m a little jealous of my friend James. Where is my art installation wall of infamy? I mean, how many of these climate articles do I have to write?
Given the amount of publicity this political stunt has generated for the artist who created it, hopefully there will be some copycat attempts before too long. Please make sure you get the spelling of my name correct – that is “Worrall” with an “A”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Swiss Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) has published a commentary by renowned economics professor Silvio Borner, University of Basel, where he sharply criticizes climate models and basing political decisions on them.
He compares climate forecasts to economic forecasts, where in both fields one runs into a myriad of unpredictable variables and complex, poorly understood interactions that make reliable forecasts impossible – even more so in climate.
When it comes to climate, Borner writes that it is a fact the current warming started before industrialization and that CO2 is “partly responsible” for the current warming – as scientifically accepted temperature reconstructions of the past show.
In his commentary he looks at the parallels between global economy and global climate, reminding us that we already know that there are huge margins of errors for even short-term forecasts. “They often err even on the algebraic sign“.
Interestingly, Borner writes that forcasting the climate system is even more difficult because “we do not know the unknown exogenic causal factors in advance nor are we able to control them politically“. He explains that economists have had (bitter) experiences in trying to forecast economies and that the climate system is an even more unfamiliar system. This is evident, he says, even from weather forecasts which “differ from model to model and are often wrong“.
On the usefulness of models, Borner says they are of value, but never “true” due to the numerous assumptions that go into them. He writes:



<!--

/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




For these reasons, all the ‘doom prognoses’ concerning the limits of growth have all failed grandly.”
Due to all the unknowns in the climate system, and the extreme lack of understanding with regards to their interaction, Borner says it is “scientifically irresponsible to fix a relationship between CO2 emissions and global warming, and then calculate from that how much Co2 needs to reduced by 2030 in order to avoid a 2°C temperature rise.” He adds:
To qualify that as methodological nonsense, one does not have to be a ‘climate denier’.”
Borner believes that it makes sense to reduce CO2, “but not on the backs of the poor countries“. He favors a CO2 emissions certificate trading scheme. He concludes:
 It is enough to set down the right general framework conditions. State planning or investments lead to chaos.”
Take this from a renowned expert in economic modeling – one who understands that the climate system is even more complex, unpredictable and far less controllable. In a nutshell Professor Borner is warning that controlling the climate is a futile endeavor and that basing policy on climate models borders on folly.

Guest essay by Mike Jonas
Introduction
This article is the third in a series of four articles.
Part 1 of the series (Part 1) is here
Part 2 of the series (Part 2) is here
In Part 1, simple mathematical formulae were developed to emulate the carbon dioxide (CO2.) contribution to global temperature change, as represented in the computer climate models.
In Part 2, the formulae were used to have a look at the Medieval Warming Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA).
Part 3 uses the formulae to have a look at the longer term – at the period used to great effect by Al Gore in his film An Inconvenient Truth.
Note : This article does not say anything new, or claim to find any new results. It has all been said many times before. But by using simple formulae that emulate the internal workings of the computer climate models, it allows the CO2 and non-CO2 components of global temperature change to be quantified using a spreadsheet [4] instead of a sophisticated climate model.
Please note : In this article, all temperatures referred to are deg C anomalies unless otherwise stated.
The data
In An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore showed graphs of temperature and CO2 for the last 400,000 years. The data is available from studies of ice cores at Vostok in Antarctica [1] [2], and it looks like this:

Al Gore presented the graphs of temperature and CO2 separately, but the correlation between temperature and CO2 is perhaps easier to see if they are presented in a single graph, as in Figure 1.
There is a well-known connection between temperature and CO2 : as temperature rises, the oceans release CO2 into the atmosphere [3], thus a rising temperature causes rising levels of CO2. The result is clearly visible in Figure 1, with CO2 following some years after the temperature changes.
But what about the connection the other way, ie, CO2 warming the ocean? After referring to this time lag (“CO2 starts to rise about 800 years (600-1000 years) after Antarctic temperature”) RealClimate [3] puts it this way :
<blockquote>All that the lag shows is that CO2 did not cause the first 800 years of warming, out of the 5000 year trend. The other 4200 years of warming could in fact have been caused by CO2, as far as we can tell from this ice core data.
The 4200 years of warming make up about 5/6 of the total warming. So CO2 could have caused the last 5/6 of the warming, but could not have caused the first 1/6 of the warming.</blockquote>
Well, the formulae established in Part 1 can be used to test this idea.
The calculation
Applying the formulae established in Part 1 to the Vostok data gives the following picture of the CO2 and non-CO2 contributions to global temperature :

Before discussing this picture, some caveats are needed:
· The temperature range in Figure 2 is much greater than the temperature range used to establish the formulae. This makes the formulae unreliable over the period in Figure 2, as addressed in the following dot points.
· The basic formulae used, namely
Rcy = 5.35 * ln(Cy/C0) – j * ((T0+Tcy-1)^4 – T0^4)
δTcy = k * Rcy
(see Part 1) make no reference to the ice-free ocean area, but it is implicitly built in.
· As the temperature falls and sea ice area increases, the oceans’ influence on global temperature decreases, so CO2’s influence decreases too. (Extreme example : at 100% sea ice, ECS is zero). This means that CO2’s influence will in practice be less than as shown in Figure 2. Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) will be lower at lower temperatures and the time taken to reach equilibrium will be longer.
· Similarly, at higher temperatures than today’s ECS will be higher, but since the average area of sea-ice is currently only a small proportion of the ocean surface (20m in 360m sq km) the increase in ECS would be very small.
· What the factors are that cause these major temperature changes is unimportant. The distinction in Figure 2 is between CO2 and non-CO2. All of the CO2 feedbacks claimed by the IPCC are built into the formulae and are accounted for fully in Figure 2. All the rest of the temperature change is non-CO2 regardless of the actual mechanisms, and regardless of whether those mechanisms are built into the computer climate models.
· At the low temperatures, it is possible that the CO2 feedbacks change too. Whether they increase or decrease is not known, but given that the oceans’ influence is lower at the low temperatures, and given that the feedbacks apply to radiative forcing (not just CO2 radiative forcing) and that non-CO2 radiative forcings must have been operating to produce the low temperatures in the first place, it is reasonable to assume that CO2’s overall contribution, including the feedbacks, is actually lower than as shown in Figure 2.
Now, looking at Figure 2, it is clear that CO2 has little influence on global temperature over this longer timescale. Note also that from about -130,000 to -100,000 CO2’s contribution remains at around its highest level while temperature falls more than 8 degrees. Similarly from about -400,000 to -350,000. In all of the major temperature increases, CO2 contributes no more than about 1/6 of the temperature increase.
In Part 2, there was some room for doubt about whether the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was global, and attention was drawn to the accusation that climate scientists had tried to get rid of the MWP. With the very high publicity given to An Inconvenient Truth, and with the high reputation of the Vostok data (at least to the kind of accuracy needed here), it seems unlikely that anyone will attempt to “get rid of” the temperature and CO2 changes in the Vostok data. Even getting rid of the 800-year time lag of CO2 behind temperature would make no noticeable difference to Figure 2.
Conclusion
The picture of global temperature and its drivers as presented by the IPCC and the computer climate models is one in which CO2 has been the dominant factor since the start of the industrial age and other factors have had minimal impact. In order to support this picture, the IPCC has sought to portray CO2 as having been an important driver of global temperature in the past.
The idea that CO2 has been an important driver of global temperature over the last 400,000 years is not supported by the evidence.
The idea that CO2 has been the dominant driver of global temperature over the last 400,000 years is laughable.
Footnote
It is important to recognise that the formulae used here represent the internal workings of the climate models. There is no “climate denial” here, because the whole series of articles is based on the premise that the climate computer models are correct, using the mid-range ECS of 3.2.

"Worldwide, the use of Marine Protected Areas is recognised as an important strategy to safeguard marine biodiversity from the impact of over-fishing, pollution, and other environmental damage. In England, Part V of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 enables the establishment of protected areas of national importance, known as Marine Conservation Zones. The designation of 27 new zones was announced last month after a long consultation process. The designated number is low compared to the expectations, but this is not the only problem.   Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) should not be seen in isolation but as part of a wider network of protected areas across the UK to fulfil the requirements of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive. But MCZs are unique in that “socio-economic consequences” may be taken into account when deciding the boundaries and level of protection within these areas. This in practice meant embarking on an elaborate consultative, participatory, decision-making process over two years. This began in 2008, when England was divided into four regional projects which co-ordinated the involvement of various stakeholders such as conservation groups, fishers, energy companies, shipping and recreational sea users in the designation process. The aim of this exercise was not to dilute the conservation objectives of the protected areas – MCZs were to be designated on the best available evidence following a precautionary approach –but to contribute to a shared sense of ownership of the decision making.  After considering time and planning, in December 2012 the regional groups recommended the designation of 127 MCZs, but only 31 were put forward by the government for public consultation. The government justified this drastic drop in numbers by citing “lack of evidence”, and stated that more areas would be designated at later stages after gathering more evidence. The government’s proposal of such a small tranche of sites seemed in contradiction with the logic of using the best available evidence and with the precautionary approach. In more than 40,000 responses to the public consultation, many criticised the government’s decision to drastically reduce the number of potential MCZs on this basis. While these criticisms came chiefly from environmental organisations such as Fish Fight, RSPB and the Marine Conservation Society, disappointment was not only felt among the “usual suspects”, but by those whose livelihoods would be affected by the MCZs; mostly local, small-scale fishermen. Despite often being painted as the enemies of marine conservation, the fishermen I interviewed in the south east as part of my Ecologies and Identities project complained not about the number of sites, but about the selection process. Sold as participatory and inclusive, fishermen complained that the stakeholders’ discussions happened within pre-determined ecological parameters. They argued that their knowledge and views were not always included, and that the decision to put forward certain sites did not take due account of the costs of the loss of fishing grounds. The site of Hythe Bay was a case in point, with local fishers arguing that the area’s positive ecological trends meant the Hythe Bay MCZ should be designated with an aim of allowing fishers to continue their activities rather than be pushed out of a job. Instead, Hythe Bay was one of the 31 put forward for public consultation, while others that had broad support from fishermen and conservationists alike, such as Dover to Folkestone and Inner Bank, were dropped. Last month the Department for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, announced the formal designation of only 27 sites. Fewer still than the 31 sites in the public consultation document, Hythe Bay was among the two sites whose designation has been deferred, and a further two were declared unsuitable. Even for those small-scale fishermen in the south east celebrating a victory of sorts, essentially the problem – the weak participatory techniques used in the process of designation – remains intact and unquestioned. Despite the lengths gone to for the express purpose of ensuring that those with a stake in the zones were involved, the government ultimately ignored most of the proposed sites. It’s not clear this exercise was worthwhile as it failed to create a sense of shared ownership over the decision-making. The government in Scotland is progressing its own version of MCZs, using a different political process – it will be interesting to see how these issues are dealt with at Holyrood. But the problem is not just one of failed participatory ethics. The UK must meet its obligations to fulfil European Environmental Directives, to which a coherent network of marine protected areas is central. This was a point stressed repeatedly by the scientists advising on the MCZ process. So it is essential that the UK government remains committed to the full extent of the regional groups’ recommendations for 127 protected areas, and ensures that these MCZs are created in the near future."

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
Dr. Roy Spencer introduced the updated and much corrected UAH atmospheric temperature data in his blog post Version 6.0 of the UAH Temperature Dataset Released: New LT Trend = +0.11 C/decade.  The new temperature anomaly data for the lower troposphere, mid troposphere and lower stratosphere are presently in beta form for comment. That is, they’re not official…yet.  I suspect the update will not go over well with the catastrophic-anthropogenic-global-warming crowd.  Links to the version 6.0 beta data are at the bottom of Roy’s post, which also contains a detailed discussion of the updates.  So if you have questions, please ask them at Roy Spencer’s blog through the above link.  This post is a simple data presentation.
The version 6.0 beta temperature anomaly data for the lower troposphere used in this post are here.
In this post, we’ll take a quick look at the new UAH version 6.0 beta lower troposphere temperature anomaly data, comparing it to:

the current UAH version 5.6 data
the RSS lower troposphere temperature data.

But first…
BASED ON LINEAR TRENDS, THE NEW UAH LOWER TROPOSPHERE TEMPERATURE DATA SHOW NO WARMING FOR 18+ YEARS, LIKE RSS 
For Figure 1, I’ve extended the new UAH version 6.0 beta and the RSS lower troposphere temperature anomaly data as far back in time as they could go while showing no warming based on their linear trends.  The new UAH data show no warming for 219 months, and for the RSS data, it’s 220 months.

Figure 1
A QUICK OVERVIEW OF LOWER TROPOSPHERE TEMPERATURE DATA
The following is a reprint of the initial discussion of lower troposphere temperature data from the monthly updates. The most recent update is here.
Special sensors (microwave sounding units) aboard satellites have orbited the Earth since the late 1970s, allowing scientists to calculate the temperatures of the atmosphere at various heights above sea level.  The level nearest to the surface of the Earth is the lower troposphere. The lower troposphere temperature data include the altitudes of zero to about 12,500 meters, but are most heavily weighted to the altitudes of less than 3000 meters.  See the left-hand cell of the illustration here.  The lower troposphere temperature data are calculated from a series of satellites with overlapping operation periods, not from a single satellite. The monthly UAH lower troposphere temperature data is the product of the Earth System Science Center of the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). UAH provides the data broken down into numerous subsets.  See the webpage here [version 5.6 data].  The UAH lower troposphere temperature data are supported by Christy et al. (2000) MSU Tropospheric Temperatures: Dataset Construction and Radiosonde Comparisons.  Additionally, Dr. Roy Spencer of UAH presents at his blog the monthly UAH TLT data updates a few days before the release at the UAH website.  Those posts are also cross posted at WattsUpWithThat.  UAH uses the base years of 1981-2010 for anomalies. The UAH lower troposphere temperature data are for the latitudes of 85S to 85N, which represent more than 99% of the surface of the globe.
UAH VERSION 5.6 VERSUS UAH VERSION 6.0 BETA
Figure 2 compares the current version 5.6 UAH lower troposphere temperature anomaly data to the recently released version 6.0 beta. The comparisons start in the Januarys of 1979, 1998 and 2001 and run through March 2015.  The first full year of the UAH lower troposphere temperature data is 1979, while 1998 and 2001 are commonly used as start years during discussions of the recent slowdown in global surface and global lower troposphere temperatures. They are the same time periods we present in the monthly surface and lower troposphere temperature anomaly updates.  See the most recent update here.

Figure 2
Since 1979, the new version (v6.0 beta) of the UAH lower troposphere temperature data show a noticeably lower warming rate than current version 5.6 data.  For the periods starting in 1998 and 2001, the new beta version data show cooling of the lower troposphere based on the linear trends, while the current 5.6 version data show warming.
RSS VERSUS UAH VERSION 6.0 BETA
The warming rate since 1979 for the new UAH data is slightly less than (basically the same as) the lower troposphere temperature anomaly data from RSS. The shorter term cooling rates since 1998 and 2001 are also comparable.  See the graphs in Figure 3.

Figure 3
CLOSING
The RSS lower troposphere temperature data used to be an outlier, showing much lower trends than the surface temperature data and the UAH lower troposphere data. That will no longer be the case with the new UAH version 6.0 data.

A key feature of the U.S. economy is the dramatic increase in expenditures by all levels of government beginning in the 20th century. At the national level, the U.S. government annually spent roughly $142 (in 2017 dollars) per capita from the 1790s to the 1910s compared to $11,500 per capita in 2017.1 Expenditure growth outpaced the growth in income as well as population, with U.S. government expenditures accounting for 3.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1930 compared to 20.5 percent of GDP in 2017. The behavior of state government expenditures parallels that of the U.S. government: total state government spending increased from $1,470 (in 2017 dollars) per capita in 1960 to nearly $6,980 per capita in 2017. Total state government expenditures increased from 5.8 percent of GDP in 1960 to roughly 12 percent of GDP in 2017.



The growth in government has attracted considerable academic research that has generated numerous theories to explain (or partially explain) government growth in the United States. All theories assume that a market for public sector output and expenditures exists (Mueller 2003).2 The demand for government output and expenditures is determined by individual citizens or a collection of citizens organized into special interest groups. Essentially, demand-side theories argue that government has grown because citizens have demanded more government. These theories make use of the median-voter model (Downs 1957, 1961) to explain why citizens have had an increased demand for public goods (e.g., increased income) and a reduction in externalities (Baumol 1967; Ferris and West 1996; Mueller 2003), as well as a greater demand for more redistribution of income (Meltzer and Richard 1978, 1981, 1983).3 In addition, citizen-based interest groups can increase government size by organizing members and applying political pressure more effectively than individuals (Olson 1965; Becker 1983; Ekelund and Tollison 2001).



Supply-side theories of government growth argue that government expenditures are determined by legislators and bureaucrats who face certain incentives, the inherent inefficiencies in the provision of government goods, and the structure of government (e.g., representative democracy versus democracy). Niskanen’s (1971) theory of bureaucracy postulates that government bureaucrats maximize the size of their agencies’ budgets in accordance with their own preferences, and are able to do so because of the unique monopoly position of the bureaucrat.4 Fiscal illusion theory (Buchanan 1967) assumes that government, specifically legislators and the executive branch, can deceive voters as to the true size of government by using taxes and tax collection measures that are less obvious to citizens.5 Finally, the idea that representative governments behave as monopolists was first suggested by Breton (1974) and extended further by Brennan and Buchanan’s (1977, 1980) model of leviathan government where a monopoly government’s sole objective is to maximize revenue.6



It is not unreasonable to argue that government growth is likely the result of both demand-side and supply-side factors. Thus, research along these lines to deepen our understanding of the market for government output and expenditures seems warranted. In this article, we argue that the introduction of air conditioning in states’ capitol buildings was a permanent technology shock that may have contributed to the growth in state government output, and thus expenditures, by increasing the productivity (output per unit of labor input) of legislators, lobbyists, bureaucrats, and others involved in producing government output and expenditures. We also argue that the effects of air conditioning would have been most pronounced in warmer states.



The following quotations suggest that the hypotheses of this article merit more rigorous attention:



The installation of air conditioning in the 1930s did more, I believe, than cool the Capitol, . . . . members were no longer in a hurry to flee Washington. The southerners especially had no place else to go that was half as comfortable [Martin 1960: 49].



Six months of every year, the nation enjoyed a respite from the promulgation of more laws, the depredation of lobbyists, the hatching of new schemes for Federal expansion and, of course, the cost of maintaining a government running at full blast. Once air conditioning arrived, Congress had twice has much time to exercise its skill at regulating and plucking the population [Baker 1978: 6].



Prior to air conditioning, attempts to cool buildings or rooms, including those in states’ capitols, were typically done with electric fans or swamp coolers (which worked on the principle of evaporation), neither of which reliably cooled rooms to comfortable levels (Arsenault 1984).7 Air conditioning, however, effectively lowered both room temperatures and humidity levels, thus greatly improving working and living conditions. There is little doubt that the introduction of air conditioning transformed society during the 20th century by increasing the productive efficiency of businesses and households (Arsenault 1984; Cooper 1998; Solomon 2003). There is thus reason to presume that the public sector was also influenced by the transformative and productivity-enhancing effects of air conditioning.



Our theory of government growth is not an independent explanation for growth but rather a contributing explanation. That is, we take the supply-side and demand-side factors as given and reasonable and argue that the introduction and existence of air-conditioning has _enhanced_ the supply-side and demand-side factors that have been hypothesized to influence state government growth — for example, lobbying in states’ capitols by citizens and legislators became more pleasant and occurred all year without summer break. While we are agnostic about the precise effect of air conditioning on specific supply-side and demand-side factors that influence state government growth, it seems reasonable to suggest that air conditioning could have a direct effect on the productivity of all parties involved in producing government output just as it did for households and businesses.



The analysis proceeds in several steps. As a motivation for our empirical methodology, we first present a simple model of technological growth to demonstrate how the introduction and subsequent existence of air conditioning in a state capitol may have led to increased growth in state government output. A brief discussion is then provided to motivate the link between state government output and state government expenditures. We then discuss the panel data, identification strategy, and the empirical methodology that is used in order to test our hypothesis that the growth in state government expenditures was greater after the introduction of air conditioning in states’ capitols. Finally, we present our empirical results, which support our hypothesis that the growth in state government expenditures was higher after the introduction of air conditioning in state capitols, and that this effect was more pronounced in the warmer southern states.



As the starting point for our conceptual framework, it is important to first examine how the introduction of air conditioning could have influenced the growth in the output of state governments. As discussed shortly, there is a direct link between the growth in government output and the growth in government expenditures.



We assume that the introduction of air conditioning, both generally and in state capitols, acted as a one-time and permanent labor-augmenting technology shock.8 Let the labor-augmenting technology be represented by the parameter _A_ , where _A_ = 1 before the labor-augmenting technology shock and _A_ >1 after the technology shock. We can write a representative production function for a state government’s output ( _q_ ) as



 _q_ = _q(K, A_ • _L),_



where _K_ and _L_ are capital and labor inputs, respectively.9 Rewriting the above production function as a function of time to capture output growth as a result of air conditioning gives



(1)



 _q_ ( _t_ ) = _q_ ( _K_ ( _t_ ), _A_ • _L_ ( _t_ )).



Totally differentiating with respect to _t_ yields





Dividing both sides by _q_ gives





or, equivalently,



(2)





Rewriting in familiar terms gives the following expression for output growth due to labor-augmenting technological progress:



(3)





where ε _q,K_ is the elasticity of output with respect to capital and ε _q,L_ is the elasticity of output with respect to labor.10 It should be clear from (3) that output growth, , is higher after the introduction of air conditioning ( _A_ > 1) than before the introduction of air conditioning ( _A_ = 1), regardless of whether the usage of inputs remains constant or increases over time.11 Note that the technology shock essentially increases output by increasing the marginal product of labor, (∂ _q/_ ∂ _L_ ) • _A_ , in equation (2) even if the quantity of labor remains constant.



There is a clear link between government output and government expenditures; namely, that government expenditures reflect the total cost of producing total government output.12 This cost not only includes the cost of inputs but also the cost of maintaining government programs (social programs, military, etc.). Thus, our line of reasoning is that air conditioning in a state’s capitol was a positive technology shock that increased legislative output in a state capitol by “shifting up” the government production function, which resulted in an increase in the total output of the respective state government. This increase in total output then resulted in an increase in state government expenditures after the introduction of air conditioning.



We also argue that air conditioning enhanced the supply-side and demand-side factors that have been argued to also contribute to government growth. On the demand side, the presence of air conditioning in state capitols may have facilitated lobbying by consumer and business interests by making lobbying more comfortable, thus leading to additional legislative output and, following the explanation made earlier, ultimately an increase in government expenditures. On the supply side, theory and evidence suggest that governments are not cost minimizers. The additional total physical output due to air conditioning would therefore not be produced at the lowest cost. In other words, air conditioning would have further increased the cost inefficiencies of government, thus increasing state government expenditures even more.



It is worthwhile to summarize our conceptual framework and resulting hypothesis, as both serve as the basis for our empirical setup. Government output and expenditures were increasing before the introduction of air conditioning due to changes in input usage as well as supply-side and demand-side factors. The introduction of air conditioning was a one-time, permanent technology shock that increased output and expenditures by not only increasing the marginal product of labor, but also by enhancing the supply-side and demand-side factors that have been found to contribute to government growth. This implies that the average annual growth rate of state government expenditures was greater after the introduction of air conditioning. In the following section we discuss the empirical methodology used to test our hypothesis.



We use a panel dataset of U.S. states in order to test our hypothesis that the growth of state government expenditures was greater after the introduction of air conditioning in each state’s capitol. In order to account for population growth that has occurred over time (which would affect the government expenditures via the supply and demand for government), our dependent variable is real per capita state government expenditure.13 Our empirical approach is to examine whether the trend-rate of growth in state government expenditures, where the trend captures the behavior of expenditures due to all aforementioned supply and demand factors, was greater after the introduction of air conditioning, especially in warmer states.



Testing for differences in the trend-rate of growth in state expenditures before and after air conditioning requires identifying the point in time in which the “break” in the trend occurred. Our identification of this break in trend is the year in which air conditioning was installed in each state capitol. One issue we faced was how to define the existence of “air conditioning.” Prior to the installation of central air-conditioning systems, some offices in state capitols had window air-conditioning units that cooled individual offices while leaving many other offices, conference rooms, and the legislative chambers uncooled. We consider the year when central air conditioning (e.g., HVAC) was introduced throughout the entire state capitol as the date in which air conditioning was introduced.



Much effort went into contacting state historians, legislative archivists, and even “old-timers” who had worked in the state capitol for decades, in order to determine when air conditioning was installed in each state capitol. We were able to obtain air-conditioning installation dates (years) for 21 states. The first year after each state installed air conditioning in its capitol building serves as the break in the trend for each state’s expenditure growth that we test for in our empirical models.



As suggested earlier, it seems likely that the effect of air conditioning on state government expenditures would differ depending upon the relative difference in indoor air temperature due to air conditioning compared to indoor air temperature without air conditioning. That is, the relative increase in indoor comfort levels due to air conditioning would be greater in the states with warmer and more humid climates compared to the states with cooler and less humid climates. Thus, the hypothesized effects of air conditioning should be greater in warmer and more humid states. To explore this possibility, our empirical analysis considers the impact of air conditioning on state government expenditures in “warm” states compared to “cool” states.



We followed several steps in order to classify each of the 21 states in our sample as either a “warm” state or a “cool” state. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) defines an uncomfortable and potentially dangerous heat-index level as that above 80 degrees Fahrenheit.14 Thus, we classify a state as “warm” (“cool”) if its average summertime heat index is above (below) 80. To calculate the summertime heat index for each state, we used the primary formula used by NOAA.15 This formula requires data on air temperature and humidity levels. For each state, we therefore obtained the average air temperature and humidity levels over the months of June, July, and August in 2010 for each state’s capital city.16 We then calculated the heat index for each state’s capital city and used the heat index benchmark of 80 to either classify the state as a warm state or a cool state.



Not surprisingly, it turned out that warm states had air conditioning installed sooner than many cool states. In order to be able to make a comparison between the effect of the introduction of air conditioning in warm and cool states, we omitted from our final sample those cool states that had air conditioning installed much later than any warm state. Our final sample includes all seven warm states for which we were able to obtain the dates of air conditioning installation and five cool states that had air conditioning installed during the same time period as warm states. Table 1 presents the 12 states in our panel of data, the year that air conditioning was installed in each state’s capitol, and the classification of each state as “warm” or “cool.” In these 12 states, air conditioning in the capitol buildings was installed between 1959 and 1969.17 In order to ensure a sufficient number of year-observations before and after the introduction of air conditioning, our panel includes the years 1950–75.18





Our empirical objective is to test whether the trend growth in state expenditures is larger after the introduction of air conditioning, and whether the difference in expenditure growth as a result of air conditioning varies between warm states and cool states. To meet this objective, we first created binary variables that denote whether a state is warm or cool, as well as a variable that denotes the presence of air conditioning in each state’s capitol. We construct the variable _Cool_ that has a value of ‘1’ if state _i_ has been classified as cool, and has a value of ‘0’ if state _i_ has been classified as warm. Similarly, we construct another binary variable _Warm_ that has a value of ‘1’ if state _i_ has been classified as warm, and has a value of ‘0’ if state _i_ has been classified as cool. The variable _PostAC_ has a value of ‘1’ for all years in which air conditioning was present in each state’s capitol, and has a value ‘0’ otherwise. We also create a linear time trend variable ( _Trend_ ) to capture the growth in state government expenditures, where _Trend_ _t_ = _t_ for years (observations) _t_ = 1, 2, . . . 26.



The variables we use in our empirical models are as follows. The variable _WarmTrend_ _it_ is constructed as _Warm_ _it_ • _Trend_ _t_ , and this variable captures the time trend for all states classified as warm. Similarly, the variable _CoolTrend_ _it_ is constructed as _Cool_ _it_ • _Trend_ _t_ , and this variable captures the time trend for all states classified as cool. These two variables are then interacted with the variable _PostAC_ to arrive at the variables _WarmTrendPostA_ C _it_ and _CoolTrendPostA_ C _it_. With these variables in hand, we can specify our regression equation as



(4)



 _G_ _it_ = _a_ 0 \+ _a_ 1 • _WarmTrend_ _it_ \+ _a_ 2 _WarmTrendPostAC_ _it_ +  
 _a_ _3_ • _CoolTrend_ _it_ \+ _a_ 4 • _CoolTrendPostAC_ _it_ \+ _a_ 5 •  
 _Inc_ _it_ \+ δ _i_ \+ _θ D60_ \+ _θ D70_ \+ δ _i_ • _θ D60_ \+ δ _i_ • _θ D70_ \+ ε _it_ ,



where _i_ denotes each state ( _i_ = 1, 2 . . . 12) and _t_ denotes each year ( _t_ = 1, 2, . . . 26) in our sample of panel data. The dependent variable, _G_ , is total state government expenditures. We first specify this variable as the natural log of real per capita expenditures so that the trend coefficients reflect the average annual growth rate of expenditures. As an alternative measure, we also estimate this regression with the dependent variable measured as the level of real per capita state expenditures. Fixed state-effects ( _δ i_) are included to account for cross-state heterogeneity, as well as allowing the initial level of government growth to differ by state. Fixed decade-effects ( _θ D_60 and _θ D_70) are included to account for decade-specific shifts in government expenditures. We also interact these decade-effects with each state’s fixed-effect to account for state-specific decade-effects, such as crisis episodes (Higgs 1987; Bologna and Young 2016), changes in the federal/state relationship (Sobel and Crowley 2014) that have been shown to be state specific and have differing effects on state government expenditures, and other technological changes (e.g., the introduction of computers) that may have occurred. Finally, we include per capita state personal income ( _Inc_ _it_ ) to control for the demand-side effect of income growth on government expenditures. Our key trend variables thus capture the behavior of government expenditures due to all possible aforementioned reasons except income growth.



The interpretation of the coefficients of interest in equation (4) is as follows. When the dependent is specified as the natural log of real per capita expenditures, the coefficient _α_ 2 reflects the growth in government expenditures for warm states after the introduction of air conditioning _relative_ to the growth in government expenditures for warm states prior to the introduction of air conditioning ( _α_ 1). Similarly, the coefficient α4 reflects the growth in government expenditures for cool states after the introduction of air conditioning _relative_ to the growth in government expenditures for cool states prior to the introduction of air conditioning ( _α_ 3). When the dependent variable is specified as the level of real per capita expenditures, _α_ 2 and _α_ 4 reflect the marginal difference in per capita spending after air conditioning relative to spending before air conditioning in warm and cool states, respectively. As stated earlier, the goal of our empirical framework is not to determine the significant factors that explain the growth in the state government expenditures, but rather to see if there is a break in the trend (where the trend reflects the behavior of government expenditures due to all possible aforementioned reasons, except income) after the introduction of air conditioning.



It is worthwhile to briefly discuss our expected empirical results based upon the previous conceptual framework. Regarding warm state capitols, it seems reasonable that air conditioning would have likely resulted in a significant marginal improvement in comfort levels, and thus productivity and expenditures. If air conditioning increased the growth in government spending in warm state capitols, we expect to find that _α_ 2 is positive and statistically significant. However, with respect to cool states, the marginal improvement in comfort levels as a result of air conditioning may not have had a significant impact on subsequent expenditure growth. More importantly, however, if air conditioning had a greater impact on expenditures growth in warm states than it did in cool states, we should find that _α_ 2 is significantly larger than _α_ 4.



This section presents the empirical results from equation (4) as well as the results from the above-mentioned hypothesis tests. In addition, we present empirical results from growth regressions that consider various components of state government spending.



The Growth Rate of State Government Expenditures before and after Air Conditioning



The empirical estimates for equation (4) with the dependent variable specified as the natural log of real per capita expenditures (so the trend coefficients reflect the average annual growth rate of expenditures) are shown in the first column of Table 2. We find that, not surprisingly, expenditure growth in both warm and cool states was increasing before the introduction of air conditioning, where warm states had an average growth rate of 4.6 percent and cool states had an average growth rate of 4.1 percent. Per our hypothesis, we wish to examine whether the growth in expenditures was higher after the introduction of air conditioning in the capitols. For warm states, we find that the relative annual expenditure growth in warm states after the introduction of air conditioning was 0.29 percentage points larger than annual expenditure growth before the introduction of air conditioning. For cool states, we find no statistically significant change after the introduction of air conditioning. Per the bottom of column (1), this difference in expenditure growth for warm states after air conditioning is found to be statistically larger (0.20 percentage points) than expenditure growth in cool states after air conditioning. In sum, the results in column (1) support our conceptual hypothesis as well as the notion that the introduction of air conditioning in cool states may not have resulted in significant marginal improvement in comfort levels to influence productivity and expenditures.







Having shown that the growth in state government expenditures in warm states was higher after the introduction of air conditioning, we now examine whether the growth rate of various components of state government spending were similarly affected by the introduction of air conditioning. Doing so not only provides additional support for our hypothesis but provides insight into the underlying drivers of the previous results for total state government expenditures. We consider four components of state government spending in the subsequent analysis: education spending, health spending, welfare spending, and transfer payments to local governments. Equation (4) is estimated for each component of state government spending, where the dependent variables are now the natural logarithm of each of the four components of state government expenditures. The results from these regressions are shown in column (2) through column (5) of Table 2.



The results are similar to our findings for total state government expenditures. There was positive growth in per capita expenditures in each component of state government expenditures in both cool states and warm states before introduction of air conditioning. After the introduction of air conditioning in warm states, the spending growth rate for each component except welfare was higher. In addition, the increase in the growth rates of education spending and transfer payment spending in warm states after air conditioning are greater than the increase in spending on these categories in cool states after the introduction of air conditioning, as evident from the _t_ -tests shown at the bottom of Table 2. There was no statistically significant difference between increases in spending on health and welfare between warm and cold states.



State Government Expenditures before and after Air Conditioning



Here we repeat the previous analyses but use the _level_ of real per capita expenditures instead of the natural logarithm. These results are presented in Table 3. First considering total state government expenditures, the results in column (1) show that per capita expenditures have increased after the introduction of air conditioning in both warm and cool states. Specifically, per capita expenditures increased by $5.13 per capita in warm states after the introduction of air conditioning and by $1.42 dollars in cool states after the introduction of air conditioning. As shown in the bottom of column (1), the difference in the relative effects ($3.71) for warm state and cool states is statistically significant. Considering the four components to total spending in column (2) through column (5), we find that per capita spending on all the components has increased after introduction of air conditioning in both warm and cool states. The effect of air conditioning was greater in warm states than in cool states for per capita expenditures on education, health care, and transfer payments, with significant differences of $1.83, $0.23, and $1.74, respectively.







Previous research has found that the introduction of air conditioning led to a substantial increase in the productivity of households and businesses, especially those located in warmer climates. In this paper we argued that a contributing reason for the growth in state government expenditures that occurred during the latter half of the 20th century was due in part to the introduction of air conditioning in state capitols. Our conceptual framework of state government production demonstrated that the introduction of air conditioning in state capitols was a positive technology shock that would have increased the productivity of all demand-side and supply-side groups involved in producing public sector output. By collecting and assembling a unique data set containing the various dates when air conditioning was installed in state capitols, we tested our hypothesis using a quasi-experimental empirical framework.



Our empirical work supports our hypothesis. We find that the annual rate of growth in expenditures for warmer states was significantly higher after the introduction of air conditioning in these state capitols than was the annual growth of expenditures in cooler states. In addition, we also find that the growth rates for each of several components of government spending — education, health care, transfer to local governments — were significantly higher in warmer states after the introduction of air conditioning compared with cooler states. Similar results were obtained with per capita expenditures. Both our conceptual framework and empirical results not only contribute to the literature on government growth, but they also provide a contribution to the literature on the productivity effects of air conditioning.

2Also see Garrett and Rhine (2006) for a more thorough discussion of demand-side and supply-side theories of government growth.



3The median voter’s demand for government is typically modeled as a function of income, the relative price of public goods to private goods, and tastes.



4Mueller (2003: chap. 16) provides a summary of 70 studies that examined the cost of public- versus private-sector provision of identical services. The majority of studies find that public provision is more costly.



5Examples include the federal withholding of income taxes and property tax collection through monthly mortgage payments



6Breton (1974) argues that the party in control of the legislature has an objective function that includes the probability of reelection, personal pecuniary gain, and the pursuit of personal ideals. While providing basic public goods, a monopoly government can obtain its objectives by bundling narrowly defined issues that benefit individual members of the government (see Tullock 1959).



7We discuss different types of air conditioning (e.g., window units versus central systems) later in the article.



8We argue that air conditioning was a labor-augmenting shock since government output is predominantly determined by the actions of citizens and legislators. However, the impact of technological growth on output is similar regardless of how the technology is specified (e.g., capital augmenting or augmenting both inputs).



9We assume that there was no technological progress in air conditioning. Dropping this assumption would give us a parameter _A_ that is a function of time, resulting in output growth being a function of technological growth in air conditioning over time. While technology may have improved the efficiency and cost of air-conditioning systems over time, it is unlikely there would have been significant improvements in the cooling ability of subsequent air-conditioning systems since initial air-conditioning systems already provided cool and low-humidity environments (Arsenault 1984).



10Recall that the growth rate of any variable _x_ per unit of time is _ẋ_ = ( _dx/ x_ )/ _dt_.



11It is certainly possible that the introduction of air conditioning would have also increased labor supply and hours worked. Air conditioning in state capitols made the workplace more pleasant; thus, on the margin, employees would work more hours and consume fewer leisure hours. More hours worked would then have led to an increase in output. Unfortunately, we cannot isolate this effect with the available data.



12Measures of government output have included the number of bills, acts, or statutes (termed legislative output) enacted during a specified period of time, as well as legislative session length (Mayhew 1991; Howell et al. 2002; Clinton and Lapinski 2006). More legislative output will increase the total output of the respective public sector by increasing, for example, the scope and number of agencies, the number of new social programs, and, ultimately, expenditures on these programs, and so on. In our empirical models, we use government spending rather than the aforementioned government output measures due to the annual availability and consistency of expenditure data across states compared with state-specific data on bills, acts, or statutes (e.g., more bills or statutes passed in one state does not necessary imply that that state will have higher expenditures, because expenditures depend upon the purpose of the bills and statutes). We argue that government spending is a more comprehensive measure of (the dollar value of) government activity than bills, acts, statutes, or session length because spending not only captures the effects of the number of bills, acts, statutes, and session length, but also the demand-side and supply-side factors that occur outside of the legislative session.



13All state government expenditure data were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau’s _State Government Finances_ (various years). State population data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. All data are in CPI base-year dollars (1983).

16Air temperature and humidity data are readily available from The Weather Underground at www.wunderground.com/history.



17The omitted cool states (Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) had air conditioning installed in their capitol buildings as late as 1992.



18In addition to ensuring a sufficient number of years pre– and post–air conditioning, we chose to end our sample in 1975 to (1) avoid potential confounding effects from the national and state fiscal crises of the late 1970s, and (2) to best capture the effects of air conditioning that are likely to be seen soon after the introduction of air conditioning rather than later years due to dilution of the potential effect over time. Similar results are obtained using alternative end-dates around 1975. These results are available from the authors.

Last week the Trump administration announced its intent to freeze Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards (CAFE) at 2020 levels. Rules implemented in 2012 under the Obama administration would require a fleet average fuel economy of 54.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by 2025, but the new rule change would instead hold average fuel economy at about 37 mpg.   
  
Predictably, the announcement created a flurry of criticism, with the _New York Times_ editorial board characterizing the plan as reckless in the face of climate change. Much of this criticism misses a key point: CAFE has been repurposed to manage a problem for which it was not designed and is thus a very costly and imperfect remedy.   
  
Enacted after the 1973-74 oil shock, CAFE was a political solution to a political problem: soaring oil prices. The standards were premised on the belief that consumers would not pay more for cars that used less fuel even if the reduced fuel use more than paid for the extra initial cost. Instead, CAFE sought to force automakers to produce higher mileage cars and thereby reduce fuel use despite the supposed myopia of consumers. But subsequent economic research has shown that consumers were not myopic. Consumers’ willingness to pay for higher mileage capability approximately equals the expected future fuel cost savings without government intervention.   
  
Even though the original rationale for CAFE has been undermined by the evidence, CAFE lives on with a new purpose: climate change. Since the 2007 Supreme Court decision in _Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency_ that the EPA has authority to regulate tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions, CAFE has become a tool for CO2 emissions reduction. But, as I have previously argued and my colleague Randal O’Toole recently discussed, CAFE is an inefficient and clumsy tool because it targets only one source of greenhouse gas emissions and it does so indirectly. Directly taxing carbon emissions would much more effectively incentivize businesses and consumers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The indirect CAFE program costs the economy at least six times as much as a carbon tax that reduces emissions equivalently. If reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a worthwhile goal, we should pursue policies that directly address the problem and utilize market forces to reduce emissions.   




Another key component of the Trump administration’s plan is its proposal to revoke a waiver that allows California to set its own vehicle emissions standards and allows other states to follow California’s lead. Currently, California standards are set to continue on the Obama 2012 path. So, if the Trump administration freezes national standards but California’s separate standards are permitted, then automakers would be forced either to sell different cars in California and the states that follow its lead or comply with California standards in all states.   
  
The origin of the California waiver, like CAFE in general, is divorced from its original intent. The waiver’s purpose was to allow California to impose its own regulations on conventional emissions because of unique weather and geographic conditions around Los Angeles that make it especially susceptible to smog.   
  
Smog forming pollutants and greenhouse gases are very different emissions. As I noted in the 2017 _Cato Handbook for Policymakers_ , regulation of pollutants that affect local air quality should be decentralized because both the costs and benefits are local. But reduction of CO2 emissions is a global public good. Any benefits accrue to the world’s climate even though the costs are local. This mismatch between the geographic incidence of costs and benefits imply that a waiver that exempts one state makes no sense in the context of CO2 emissions and has the potential to unduly increase compliance costs for automakers.   
  
CAFE should have ended a long time ago. The problem for which it was designed (consumer myopia) never existed. Because that is not politically possible the proposed freeze is defensible. In contrast state control of conventional pollutants is appropriate, but the California waiver should not be repurposed for greenhouse gas emissions.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online daily Berliner Zeitung (BZ) here reports that German consumers in 2015 have “never paid so much money for supporting renewable energy.”
Wind energy is hugely expensive and doesn’t work well. Photo: NTZ
Some 15 years ago German Environment Minister, Jürgen Trittin, wanted the public to believe that Germany’s Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) would only cost consumers about as much as one scoop of ice cream per month. Since those famous words were spoken that scoop has ballooned to a jumbo bucket of Ben and Jerry’s.
Never have German consumers paid so much for electricity. Indeed one study concluded that the high cost of electricity in Germany is resulting in hundreds of thousands of German households having their power cut off because families can no longer afford the high electric bills – see here and here. It just goes to show that under reckless political management even a scoop of ice cream can become a luxury.
The BZ reports:

According to media reports, 24.1 billion euros were paid out to green energy producers last year. That is 2.6 billion euros, or 12 percent, more than in 2014.”
The costs are rising so fast that some leading politicians are (finally) beginning to sound the alarms. The BZ writes that leading conservative politician Michael Fuchs of Angela Merkel’s CDU party “fears the worst“, telling the flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that the Energiewende “is on the best path to becoming a financial disaster”.
And despite the massive investment, wind energy was only able to deliver 13% of Germany’s electricity needs last year – and that in a year which was a relatively windy one.
What will be the consequence of all the Bernie-Sanders-“free” green energy in the future? The Berliner Zeitung writes: “Higher costs”.
One reason for the higher costs, the BZ writes, is because of the governments plan to boost investment in offshore wind parks – and slow down the construction of onshore parks. The problem with that plan is that offshore wind energy is far more expensive. Offshore wind park operators are guaranteed up to 19.4 euro-cents per kilowatt-hour – which is some three times more than what onshore operators get.
And there’s still remains the problem of getting offshore wind energy to markets inland.

"**Ethiopia's forces have captured two towns in the northern region of Tigray where soldiers loyal to the local political party are fighting the central government.**
Tigray's leader confirmed the losses but said it was a temporary setback and vowed to defeat the government.
Ethiopia's prime minister has said that his army is advancing on the Tigrayan capital Mekelle.
Hundreds of people have reportedly died in two weeks of clashes.
Verifying information from Tigray is hard due to a blackout on most communications.
The conflict is rooted in long-standing tension between powerful regional party the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and Ethiopia's central government.
When Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed postponed a national election due to coronavirus in June, tension escalated between the two groups. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate to lead the country.
The government accused the TPLF of attacking a military base to steal weapons, which the TPLF denied. In response, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive, accusing the TPLF of treason.
Government forces seized the towns of Shire and Raya after a three-day deadline given by Prime Minister Abiy to Tigray's forces to surrender expired on Tuesday.
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael, who was born in Shire, confirmed to a local TV station that his soldiers had lost control of the towns in the south and west of Tigray. But he said their victory was temporary and he vowed to defeat Mr Abiy's forces.
As fighting raged on Wednesday, Mr Gebremichael said his forces were inflicting ""heavy defeats on all fronts against the forces that came to attack us"". He called on all Tigrayans including children to mobilise and join the ""struggle"".
Ethiopian officials accused the TPLF of destroying four bridges close to the Tigray capital Mekelle, but the group denied the claims.
The prime minister suggested on Tuesday that the fighting was coming to an end, saying ""the final critical act of law enforcement will be done in the coming days"".
At least 27,000 people have fled over the northern border to Sudan as the UN warned a ""full-scale humanitarian crisis"" was unfolding.
TPLF adviser Fesseha Tessema, a former Ethiopian diplomat, told the BBC that civilian sites in Mekelle were being bombed by federal forces.
""[The people of Tigray] haven't done anything wrong, they are in their own homes, churches,"" Mr Fesseha said.
The federal government has denied targeting civilians and said that air attacks are aimed at the Tigrayan military.
**By a BBC reporter in Mekelle**
A deadly air strike just before noon on Tuesday killed two people and injured others in Mekelle, doctors said. It is not yet clear who carried it out.
I was out on the streets shortly afterwards and saw an ambulance carrying people to hospital. Witnesses told me a young boy - one of the wounded - died on arrival, and three others are still receiving treatment.
Because the banks had reopened, people in the city were out shopping at the time the incident took place. There have been other strikes in the city which did not cause casualties but caused a lot of damage to buildings.
I went out to assess the situation and found houses with collapsed walls and roofs, and bridges destroyed. Artillery has created craters on key roads. Local people have been milling around in the affected areas, discussing the attacks and the damage.
The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, has said that thousands of people have been fleeing the fighting.
The agency was ""on stand-by to provide assistance in Tigray when access and security allow"" spokesman Babar Baloch said.
""There may be massive displacement inside Tigray and that is of course a concern and we try to prepare the best way possible,"" Jens Laerke, spokesman of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said.
The UN fears the numbers fleeing Ethiopia may be just a fraction of those forced from their homes by the fighting, but for the moment aid agencies have no access to the Tigray region.
Regional powers Kenya and Uganda have called for negotiations to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
The Ethiopian government has, however, ruled out talks with the TPLF.
Human rights group Amnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) on Monday last week.
Mr Abiy has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings. The TPLF has denied involvement, saying it will welcome an independent international investigation.
Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate.
The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms.
Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join.
The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea.
The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority.2

"UN inspectors descend on Iran this week to visit the Arak heavy water plant, and engineers at the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plants in Japan attempt one of the most challenging nuclear salvage operations ever. But below the headlines is a potential expansion of nuclear energy not seen since the 1970s and 80s. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s international nuclear watchdog, 29 countries are considering constructing their first nuclear power plant. There are doubts as to which of these nuclear “newcomer” countries can actually succeed and join the 31 countries that already operate nuclear reactors. One thing’s for sure: these countries will need to import the technology and most of the skilled manpower required from existing nuclear operators to get their programmes off the ground. But newcomers to nuclear energy have found that this is a market with few suppliers. According to last year’s Global Energy Assessment, only 12 companies in just eight countries have the capacity to construct the pressure vessels which are central to the construction of a nuclear power plant. So, while nuclear power can shield countries from the price volatility of gas and coal – the main competitors to nuclear-generated electricity – those states wishing to deploy it must deal with an industry with the most concentrated supply chain of any of the major energy sources today. However, according to a study from 2011, very few newcomers have the capacity and motivation necessary to build a nuclear power plant. Of the 30 countries with operating nuclear power plants today, all were started before 1986, the year of the fateful Chernobyl accident. Historically, countries started nuclear power programs to increase electricity generation in response to rising demand. Most of these countries were rich and politically stable with economies big enough to absorb the necessary state investment. But few countries match this profile – in fact a third of newcomer states rank among the 50 most unstable countries in the world such as Bangladesh, Nigeria and Egypt. There are only a few examples of nuclear power programmes that began during periods of political instability, and those went along with the pursuit of nuclear weapons (in Argentina, Brazil, India and Pakistan). This gives some indication of the degree of political commitment required to overcome investor anxiety in the face of an unpredictable political landscape. Even with the limited choice of suppliers, newcomers have found willing partners eager to expand into new markets, as some existing markets decline following the disaster at Fukushima in 2011. The prime minister of Japan recently signed export agreements with Turkey and the UAE, and Russia has agreed to finance nuclear power plants in Turkey and Belarus. Nicolas Sarkozy, former French president and a famous proponent of expanding nuclear power into the developing world (it already provides more than two thirds of France’s electricity), went so far as to say the industry holds “the reputation and image of France in their hands”. Few other industries receive such high level financial and rhetorical support. In Belarus and UAE, states in which construction has started on their first nuclear power plant, nuclear suppliers are playing a critical role. This is most pronounced in Belarus – a small country with a limited domestic electricity grid, it would not be able to afford such a project without Russian finance. Ironically, this is also the country where the benefits of nuclear power could be the lowest: the deal would diversify the nation’s energy supply from today’s reliance on gas from Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom, only as far as adding nuclear power from Russian state-owned nuclear firm Rosatom. The spread of nuclear technology raises three main concerns: safety, physical security and proliferation. Safety means preventing accidental system and equipment failures. Physical security means guarding against nuclear materials or fissile material falling into the wrong hands. Proliferation involves the spread of nuclear weapons or other fissile material to new countries. In terms of accidents, there is nothing intrinsically unsafe about more countries operating nuclear power plants. Nuclear newcomers should and presumably will be held to the same safety standards as existing nuclear operators. A new code of conduct for Nuclear Power Plant Exporters commits to adhering to international safety requirements. Some experts argue that after Fukushima, newcomers are that much more concerned about implementing the highest safety procedures. A similar argument could be made in terms of physical security, but the instability of some states with nuclear ambitions causes concern, such as the Chinese deal to supply nuclear tech to  Pakistan. The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material is meant to combat the risk of nuclear power falling into the wrong hands. But of the three countries which have already signed a contract for their first nuclear power plant, only the UAE has ratified the Convention. Perhaps the trickiest risk to counter is that of proliferation. Nuclear Power Plant Exporters provide nuclear power “exclusively for peaceful purposes”. Additionally, the nuclear supply chain companies typically restrict the sale of uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing equipment. For example, in the UAE’s nuclear deal with the US – hailed as a model – the UAE agreed to forgo domestic uranium enrichment, the part of the nuclear cycle most closely linked to proliferation. Conventional wisdom is that countries which pursue nuclear power are not more likely pursue nuclear weapons, however a recent study found that even civilian nuclear co-operation increases the risk of nuclear proliferation by spreading material, equipment and know-how. If even half of the national plans for nuclear power plants materialise, the geography of nuclear energy would radically change and could revitalise a stagnant industry. But given the obstacles to starting a national nuclear power programme even for rich and stable countries, it’s not likely to happen quickly elsewhere."

Only science deniers don’t believe in catastrophe
By Kenneth Richard
Now that the latest James Hansen catastrophic sea level rise paper (Hansen et al., 2016) has been affirmed by peer review, it has, according to Slate‘s meteorologist Eric Holthaus, been effectively “canonized.”   In other words, it has become scientifically authoritative.
James Hansen’s Bombshell Warning Is Now Part of the Scientific Canon”
The paper, which has undergone some wording revisions since the original version appeared last July (so that it could be accepted for publication), apparently “concludes” that the polar ice sheets will soon melt catastrophically; this ice sheet melt contribution will in turn result in sea level rise of “at least 10 feet in as little as 50 years” according to a summation from the same Eric Holthaus:
The study—written by James Hansen, NASA’s former lead climate scientist, and 16 co-authors, many of whom are considered among the top in their fields—concludes that glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica will melt 10 times faster than previous consensus estimates, resulting in sea level rise of at least 10 feet in as little as 50 years.
Putting aside for the moment that (a) Greenland’s vast interior ice sheet has been melting more slowly in recent decades than it has for 95% of the last 9,000 years (MacGregor et al., 2016), or that (b) the West Antarctic Peninsula melted faster during the Medieval Warm Period than it has in recent decades (Guglielmin et al., 2016), or that (c) the northern Antarcitc Peninsula melted 10 times more slowly between 2003-2014 than it did between 1995 and 2003 (Seehaus et al., 2015)…
Or, putting aside that (d) the rate of sea level rise contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets combined was just 2.3 inches per century (0.59 mm/year) between 1992 and 2011 (Shepherd et al., 2012).
Alas, with inconveniences put aside, Hansen’s claim of 10 feet of sea level rise in 50 years has nonetheless been officially anointed as scientifically authoritative anyway.  Therefore, to deny the conclusions of Hansen’s paper is tantamount to denying climate science. After all, that’s what science deniers do.  They deny canonized climate science like Hansen’s sea level rise forecasts.
To avoid being characterized as a science denier, one effectively must believe that the sea level rise contribution from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets combined will catapult from the current rate of 0.23 of an inch per decade (Shepherd et al., 2012) to 10, 50, or perhaps 100 times that rate so as to reach 24 inches per decade total sea level rise through the mid-2060s (so that Hansen’s sea level rise estimate of “at least 10 feet in as little as 50 years” can be realized).
Don’t agree that one should be categorized as a science denier if she or he doesn’t agree with Hansen’s catastrophic melt and sea level rise forecasts?  Well, that immediately begs the question: How many meters (or feet) of sea level rise must one believe in to avoid being labeled a science denier?  If one believes in only 2 meters (~7 feet) of sea level rise by 2100, for example, is that denying canonized climate science?
The IPCC’s last two reports (2007, 2013) confer sea level rise forecasts ranging from a low threshold of 18 cm to a high threshold of 98 cm (between 7 and 39 inches) by 2100.  One would assume, then, that with the scientific canonization of Hansen’s latest paper, the low range IPCC estimates are now effectively in the science denier camp.  If not science denier, how else does one categorize a forecast of just 7 or 10 or 12 inches of sea level rise by 2100?

Specifics are needed here.  After all, no one wants to be called a science denier due to non-belief in authoritative climate science.  So again, how much sea level rise by 2100 must one minimally believe in to avoid being called a science denier now that Hansen’s sea level rise catastrophe paper has been canonized?

"Is a car-free city possible? In many European cities walking and cycling already account for more than half of all journeys. In Britain, the Sustainable Travel Demonstration Towns project between 2004-08 showed it’s possible to increase the number of people getting out of the car, encouraging sometimes up to nine times more journeys by foot or bike.  A large study carried out by researchers at the Universities of Leeds, Oxford, Salford, Manchester, and East Anglia, Visions 2030 explored different ways to increase the amount of walking and cycling in the UK. This would improve public health, and considerably reduce the effects of carbon emissions in towns and cities by cutting traffic congestion, as stop-start traffic is the most polluting cycle of vehicle’s engines. Our current journey patterns reveal there is great potential for change, as nearly two thirds of trips are less than 8km in length (38% under 3km), while 6% of car trips are under 1.6km. Here the car’s efficiency is at its lowest, and the potential to easily swap it for other modes of transport is greatest. The rationale is partly to do with sustainability, but also improving the quality of life in our urban areas. The aim was to find ways to encourage more walking and cycling in cities for the year 2030. Initially, this involved a lot of consultation to gather ideas about what the future might look like, and how cycling and walking could be better integrated into the design of towns and cities. This led to designing three different future visions. The first vision has walking and cycling account for around 45% of trips, a big increase on the UK’s 2010 figure of less than 30%. In this vision there is universal (or near) application of current European best practice in relation to walking and cycling in towns and cities.  Society is very similar to today’s and the government systems at national and local levels are essentially the same, though there is a heightened focus on the need for planning, in all sectors. The mode of transport split for this vision is 32% walking, 13% cycling, 25% public transport and 30% car.  This vision is aimed at changing society’s values to encourage urban areas where walking and cycling account for around 60% of urban trips, with vastly improved public transport taking care of a further 35%. This vision entails substantial provision to support walking, cycling and public transport, and represents a very large change in attitudes and move away from our car-centric society.  This has been brought about by major changes in society and values. Government is very different, more de-centralised, and with polices co-ordinated predominantly at the local level. In this vision split is 37% walking, 23% cycling, 35% public transport, and 5% car. 


One size fits all: the road is a shared, safer space for travel by foot, bike and bus.
Visions2030

 This is a response to serious long term fuel shortages or high costs, where hugely increased use of leg-power on foot and by bike accounts for around 80% of journeys. Society chooses to deal with the transport implications by focusing on walking and cycling within cities. Strong national government provides the direction for change, but also more power to decentralised local government than at present. The split for this vision is 40% walking, 40% cycling, 15% public transport and 5% car.  


Cycle super-highway: with fuel shortages, work bikes and trikes are the road users de jour.
Visions2030

 We created visualisations and animations to give a better impression of how the three future visions of our hypothetical city of around 200,000 people would look, and outlined narratives to explain what might plausibly happen between now and our visions for 2030. We carried out public surveys of adults and children to gauge how people responded to the proposals, how they would affect their lives, and how they might want to change them. There were a number of significant findings from these surveys. Exploring general attitudes towards  walking and cycling, respondents complained of poor support which, where provided, was rarely respected by drivers, and inconsistent. Sometimes long travel distances or complex household routines thwart good intentions to walk and cycle, as do concerns over road safety (for cyclists) and fear of crime (for pedestrians). We found considerable hostility from cyclists and pedestrians to the idea of “shared space” for different modes of transport, with respondents strongly preferring segregated routes. Streets’ aesthetics and environmental aspects were felt to be almost as important as their function. But in all cases, there seemed to be considerable disagreement about what the future of walking and cycling should be, with no single ideas held by the majority of each group. We took our models, hypothetical narratives, and survey responses to  decision makers in local authorities in Leeds, Norwich and Kirkcaldy, to explore how they might put our ideas in to place in their own districts, each with its own complexities and problems. We also held one workshop with national level decision makers. These discussions were immensely useful. They identified problems and barriers to achieving the kinds of futures we imagined, but also highlighted the level of willingness among decision makers to get involved in such an exercise and think beyond the bounds of their day-to-day roles. Not once were we told our ideas were impossible, and in many cases we developed firmer ideas of just how those futures may be achieved."
"BANJUL, Gambia  —   A week after he was inaugurated in another country, Adama Barrow landed in Gambia on Thursday afternoon, setting foot inside his own national borders for the first time as the new president. Throngs of supporters, some holding Gambian flags, lined the roads to greet Mr. Barrow, who had flown in from Dakar, Senegal, where he had fled more than a week earlier out of security concerns after his predecessor, Yahya Jammeh, refused to step down. As he entered Banjul, the capital, Mr. Barrow, dressed in all white, poked out of a white Land Cruiser surrounded by military vehicles and waved to onlookers. “Today is freedom day,” said Mariama Bah, a nurse from Serekunda, a town nearby, who came to the airport to welcome President Barrow. “We now have a president that we can be proud of. ” Mr. Barrow defeated the longtime president, Mr. Jammeh, in a surprising outcome to an election in December. Mr. Jammeh, who had been in power since 1994, when he led a successful coup, initially accepted defeat. A few days after the vote, he changed his mind, declared the election results invalid and vowed to use the power of his military to stay in charge. It took repeated personal overtures from West African presidents and finally a regional coalition of troops that crossed into Gambia to persuade Mr. Jammeh, known for human rights abuses, to step down. He flew out of the country on Saturday, accompanied by a cargo plane containing his   and other luxury automobiles, and has settled in Equatorial Guinea, which has its own record of human rights violations. Mr. Barrow’s arrival capped a tense period for many Gambians who had feared a bloody end to the presidential standoff. Tens of thousands of residents had been so worried that they fled the country, though many have already returned. But Mr. Jammeh still has supporters left in Gambia, and some residents worry that divisions could lead to problems in the new administration. Mr. Barrow has dismissed his predecessor’s supporters as a minority. Most of all, many residents said they were weary of the regional troops who were still roaming the capital. They had arrived at the statehouse to search it and make sure all was safe for Mr. Barrow’s return, but their presence on the streets was unsettling to many. Mr. Barrow’s aides said the soldiers were likely to remain in Gambia for weeks as the new administration makes the transition. Some Gambians worried that it was still too early for Mr. Barrow to come home. “Yahya Jammeh was not acting alone,” said Ishmael Ceesay, 24, a mobile phone salesman in Serekunda. “His people are still around. ” Mr. Barrow’s aides said the president would stay at a private residence until the regional troops finished securing the statehouse. Mr. Jammeh’s rule penetrated the psyche of many Gambians who feared him, so much so that thousands fled years ago. Their departure further damaged an already shaky economy that Mr. Barrow has said will be a priority for him. Mr. Jammeh jailed journalists and his opponents, some of whom died in prison, carried out hunts for people believed to be witches and forced patients to stop taking medication so he could test what he said was his homemade cure for AIDS  —   herbs, prayers and a banana. Residents of Gambia talked about Mr. Jammeh only in hushed tones, and rarely in public, and even some members of the diaspora said they were convinced he was monitoring their communications. Mohamed Jalloh, who sells fabric at the entrance to the statehouse, said he had spent the past two decades praying a bullet would not come flying toward him. “Yahya Jammeh brought so much fear in us,” Mr. Jalloh said. The paranoia was evident even this week, with Mr. Jammeh hundreds of miles away, when a Gambian newspaper reported that he had left toxins in the vents in the statehouse to poison his successor. Mr. Barrow’s team said the report was false. For many Gambians, the pain of Mr. Jammeh’s rule was all too real. Some residents said part of Mr. Barrow’s new job would be comforter in chief. Mr. Barrow has vowed to create a truth and reconciliation commission to look into injustices during Mr. Jammeh’s more than   administration. On Wednesday afternoon in Brikama, the region where Mr. Barrow received the most votes, three women sat on a long wooden bench. They wore yellow #GambiaHasDecided   a motto adopted by the opposition that wanted Mr. Jammeh to leave. Like many others across Gambia, each of the women said a relative had been killed by security forces loyal to Mr. Jammeh. As they sold sugar at the market, the three spoke of their losses. It was during the 2011 presidential election campaign that Nyima Jabang’s father, an ambulance driver, was tortured and killed while in custody at the National Intelligence Agency. His crime: driving two men to a hospital who had been wounded at a rally in a clash between Mr. Jammeh’s party and the main opposition party, the United Democratic Party. The next day, the brother of Nyima Sanyang, another of the friends selling sugar, was arrested by security forces in connection with the campaign clash and was beaten to death. The third woman, Bintu Sonko, 30, described the long, speeding motorcades that carried Mr. Jammeh and his aides, who would toss packets of cookies to supporters. In 2013, Ms. Sonko’s son, Lamine, 7, heard Mr. Jammeh’s cars approaching. He ran out with his friends to wave to the passing president. Lamine darted into the street to catch a cookie and was struck and killed by a car in the motorcade. “They did not even stop,” Ms. Sonko said. “They kept going and throwing cookies at the rest of the kids. We can’t even report the matter to the chief or the police. ” “That was my only child. ”"
"In a biology lesson about the bacterial growth curve, the parallels with the climate crisis were hard to miss. Stick bacteria in a test tube with food and their population will grow exponentially until, eventually, they run out of resources and kill themselves off. Even a couple of decades ago, the comparison with humanity’s predicament felt glaringly obvious; and we have not really strayed since from the inevitable path to extinction. The hope seems to be that a big crisis might be the shock we need to change course. But we are living through the biggest global crisis for decades – and are travelling and consuming less as a result of the pandemic – yet it already seems unlikely that much will change. It’s easy enough to throw around the old adage “never waste a good crisis”. But when it comes to existential questions about the future of humanity, it has proved fairly useless.  Coronavirus or not, we remain locked into a treadmill that measures progress by growing GDP rather than by wellbeing and environmental sustainability. This is an economic paradigm that has served most of us – particularly the most affluent – pretty well for decades. But the richer we’ve got, the more the benefits have tailed off. There have been a number of studies showing that, beyond a certain point, more wealth does not necessarily equal more happiness – true at a societal level as well as an individual one. There is a lot that could account for this flatlining. It was once assumed that increased productivity, driven by technological progress, would result in us having more leisure time: see John Maynard Keynes’s prediction in the 1930s that we’d be working just 15 hours a week by now. But instead, luxury beat leisure and an explosion in consumerism has driven us towards ever more consumption. The “happiness” economist Richard Layard has also pointed towards “disorders of development” such as obesity and tech addiction (although it should be noted that within a wealthy society such as ours, obesity is associated with poverty). The costs of this consumption have increased. Much of it is subsidised by labour exploitation, both at home and abroad. And then there is the small issue of catastrophic climate change, as we race towards “tipping points” beyond which global heating becomes self-reinforcing and harder to halt without unprecedented levels of coordinated international action. Stack all this up, and the idea of already-rich societies moving towards a “zero growth” economic model – once the preserve of the radical green fringes of politics – starts to look increasingly like a no-brainer. We would have to sacrifice gains in material living standards, but the potential prize would be preserving the planet and achieving a better worklife balance. If we could protect the least affluent from any negative impacts – which would require more redistribution, not to mention paying more for services such as caring and cleaning – what’s not to like? The big problem is, of course, no one knows how to get there. The 2008 financial crisis offered a chance to take stock. For a while, it looked like something might happen: economists designed global “happiness” indices and the UN General Assembly declared a “world happiness day”. But not only did nothing change: it was used as political cover for darker agendas. Bhutan adopted a measure for Gross National Happiness in an attempt to market itself globally as the “happiness” country, while papering over its record of human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing. In the UK, David Cameron pledged to set up a national wellbeing index as he cut back mental health services, youth services and children’s centres. We’re back there again: happiness advocates saying we can’t afford to waste this opportunity to rethink, even as the government has prioritised pubs over schools – economic recovery over broader measures of wellbeing – in relaxing the lockdown. This is no surprise. Our political and economic systems are utterly indisposed to the radical shifts we need to promote wellbeing over wealth and protect the planet. Short-termism is everywhere, from politicians who face elections every few years to company directors who must account for quarterly results. On the right, there are powerful vested interests who want to maintain business as usual – who go quiet in the wake of a crisis, or even appear to jump on the bandwagon (just look at Davos agendas in recent years), but who do all in their power to obstruct change. The left often makes peace with continuous growth, despite its costs, because a rising tide makes redistribution easier. And it is crazy to think that a shock to GDP caused by a financial crisis or a pandemic could be used as a bridge to a different world because the brunt of the pain is always, always borne by the least affluent and the young. So we need to think far more about the mechanisms and institutions that could get us on to a different path. The Long Time Project is exploring how humans could shift their time horizons so, simply put, we feel more emotionally connected to our future descendants. It points to the fact that we tend to view our future selves, let alone future generations, as strangers. We need to rewire the way we think about the future, and our own ageing and deaths; the projects’ founders believe that art and culture can play an important role. And we could learn from those times in history when humans have proved their ability to think beyond their own lifespan: “cathedral thinking” is based on those architects who planned spectacular buildings that would never be finished in their own lifetimes. It’s no exaggeration to say that, unless we find a way to think differently about consumption, wellbeing and sustainability, humans will be responsible for our own extinction. And it should be clear by now that crises – extreme weather, pandemics, financial crises – are never going to be the wake-up call that forces us to confront our own fragility. A good crisis inevitably goes to waste, and it is lazy and irresponsible to think otherwise. • Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist"
"When you stand facing an exposed edge of permafrost, you can feel it from a distance. It emanates a cold that tugs on every one of your senses. Permanently bound by ice year after year, the frozen soil is packed with carcasses of woolly mammoths and ancient ferns. They’re unable to decompose at such low temperatures, so they stay preserved in perpetuity – until warmer air thaws their remains and releases the cold that they’ve kept cradled for centuries. I first experienced that distinct cold in the summer of 2016. I was traveling across Arctic Europe with a team of researchers to study climate change impacts. We were a few hours past the Finnish border in Russia when we stopped to first set foot on the tundra. The ground was soft but solid beneath our feet, covered with mosses and wildflowers that stretched into the distance until abruptly interrupted by a slick, towering wall of thawing permafrost. As we stood facing the muddy patch of uncovered earth, the sensation of escaping cold felt terrifying. The northern hemisphere is covered by 9m sq miles of permafrost. This solid ground, and all the organic material it contains, is one of the largest greenhouse gas stores on the planet. Frozen, it poses little threat to the 4 million people that call the Arctic home, or to the 7.8 billion of us that call Earth home. But defrosted by rising temperatures, thawing permafrost poses a planetary risk. When the organic material begins to decompose, permafrost thaw can destabilize major infrastructure, discharge mercury levels dangerous to human health and release billions of metric tons of carbon. We witnessed small-scale damage in Russia that summer through slumped landscapes and uneven roads. At the time, the larger, more dramatic changes were predicted to unfold over the course of this century. Four years later, those changes are happening much sooner than scientists predicted. The carbon-laden cold of the Arctic’s permafrost is leaking into Earth’s atmosphere, and we are not ready for the consequences. In June, the Russian Arctic reached 100.4F, the highest temperature in the Arctic since record-keeping began in 1885. The heat shocked scientists, but was not a unique or unusual event in a climate-changed world. The Arctic is warming at nearly three times the rate of the global average, and June’s single-day high was part of a month-long heatwave. This relentless heat has melted sea ice and made traditional subsistence dangerous for skilled Indigenous hunters. It’s fueled costly wildfires, some of which are so strong they now last from one summer to the next. And it’s sped up permafrost thaw, buckling roads and displacing entire communities. Watching the heat of 2020 devastate the Arctic, I think back to the fear we experienced while watching that permafrost thaw in 2016, but I also remember feeling hopeful. Just weeks before our expedition began, 174 countries had signed the Paris agreement on the first day it opened for signatures. Barack Obama and China’s President Xi Jinping released a joint statement of climate commitments for the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters. It seemed like every world leader had finally dedicated themselves to climate action. Throughout our trip across the Arctic, my colleagues and I discussed the difficulties of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, but, with the momentum of Paris, we agreed that it was still possible to contain a climate catastrophe. It is much harder to find hope today than it was four years ago – but it’s not impossible. The Arctic’s skies are blackened with wildfire smoke and we are not even halfway through summer. The Trump administration has reversed 100 environmental rules and stands on the precipice of pulling the US out of the Paris agreement in November 2020. Things may seem hopeless, but we are not helpless. Every individual has a skill, a voice, a career to wield as a tool to address climate change. Ultimately, climate action is not powered by the Paris agreement – it’s powered by people. From presidents to protesters, we each have a part to play in limiting the devastation of the climate crisis. Climate change cannot be stopped. The Arctic’s ice will melt and large swaths of frozen ground will thaw. Climate change is already causing devastating loss of life, destroying irreplaceable cultural heritage and inundating the places we hold dear. With every degree we allow our world to warm, the more we lose. But by demanding climate action from our governments, and demanding climate action from ourselves, we can work today to avert the worst damage and adapt to the impacts we can no longer avoid. As the Arctic burns, we cannot afford climate silence from anyone. The cost of inaction is too high. Dr Victoria Herrmann is the president and managing director of the Arctic Institute"
"What should have been a damp swamp beside Victoria’s Bemm River in East Gippsland was a blackened crunchy mess when Nick Clemann arrived in early March. “These are habitats not known for burning. To have them converted to just smouldering charcoal was pretty confronting,” says Clemann, a senior scientist for the Victorian state government’s Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research.  Clemann was in Croajingolong national park to search for the threatened swamp skink. Lifting up logs and rocks, Clemann would usually expect to find dozens of skinks, but he found only a handful of survivors among the charcoal. At other sites nearby, he found none. The swamp skinks are among the astonishing 2.46bn lizards and snakes estimated to have been in the path of Australia’s fires last summer. Clemann is a reptile specialist and has been out across Victoria assessing the impacts of the fires. He’s worried about the alpine she-oak skink, which doesn’t burrow but hangs around on vegetation that would have been incinerated. Some patches of its favourite habitat were spared, but others around Mount Kosciuszko were not. He says until last summer’s fires, the places around East Gippsland had always been considered a refuge for threatened lizards. A place for them to hang on. Now he’s not so sure. As the Guardian revealed last month, an interim report from 10 scientists estimated that almost 3bn animals were in the path of Australia’s bushfires. More than 2bn of those were squamates – also known as lizards and snakes. Separately, conservation experts advising the department of environment have identified 23 reptile species that need urgent action. But what does it mean to lose millions – perhaps billions – of reptiles from Australia’s landscape? Reptiles make up such a large number of animals hit by the fires because of their ubiquity across Australia. They are literally everywhere. “They’re the most diverse group of terrestrial vertebrates that we have,” says David Chapple, an associate professor at Monash University. “They occur across every single different type of environment and habitat. They’re a part of every food web of every ecosystem.” Prof Rick Shine, a biologist and reptile expert at Macquarie University in Sydney, says Australia is known as the “land of the lizards”. “Australia is a tough place to make a living and you have droughts and floods and bushfires with long periods of little food available. “Reptiles can survive long periods without access to food and water and so they tend to dominate a lot of Australian ecosystems in a way they don’t in other parts of the world. “These reptiles are incredibly important in a wide range of Australian ecosystems. Taking them out through threats like bushfires will have a strong impact on our ecosystem function and a huge impact on biodiversity.” Compared with other species, comparatively little is known about Australia’s lizards. As Australia’s east coast was ablaze late last year, scientists published a comprehensive assessment of the health of the nation’s snakes and lizards. The last major assessment was in 1993. The research found Australia had 1,020 species of lizard and snake, of which 96% exist nowhere else in the world. For comparison, says Dr Hal Cogger, an expert on reptiles at the Australian Museum who co-wrote Australia’s previous reptile action plan, North America has 390 species and the UK just six. About 7% of Australia’s species are considered threatened and among those the research found one in five existed entirely outside protected areas such as national parks. Since 1993, three reptile species – all on Christmas Island – have been declared extinct in the wild and 36 have been added to the national threatened species list. Chapple, who wrote an action plan for the country’s snakes and lizards on the back of that work, says the conclusions of the 1993 action plan were eerily similar to the latest efforts. “After more than 20 years our message was exactly the same – we are still getting a grasp on species. It’s hard to get long-term population trends and you don’t know enough to implement effective recovery strategies.” Now retired, Cogger spent 40 years at the Australian Museum – mostly around the herpetology department. The reason reptiles are an understudied group is simple, he says. “This goes back to support for conservation of all species,” he says. “The reality is that the publicity is concerned with the warm and cuddly rather than the cold and scaly. “We tend to overlook that the lizard population can be in the tens of thousands and will have a big impact on other animals like the insects they eat but also the birds and warm cuddly mammals that eat them.” During workshops to develop the most recent action plan, Chapple says, no one had entertained the idea that the impact of fires could be so widespread. “With these fires we’ve seen entire regions being burned and that was a scale of threat that we did not believe was possible. “It’s made us reassess the way we try to estimate the likelihood of an entire species being lost.” Even if reptiles can survive fires, they already have pressure from other human-caused problems, such as habitat destruction, increasing frequency of fires and predation by feral animals, in particular cats. “These creatures are pretty resilient, but the difficulty comes when we add multiple threatening processes,” Shine says. “It reaches a point where the sum total of challenges becomes too much.” Across Victoria’s reptile populations, Clemann is worried that species already under pressure are becoming isolated in pockets, increasing their vulnerability from fires. “Even in the worst cases you’ll get survivors, but the problem comes when there are so few individuals that you lose genetic diversity – you get a genetic bottleneck with high levels of in-breeding. “When we think about climate change and increasing fire frequency, a concern is that a single bottleneck event is undesirable, but several of them can be absolutely catastrophic.” Another largely unseen problem in burnt areas, says Clemann, is that when vegetation grows back over years and decades, it tends to be dense. “The reptiles were there because an area provided the right thermal environment, but the forest becomes incredibly dense after fires. “That brings new challenges to reptiles because their ability to lie out in the sun has been taken from them.” Clemann is busy planning projects to save the state’s reptiles – even those that almost no one has heard of. One lizard – the hand-sized mountain skink – lives in small family groups in hilly regions that were badly burned. Recent monitoring trips have recorded fewer and fewer of them, and Clemann fears that “by the time we get to taking it seriously” the species could be too far gone. He also wants to take samples from some lizard’s tails to assess their genetic health. An emerging conservation strategy – called genetic rescue – could be one solution, where specimens from different isolated groups are mixed together to make them healthier. But he says aside from tackling climate change, the solutions to helping reptiles are local – stopping further habitat loss through developments and transport infrastructure. “If we are genuine about wanting to stop the obvious decline and extinction trajectory of some of these species, then we first need to stop doing harm,” he says. “If we want them to have the resilience to cope with climate change and disease and fires, then we need to ease all the other pressures that are within our power.” "
"NBC is looking to place its new star Megyn Kelly in the morning hours. Ms. Kelly, who announced this month that she was leaving Fox News for NBC, will start at the network in May, and plans are beginning to take shape for her new show, two people briefed on the discussions said Friday. Ms. Kelly is being considered for a time slot at 9 or 10 a. m. for a show that is expected to begin in the fall. If she moves to 10 a. m. the popular fourth hour of “Today,” hosted by Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb, will move to 9 a. m. One thing that is known for sure: The current iteration of the third hour of “Today,” hosted by Tamron Hall and Al Roker, will be a thing of the past once Ms. Kelly’s show begins. Ms. Kelly’s apparent move to the morning, which Variety reported earlier, removes her from the tricky minefield of syndicated daytime TV. Other TV news hosts, including Jane Pauley, Meredith Vieira and Katie Couric, have tried their hand at the format and failed. That was one of the reasons that NBC initially planned to make Ms. Kelly’s show a straight news show because other anchors could not make it work, the network saw no reason to try that strategy again. But in recent weeks, NBC executives have had more of an open mind over what direction her show should take: There have been discussions about whether it should be softer in focus than what was originally discussed, one person briefed on the plans said. They also have not decided whether Ms. Kelly’s show will be branded as part of the “Today” show. If Ms. Kelly locked up the 9 a. m. hour, it would also set up an intriguing battle royal that would pit her against another longtime morning host, ABC’s Kelly Ripa. The 9 a. m. hour for “Today” has long been a tricky proposition for NBC: Facing formidable competition against Ms. Ripa’s “Live With Kelly,” the network has tried a number of solutions, including bringing in Billy Bush last year. Shortly after Mr. Bush was brought in to host, he was let go after the infamous “Access Hollywood” recording of him and Donald J. Trump was released in October. Mr. Roker will continue to work on the early parts of “Today. ” And Ms. Hall, who is in contract negotiations with the network, will continue to host her MSNBC show and is also expected to make appearances on “Today. ” There are no concrete plans yet for the Sunday night newsmagazine show that NBC plans to have Ms. Kelly host, the people said. Fox News has not missed a beat since Ms. Kelly left her 9 p. m. time slot. Tucker Carlson, who replaced Ms. Kelly this month, has seen big ratings gains in the busy news weeks since his debut."

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its _Fifth Assessment Report_ (AR5) last week to fanfare and stinging criticism.   
  
Most of the criticism was aimed at the IPCC’s defense of climate models—models that the latest observations of the earth’s climate evolution show to be inaccurate, or at least are strongly indicative that is the case.   
  
There are two prominent and undeniable examples of the models’ insufficiencies: 1) climate models overwhelmingly expected much more warming to have taken place over the past several decades than actually occurred; and 2) the sensitivity of the earth’s average temperature to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (such as carbon dioxide) averages some 60 percent greater in the IPCC’s climate models than it does in reality (according to a large and growing collection of evidence published in the scientific literature).   
  
Had the IPCC addressed these model shortcomings head on, the flavor of their entire report would have been different. Instead of including projections for extreme climate changes as a result of continued human emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from our production of energy, the high-end projections would have featured relatively modest changes and the low-end projections would have been completely unremarkable.   
  
Since changes in the earth’s temperature scale approximately linearly with a property known as the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity (how much the earth’s average surface temperature rises as a result of a doubling of the atmosphere’s carbon dioxide concentration), it is pretty straightforward to adjust the IPCC’s projections of future temperature change to bring them closer to what the latest science says the climate sensitivity is. That science suggests the equilibrium climate sensitivity probably lies between 1.5°C and 2.5°C (with an average value of 2.0°C), while the climate models used by the IPCC have climate sensitivities which range from 2.1°C to 4.7°C with an average value of 3.2°C.   
  
To make the IPCC projections of the evolution of the earth’s average temperature better reflect the latest scientific estimates of the climate sensitivity, it is necessary to adjust them downward by about 30% at the low end, about 50% at the high end, and about 40% in the middle.   
  
The figure below the jump shows what happens when we apply such a correction (note: we maintain some internal weather noise). The top panel shows the projections as portrayed by the IPCC in their just-released _Fifth_ _Assessment Report_ , and the lower panel shows what they pretty much would have looked like had the climate models better reflected the latest science. In other words, the lower panel is what the IPCC temperature projections _should have looked like_.   
  






Figure 1. (Top) Temperature evolution from 1950 to 2100 as portrayed by the IPCC in _its Fifth Assessment Report_ according to its worst case (red) and best case (blue) emissions scenarios (RCP8.5 and RC2.6, respectively). (Bottom) Temperature evolution from 1950 to 2100 from the same emission scenarios adjusted such that the equilibrium climate sensitivity values better matched the latest science.   






The result of such adjustments is that the IPCC’s worst-case emissions scenario produces a global average temperature rise (from the 1986-2005 average) by the end of the century that has a centralized value of about 2.6°C, compared with a rise of 4.1°C given in the IPCC AR5. The more moderate emissions scenarios (the more likely course as the natural gas revolution will see lower carbon dioxide-emitting natural gas replace higher-emitting coal in energy production), once properly adjusted, produce a temperature rise by century’s end of only about 1.25°C (of which, about 0.15°C has already happened).   
  
Since virtually all climate impacts are related to the change in the earth’s temperature, the smaller the future temperature increase, the smaller the resulting impacts. Another degree of so of temperature rise during the next 87 years is not going to lead to climate catastrophe.   
  
Had the IPCC been more interested in reflecting the actual science rather than in preserving a quickly crumbling consensus (that human greenhouse gas emissions are leading to dangerous climate change that requires urgent action), its _Fifth Assessment Report_ would have been a much kindler and gentler document—as it well should have been.

Labour, still refusing to face reality after their election drubbing in the UK, are continuing to remain utterly deluded. There are none more deluded than leadership aspirant Rebecca Long-Bailey.



She has [declared that she will stick with the socialist policies](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/06/rebecca-long-bailey-announces-labour-leadership-bid?fbclid=IwAR1TfISNAeS7QGuvAVbxrvluDEZ2exZuRr2g332hk18Az6YrczplwbceyMI) that were soundly defeated in the election. _The Guardian_ reports on her grand delusions:



[Rebecca Long Bailey](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rebecca-long-bailey) has announced that she is standing to become leader of the Labour party with a stout defence of Jeremy Corbyn’s political programme in the general election.



Widely seen as the favoured candidate of the left of the party, the MP for Salford and Eccles announced her candidacy on Monday night with a piece criticising the party’s election strategy and lack of narrative. She promised to defend policies within the party’s current socialist programme with “unwavering determination” [in the article for Tribune magazine](https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/01/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-leadership-socialism).



In the article, she says: **“It is true that one reason we lost the election was that Labour’s campaign lacked a coherent narrative. But this was a failure of campaign strategy, not of our socialist programme.**



Riiight, sure it was.



 **“I don’t just agree with the policies, I’ve spent the last four years writing them. Labour’s green new deal, our plans to radically democratise the economy, and to renew the high streets of towns across the country, are the foundations for an economic transformation that will combat the climate crisis and hand back wealth and power to ordinary people.”**



The green new deal, which she said was “tragically undersold” in the election, would remain at the heart of her programme if she became leader, she said.



 **“The popularity of our green new deal bridges the divides in our electoral coalition, with huge support in the cities and marginals in the south-east too. It should have been a core part of our offer: this is how[Labour](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour) will help you take back control,”** she wrote.



She has also promised not to move back to tactics employed by Ed Miliband on immigration. “Never again will our party put ‘controls on immigration’ on a mug,” she said. “It would be a betrayal of our principles, and of our core supporters and activists.”



If that doesn’t fill you with mirth, then check out what one candidate who has withdrawn and now endorsed Long-Bailey has said:



Ian Lavery, the party’s chairman and former National Union of Mineworkers executive, has dropped out of the leadership race, a source confirmed on Monday night.



Lavery released a statement offering Long Bailey his support. “Having worked with her in the shadow cabinet, I know she has the intellect, drive and determination to take forward and develop the popular, **commonsense socialist policies** that Jeremy Corbyn has championed,” he said. “And after more than a century, it’s about time the Labour party was led was a woman.”



Straight into the **same politics of intersectionality** that was so thoroughly rejected. You’d think they’d learn, but apparently not. I really hope that she wins the leadership battle: the lolz will be tremendous as they continue towards their complete destruction.



And in case you stopped laughing, another article in _The Guardian_ outlines how [candidates are being urged to sign a statement prepared by the unions](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-election-supporters-48-hours-sign-up?fbclid=IwAR1QPzcQxzFtEGlMfI-L-9IfumUIgB0fDxVPsXZDdt4aXC11TwYeytm2lD8) to try to halt job losses amongst Labour staffers affected by the demise of their hapless MPs:



Labour’s main leadership contenders have been urged to join calls for a halt to a party reorganisation that would result in multiple sackings of party staff.



As the timetable for the leadership race was set out, **representatives of Unite and GMB sent a letter to leadership and deputy leadership contenders urging them to sign a statement to stop a clear-out of staff members.**



Leadership contenders Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy and deputy candidate Angela Rayner said they would support the statement. Rebecca Long Bailey, who declared her candidacy on Monday night, has also reportedly offered her support to staff.



The move comes amid reports of significant internal party changes after last month’s calamitous election result. Jeremy Corbyn’s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, and the party’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, are reportedly drafting an overhaul of party structures before he steps down in the spring.[…] 



The decision by Unite and GMB to send the letter to candidates is significant, as **both unions will influence the contest.** Both Murphy and Formby are former senior Unite figures.



The joint union statement reads: “As candidates in the leadership and deputy leadership campaigns we firmly believe that a thorough review should be the duty and responsibility of the next leadership team when a full and frank debate has taken place. It would be a mistake for the party to undertake any steps towards reorganisation of the party until a new leader and deputy leader are in place.”



On Monday night leadership favourite Starmer offered his “wholehearted” support for the letter.



He said: “Hard-working staff need immediate reassurance, not a rushed reorganisation. It’s important any structural changes to the Labour party are undertaken by the new leadership team following a full consultation with staff and trade unions.”



A senior union source said: “How can anyone think it’s a sensible idea to restructure the entire party before a new leadership team is elected? We lost. If the people proposing this restructure had the answers, they’d be in No 10 by now.



“Rushed, politically motivated hirings and firings are part of the problem, not the solution.”



No, union domination is part of the problem, and these unions will be right in the thick of the looming donnybrook over the leadership. Ironically it was the actions of those unions in the leadership battles that caused the problems that Labour is still suffering from.



Just when I thought the day couldn’t get any better I find [Polly Toynbee has an op-ed](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/06/labour-unity-leadership-race?fbclid=IwAR0gBkc8V6d3pNvT25NgLG99o7xO6JW26H3zeRUfJC5tkqnraTGadAYecoA):



 **The public can be badly wrong – but winning requires nationwide success, not narrow segmentation targeting particular voters.** Lisa Nandy’s plea for northern towns is full of excellent local campaigning plans, but a countrywide vision is what wins. Or, in Johnson’s case, a better feint at a vision than the other party.



It may take finely tuned ears to spot the subtle nuances between candidates’ messages, so take the advice of Herbert Morrison (Peter Mandelson’s grandfather): “Don’t tell me what’s in the motion, lad, just tell me who’s backing it.” Look behind the candidates to see their promoters and Phillips has captured those on the right who, like her, have been most fearless in speaking out truthfully against Corbyn when electoral disaster beckoned – Neil Coyle, Wes Streeting, Margaret Hodge.



Nothing about [Long Bailey’s pitch](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-party-britain), as set out in these pages, marks her out as especially far left, with her talk of “progressive patriotism” and no mention of socialism. An impeccable working-class girl made good who became a solicitor by her own efforts, Long Bailey’s problem is her history and her supporters. When hoisted into her seat with the aid of Len McCluskey’s Unite union in 2015, she immediately joined the 36 Corbyn nominators. She was rewarded with rapid promotion to the shadow cabinet, where Corbyn and McDonnell both pushed her as heir apparent.



With a seat on the NEC, she has voiced no objections to a series of inside fixes, not even protesting during the antisemitism row. She voted to back Jon Lansman’s failed “drive-by shooting” attempt to abolish Tom Watson’s post. Though respected for developing the excellent [Green New Deal](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/21/labour-manifesto-promises-1m-green-jobs-to-tackle-climate-crisis), which promised good jobs in former manufacturing zones, and though personally well-liked, that silent obedience in the face of backroom skulduggery will drag her down – as will the names of those promoting her, Lansman especially.



Oh dear, it seems bitter infighting is Labour’s short-term future. Toynbee’s statement about avoiding narrow segmentation goes totally against the statement of Ian Lavery.



Labour appear even more hapless and rudderless than at the election. Long may it continue as Boris Johnson gets down to the business of government, and draining Whitehall’s swamp.

"Electric cars have been a huge success in Norway, with more electric cars per capita than anywhere else in the world. Sales are thriving, with Norway’s new car market boasting the largest share of electric vehicles (EV). The country’s top-selling car for the last two months is electric. So how has Norway achieved this, some would say enviable, situation? Frequently, deploying EVs starts with government-backed national action plans. These involve demonstration pilot projects, “learning by doing”, and introducing EVs as company cars in those firms with big fleets. Not so in Norway. Here, company fleets’ use of EVs lags behind private consumers. Of course electric vehicles of any kind rely on electric charging infrastructure in order to be useful. Financial incentives, since EVs are relatively expensive, are also common. These, and the need to introduce consistent and institutionalised policies and legal frameworks governing use and investment in EVs, are among the initial challenges faced. Norway has in place several policies and tools at hand to speed the uptake of EVs. Their rapid expansion to date has most likely been spurred on by strong financial incentives. For example, considerably reduced taxes, worth around US$8,200 (£5,000) per car each year, have been very important. Due to a strict tax regime, conventional vehicles can be twice as expensive in Norway as in other European countries. While EVs are expensive relative to their size and luxury, the tax breaks they come with bring down their price to around the same as petrol and diesel vehicles, making them a viable alternative for many Norwegian households. Other incentives include free access to public parking, toll roads, ferries and charging stations, and the opportunity to use bus lanes. So, all in all, the incentives of Norwegian EV policy and the establishment of Transnova, which provides finance to build charging facilities, have reduced the barriers to entry considerably, making EVs accessible to buy and attractive to use. It’s important that these incentives have some longevity, and to provide this the government has stated they will continue until 2017, or until the number of EVs on Norway’s streets hits 50,000. There is a cultural dimension to the enthusiasm for EVs in Norway over and above just saving time and money. The extra benefits of being able to drive in the bus lane, free parking, avoid toll charges and so on add to their cultural cachet, but they are also widely seen as comfortable and efficient due to their small size, electric engine and fast acceleration. They also provide the satisfaction of driving a less polluting car.  Demonstrating environmental concerns by driving an EV is important to some people. As more and more people choose them, it appears to be a more reasonable choice for others – particularly those with environmental leanings. This is at least true for countries like Norway where electricity is mainly produced from renewable sources. Their range, often a concern of new electric drivers, is seldom found to be a problem. Most daily trips are within the cars’ range – and EV drivers have adopted their usage around it. Many households also have a conventionally powered car at their disposal. We have also noted that EV drivers tend to act as very enthusiastic advocates, extolling their virtues at work and among friends. So the “show and tell” of positive experiences also contributes to the continued upward trend of EVs in Norway. What steps could be taken in the UK to deliver Norway’s success? It’s not easy to replicate the situation in Norway in other countries. Other countries have much less tax on conventional cars, and might deem it too expensive to implement the other favours Norway bestows upon electric vehicle drivers. But there may be other lessons to learn from the Norwegian case. Hands-on experience driving an electric car seems to be a crucial step towards becoming an owner. So by letting people get first-hand experience driving an EV, through the use of pilot projects, for instance, may lead more people to think that an electric car is the right choice for them. In short, it is important to provide public access to EVs, taking them out of the realms of the hypothetical and onto the station forecourt. This is key – and a critical element of the popularity of EVs is the way each new electric car driver tends to pass their news of the experience and benefits to the next."
"WASHINGTON  —   As President Trump signed a sweeping executive order on Friday, shutting the borders to refugees and others from seven largely Muslim countries, the secretary of homeland security was on a White House conference call getting his first full briefing on the global shift in policy. Gen. John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, had dialed in from a Coast Guard plane as he headed back to Washington from Miami. Along with other top officials, he needed guidance from the White House, which had not asked his department for a legal review of the order. Halfway into the briefing, someone on the call looked up at a television in his office. “The president is signing the executive order that we’re discussing,” the official said, stunned. The global confusion that has since erupted is the story of a White House that rushed to enact, with little regard for basic governing, a core campaign promise that Mr. Trump made to his most fervent supporters. In his first week in office, Mr. Trump signed other executive actions with little or no legal review, but his order barring refugees has had the most explosive implications. Passengers were barred from flights to the United States, customs and border control officials got instructions at 3 a. m. Saturday and some arrived at their posts later that morning still not knowing how to carry out the president’s orders. “The details of it were not thought through,” said Stephen Heifetz, who served in the Justice and Homeland Security Departments, as well as the C. I. A. under the previous three presidents. “It is not surprising there was mass confusion, and I expect the confusion and chaos will continue for some time. ” Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist, oversaw the writing of the order, which was done by a small White House team, including Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s policy chief. But it was first imagined more than a year ago, when Mr. Trump, then a candidate for the Republican nomination, reacted to terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif. by calling for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. ” In the months that followed, Mr. Trump’s campaign tried to back away from the proposal, which was seen by Democrats as    campaign rhetoric that would never be reality. Mr. Trump offered few details as the campaign progressed, and as   he promised to protect the country from terrorists with only vague promises of “extreme vetting. ” But Mr. Bannon, who believes in highly restrictive immigration policies and saw barring refugees as vital to shoring up Mr. Trump’s political base, was determined to make it happen. He and a small group made up of the president’s closest advisers began working on the order during the transition so that Mr. Trump could sign it soon after taking office. A senior administration official said that the order was drafted in cooperation with some immigration experts on Capitol Hill and members of the “beachhead teams”  —   small groups of political appointees sent by the new White House to be liaisons and begin work at the agencies. James Jay Carafano, a vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation and a member of Mr. Trump’s transition team, said that little of that work was shared with career officials at the Homeland Security Department, the State Department or other agencies. There was “a firewall between the old administration and the incoming one,” Mr. Carafano said. One reason, he said, is that when the Trump transition team asked pointed questions suggesting new policies to the career officials, those questions were swiftly leaked to the news media, generating negative stories. So the Trump team began to limit the information they discussed with officials from the previous administration. “Why share it with them?” Mr. Carafano said. R. Gil Kerlikowske, who served as commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under former President Barack Obama, said that his staff had little communication with Mr. Trump’s transition team, who made no mention of a bar on entry for people from certain countries. White House officials in the meantime insisted to reporters at a briefing that Mr. Trump’s advisers had been in contact with officials at the State and Homeland Security Departments for “many weeks. ” One official added, “Everyone who needed to know was informed. ” But that apparently did not include members of the president’s own cabinet. Jim Mattis, the new secretary of defense, did not see a final version of the order until Friday morning, only hours before Mr. Trump arrived to sign it at the Pentagon. Mr. Mattis, according to administration officials familiar with the deliberations, was not consulted by the White House during the preparation of the order and was not given an opportunity to provide input while the order was being drafted. Last summer, Mr. Mattis sharply criticized Mr. Trump’s proposed ban on Muslim immigration as a move that was “causing us great damage right now, and it’s sending shock waves through the international system. ” Customs and Border Protection officers were also caught unaware. They contacted several airlines late Friday that were likely to be carrying passengers from the seven countries and “instructed the airlines to offload any passport holders from those countries,” said a state government official who has been briefed on the agency’s actions. It was not until 3 a. m. on Saturday that customs and border officials received limited written instructions about what to do at airports and border crossings. They also struggled with how to exercise the waiver authority that was included in the executive order, which allowed the homeland security secretary to let some individuals under the ban enter the country case by case. One customs officer, who declined to be quoted by name, said he was given a limited briefing about what to do as he went to his post on Saturday morning, but even managers seemed unclear. People at the agency were blindsided, he said, and are still trying to figure things out, even as people are being stopped from coming into the United States. “If the secretary doesn’t know anything, how could we possibly know anything at this level?” the officer said, referring to Mr. Kelly. At the Citizenship and Immigration Service, staff members were told that the agency should stop work on any application filed by a person from any of the countries listed in the ban. Employees were told that applicants should be interviewed, but that their cases for citizenship, green cards or other immigration documents should be put on pause, pending further guidance. The timing of the executive order and the lack of advance warning had homeland security officials “flying by the seat of their pants,” to try to put policies in place, one official said. By Saturday, as the order stranded travelers around the world and its full impact became clear, Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, became increasingly upset about how the program had been rolled out and communicated to the public. By Sunday morning, Mr. Priebus had to defend the immigration ban on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” where he insisted that the executive order was rolled out smoothly. He also backpedaled on the policy and said that the executive order’s restrictions on entry to the United States would not apply to legal permanent residents “going forward. ” As White House officials also insisted on Sunday that the order had gone through the usual process of scrutiny and approval by the Office of Legal Counsel, the continuing confusion forced Mr. Kelly to clarify the waiver situation. He issued a statement making clear that lawful permanent residents  —   those who hold valid green cards  —   would be granted a waiver to enter the United States unless information suggested that they were a security threat. But senior White House officials insisted on Sunday night that the executive order would remain in force despite the change, and that they were proud of taking actions that they said would help protect Americans against threats from potential terrorists. That assertion is likely to do little to calm the public furor, which showed no signs of waning at the beginning of Mr. Trump’s second full week in the Oval Office. Mr. Carafano said he believed that the substance of Mr. Trump’s executive order was neither radical nor unreasonable. But he said that Mr. Trump’s team could have delayed signing the order until they had better prepared the bureaucracy to carry it out. He also said the president and his team had not done a good job of communicating to the public the purpose of the executive order. “If there is a criticism of the administration, and I think there is, I think they have done a rotten job of telling their story,” he said. “It is not like they did not know they were going to do this. To not have a cadre of people out there defending the administration  —   I mean, really guys, they should have done this. ”"
"Surrounded by her five grandchildren who live with her, Sandra Parker asserted her unconditional love for each one. The oldest, Akiea Brewer, 19, who identifies as transgender, interrupted to express her doubt. Ms. Parker’s reply was swift and unequivocal: “I was never mad at you for being who you are. What did I tell you? Be who you are. Don’t follow and try to be who someone else is. ” Ms. Parker has never been one to mince words. She believes her directness does not dilute her warmth and affection. “Sometimes I can be really harsh,” Ms. Parker acknowledged. “Sometimes you just have to say what you have to say. You can’t pussyfoot with kids. ” An unwavering dedication to family is what led Ms. Parker, 58, to take custody of many of her grandchildren over the years, stepping up when her children could not. For example, the mother of four of Ms. Parker’s grandchildren who live with her lives in Florida and is dealing with health issues. Ms. Parker credits her ceaseless devotion to the aunt who took her in at age 48, whom Ms. Parker calls her adoptive mother. “She was just a gem. She was precious,” Ms. Parker said. “I could never ask for a better mother. She loved me as if she birthed me into the world. ” Ms. Parker said she had showered her own four children with that same unrelenting affection. Her approach to motherhood was as tough as it was tender. If one of her sons was hanging out with the wrong crowd, she did not hesitate to yank him off street corners. One son’s friends were so worried that his mother was bringing attention to the group that they told him he could no longer associate with them. “I live what I live in front of the children,” Ms. Parker said. “They don’t see me robbing, stealing, doing all those things. They don’t see those things. ” Her parental role extended to several of her children’s friends, whom she welcomed into her home. Even now, her door is open to all. Friends regularly drop by her Bronx apartment to chat and laugh. Children in the neighborhood greet her on the sidewalk. Ms. Parker, a widow, moved to New York from Florida in 2012. She came for love  —   to be with a man she had met on vacation. They are now engaged. Because of the values she has instilled in them, Ms. Parker said, she does not worry for her grandchildren. “I was always told children emulate what they see,” she said. “If you raise them good and do the best that you can do, and they see this, then somewhere in their heart, it’s going to be stored. ” She has long demonstrated her willingness to care for them. That respect is returned to her, and she demands that her grandchildren offer it to their absent parents, too. “A lot of grandparents allow their grandchildren to call them ‘Mother,’ but that’s not who I am,” she said. “I’m their grandmother. I never allowed them to call me Mother. They have a mother. I’m just taking her place right now, but she’s still your mother. ” Health problems, including diabetes and heart disease, prevent Ms. Parker from working. Each month, she receives $630 from Social Security, $123 in survivor benefits and $376 in federal benefits for one of her grandchildren. She also receives $771 in food stamps and $310 in cash from public assistance. Ms. Parker is responsible for paying $246 toward her $1, 541 monthly rent the bulk of it is paid by a Family Eviction Prevention Subsidy provided by New York State. Through the Visiting Nurse Service, Ms. Parker contacted the Family Center, an affiliate of FPWA, formerly the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. FPWA is one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. A Family Center caseworker noticed that much of the family’s furniture was badly worn. The caseworker applied for a grant from FPWA, and Ms. Parker was approved for a grant for $1, 000 in August to buy new furniture. “It feels more like home because I didn’t have anywhere for people to sit,” she said. That home is still very close quarters, which leads to the occasional fight. But her family makes the most of it, Ms. Parker said, and has learned to navigate the different personalities in a limited space. Ms. Parker wishes she had moments of calm and solitude. “There’s never a moment,” she said. “Not even when I take a shower, because somebody’s knocking on the door. Oh, my Lord. ” Ms. Parker said her home was brimming with love, giving her reason to anticipate an even brighter future. “I hope the children do well, finish school and my fiancé and I get married and sail away somewhere,” she said."

How on Earth can anyone vote for that … [fill in the blank]? This is a question some Americans ask during every presidential primary race, but this year our mutual incomprehension feels especially intense. A year ago, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush were expected to be the frontrunners, but now a senator from the far right (Ted Cruz) and a political neophyte from no known political zip code (Donald Trump) have come in first and second among Republicans in Iowa, taking more than 50 percent of the vote between them. On the Democratic side, an avowed socialist essentially tied with Clinton. What is happening?





Politics is in many ways like religion: Voters reward candidates who are effective preachers for a set of moral concerns.



Political scientists and commentators have a standard toolbox they use to explain elections, including variables such as the state of the economy, changing demographics, and incumbency fatigue. But this year, the standard tools are proving inadequate. Experts are increasingly turning to psychology for help. A recent article in Politico was titled ""The One Weird Trait that Predicts Whether You're a Trump Supporter."" It argued that the psychological trait undergirding Trump's popularity is authoritarianism — a personality style characterizing people who are particularly sensitive to signs that the moral order is falling apart. When they perceive that the world as they know it is descending into chaos, they glorify their in-group, become highly intolerant of those who are different, and feel drawn to strong leaders who promise to fix things, and who do not seem shy about using force to do so.



But now that Trump has lost in Iowa, there is increasing interest in the moral and psychological profiles of those who support other candidates. Iowa entrance polls showed that Cruz took the lion's share of voters who said it was most important to elect a candidate who shares their values. But what are those values, exactly? Is that just code for ""evangelical Christian?""



On the Democratic side, Sanders attracts supporters who are younger, whiter, and further to the left — but is that all there is to it? What are socialist values, anyway? Can authoritarianism tell us anything about the supporters of these other candidates, or do we need other instruments, with finer resolution?



 **What is Moral Foundations Theory?**



We'd like to add another psychological tool to the toolbox: Moral Foundations Theory. One of us (Haidt) developed the theory in the early 2000s, with several other social psychologists, in order to study moral differences across cultures. Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) draws on anthropology and on evolutionary biology to identify the universal ""taste buds"" of the moral sense, while at the same time explaining how every society creates its own unique morality.



Think of it like this: Evolution gave all human beings the same taste receptors — for sweet, sour, salt, bitter, and umami (or MSG) — but cultures then create unique cuisines, constrained by the fact that the cuisine must please those taste receptors. Moral foundations work much the same way. The six main moral taste receptors, according to MFT, are:



As with cuisines, societies vary a great deal in the moralities they construct out of these universal predispositions. Many traditional agricultural and herding societies rely heavily on the loyalty, authority, and sanctity foundations to create rituals, myths, and religious institutions that bind groups together with a strong tribal consciousness.



That can be highly effective for groups that are often attacked by neighboring rivals, but commercial societies (such as Amsterdam in the 17th century or New York City today) are far less in need of these foundations, and so make much less use of them.



Their moral values, stories, and political institutions flow more directly from the liberty and fairness foundations — well suited to a culture based on exchange and production — and are therefore much more tolerant and open to ethnic diversity.



In recent years, MFT has been used to study political differences between the American left and right. Republicans and Democrats in the United States are now in some ways like citizens of different countries, with different beliefs about American history, the Constitution, economics, and climate science. Using questionnaires, text analyses, and other methods, psychologists have found that progressives put more emphasis on the care foundation than do other groups, while social conservatives see more value in loyalty, authority, and sanctity than do other groups. Libertarians, meanwhile, put liberty far above all other moral concerns.



Fairness, important to all groups, nonetheless has subtypes: The left values fairness more when it is presented as equality, particularly equality of outcomes between groups (which is at the heart of social justice). The right values fairness more than the left when it is presented as proportionality — a focus on merit, which includes a desire to let people fail when they are perceived to have been lazy or otherwise undeserving.



But these are broad-brush generalizations. Each person has a unique morality developed over the course of a lifetime. Each political party is a coalition of interest groups and political philosophies that appeal to people with diverse values. In the chaos of this political season, can MFT help us find some order? Can it improve our ability to predict which people will gravitate to which candidate, over and above the predictions we can make from standard variables such as age, race, gender, education, and self-ratings on the liberal-conservative dimension?



 **Our study**



In November 2015 one of us (Ekins) was part of a team that surveyed 2,000 Americans as part of a Cato Institute/YouGov national public opinion study. The study included a battery of questions measuring each of the six moral foundations, and also asked respondents which presidential candidate they liked best. (See the bottom of this essay for the exact items we used.) When we analyzed the data, we found that the 2016 presidential candidates have indeed attracted unique voter constituencies with distinct sets of moral priorities. As we shall see, these moral differences among supporters map on pretty closely to real policy debates among the candidates.



To analyze the data, we first ordered the candidates from left to right based on their supporters' self-described political ideology. The scale ran from 1 (""very liberal"") to 5 (""very conservative""). We included candidates who had at least 35 respondents in the survey, although we leave out supporters of Carly Fiorina and Chris Christie in subsequent figures and analyses because their supporters' moral profiles were similar to those of Marco Rubio supporters. (Please see our supplemental blog post for many more graphs and analyses, including those for Fiorina and Christie supporters).





**How do the candidates compare?**



Next, we looked at how each candidate's supporters prioritize each of the moral foundations _compared with the average American_ (Figure 1). Bars above zero indicate that the candidate's supporters place more emphasis on that particular moral foundation compared with the average voter. Bars that dip down below zero do not mean those supporters do not care about the moral concern, only that they gave relatively lower ratings to it compared with the rest of our nationally representative survey sample.





Let's walk through the graph, one set of bars at a time.



 **1) Care (blue bars):** The care foundation measures the psychological tendency to believe that morality requires caring for and protecting the vulnerable. A sample survey item asks respondents if they agree that ""compassion for those who are suffering is the most crucial virtue."" Individuals who score high on this foundation tend to support a more activist government with a more generous safety net.



 **2) Fairness as proportionality (green bars):** Proportionality is the desire for people to reap what they sow — for good deeds to be rewarded and bad deeds punished. A sample survey item asks respondents if they agree that ""people who produce more should be rewarded more than those who just tried hard.""



In practice, a strong desire for proportionality is highly predictive of a preference for small government and a dislike of activist government and the welfare state. (We only asked about fairness as proportionality in our survey, not fairness as equality — which is always higher on the left.)



 **3) Liberty (orange bars):** The liberty foundation measures the psychological tendency to resist being controlled or dominated. A sample survey item asks respondents if they agree that ""everyone should be free to do as they choose, so long as they don't infringe on upon the freedom of others.""



 **4) Authority/loyalty/sanctity (red bars):** For simplicity, we took the average of each respondent's answers to all six questions for these three foundations, because they tend to go together as the foundations of social conservatism, and in this data set they generally tell the same story about each candidate. (See our supplemental blog post for graphs and extended analyses of each foundation separately.) Authority shows up in political life in strong support for the police and a ""tough on crime"" attitude; a sample question in our survey asked respondents whether it is relevant to moral judgment that ""an action caused chaos or disorder."" Loyalty shows up in political life in strong patriotism and a desire to protect the flag; a survey item we used asked if it was relevant to morality that a person ""showed a lack of loyalty."" Sanctity shows up in political life in culture war debates related to sexuality (including same-sex marriage) and also to the sanctity of life (including abortion). An item we used asked if respondents agreed that ""some acts are wrong on the grounds that they are unnatural.""



 **Moral Foundations Theory gives us a clearer picture of what voters care about**



What do moral foundations add to our understanding of voter preferences? If you already know a person's age, sex, education level, income, race, and self-reported ideology (liberal to conservative), you can make an educated guess about which candidate he or she is most likely to support. But if you add on top of all that the person's responses to our Moral Foundations questions, does that improve your ability to predict his or her vote?



To find out, we conducted a very stringent test: We performed a series of regression analyses, one for each candidate. (We carried out LOGIT regressions separately for the Democratic candidates among Democratic respondents and Republican candidates among Republican respondents). Then we examined how well each of the moral foundations predicted the likelihood that any particular person would pick each candidate as his or her favorite, while also accounting for the effects of demographic and political variables as well as the other moral foundations.



We wanted to see if adding the moral foundations improved prediction _above and beyond_ the demographic factors that are usually used.



It did.



 **Table 2** shows what we found. Each row shows which moral foundations were statistically significant predictors of vote choice in the regression analysis for each candidate. The numbers in parentheses show the size of the ""standardized beta weight,"" which quantifies how big the contribution was. Negative numbers mean that the predictor worked in the reverse direction (e.g., scoring _low_ on care makes a Republican more likely to vote for Trump, holding everything else constant).





Among Republicans, four moral patterns stand out. First: Voters who still score high on authority/loyalty/sanctity and low on care — even after accounting for all the demographic variables — are significantly more likely to vote for Donald Trump. These are the true authoritarians — they value obedience while scoring low on compassion. They are different from Huckabee supporters, who appeared to score even higher than Trump supporters on authority/loyalty/sanctity, but also scored high on care, as we saw in Figure 1.



Authoritarianism is often assessed in social science research by asking people two or three questions about the relative importance of teaching their children obedience and respect, but our data shows a limitation of this approach: Not everyone who wants their kids to be obedient is an authoritarian. Some past research has been too quick to lump in social conservatives with authoritarians. MFT offers a more nuanced assessment of voters' moral concerns.



The second pattern picks up the voters who seem to be most concerned about proportional fairness. They want society to reward people according to what they have earned, not according to their needs. These voters are split between Cruz and Rubio. The fact that our proportionality items predicted support for these candidates even after taking background and ideology into consideration shows how directly these candidates are appealing to the core moral concerns of the Tea Party.



But it revealed something else: Despite often being portrayed as opposites (Rubio is ""establishment""; Cruz isn't), and Cruz being seen as more aligned with Donald Trump, Rubio and Cruz actually draw from voters with a similar moral profile. Each would probably be doing better in the polls if the other weren't in the race.



The third moral pattern we tracked was Republicans who were _not_ strongly focused on enforcing proportional fairness in society. A low score on the proportionality questions predicted support for Bush (and, we would guess, for Kasich, although we did not have enough Kasich supporters in our data to test that hypothesis).



The fourth moral pattern was the classic libertarian archetype: high on liberty, low on the social conservative virtues of authority/loyalty/sanctity. Those voters gravitate to Rand Paul. Now that Paul has dropped out of the race, the moral profile of his supporters suggest they may find a new home with Cruz, Rubio, or even Sanders, who draws civil libertarians.



Now turning to the Democratic primary: Before controlling for demographic factors, the liberty foundation positively predicts a vote for Sanders and a vote against Clinton. But this effect seems to be driven by young libertarians. Once age is included in the analysis, the liberty foundation no longer adds significantly to the prediction of support for Sanders. When accounting for demographics, Sanders support is actually predicted by _low_ proportionality and _low_ authority/loyalty/sanctity.



Meanwhile, Moral Foundations do not significantly predict a vote for Hillary Clinton; demographic variables seem to be all you need to predict her support (being female, nonwhite, and higher-income are all good predictors).



 **Much of this contradicts conventional wisdom about the candidates**



The 2016 presidential campaign is among the most unusual and confusing in many years, but moral psychology can help us make sense of what is going on. Moral values matter a great deal in both parties. Despite the fact that the Moral Foundations questions don't ask about public policy, they still uncovered distinct moral profiles of each candidate's supporters that map onto actual policy differences that we hear coming from the candidates.



The Democratic candidates are both competing to show how much they care about the poor and vulnerable. It makes sense that they would both covet this impression: There is no difference between their supporters on the care foundation. But beyond care, Clinton and Sanders appeal to different moral values.



Like Barack Obama in 2008, Bernie Sanders draws young liberal voters who have a strong desire for individual autonomy and place less value on social conformity and tradition. This likely leads them to appreciate Sanders's libertarian streak and non-interventionist foreign policy. Once again, Hillary Clinton finds herself attracting more conservative Democratic voters who respect her tougher style, moderated positions, and more hawkish stance on foreign policy.



On the Republican side, we see evidence that the ""Reagan coalition"" has fractured. No candidate has yet brought together the conservatives, libertarians, and foreign policy hawks. Our survey was conducted last November, but today it is clear that the leading candidates are striving to outdo one another on appealing to social conservative policies (particularly immigration) and hawkish foreign policy (including ""carpet-bombing"" our enemies).



Despite Trump's longevity in the polls, authoritarianism is clearly not the only dynamic going on in the Republican race. In fact, the greatest differences by far in the simple foundation scores are on proportionality.



Cruz and Rubio draw the extreme proportionalists — the Republicans who think it's important to ""let unsuccessful people fail and suffer the consequences,"" as one of our questions put it. Bush and Huckabee attract those who are not so focused on enforcing proportional fairness. Trump and Paul fall in between on this dimension.



One surprise in our data was that Trump supporters were not extreme on any of the foundations. This means that Trump supporters are more centrist than is commonly realized; consequently, Trump's prospects in the general election may be better than many pundits have thought. Cruz meanwhile, with a further-right moral profile, may have more difficulty attracting centrist Democrats and independents than would Trump.



One last interesting finding: Jeb Bush supporters are closest to the average American voter, despite the fact that his campaign has thus far has failed to gain any traction among Republican primary voters.



Bush's failures may have more to do with his poor debate performances than with his moral profile, but in this time of high and rising polarization, cross-partisan hostility, and anger at elites and the establishment, Bush appears to be suffering from an excess of agreeability: He has no standout moral message that connects to any particular moral foundation, even at the risk of alienating supporters of another.



Politics is in many ways like religion: Voters reward candidates who are effective preachers for a set of moral concerns. Candidates who understand this realize that electoral campaigns are not won just by articulating the most effective policy responses to the pressing issues of our time — they are not even won by appealing to self-interest.



Rather, an effective political preacher offers a clear moral vision of America. That vision includes a historical narrative about where we went wrong, and then tells us how we can set things right. It also includes strong moral arguments that connect with and validate the moral judgments of voters.



So the next time you hear someone ask, ""How on Earth can anyone vote for that ... person?"" tell them to think about all six foundations of morality.

[PassBlue ](https://www.passblue.com/2019/01/06/another-un-harassment-case-quietly-disappears/?utm_source=PassBlue+List&utm_campaign=2b7bc8b4a8-EMAIL_2020_01_06_NM&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4795f55662-2b7bc8b4a8-55022357)



Amid a busy December, when the United Nations was focusing on important conferences on climate change and migration and year-end holidays loomed, a case of harassment that never got the traction it arguably deserved ended in a traditional UN way: it disappeared.



On Dec. 14, the [chairman](http://www.ipsnews.net/2018/12/senior-un-official-resigns-undermining-sexual-abuse-charges/) of the [International Civil Service Commission](https://icsc.un.org/rootindex.asp), which regulates salaries and working conditions for staff members across the vast UN system, quietly resigned, after a year of dodging allegations that he had created a hostile and “unhealthy” environment for women who rejected his sexual advances.



The chairman of the commission, Kingston Rhodes of Sierra Leone, who held the rank of UN under secretary-general, was due to retire at the end of 2018, when his second term ended. His sudden, early resignation was exactly what the women who filed a complaint feared: Rhodes hung on and walked free. Four of those women had aired their allegations in a letter to Secretary-General António Guterres.



Rhodes’ staff even organized a farewell party for him, in place of a holiday party, and employees were urged to help defray the costs.



Thalif Deen, a correspondent at the UN for Inter Press Service, who was almost alone in his persistent reporting on the harassment story, wrote on Dec. 14 what women working for the commission had been predicting, “The UN’s heavily-hyped ‘zero tolerance’ policy on sexual abuse is being ridiculed once again.”



Equality Now, an international organization advocating for women’s rights, had been following the case for more than a year, since the allegations surfaced in November 2017. The organization had also formally asked for intervention by Guterres, who was reported to have said he found the allegations made by the women on the commission staff “credible.”



One complainant was Shihana Mohamed, a human-resources policies officer on the commission. In an interview with PassBlue last summer, she discussed several systemwide principles that she charged had been violated by Rhodes, who had created a “hostile” and threatening working environment.



While Rhodes — as an elected, not appointed, official — was not required to abide by some employee rules, one that he had at least publicly endorsed was a systemwide UN code of conduct. Under the heading “Harassment and abuse of authority,” it says:



“Harassment in any shape or form is an affront to human dignity and international civil servants must not engage in any form of harassment. International civil servants have the right to a workplace environment free of harassment or abuse. All organizations must prohibit any kind of harassment. Organizations have a duty to establish rules and provide guidance on what constitutes harassment and abuse of authority and how unacceptable behaviour will be addressed.



“International civil servants must not abuse their authority or use their power or position in a manner that is offensive, humiliating, embarrassing or intimidating to another person.”



The International Civil Service Commission, which has 15 commissioners from around the world and a staff of about 40 people, is not a remote body based far from the UN. It is across the street from UN headquarters in a building housing other UN offices. Yet for months, the UN Secretariat, including the office of the secretary-general, took the position that technically, the commission was an independent entity, having been created by the General Assembly and fully in charge of its own affairs.



Equality Now took issue with that explanation from the start. Yasmeen Hassan, the organization’s global executive director, said in a letter to Guterres in July, endorsed by nine other advocacy groups, “You are in a unique position to defend your staff against harassment, physical and psychological, by any others in the United Nations workplace.”



Although the complaint filed in November 2017 could have been acted on quickly, it took five months for the Office of Internal Oversight Services, the UN’s investigative arm, to begin considering the case and apparently to decide whether it had standing to investigate the commission.



When the investigation began, another seven months elapsed before it issued a report, according to the Inter Press Service, which has a global readership. The findings were sent to the commission in mid-December 2018 and have not been made public by that body or by the Secretariat.



Throughout the time that Rhodes was under investigation, he carried on blithely ignoring the complaints. For example, in a speech on July 9, he congratulated himself on the successes of his tenure.



“Twelve years ago when I was first appointed Chair of the Commission, I set out my vision for a revitalized Commission, which would reassert its leadership role and deepen engagement with the overall reform taking place in the organizations of the United Nations common system,” he said.



“At the time, I urged members of the Commission to recommit to the concept of a unified, high performing, merit-based international civil service which emphasizes and rewards performance. . . . Looking back, I take pride in seeing how much has been accomplished and the extent to which we were able to realise that vision together.”



Rhodes was allowed to continue in his post without interference from fellow commissioners or Guterres until less than two weeks from his scheduled retirement date. The details of what prompted his unexpected — earlier (so to speak) — resignation have not been made public.



He will be replaced as chairman by [Larbi Djacta](http://www.aps.dz/en/algeria/26436-algerian-larbi-djacta-elected-chairman-of-un-international-civil-service-commission) of Algeria. A member of the commission, Djacta is a diplomat who has also worked with UN peacekeeping.



After the resignation of Rhodes was announced, Shihana Mohamed, the complainant noted above and a leading figure in the campaign to expose the difficult conditions for women at the commission, publicized the details of her own experiences in a statement to Equality Now. She said, in an abridged version of her story:



“I was sexually harassed by the Chairman of the ICSC, Mr. Kingston Rhodes, for over 10 years — and I was not the only one,” Mohamed said. “Because I said NO to his repeated sexual advances, Mr. Rhodes denied me promotions, and excluded me from duty travels, training, assignments, projects, Commission sessions and working groups. In 2016, I was on sick leave for 3 months due to the stress caused by the hostile office environment and retaliation by the ICSC management.



“His quiet resignation just two weeks before the end of his term is a slap in my face and barely a slap on his wrist.”

"
"**Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization (WHO), is something of a superstar these days.**
The entire planet hangs on his every word as he explains, during regular press conferences at WHO headquarters in Geneva, just how widespread the Covid-19 pandemic now is and what countries must do to defeat it.
A who's who of world leaders joined him, virtually, at one of those meetings last month - France's President Emmanuel Macron, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa - all pledging support for the WHO's efforts to end the pandemic, and find a vaccine.
Pop star Lady Gaga turned up a week before that, announcing an online music festival One World Together at Home - with a host of big names from Billy Eilish, to Elton John, to the Rolling Stones.
No other senior UN official, not even the UN Secretary General himself, has ever received so much attention.
Dr Tedros, as he likes to be known, is the first African head of the WHO.
He took office two-and-a-half years ago promising to reform the organisation, and to tackle the illnesses that kill millions each year: malaria, measles, childhood pneumonia, and HIV/Aids.
A certain political wiliness has become apparent too as Dr Tedros faces down more than just the virus itself.
He has weathered bitter criticism - most notably from the US - of his handling of the pandemic, which the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January.
A PHEIC is the WHO's highest level of health emergency. That means it requires 24-hour monitoring, deployment of medical staff, equipment and medicines, daily discussions with affected countries and countries who might be affected, and of course, a steady stream of reliable information for an anxious world desperate for immediate answers.
A huge task for the ""charming"" and ""unassuming"" 55-year-old at the organisation's head.
At his first press conference as WHO director general, the Geneva-based journalists quickly realised Dr Tedros' style would be very different.
He strolled in smiling, sat down and chatted in a very relaxed way, his voice sometimes so quiet it was difficult to hear him. That was a very big change from his more formal predecessor, Margaret Chan.
And yet, behind that quiet manner, there lies a very determined man.
Before becoming head of the WHO, he climbed through the ranks of Ethiopia's government, becoming health minister and then foreign minister. He could not have risen that far by being self-effacing.
Dr Tedros was born in 1965 in Asmara, which became Eritrea's capital after independence from Ethiopia in 1991, and grew up in northern Ethiopia's Tigray region.
One formative, and now motivating experience, was the death of a younger brother, who was around four years old at the time, he told Time magazine in November. Later, as a student, Dr Tedros came to suspect it was measles that killed him.
""I didn't accept it; I don't accept it even now,"" he was quoted as saying, adding that it was unfair that a child should die from a preventable disease just because he was born in the wrong place.
""All roads should lead to universal health coverage. I will not rest until we have met this,"" he told the World Health Assembly shortly before his election as WHO chief.
As the coronavirus pandemic exposes the fragility of even the richest countries' health sectors in a crisis, Dr Tedros and his supporters believe it's the best argument there is for a radical global commitment to universal health coverage.
Dr Tedros became a member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was in the vanguard of the 1991 overthrow of Ethiopia's Marxist dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam.
As a government minister from 2005, he was seen as more approachable and friendly than some of his more austere TPLF comrades.
He has been praised for reforming the health sector and improving access to health care in Ethiopia, Africa's most populous state after Nigeria.
But when he was in charge, his ministry was known to discourage journalists from reporting about suspected cholera cases in the country.
During his highly efficient and ultimately successful campaign to lead the WHO, Dr Tedros' supporters dismissed allegations that he had covered up cholera outbreaks.
That is why ""persuasive"" and ""political"" are also words which crop up regularly when discussing his leadership of the WHO.
He knows that the WHO's success tackling global health crises depends on the co-operation of the organisation's 194 member states.
During the current Ebola outbreak in DR Congo which is also a PHEIC, he has travelled there several times, not just to see the situation but to also talk to government leaders. And he moved quickly to visit Beijing when news of the coronavirus outbreak emerged.
""His strategy is to coax China to transparency and international co-operation rather than criticising the government,"" says Lawrence Gostin, Professor of Global Health Law at Georgetown University.
But has that actually worked?
Some WHO watchers have criticised the effusive praise heaped on China for its containment measures.
After his trip to Beijing, Dr Tedros said China had set ""a new standard for outbreak control"".
A few days later, he told world leaders meeting at the Munich Security Conference that China's actions had ""bought the world time"".
Such comments sit uneasily with the knowledge that China arrested health workers who first raised the alarm about the outbreak.
The US, with President Donald Trump leading the way, has cut its funding to the WHO, saying the organisation botched its efforts to control the pandemic.
Dr Tedros knows very well just how serious the US funding cut is, not just on an immediate financial level, but to the whole UN system, based as it is on a multilateral approach to the world's biggest threats.
He has been careful to say that he ""regrets"" the US decision, and his only mention of Mr Trump was to say he thought the president was handling the US' virus outbreak well.
But that all-star line up of world leaders, in which the US was conspicuous by its absence, was a political masterstroke.
It laid the groundwork for an accelerated development of treatments and vaccines, and promised the resulting medicines would be fairly priced, and available to all.
At the same time it sent a signal to Washington: Look, we're all here getting on with this crisis together, where are you?
So is there any foundation to the US charge that the WHO waited too long to declare a PHEIC?
""I was one of the first to ask him to call a PHEIC,"" says Prof Gostin. ""Having said that, it was only a short delay and I don't think the timing had any impact on the trajectory of Covid-19.""
""I do worry quite a bit however that his effusive praise for China could in the long term tarnish the WHO's reputation as a trusted scientific authority willing to speak truth to power.""
Meg Davis, a global health specialist at Geneva's Graduate Institute, views the WHO's position as an awkward one.
""All my sympathies go to [them], they were in a tough spot,"" she says. ""China was the place where we first saw the outbreak. They [WHO] sent a team to China, wrote generally an accurate report about the things China was doing well.
""But they didn't talk about censorship, or repression of whistleblowersâ¦ and because they didn't do that, they are now having to pay a ridiculous price.""
Now is not the time, says Dr Davis, to start cutting funding.
""At this moment we really need the WHO more than ever. We need a functional well-resourced organisation, to analyse the data and gather evidence of what works.""
So while Dr Tedros may be political, a lot of that political effort seems to be spent reassuring authoritarian, opaque governments, in a bid to get them to work with the WHO to tackle diseases which threaten global health.
When it comes to perceiving how that effort may be viewed by governments in Western democracies, his political skills may not be quite so sharp.
Shortly after taking office he proposed Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president at the time, as a WHO goodwill ambassador, saying he had worked to make Zimbabwe ""a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies"".
Only after days of outrage, not just from governments, but from human rights groups, who pointed to the deprivation that Mr Mugabe's regime had inflicted on its people, did Dr Tedros decide to withdraw his proposal.
It is not the first time the WHO has been in the spotlight for allegedly handling a disease outbreak badly.
Dr Tedros' predecessor Margaret Chan was criticised for a perceived overreaction to the 2010 swine flu outbreak, over which she declared a pandemic and advised countries to spend millions on medicines most did not, in the end, need.
Then she was seen to react far too slowly to West Africa's catastrophic Ebola outbreak, which claimed at least 11,000 lives.
""Damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" is a phrase you often hear at WHO headquarters.
Prof Gostin believes Dr Tedros has become ""the symbol of leadership"" in the course of the coronavirus crisis. But, he warns, the WHO's ""fundamental weaknesses are still there, including pitiful funding"".
The success of Dr Tedros, and the WHO as a whole, at handling the coronavirus will not be really clear until the crisis is over.
For now, he will keep on advising countries to prepare, to diagnose, to trace, and to contain.
And so he continues with his press conferences. He knows they are being watched around the world, in every time zone. He begins each with the words ""Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening"".
Despite the pressure to come up with answers, and despite the constant media spotlight, he remains quiet and friendly.
His only flash of passion came when he was asked, for the umpteenth time, what his response was to the personal criticism of him.
""I don't have extra energy for that,"" he said. ""My focus is on saving lives."""
"The Morrison government has asked the human rights committee of the United Nations to dismiss a landmark claim by a group of Torres Strait Islanders from low-lying islands off the northern coast of Australia that climate change is having an impact on their human rights, according to lawyers for the complainants. The complaint, lodged just over 12 months ago, argued the Morrison government had failed to take adequate action to reduce emissions or pursue proper adaptation measures on the islands and, as a consequence, had failed fundamental human rights obligations to Torres Strait Islander people.  But the lead lawyer for the case, Sophie Marjanac, says the Coalition has rejected arguments from the islanders, telling the UN the case should be dismissed “because it concerns future risks, rather than impacts being felt now, and is therefore inadmissible”. Marjanac said lawyers for the commonwealth had told the committee because Australia is not the main or only contributor to global warming, climate change action is not its legal responsibility under human rights law. “The government’s lawyers also rejected arguments that climate impacts were being felt today, and that effects constituting a human rights violation are yet to be suffered”. A spokesman for the attorney general, Christian Porter, said submissions to the human rights committee were not publicly available. He said once made, the UN transmits the government’s submission to the complainants. “It is now for the committee to consider the submissions and reach a decision,” the spokesman said. The UN Human Rights Committee is a body of 18 legal experts that sits in Geneva. The committee monitors compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Guardian Australia has not seen the commonwealth’s submission, because that would be a breach of UN processes. The complainants are alleging that Australia has violated article 27, the right to culture; article 17, the right to be free from arbitrary interference with privacy, family and home; and article 6, the right to life. Decisions in these processes can take up to two years. Lawyers for the islanders have alleged that the catastrophic nature of the predicted future impacts of climate change on the Torres Strait Islands, including the total submergence of ancestral homelands, is a sufficiently severe impact as to constitute a violation of the rights to culture, family and life. The challenges associated with sea level rise in the Torres Strait have been well documented. A report from the Climate Council on the risks associated with coastal flooding notes that Torres Strait Island communities are extremely low-lying and are thus among the most vulnerable in Australia to the impacts of climate change. The report concludes the shallowness of the strait “exacerbates storm surges and when such surges coincide with very high tides, extreme sea levels result”. It cites sea level data collected by satellite from one location in the Torres Strait between 1993 and 2010 that indicated a rise of 6 mm per annum, “more than twice the global average”, Although the report notes this was a single dataset, low-lying islands in the Pacific – and Torres Strait islands such as Masig and Boigu – are likely to be at the forefront of forced displacement. Some forecasts have predicted up to 150 million people could be forcibly displaced by climate change by 2040 – larger than the record number of people already forced from their homes globally. The non-profit group ClientEarth is supporting the complaint. A spokesman for the group said: “It is shameful that Indigenous communities on Australia’s climate frontline are being told that the risk of climate change to their human rights is merely a future hypothetical issue, when scientists are clear these impacts will happen in coming decades”. “Climate change risk is foreseeable and only preventable through immediate action in the present. States like Australia have legal duties to protect the human rights of their citizens”."

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   
  
\---   
  
“New Actions to Reduce Methane Emissions Will Curb Climate Change, Cut Down on Wasted Energy” reads the headline from Wednesday’s White House blog, posted by Counselor to the President John Podesta (who will be leaving this post soon to serve as a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s presumed 2016 presidential campaign).   
  
Let’s hope Podesta didn’t write the title, because it is completely wrong.   
  
First off, methane isn’t energy. It’s a gas. Like anything else, it can be converted to energy, and like a fuel the conversion process produces more energy than it takes to perform it. But methane leaks from the oil and gas sectors no more represent “wasted energy” than does cow flatulence.   
  
More accurately, methane leaks represent lost revenue. Or at least they would if natural gas prices were higher. With prices as low as they are, companies sometime find it more costly to stop the leaks than what they gain by capturing the methane and bringing it to market.   
  
Consider that the price of natural gas is so low in many regions where oil is being extracted from tight shale deposits (for example, the Bakken region of North Dakota and in west Texas) that the methane that is produced along with the oil is simply flared (burned) on site, rather than being captured and brought to market. It is more expensive to develop the transport infrastructure (largely it has to be transported via pipeline) than the return on the sale of natural gas.   
  
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that in 2013, more than 260 billion cubic feet of methane was flared in the United States. In essence, this methane represented more “unwanted” energy than “wasted” energy.   




But methane flaring is not the target of the new EPA regulations; instead, methane leakage is. In fairness, when it comes to climate change, on a unit basis, leaked methane is more important than flared methane, because the flaring process converts the methane to carbon dioxide (among other things), which has a much lower “global warming potential” than does methane.   
  
This “global warming potential” is why methane leakage is targeted in the first place by the Obama administration—it is another “we are doing something about climate change” excuse for increasing the reach of the federal government.   
  
The amount of methane that falls under the new EPA regs is very small; in the grand scheme of global warming, it is so small as to be climatically immaterial (which is the other thing wrong with Podesta’s blog headline—it won’t “curb” climate change a whit).   
  
In 2013, methane emissions accounted for about 9% of greenhouse gases emitted in the United States. (Carbon dioxide accounted for 82%.) Of this 9%, about 3% are the subject to the proposed EPA regulations—which seeks to cut those emissions in half.   
  
So how much “climate change” would such regulation avert in the future? Here’s a back-of-the-envelope calculation:   
  
Using our handy dandy temperature savings calculator, you can find out that if the United States were to cease all carbon dioxide emissions now and forever, the amount of global warming that would be “saved” amounts to 0.10°C by the end of the century (assuming a 2.0°C climate sensitivity, which is more realistic than the 3.0°C value the EPA is fond of). So if halting 87% of our greenhouse gas emissions produces a saving of 0.10°C, then halting 1.5% of our greenhouse gas emissions produces about 0.002°C of temperature savings.   
  
That’s it. Two-thousandths of a degree of warming averted by the new EPA regulations!   
  
Perhaps what is most odd with the newly proposed regulations is that in their absence, methane emissions from the natural gas and oil sector, according to the EPA’s own data, have declined about 10% since 2008—a time when U.S. oil and natural gas production has skyrocketed.   
  
In fact, all of this decline has come from the natural gas industry. (Methane emissions from oil production has actually increased slightly.) Why? Largely because natural gas producers want to limit losses of the very thing they are trying to produce. Consequently, they have developed and employed new technologies to prevent leakage all along the line from drilling, to transportation, to processing. Undoubtedly, they will continue to do this in the future.   
  
So, the ongoing and self-incentivized trend toward declining emissions, along with an imperceptible influence on global warming, means that the newly proposed methane regulations from the EPA are completely unneeded.   
  
This leads to the conclusion that they are being imposed for appearance’s sake only—appearing to burnish President Obama’s climate legacy with an eye toward increasing his clout during this December’s United Nations climate meeting. There, in Paris, he is going to champion a new, “legally binding” treaty on climate change. The same was supposed to happen during the Copenhagen meeting in 2009, where posturing hype was the order of the year. That didn’t work out very well, as the meeting was a complete failure. We anticipate a similar result will come out of Paris.

"On Thursday 20 August, it will be exactly two years since the first school strike for the climate took place. Looking back, a lot has happened. Many millions have taken to the streets to join the decades-long fight for climate and environmental justice. And on 28 November 2019, the European parliament declared a “climate and environmental emergency”. But over these past two years, the world has also emitted more than 80 gigatonnes of CO2. We have seen continuous natural disasters taking place across the globe: wildfires, heatwaves, flooding, hurricanes, storms, thawing of permafrost and collapsing of glaciers and whole ecosystems. Many lives and livelihoods have been lost. And this is only the very beginning.  Today, leaders all over the world are speaking of an “existential crisis”. The climate emergency is discussed on countless panels and summits. Commitments are being made, big speeches are given. Yet, when it comes to action we are still in a state of denial. The climate and ecological crisis has never once been treated as a crisis. The gap between what we need to do and what’s actually being done is widening by the minute. Effectively, we have lost another two crucial years to political inaction. Last month, just ahead of the European council summit, we published an open letter with demands to EU and world leaders. Since then, more than 125,000 people have signed this letter. Tomorrow we will meet the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and deliver the letter and demands, as well as the signatures. We will tell Merkel that she must face up to the climate emergency – especially as Germany now holds the presidency of the European council. Europe has a responsibility to act. The EU and the United Kingdom are accountable for 22% of historic accumulative global emissions, second only to the United States. It is immoral that the countries that have done the least to cause the problem are suffering first and worst. The EU must act now, as it has signed up to do in the Paris agreement. Our demands include halting all fossil fuel investments and subsidies, divesting from fossil fuels, making ecocide an international crime, designing policies that protect workers and the most vulnerable, safeguarding democracy and establishing annual, binding carbon budgets based on the best available science. We understand the world is complicated and that what we are asking for may not be easy or may seem unrealistic. But it is much more unrealistic to believe that our societies would be able to survive the global heating we’re heading for – as well as other disastrous ecological consequences of today’s business as usual. We are inevitably going to have to fundamentally change, one way or another. The question is, will the changes be on our terms, or on nature’s terms? In the Paris agreement, world leaders committed themselves to keeping the global average temperature rise to well below 2C, and aiming for 1.5C. Our demands demonstrate what that commitment means. Yet this is just the very minimum of what needs to be done to deliver on those promises. So if leaders are not willing to do this, they’ll have to start explaining why they’re giving up on the Paris agreement. Giving up on their promises. Giving up on the people living in the most affected areas. Giving up on the chances of handing over a safe future for their children. Giving up without even trying. Science doesn’t tell anyone what to do, it merely collects and presents verified information. It is up to us to study and connect the dots. When you read the IPCC SR1.5 report and the UNEP production gap report, as well as what leaders have actually signed up for in the Paris agreement, you see that the climate and ecological crisis can no longer be solved within today’s systems. Even a child can see that policies of today don’t add up with the current best available science. We need to end the ongoing wrecking, exploitation and destruction of our life support systems and move towards a fully decarbonised economy that is centred on the wellbeing of all people, democracy and the natural world. If we are to have a chance of staying below 1.5C of warming, our emissions need to immediately start reducing rapidly towards zero and then on to negative figures. That’s a fact. And since we don’t have all the technical solutions we need to achieve that, we have to work with what we have at hand today. And this has to include stopping doing certain things. That’s also a fact. However, it’s a fact that most people refuse to accept. Just the thought of being in a crisis that we cannot buy, build or invest our way out of seems to create some kind of collective mental short circuit. This mix of ignorance, denial and unawareness is at the very heart of the problem. As it is now, we can have as many meetings and climate conferences as we want. They will not lead to sufficient changes, because the willingness to act and the level of awareness needed are still nowhere in sight. The only way forward is for society to start treating the crisis like a crisis. We still have the future in our own hands. But time is rapidly slipping through our fingers. We can still avoid the worst consequences. But to do that, we have to face the climate emergency and change our ways. And that is the uncomfortable truth we cannot escape. • Greta Thunberg is a 17-year-old environmental campaigner from Sweden.

"At key moments in history, courts around the world have helped to accelerate social change – they have vindicated the demands of people fighting to end slavery, racial segregation and gender inequality. It should therefore come as no surprise that they are being called on to help resolve the biggest social and environmental crisis of our time: the climate emergency. The case against the government of the Netherlands powerfully illustrates what climate litigation can achieve. In 2015, the Hague district court issued a groundbreaking decision in response to a lawsuit filed by the Urgenda Foundation and 886 Dutch citizens, arguing that the government was failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough. The court agreed that the government’s actions were unlawful and ordered it to slash the Netherlands’ emissions by 2020. That decision was upheld by a court of appeal and ultimately by the supreme court of the Netherlands in 2019.  It’s hard to overstate the impact: in response, the government has taken huge steps to reduce emissions, including closing or significantly reducing the capacity of coal-fired power plants and overseeing €3bn worth of low-carbon investment. The first judgment also spurred public debate that led to a new Climate Change Act. But the value of the litigation was just as clear in the hushed, crowded courtroom in the Hague. People waited for the country’s highest court to validate what they instinctively knew to be true: that governments cannot know the risks of climate change and wilfully ignore them. Urgenda’s case has inspired communities and organisations around the world to hold governments and big polluters legally responsible for their contribution to the climate crisis. From the Philippines to Canada to Colombia, people are looking for accountability for decades of broken promises. Governments signed an international treaty to address climate change almost 30 years ago, and fossil fuel companies have known that since at least the 1970s the product that they sell leads directly to global warming. Last month, we supported a historic case challenging the Irish government’s inadequate emissions reduction plan, which resulted in the supreme court requiring the government to make a new, more ambitious one. Lawsuits are not a panacea. It takes significant public vigilance and pressure to ensure that judgments translate into real change. But litigation is one of the most powerful tools we have for claiming our rights and making clear what’s at stake – and the stakes have never been higher. • Tessa Khan is a climate change lawyer, co-director of the Climate Litigation Network and a member of Urgenda’s legal team"
"It seems like science fiction that 44 years ago Apollo 11 astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin traveled nearly a quarter of a million miles to walk on the surface of the Moon. 
When the crew of Apollo 17 returned to Earth in December 1972, they were not only the last humans to visit the moon, but also the last to venture further than a couple of hundred miles from the Earth. That the moon landings were achieved less than 10 years after Kennedy’s now famous speech in Rice, Texas, 1962 makes it more amazing still. His impassioned argument for why a Moon landing and safe return should be the challenge to be met was: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard”. The more romantic notions of space exploration aside, Apollo was a statement of US scientific, engineering, industrial and political exceptionalism, driven by Cold War rivalry with the USSR. Technological elements of it were based on intercontinental nuclear missile programmes. The fear of nuclear war and losing the space race helped build support for Apollo. Despite some of the more apocalyptic predictions of runaway climate change, one challenge of reducing carbon emissions is that while we have been monitoring atmospheric CO2 for decades, the slow, steady increase and diffuse effects has meant there isn’t a single identifiable threat against which we can organise. As with boiling a frog, when temperatures rise sufficiently gradually, by the time it’s too hot, it’s too late to do something about it. Climate change is not the only detrimental impact humans are having on the Earth. What may be one of the great mass extinction events is taking place, and over half of the world’s great tropical rain forests have been destroyed, leaving perhaps 20% by the middle of this century at current rates of deforestation. Within a few decades we will need at least 50% more energy and food and 30% more water, which means working the Earth harder for what it can give us, while urgently reducing the impact we have on its planetary boundaries. This context makes the challenge greater, and we should use this magnitude and scale as a rallying call. So if in 1962 the US chose to go to the Moon, 51 years later we can choose to reduce impacts on the Earth. Asked why we should to divert effort, energy and money to this challenge, the response should be that we are choosing the Earth. We choose the Earth in this decade and the next, not because it is easy, but because it is hard. Because – as Kennedy said then – that goal will serve to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone. Reducing carbon emissions will require fundamental transformations in energy production that will challenge us scientifically and technologically. We have already made good progress – the cost of solar-powered electricity is about one hundredth what it was in the 1970s, wind power and other renewable energy capacity is rapidly growing, and new generations of nuclear fission reactors, even fusion reactors, hold the potential for safer, clean power. But generation is only one aspect. We will need to build smartgrids in which electric vehicles not only consume electricity but are also batteries that can power homes. This requires massive investment in, and sometimes complete reconstruction of transmission networks. It will require a new generation of engineers to build new infrastructure. More challenging are the changes to governance and political institutions. This means messy and imperfect politics, and that means voting. The wishes of young people are very often under-represented  because they often won’t engage with the political process. Democracy is not just about voting, it’s also about knowing who represents you and you telling them what you find important. Write to them. Complain. Don’t like any of the candidates? Spoil your paper. Start your own party. Meet other people who share your interests and values. Individually you can be ignored. Collectively you can agitate and initiate real change. Rather than top down, imposed solutions that don’t work get people involved in processes and issues that matter to them. Connect them with others and have them feel invested in these projects and collectively build consensus and power from the bottom up. Perhaps the greatest challenge of all is finding the set of values that will let us live sustainably on the Earth. Hyper-consumerism and the demand for growth is simply not compatible with the finite resources of our planet, and the use of Gross Domestic Product as the only measure that counts needs to be addressed, so that natural resources and human lives are defined by more than monetary values. One of Apollo’s greatest achievements is the image of Earth known as the Blue Marble, taken by the crew of Apollo 17 as they left the Earth. Mission commander Eugene Cernan said later that “We went to explore the moon and in fact discovered the Earth”. The Earth had been photographed from space before, but this was the first complete high quality colour picture. Beautiful, without borders, it hangs dynamic and fragile in the vast blackness of space. Its atmosphere, a thin film that clings to its surface. The Cold War propelled us to the Moon 50 years ago. Our response to the prospects of a hotter climate can be to choose to live sustainably on our home planet. In doing so our legacy to future generations can be that we decided to choose the Earth that they would wish to live on."
"TEHRAN  —   The Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, whose film “The Salesman” is nominated for an Academy Award for best   movie, said on Sunday that he would not attend the Oscars ceremony next month even if he were granted an exception to President Trump’s visa ban for citizens from Iran and several other predominantly Muslim countries. Mr. Farhadi said he had planned to attend the Feb. 26 ceremony in Los Angeles and while there bring attention to a decision he called “unjust. ” But the executive order signed by President Trump on Friday presented “ifs and buts which are in no way acceptable to me even if exceptions were to be made for my trip,” he said in a statement to The New York Times. The executive order blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also suspended entry of all refugees for 120 days and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely. Here is Mr. Farhadi’s statement: [See where to stream Asghar Farhadi’s dramas at Watching, The New York Times’s film and TV recommendation site."
"On a chilly October morning, Talea Childs, 4, still dressed in pajamas, bounced along the living room rug of a United States map. “Konnichiwa,” she greeted in Japanese, and bowed. Surrounded by shelves of her favorite books, she selected a thin volume and sat to read. “She’s been interested in books since she could belly over and look at the pages,” her mother, Trenicia Childs, said as Talea settled into the story. Ms. Childs is applying to kindergarten for next year  —   a notoriously rigorous process in New York City schools  —   and nurtures her daughter’s learning at home. A schedule taped to a cupboard by the kitchen lists Circle Time,   Storytelling, Cooking and other activities. Brushes, thick with paint, sit in a canister by the sink, and evidence of recent art projects lines the walls  —   abstract strokes of pinks, purples and green glitter. Also on the walls are posters of the solar system, the human body, the numbers through 100 and the words “large,” “small,” “run” and “walk” and associated words. While Talea read in the corner, Ms. Childs sorted through piles of housing documents. The Childses, who are among almost 565, 000 people in New York State who receive some public assistance, according to state calculations in June, never expected to need help. Ms. Childs, 45, and her husband, Tarrell Childs, 40, an Air Force veteran, have college degrees and work force experience. While serving in the military for a decade as an account finance specialist, Mr. Childs worked through an injury in 1997 that gouged and blinded his right eye. A Bronx native, he returned there in 2003, working full time while studying English literature at Fordham University. He wrote short stories, plays and short film scripts late into the night. The couple met at Moca Bar and Lounge at a spoken word performance in Harlem in 2010. Mr. Childs wondered aloud what their children would be like on their second date. A year later they were married and expecting their daughter. With Mr. Childs’s steady income as a property manager, Ms. Childs postponed completing her master’s in education to raise their daughter. She was one certification shy of graduation. But Mr. Childs lost his job in 2014 when his company restructured because of financial problems. “That’s when we really started getting behind,” Ms. Childs said. With his G. I. Bill benefits set to expire, Mr. Childs dusted off his screenplays and applied to the New York Film Academy. He got in. He planned to work while going to school, but he found that an accelerated yearlong conservatory program packed with   days did not allow for extra time. Although the military covered his studies, the family exhausted its meager savings. With little time to search for jobs during school, Mr. Childs graduated in September 2015 without work. That month, bringing in just $594. 98 in disability payments from Veterans Affairs, the Childses applied for public assistance, confronting a frustrating labyrinth of city departments and aid applications, according to documents provided by the family. They hoped the assistance would be temporary  —   keeping food on the table and bills paid on time  —   until they gained   employment. In October 2015, a month after they applied for aid, the city’s Human Resources Administration lost their paperwork. A month after that, the Homelessness Diversion Units forced them to reapply. And a month after that: the same story. Their debt quadrupled while they waited for paperwork to be fixed, and they faced imminent eviction after missing rent payments, the family said. With a worsened financial situation, the family was told that December that its rent was too high and its arrears too steep to qualify for assistance from the Homelessness Diversion Units, so it was referred to the Neighborhood Association for   Affairs, a nonprofit organization providing housing intervention and assistance services. That same month, the Childses found out they had qualified for public assistance through the Human Resources Administration. But two days later, another error closed their case, halting all public assistance, including food stamps. In early 2016, the Human Resources Administration reopened the case, and the family reapplied to the Neighborhood Association for   Affairs. But a week later the nonprofit denied the application. Eventually, in February, the Human Resources Administration referred the family for an eviction prevention subsidy. “It felt personal,” Ms. Childs said. “It was one more stressor when there were already weeks we didn’t have enough food on the table. ” In March, HomeBase, an eviction prevention program administered by Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, helped them navigate the complicated application process  —   which included another errant application closing in April  —   and avoid eviction. By this time, the family was $12, 193. 46 in arrears. “It’s right out of a Kafka novel,” said Alice Kenny, the organization’s director of special projects. In May, Catholic Charities got the city to help settle the Childs family’s arrears with a lump sum of $12, 083. 46. Then in June, nine months after initially applying for a housing subsidy, they received their first payment, along with another conciliation notice threatening case closure. The family resolved the notice and now receives $960 a month toward rent from the city. Still, despite noting Mr. Childs’s veteran status in September 2015, the family was not referred to the proper office for public assistance for more than a year. Last summer, Mr. Childs got a job as a substitute teacher. Working toward a teaching license while interning on film projects, he anticipates additional film work this year. In January, he began a work training program at a martial arts school in the Bronx, learning to become an instructor. Ms. Childs also temporarily worked at a   job with the federal Women, Infants and Children program. She has also taught English to children in their Bronx neighborhood and plans to return to school to study early childhood education and later open a toddler education program, based on the family’s educational approach at home. The family brings in $950 monthly, and currently has about $2, 000 in rent arrears. HomeBase provided the family with $340 in July to buy a dresser and a toddler bed for Talea. Then in September, Catholic Charities provided $162. 85 in Neediest Cases funds to cover the cost of Talea’s school clothes and bedding. Through public assistance, the family can use child care centers that are suggested and subsidized by the city. The family tried several of those education programs last year, but the workload and environment were not stimulating, Ms. Childs said, so she enrolled Talea at a Montessori school, where the family receives financial aid, in late October and doubled her efforts at home. The Childses have applied to five independent schools, where they believe Talea could thrive next school year, but the costs  —   estimated at $25, 000 to $45, 000 annually  —   are high. They have applied for financial aid to the schools through Early Steps, a nonprofit intended to increase diversity within kindergarten and   classrooms in independent schools. Talea will find out in February if she is accepted to any of the schools. At night, the family dresses up and improvises plays, which Mr. Childs records. Many end in life lessons.   is not one of them. While sitting on a park bench on a recent   outing, Ms. Childs said, she had a conversation with another mother who did not agree that everyone deserved the same chances. Unaware that the Childs family receives welfare, the woman depicted recipients as sloths sitting at home, sending their children to overpriced day care centers. “But is that who we are?” Ms. Childs asked, recalling the conversation. “The assumption is if you’re on public assistance, you don’t want to work. Yes, we receive a check every month. But we also work and are involved in our kid’s life. We’re working hard to make something of ourselves. So, no, that’s not who we are at all. ”"
"The latest results from the National Ignition Facility in the US represent the passing of a nuclear fusion power milestone and come after a year of significant progress at projects in France and the UK. The concept underpinning energy release from nuclear processes dates back to 1905 when Albert Einstein wrote his most famous paper. Writing on his theory of relativity, an observation in the paper became the world’s most famous equation: E=mc2 This startling observation became the key to understanding both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. It ultimately tells us that when heavy elements such as uranium are split, they release a huge amount of energy – this is called fission. Similarly, when we join light elements such as hydrogen together this is called fusion, and also releases energy. Both processes are at a scale of energy release that is typically millions of times greater than conventional chemical reactions, such as burning coal or gas. They also have a huge benefit – they do not produce carbon dioxide as a direct by-product. These two technologies took rather different routes as they developed. Even Einstein himself had initially thought that a fission-powered atomic bomb might not be possible as a practical device – indeed early, and ultimately incorrect, calculations showed that it would need to be so massive that only a huge cargo ship could carry it. It was work done by Otto Frisch (one of the pioneers who first understood the fission process) and Rudolph Peierls at the University of Birmingham in Britain during the Second World War which showed how enriching uranium could instigate a self-sustaining process – a “chain reaction” – with a much smaller amount of material. The first human-initiated chain reaction was set up by Enrico Fermi, and famously took place in a squash court at the University of Chicago in 1942 – and with the world at war, much work was done to find military uses for nuclear fission, culminating in the Manhattan Project – the US project to produce an atomic weapon. Following the war, remarkably, the fission programme went from that small-scale demonstration of principle to full-scale power station electricity generation within a short period of only about 15 years. The world’s first nuclear fission station to send a significant amount of electricity to a national grid was powered by Britain’s Calder Hall reactors next to the Sellafield site when they were opened by the Queen in 1956. The Americans followed the British in the following year with the Shippingport reactor. In contrast to fission, the promise of fusion power is much more challenging and has taken much longer to develop. After decades of research we are still without a functioning fusion power station, although significant progress has been made. The potentially enormous benefits to humankind, should fusion energy production be made both practical and economic, would amply repay the research effort. Fusion could end up being a vital component in a future low-carbon energy mix and may even become the main energy source in use for the latter part of this century and into the future. Fusion is what happens at the heart of stars like our sun, generating such vast quantities of energy that light and heat reaches the Earth across tens of millions of miles of cold space. To harness the power of fusion, the light elements it uses as fuel must be heated to such high temperatures – around 100,000,000°C – that they become a highly charged plasma. This is energy-intensive to heat and difficult to control once heated. But only under these conditions will the atoms fuse together, bound by the strong nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces. This holds an atom’s nucleus together despite the fact that the positively charged protons it contains naturally try to repel each other. The sun is capable of sustaining a continual fusion reaction because of its immense, self-sustaining heat and its colossal size that generates vast gravitational forces. On Earth, we have to contain the plasma by generating our own complex magnetic fields as have been used at the JET and MAST facilities at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy in the UK and will be used at ITER in France. An alternative is to provide intense compression to the material, such as via laser heating as used at the NIF in the US. The most promising fusion reactor design in use is the tokamak, a toroidal, doughnut-shaped chamber around which the high-temperature plasma flows, confined to the chamber and held away from the walls by powerful magnets. The complexities of fission seem minor by comparison – fission can take place at room temperature, and the fission chain reaction is propagated by uncharged particles called neutrons that, being uncharged, require no complex magnetic confinement. Another practical issue that must be surmounted is the damage dealt out by the fusion reaction to the reactor’s components from the huge amount of energy it creates. The fuel rod assemblies used to deliver fuel into fission reactors’ cores suffer from this damage to some degree, but as these are replaced when the reactor is refuelled it doesn’t become a problem. The challenge for a fusion reactor is to design structural materials for the tokamak that can withstand the significant damage, at the microscopic level, that such huge amounts of energy delivers. These two challenges – plasma containment and materials research – are the largest technical reasons why fusion has still yet to leave the development stage. But with essentially limitless hydrogen fusion fuel compared to finite supplies of uranium fission fuel and considerably reduced potential problems from radioactivity (decay times for a future fusion powerplant are 50-100 years), fusion power remains energy’s holy grail. The saying about fusion power is that it is always “30 years away” – perhaps with recent developments that 30 years has finally stopped being pushed back and has started counting down."
"Despite the environment being, according to the Olympic Charter, the “third dimension of Olympism”, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has yet to act on the enormous tonnage of lead shot scattered around by Olympic clay pigeon shooters. I have personally warned the IOC Executive of this problem repeatedly during the past 20 years, to no avail. While this doesn’t apply to the Winter and Summer Olympic Games directly, where spent bullets are trapped directly behind the targets, many tonnes of shot accumulate over the years of practice by Olympic hopefuls and contenders from all nations supporting these events. This shot is rarely recovered: it is ingested by wildlife, contaminates soils, and pollutes groundwater. The harmful effects of lead poisoning have been known for centuries. There is much documented evidence of lead shot poisoning livestock where shooting fall-out zones extend over agricultural lands. Scientific analyses of the toxic effects of lead exposure on wildlife appear in many respected scientific journals. A recent study revealed banning lead shot in Spain had reduced cases of lead poisoning by 50%. Yet there is widespread denial of this problem. Sceptics denigrate the quality of the scientific information. The International Shooting Sports Federation (ISSF) which regulates all Olympic shooting contends: “the whole topic of lead and other heavy metals is one where emotion rules and logic does not apply.” Similarly, the European Shooting Confederation (ESC) states: “Several countries have banned or will prohibit the use of lead shots for all purposes, however without any scientifically good reason.” It is argued, incorrectly, that suitable lead-free ammunition is too expensive and ineffective against clay targets. Regrettably, the effects of lead exposure and toxicity are rarely seen by those who cause it. In papers published last year in the journals AMBIO and Environmental Policy and Law I showed that there are no such barriers to the use of steel shot in Olympic shooting, and laid out the steps the IOC could take to address the problem, consistent with its charter obligations. In fact, it is an awareness of the toxicity of ingested lead shot to wildlife that has led a growing number of jurisdictions in North American, Australia and Europe to require the use of lead-free shot. For example, it has been banned for wetland shooting in the US since 1991, and in Canada since 1999. But still clay target shooting evades regulation. This is due to the piecemeal manner in which governments have addressed the issue, and the vociferous opposition from the shooting lobby. Even in the Netherlands and Denmark, countries with total bans on lead shot, Olympic shooters are required to practice and qualify with lead shot cartridges, in specially-designated shooting grounds. Such are the regulations of the ISSF which require lead shot. But Olympic rules take precedence over national rules for all sanctioned events, including shooting. A decision from the IOC to mandate lead-free shot for all Olympic events and qualifications would be an important precedent and could promote efforts to reduce lead shot use in other sporting events. No statistics are kept on the number of athletes who engage in Olympic shooting in each nation, nor are records kept of the amount of ammunition used. An Olympic qualifier could easily fire around 1,000 cartridges a week to maintain the proficiency required to be a contender for the medal-winner’s podium. This corresponds to about 1.3 tonnes of lead shot per shooter each year – an enormous quantity of a known neurotoxin deposited worldwide, not to mention the shot still distributed throughout the environment from previous years. Only between four and six pieces of lead shot ingested at once are sufficient to fatally poison a duck, pheasant, or similar bird. In North America and Europe, the number of people engaged in Olympic trap and skeet shooting is small compared to the total number engaged in the World Championships, European Championships, National Championships, local events, and recreational practice shooting. All of these activities use lead shot, and regardless of the event’s level, lead shot is still released into the environment. It is not ammunition manufacturers that are the main source of this impasse – they have already developed and marketed internationally approved lead-free substitutes. It is the sporting organisations that have resisted change, hence my calls to the IOC. International campaigns have been successful in banning lead from petrol, paints, solders, glass, glazes, and other products for good reason – its effects on health are well known. Then why has lead ammunition resisted regulation for so long? Society demanded prompt changes when human health was at risk, but seems less concerned when it is wildlife health at stake. But we know that lead shot used in hunting does enter the human food chain. Simply put, the toxicity of lead shot is a problem wherever it is used and for whatever purpose. The IOC should live up to its environmental and humanitarian founding charter and ban lead shot from its events, firing a shot that would reverberate throughout the shooting world."
"Six years ago I found myself trying to find shade from the mid-morning sun while having a chat with a farmer, Rick Laird. We were chained together, six metres above the ground, on the deck of an enormous super digger in a clearing in what would become Whitehaven Coal’s Maules Creek mine. I had gone up to Maules Creek to show solidarity with the community protesting against the mine; to add my voice to the hundreds of others who joined the Leard blockade and had been arrested. From farmers to uni students, scientists and university professors, and the unforgettable 92-year-old second world war veteran, Bill Ryan. There I met Rick. A farmer, father and volunteer firefighter who had never taken part in any climate action before.  Rick is a fifth-generation farmer; Leard state forest, 8,000 hectares of box gum woodland between Narrabri and Boggabri in the north-west of New South Wales, was named after his forebears. The coalmine we were trying to stop is just a few kilometres from his property and 4km from his kids’ school. Rick grew up on and around the rugby field, so he swung past the blockade camp in the morning to satisfy his curiosity about me being there. We chatted about farming, life in the country, his family and their ties to the area. Then we talked about the mine. He explained how he thought it was going to affect his farm, his community and his kids’ lives. He came back later in the day and we talked over lunch. I could sense we were both grappling with how to respond to these challenges. How do you make decisions? What are you willing to do in the face of injustice? The next day we locked on together. I was back up there last month catching up with Rick and his family. A huge swathe of the forest is no longer there. Gomeroi people have lost sacred sites, places they’ve known for tens-of-thousands of years. While grabbing a coffee on our way through town we bumped into some young farmers heading to yet another somber farewell to a family farm being sold to the mine. The mine has been worse than Rick ever imagined. “Far worse,” he tells me. Farming in Australia is tough at the best of times, but try farming next to a coalmine. Whitehaven was fined for not complying with its own biodiversity management plan and fined for excessive dust pollution. The Natural Resources Access Regulator has also accused Whitehaven of taking water without an access licence and commenced prosecution in the land and environment court (in response, Whitehaven has cited the “complexity” of the state’s water management system and said some of the alleged non-compliances are “widely observed” in the sector). The  company also outbid farmers for water licences during the drought, paying up to three times what farmers usually pay. And that’s just at Whitehaven’s Maules Creek mine – it’s an embarrassingly long list when you include its other mines. Just this week the NSW resources regulator charged the company with 16 counts of breaching NSW mining laws. Six years ago, after being processed at the police station after our day on the super digger, the constable looked at me sternly and said: “You don’t want to continue down this road. The ramifications are simply not worth it.” I understood his warning but at the time couldn’t help but think that his words were a perfect summary of the situation facing us all. The ramifications of continuing with fossil fuels were simply not worth it, the scientists had been telling us for years, since before I was born. Unfortunately, we have continued down that road. Our government sabotaged efforts for more ambitious international action in the Paris agreement and now point their fingers at the lack of international action as justification to continue approving fossil fuel projects. As well as subsidising fossil fuel companies to the tune of $12bn a year. The big four banks agreed to work to limit warming to 1.5C but have since funded $35.5bn of coal, oil and gas projects. And we’re letting down even more farmers like Rick with the recent approval of an expansion of another Whitehaven Coal project near Maules Creek. Local farmers have opposed it, the council opposed it, yet it was found to be in the “public interest”. After this last summer there is no doubt that climate breakdown is becoming personal for so many of us – people died, houses, forests and billions of animals were burnt. Things are changing. We’re eco-anxious. We know we have to act. Where scientists were calculated and understated, climate strikers are now angry and loud. Terrified they may not have a future. We are living in a time of climate breakdown, a time sorely lacking in courageous, moral leadership. Yet Covid-19 has shown us we can act in the face of overwhelming circumstances. We can mobilise and meet the challenge. We can rely on the brilliant minds of scientists and other Australians working on these problems to guide our actions. So what are we to do? Albert Einstein once said: “In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.” We’re certainly facing some difficulty. We have the opportunity of a generation to spend a stimulus package on starting to build a new economy. The opportunity to create a hundreds of thousands of new jobs. We can take our place in history as the ones who finally turned things around, who courageously took on the challenge of a just transition. A transition from an economy that has made us wealthy, to one that will allow us to continue to thrive into the future. We have the opportunity to build the future we want. This will require us making different decisions, choosing courage in the face of fear and learning to act truly in the public interest. This may be too much to ask for politicians wedded to fossil fuel interests, too much for a government that has sabotaged efforts to reduce emissions to ensure a liveable future, too much to ask for a prime minister who brought coal into parliament not long before his country would burn. It is maybe too much to expect politicians to stop putting short-term profits in front of economic growth, environmental health and our shared future. During a time of lockdown, it can feel impossible to know what to do, how to change things. But one of the things we can do while stuck inside our homes is move our money away from the institutions that continue to fund projects that put us all at risk. We can move our super out of funds that continue to invest in fossil fuels, and out of the big four banks; banking with institutions that aren’t loaning money to fossil fuel projects. This may seem trivial but it’s not. Moving money away from businesses and institutions that don’t align with our values or the kinds of future we want to create has a rich history. It’s known as divestment and it was a key tool in the fight for civil rights. Here in Australia, it’s clear who is funding fossil fuels and while voting and protesting are a long way off, we can put our money where our mouth, or heart, is on this issue, push to end the fossil fuel era and start building something much better. • David Pocock is a professional rugby union player and co-author of the book In Our Nature with his wife, Emma Pocock"
"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."

Spoils system reinstated by choice of grant subject.
In memoriam–our civil service as it was, a political cartoon by Thomas Nast showing statue of Andrew Jackson on a pig, which is over “fraud”, “bribery”, and “spoils”, eating “plunder”. Featured in Harper’s Weekly on 28 April 1877, p. 325. Source: Library of Congress
Clifford Eddy, PhD writes:
After James Garfield’s assassination, the spoils system of granting government jobs was replaced by the civil service system, with merit being the criterion for hiring rather than political loyalty to those in high political office.
[via Wikipedia]
In the politics of the United States, a spoils system (also known as a patronage system) is a practice in which a political party, after winning an election, gives government jobs to its supporters, friends and relatives as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party—as opposed to a merit system, where offices are awarded on the basis of some measure of merit, independent of political activity.
The term was derived from the phrase “to the victor belong the spoils” by New York Senator William L. Marcy, referring to the victory of the Jackson Democrats in the election of 1828, with the term spoils meaning goods or benefits taken from the loser in a competition, election or military victory.
…
After the assassination of James A. Garfield by a rejected office-seeker in 1881, the calls for civil service reform intensified. Moderation of the spoils system at the federal level came with the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883, which created a bipartisan Civil Service Commission to evaluate job candidates on a nonpartisan merit basis. While few jobs were covered under the law initially, the law allowed the President to transfer jobs and their current holders into the system, thus giving the holder a permanent job. The Pendleton Act’s reach was expanded as the two main political parties alternated control of the White House every election between 1884 and 1896. After each election the outgoing President applied the Pendleton Act to jobs held by his political supporters. By 1900, most federal jobs were handled through civil service and the spoils system was limited only to very senior positions.
The separation between the political activity and the civil service was made stronger with the Hatch Act of 1939 which prohibited federal employees from engaging in many political activities.
The spoils system survived much longer in many states, counties and municipalities, such as the Tammany Hall ring, which survived well into the 1930s when New York City reformed its own civil service. Illinois modernized its bureaucracy in 1917 under Frank Lowden, but Chicago held on to patronage in city government until the city agreed to end the practice in the Shakman Decrees of 1972 and 1983. Modern variations on the spoils system are often described as the political machine.
In today’s climate science, merit criteria have been replaced  by a spoils system of giving grants to those loyal to the political doctrine of Climate Change caused by anthropogenic carbon dioxide.
The US government claim is that $36B has been spent on climate research.  The terms of the resulting grants assured that their recipients would support the entirely political doctrine of  anthropogenic origins of climate change.
This has particularly evil implications such as “scientific truth can be sold to the highest bidder.”

"Heating of the world’s oceans could radically reorganise marine food webs across the globe causing the numbers of some species to collapse while promoting the growth of algae, new research has warned. Healthy marine food webs that look like a pyramid, with smaller numbers of larger predatory species at the top and more abundant smaller organisms at the bottom, could become “bottom heavy”.  The types of species that could become less abundant in the oceans are the same ones targeted by commercial fishing and also are socially and culturally important to many communities around the globe. In the research, published in the journal Science, researchers at the University of Adelaide recreated a marine habitat in a series of 1,800-litre tanks and then subjected some to temperature and CO2 changes. Prof Ivan Nagelkerken, of the University of Adelaide’s Environment Institute and who led the research, said gazing into the tanks after six months when the study period ended had not been a pretty sight. “It looked bad,” he said. After being subjected to higher temperatures and higher CO2 the rocks, he said, were overgrown with turf algae and the sandy bottom had a lot more slimy algae that is toxic to some species. The tanks recreated a habitat off the coast of Adelaide in Gulf St Vincent that was about six metres deep. Many of the species placed into the tanks – including kelp, crustaceans and the multitude of different bacteria on rocks, sand and in sediment – were gathered from the gulf. Native fish and crabs were also added. Some 12 tanks of ocean water – known as mesocosms – were split into four groups. Temperature and CO2 levels were not adjusted in one group. In another three tanks, the water temperature was raised over the course of six weeks until they were 2.8C higher than today. Another group of tanks had their CO2 levels adjusted to the equivalent of 910 parts per million in the atmosphere, causing the water to become less alkaline. The habitat in the fourth group of tanks was treated to both higher temperatures and higher levels of CO2. Both the CO2 conditions and the temperatures reflect conditions expected towards the end of this century in a world where little is done to curb fossil fuel burning. Nagelkerken said the results of the experiment remained relevant even if the world did act to slow down the rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. In 2011 a marine heatwave in Western Australia raised ocean temperatures more than 2C for about 10 weeks. A study five years later found no recovery of the kelp – a vital component shaping the marine ecosystem there. Nagelkerken said: “That marine heatwave showed that even over just a few weeks, that caused the kelp to disappear.” He said the research showed that ocean heating “reshuffles species communities” with weedy plants and algae thriving but the “abundance of other species, especially invertebrates, collapses”. He said the changed pyramid that was fatter at the bottom and thinner in the middle, could eventually see larger predators also losing out. In the study, the researchers write: “The top of food webs may eventually become depleted under future climate conditions or additional human disturbances.” The small fish that were the predators in the tank resisted the impacts of warming, but the experiment showed the food they ate was becoming impoverished – an imbalance that could see the top predators struggling. An ecological tipping point could be reached where the “the top of the food web can no longer be supported,” the study says. Nagelkerken told the Guardian that in the real world, the impacts would vary depending on whether species could move to different areas. Some species would not be able to. He said there was already evidence species were extending their ranges away from the equator as oceans got warmer and this, together with changes to the food webs, could also see traditional fishing grounds move, creating knock-on effects for communities that had been built around fishing. He added: “It’s not just climate change, but also our removal of predatory fish [through overfishing] and the addition of nutrients into the ocean. We have to consider all of that too.” Dr Kirsty Nash, of the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at the University of Tasmania, who was not involved in the research, said studying the resilience of marine systems was challenging, and the researchers had struck a balance between what was practically possible while giving an insight into real-world impacts. She said: “Developing this type of understanding is really important if we want to then address questions around the broader consequences of climate change for society, for example, are fisheries likely to suffer as a result of climate change.” The experimental findings in the tanks, she said, were likely only showing an “intermediate state” that was a prelude to the development of “radically different” food webs. She said many places in the world had fish that societies consumed but that the study suggested would be impacted. “These local fish are popular eating fish, so this would have implications for what’s available, but it does depend on the area and how culturally and socially acceptable that would be.” Dr Sophie Dove, an associate professor at the University of Queensland, who has run large long-term mesocosm experiments, said the study adds to mounting evidence that under the current trajectory of CO2 emissions “services will be lost from our most valued ecosystems”. She said she would have preferred that the experimental conditions had more closely mirrored the daily and seasonal changes in light, temperature and CO2. But she said the experiment demonstrated that organisms at the bottom of the food chain – such as “relatively inedible slimy alga” like cyanobacteria – did well under the changing conditions, but small plants that helped give rocky reefs their structure “do very badly under warming and acidification”."

We are now two- thirds of the way through the term of this Government led by the Labour Party on a slogan of **“Let’s Do This.”** So what have they done? In truth, not a lot and much of what they have done has turned out to be counterproductive. The question of why is answered by a group photo of the Labour MPs posted on Backchat on Sunday night. There looked to be no more competence amongst them than you would have found at the chimpanzees’ tea party at the Auckland Zoo in the 1950s.



The big failure of this Government has been to form hundreds of working groups of so-called experts to provide advice on legislation to be passed. What they should have been doing is consulting with the real experts, those working in the area affected by the legislation and who would, therefore, be personally affected by it. But that is not how the left of politics work. Today, the left increasingly operate somewhere between Socialism and Marxism. The hard left in America and Britain are of the Marxist philosophy which is where Ardern would like to take this country. So her **“Let’s Do This”** is more of a let’s do this but as we tell you.



Hence the working groups with people selected the majority of whom will support the groups’ recommendations which will be along the lines of what the Government wants to be written into the legislation. This is nothing short of a farce and a complete waste of time and money, [Michael Cullen and his tax working group](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/04/cullen-is-not-finished-yet/) being a prime example. The CGT was never a good idea in terms of electoral acceptance and any competent Government could have worked that out for themselves. These working groups are just a sham to have the peasants, that’s you and I, believe that there is some form of democracy in action. LOL!



The [gun buyback program](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/firearms-buyback-now-an-omnishambles/) is another good example. A knee jerk reaction which I suspect, more than anything, was a not too subtle attempt by the PM to get her name in lights on the world stage yet again. I’m sure that outfit I call the Useless Nations in New York would have been impressed. Instead of talking with law-abiding gun owners, let’s tell them instead that they can’t have their guns. Never mind our friends in the gangs, they can keep theirs. As it turns out, the whole nonsense has had it’s obvious and desired outcome – most gun owners have taken their lead from gang HQ and kept theirs too.



Climate Change is another that comes to mind. Would it have been a good idea to consult with the agricultural sector on these matters? Apparently not. Let’s do this as a Minister by carrying out the boring task of attending farmers meetings to tell them to like it or lump it in regard to regulations, thereby again feigning democracy, or do it the other way. That is, if the farmers have the audacity to front up at Parliament, barely give them the time of day and label them rednecks! Any competent Government would know this is not how you win friends. But not the left. Farmers are rich pricks and will be dealt with accordingly.



Housing and [Kiwibuild.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/bfd-transcript-judith-collins-gives-corin-dann-a-lesson-in-manners-kiwifail-affordable-housing-more/) Was there any consultation with the building and construction industry in terms of how viable was the pie in the sky idea of building 100,000 houses in terms of land and personnel availability? No, just **“Let’s Do This.”** And then when it’s found out to be a lame duck, let’s [scrap the targets](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/the-bfd-transcript-part-2-delayed-sex-assault-allegation-report-kiwibuild-reset-justin-lester-slight-more/). How easy is that? Were landlords, also supposedly rich pricks, consulted re the effects of new regulations to be implemented and what negative effects they might have on the rental market? No, just **“Let’s Do This”** and then wonder why the rental market has collapsed and, as a result, rents have skyrocketed.



Transport is another. **“Let’s Do This”** in this area means, in Auckland, dozens of suburban buses running around with few passengers and in Wellington an unworkable bus timetable. What this Government, particularly the loopy Greens, would like it to mean is – on yer bike – regardless of whether you’re doing the school run or the supermarket shopping. They would like us to start using all the cycleways that hardly anyone uses that the government have wasted money on. Meanwhile, the number of vehicles goes up on roads that are under increasing strain, thereby increasing congestion and doing goodness knows what to the carbon emissions. Any competent Government would know you have to invest in new roads.



How about Education. Here the Unions say **“Let’s Do This”** and we do it. They say no to Charter Schools so they [scrap them](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/politics-in-full-sentences-free-speech-partnership-schools-euthanasia/), well not entirely, they bring them under their control, thereby once again feigning democracy. One good thing the Minister has done, no doubt at the Union’s request, is to scrap the meaningless decile system. No competent Government would allow itself to be dictated to in this manner. Union money talks!



Energy is a pearler. **“Let’s Do This”** became **“lm Doing This”** , the infamous [Captain’s Call](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/12/drilling-but-by-gum-support-is-toothless/) to bastardise the oil and gas industry. I wonder if the Captain might see any linkage between that, looking to the future, and the fact that in the last year **we have imported the most amount of coal since 2006.** I very much doubt it. We have plenty of our own but can’t mine it because the green luvvies are petrified we might kill a snail. No competent Government would have a bar of this type of bollocks.



The list goes on but the recurring theme is that you will do as we say which is the mantra of the left. The elections in Britain and America proved that those workers, particularly in the industries, who are reliant on keeping their jobs will vote for the party most likely to provide that security. Left or right is becoming increasingly irrelevant. This is something the likes of Jeremy Corbyn, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and the rest of the hard left, including the Captain here, need to realise. Their idea of utopia where everyone is the same has never worked and won’t work now or in the future.

"It’s often been said that we’re living through an unprecedented moment. But in city centres, the coronavirus crisis has merely accelerated trends that have been unfolding for some time. In Leeds, where I live, many major banks and building societies, cinemas, shops and department stores declined or disappeared as society shifted online. The pandemic has caused the job market to contract, and many more people are now working from home. But in cities across the country, traditional office spaces have long been shrinking, as technology reduces the need for face-to-face contact and a growing number of self-employed people opt for co-working spaces. Indeed, the idea of a dedicated office building is only 200 years old; before offices, many people lived above their workplaces. Despite the economic boom that some UK cities have experienced in the last 20 years, the centre of Leeds, like many other city centres, has not yet recovered from industrial decline. Vacated banking halls have supplied glamorous homes for bars and restaurants in regeneration areas, and housing has returned to the centre, albeit in the limited form of small apartments and poorly designed student accommodation. But the continuing trend of “meanwhile use” and sprawling ground-level car parks across the city are evidence that supply still exceeds demand.  Coronavirus has accelerated these processes, but they aren’t new. Neither is Leeds a novice in dealing with pandemics; the Spanish flu of 1918, which infected one in three people in the city, overwhelmed its hospitals, closed its schools and created shortages of grave diggers. What’s new about Covid-19 is that it coincides with another existential crisis – the climate emergency – and that we’ve made extraordinary technological advances since 1918. City centres will struggle in the short term with the effects of the pandemic, and a great number of service workers will be unemployed. This is a tragedy, but it’s also an incentive to plan for medium- and long-term solutions. In the past, disasters have been the bedrock of social progress, not least in the creation of the National Health Service in 1948. And what’s good for dealing with the impacts of Covid-19 is also good for addressing the impacts of climate change. Work on climate mitigation and adaptation has already paved the way for how our city centres should change, and has supplied the technologies to make this possible. In Leeds, Covid-19 should be an opportunity to accelerate what has already been planned to address the climate emergency, such as installing a cycling network in the city centre that connects to surrounding neighbourhoods, and engaging the community in planting 1m trees. This green infrastructure is crucial for biodiversity, carbon capture, water management, temperature cooling and wellbeing. It’s the first step towards remodelling our urban environments as “15 minute cities”, a concept first promoted in Paris, which aims to provide all necessary services required for the health and wellbeing of its residents within 15 minutes’ walking distance. In the past, green infrastructure has also been a response to public health concerns: Central Park in New York was developed following a prolonged outbreak of cholera, and Victoria Park in east London, the city’s first purpose-built park, was opened as a response to insanitary conditions, overcrowding and pollution in the city’s East End. But we need to go further. We should be using public investment to build networks of new parks with playgrounds and sport and leisure facilities on underdeveloped sites in city centres. Providing this green infrastructure in our city centres would attract families to live there, and compel businesses to follow. Of course, there will be a time lag between the immediate effects of coronavirus and delivering on these ambitious plans. But I’m optimistic that in this period we’ll see a burst of creativity, of the sort that often emerges from the collapse of outmoded systems. Empty and cheap space may attract new users and institutions, as it did most notably in Detroit after the demise of its car industry. In UK cities, unused office spaces could be converted into modern family homes; in Leeds, Park Square, a handsome Georgian area that was repurposed into offices could be returned to its original residential use. Defunct shopping centres could become sites for new nurseries and community centres. Our coronavirus retrofit should be the work of many hands, a sensitive process of rebuilding cities so they’re durable, equitable and sociable places to live and work, capable of dealing with the twin emergencies of the pandemic and climate crisis. • Irena Bauman is a director at Bauman Lyons Architects, Leeds "

There have been several reports of temperature data fudging by the authorities, the most recent by Paul Homewood on several stations in Paraguay.
While exploring long temperature records in Australia, I discovered a particularly egregious example of temperature changing at Adelaide Airport. GISS now offers easy access to their several sets of data for each station: unadjusted (I assume this is the raw data.), adjusted (I assume this is after TOBs, time of observation, and moving adjustments), adjusted after cleaning (whatever that is), and the final step, after adjustments, cleaning, and homogenization.
Infusion of more error?
Homogenization is supposed to correct for urban heat island problems, but it is nearly always used to cool the past, rather than cooling the present or heating the past, the opposite of what an urban heat island correction should be. But I digress.
Here is the Adelaide Airport record before any adjustments:

Figure 1: Adelaide Airport unadjusted temperature record. The top trace is the annual average summer (December, January, and February) temperatures, the middle is the annual average meteorological year, and the bottom is the average winter (June, July, and August) temperatures, all with trend lines. On all these images, click on the image for a high resolution version.
Note in Figure 1 that all the trends are negative, that is, it has been cooling since the turn of the twentieth century, for over the last 100 years, particularly in the summer months. The warmest year was 1914. The warmest summer was in 1880!
Now let us look at the “adjusted” data:

Figure 2: Adelaide Airport after “adjustment”, also with trend lines.
Note that in Figure 2 we see warming, annually, and in all seasons. The warmest year is now 2007, though the warmest summer is still 1880 by a small fraction of degree. But the strange thing about this adjustment is this:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Figure 3: Adjustment applied to Figure 1 to produce Figure 2.
Note that from 1880 to 1947, the adjustment is exactly minus one degree, in all months, all seasons, and all years. It is a blanket, obvious, fudge! Someone got lazy. Instead of attempting to figure out an actual time of observation or move adjustment, they simply slapped on a minus one degree change, and magically, the cooling trend went away. But they were not finished! There is still homogenization to be performed, the finishing touch!

Figure 4: Adelaide Airport after all adjustments and homogenization.
Homogenization now adds another tenth of a degree to the warming temperature trends. How much was the change?

Figure 5: Homogenization adjustment applied to Figure 2 to result in Figure 4.
These changes further cool the past and mostly leave the present unchanged. The changes are the same for all months, season, and years for twenty or more year stretches.
I found the Australian BOM description for their adjustments for Adelaide. They do not resemble the adjustments seen above. They are changes to Tmax and Tmin, are in both positive and negative directions. Changes to Tmax + Tmin sometimes nearly cancel out. (If Tmax is adjusted up and Tmin is adjusted down by the same amount, Tmean will not change.) And the steps are in different years from that above.

Figure 6: Screen grab from an Australian BOM pdf document found here. Click on the image for a clearer version.
Hiding the cooling
It should be obvious to all that these adjustments to the raw temperature data are an attempt to hide the long-term cooling temperature trend at Adelaide. These changes to the temperature data begs us to examine all station data for similar changes. Is global warming real or just a  product of pencil, pen, and computer?

The biggest problem with [NZ First having scuppered ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/04/the-backdown-on-a-cgt-is-bad-for-national/)Jacinda’s proposed Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is that the subject will never go away. Even if Jacinda adheres to her promise to never introduce it, the next Labour leader will bring the subject up again. It doesn’t matter what the proletariat thinks; as we all know, from the 2016 US election and the 2019 UK election, voters are “deplorables” and have no idea what they are voting for. The next Labour leader, whoever that is, will bring it back into play, the Greens will start to jump up and down with excitement and the whole darned debate will start up again. You can be sure of it.



And as sure as night follows day, on the second day of 2020, the subject of tax reform has been raised again by our beloved messiah, [Shamubeel Eaqub.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/delusional-drongo-doubles-down/) It has the same feel about it as Brexit had: the people don’t want it, but they are stupid. Let’s keep pushing for it and eventually, everyone will come around to our way of thinking. Shamubeel might want to have a little chat with Jeremy Corbyn about that attitude.



Our tax system has worked pretty well so far. But the pressures will grow over coming decades. The two most immediate threats, from my view, are demographics and decarbonisation. 



A big chunk of taxes comes from a cut of wages. But as the population ages, the tax burden will grow for a shrinking base of taxpayers. 



Popular myth No 1, constantly bandied about by Shamubeel and his ilk is that we have an ageing population. In fact, as I have pointed out before, the median age in New Zealand is currently 37.3 years. Most of those 37 year-olds either already have children, or they will, at some time in the future. Until a person can be born at the age of 65, we do not have a serious problem with an ageing population.



One glaring discrepancy was on how we tax savings, where land was lowly taxed compared to all other forms. This leads to the natural conclusion that we should explore some kind of land tax that is broad based but low.



Because land cannot run away, it is a relatively easy thing to tax.



(The old mantra is that socialists will tax anything that moves. Clearly they will tax absolutely everything.)



I assume he is talking about taxing land that is held, rather than land being sold. Land sales are, in fact, taxed in many cases – on those in the business of property development, and under the Bright Line Test. No. We are talking about some kind of annual levy on landowners, which is exactly the sort of tax that Michael Cullen so desperately wanted to impose on all those ‘rich pricks’.



But, those who have ever studied Taxation 101 know that the first underlying principle of taxation is that it must be fair. There is nothing fair about imposing a tax on an asset that produces no income, and therefore no way to pay the tax. If land produces income, as in farming, then that income is taxed elsewhere. This proposal is like taxing a courier driver for his courier income and then imposing a special tax on his van. It is stupid, inequitable, and would cause financial hardship in many cases, where there is no income to pay the tax from. 



Another problem with this idea, of course, is that all the expensive land is in the cities, usually under houses, but the family home will have to be exempted from this tax. So the poor unfortunate guy living on his lifestyle block in Murchison will be paying land tax every year, whereas homeowners in Herne Bay, with sections worth a million dollars, get off scot-free. It was partly this kind of inequality that scuppered the CGT last year, but at least CGT would only have been applied on the sale of a property. Eaqub’s latest idea will result in a financial burden year after year.



The idea of a land tax goes back to the days when only the extremely wealthy owned land. They employed serfs to do the work and made bucketfuls of cash. These days, there are few barons left. Most farmers work extremely hard and have large loans, owners of lifestyle blocks often plant lots of trees and while their wealth may be in the land, it is unrealised wealth. If we could all dig down into a rabbit hole and find wads of cash, the idea of a land tax would be fair enough. Unfortunately, that is not yet possible. 



Eaqub studiously ignores the fact that the current tax system is, in fact, mostly fair. Income taxes are graduated, and thanks to Working for Families, many people on low incomes actually pay no income tax at all. I simply do not understand why there is this constant call for more fairness in the tax system when it features policies like that. **How can paying no income tax be ‘unfair’ to low-income families?**



No. This is just yet another attack on the perceived ‘rich’ and yet another attack on farmers. No doubt there is a climate motive in Eaqub’s thinking too, but therein lies one fatal flaw. A land tax will not just affect those evil dairy farmers who provide us with one of the staples of life. It will also affect orchardists, crop growers and foresters. Yes, even kale growers will have to pay land tax. Watch out for an increase in the price of mung beans. Watch out also for a dramatic drop in the number of trees being planted, as landowners look to sell up to avoid the tax.



 **And who will they sell to? They will sell to foreigners.** Yes, that’s right. Eaqub has globalism in his sights too. 



Landlords will no doubt be affected, which is all part of the plan. Eaqub hates landlords with a passion. If such a tax were introduced, it is likely that only the land under a family home would be exempted, which means this would be **another cost on rental properties.** Eaqub believes that, as time goes on, more and more people will be forced to rent, but he never explains how landlord bashing policies are going to make this situation any better. Already, we have landlords leaving the rental markets in droves, selling up and taking their untaxed capital gains with them, and a land tax might well be the final straw for those few landlords game enough to stay on. 



You must remember that Shamubeel Equab is the economic writer who told everyone to rent rather than buy a house… and then went out and bought a house for himself and his family because they ‘needed the security’ that owning a house brings. In other words, it is OK for other people to be turfed out of their rentals on an all too frequent basis, but that is not good enough for the Eaqub family. With that level of barefaced hypocrisy, I am amazed that he has the nerve to voice his opinion anywhere again, but it is, as we all know, OK if members of the elite do it.



All in all, this is a bad idea. This prevailing idea that we should tax the ‘rich’ into oblivion fails to see the bigger picture: it is landowners, mostly in the form of farmers, that are the backbone of our economy, and hitting them over and over again with levies and taxes when their income is at best unpredictable is a great way to destroy our economic powerhouse. 



Taxation is never an incentive, in any shape or form. The success of this country has been built on the back of hard work and enterprise. Now people like Eaqub want to destroy that, all in the name of equality. One has to wonder, however, exactly who is really in need of equal treatment these days – the low-income family paying no income tax? Of course not. Eaqub, like Michael Cullen, can never resist an opportunity to stick it to those ‘rich pricks’. Nothing has changed in 2020.

**Public health officials should**



twitter #CatoCOVID



In medical and environmental policy, scientists play prominent roles in decisions. Agencies such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency have scientific advisory councils that review the relevant scientific literature and advise policy decisionmakers about pollution exposure standards and pharmaceutical and medical device safety. When the decisions of governmental officials do not follow scientific recommendations, critical news coverage follows. The implication is that “science” is sufficient for policy decisions and that “politics” should not play a role.



The discussion about science and politics is occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent _New Yorker_ article lauded Iceland’s response to the pandemic because the prime minister deferred to scientists in her decisions: “It was very clear from the beginning that this was something that should be led by experts—by scientific and medical experts.” In the United States, 57 former scientists and public health officials issued a statement calling for a science‐​based approach to the pandemic. The signatories said, “Sidelining science has already cost lives, imperiled the safety of our loved ones, compromised our ability to safely reopen our businesses, schools, and places of worship, and endangered the health of our democracy itself.”



But scientific findings, by themselves, are rarely sufficient for individual or policy decisions. Such findings can tell us about the causes of outcomes _but nothing more_. The question of how we should evaluate those outcomes in our own decisionmaking requires other considerations, such as costs, benefits, and philosophical or religious values. And the relative importance of those considerations will vary across individuals. Finally, aggregating those individual differences into collective policy decisions involves even further nonscientific choices about the relative importance of different individual preferences about outcomes. So even under the best circumstances, policy decisions involve more than science, and in the case of COVID-19, our scientific knowledge is very limited.



What is science? Science is an ongoing discussion about the testing of hypotheses of cause and effect through experiments and comparison with the possibility that random variation produced the same outcome.



Researchers can be either too cautious or too cavalier about concluding that the results of inquiry reflect real cause and effect rather than random variation. Confidence that results reflect real cause and effect increases with replication by other experimenters and the magnitude of the result relative to the number of data points under study.



How cavalier or cautious should scientists be about their results? Ironically and importantly there is no scientific answer to this question. Instead there are only adopted conventions. Scientists are usually reluctant to say a result is “real” rather than the result of normal variation around zero effect unless they are 95 percent confident that the result did not arise simply because random variation happened to produce an outcome that appears to be a “real effect.” But even if a scientist is 95 percent confident, 5 percent of the time the observed result arises simply through sampling variation rather than a “real” effect. And 95 percent confidence is a convention.



How confident one should be in hypothesis testing is a value choice and not scientifically determined. Experimental physicists, for example, take the concern for avoiding “false positive” results to the extreme. They use what is referred to as the five‐​sigma rule, which allows a result to be considered “real” only if the probability of a false positive result is less than 1-in-3.5 million, which translates to 99.99997 percent confident. If medical science adhered to such a rule, there would be no accepted results.



Regardless of the false‐​positive acceptance rate a researcher chooses, the number of observations dictates our ability to differentiate a small result from no result. In the context of any medical treatment, including vaccines or antiviral medication for COVID-19, our ability to declare the treatment “safe” after clinical trial results depends on the number of subjects in the trial (as well as representativeness of the participants). Side effects that affect only small percentages of the population will manifest themselves with 95 percent confidence only after the medication is widely used because clinical trials have thousands rather than millions of participants.



Table 1 shows how much larger (in percentage) that the harmful effect of a medication or vaccine would have to be in the experimental group relative to the control group to allow us to state with 95 percent confidence that the negative effect is the result of the medication rather than random variation. If scientists or policymakers wanted to ensure that the negative side effects of a vaccine affected only 0.1 percent of those who received it, the trial would require 2.9 million people. While 0.1 percent might seem small, 0.1 percent of the U.S. population is 330,000 people. Thus, a vaccine trial with almost 3 million people that passed a clinical trial test with 95 percent confidence would not preclude the possibility that universal administration of the vaccine would have negative side effects on 330,000 people. Whether that is acceptable is not a scientific question.



Scientists occasionally interject values into their recommendations—not in the pervasive, subtle, and unavoidable manner previously described but in obviously avoidable ways that undermine their role as neutral providers of information. A prominent example occurred when 1,300 public health officials signed a May 30, 2020, letter of support for the public protests in the wake of the May 25 death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. But the same officials had earlier condemned public protests against mandatory business closures.



Why the difference? A _New York Times_ article asked, “Was public health advice in a pandemic dependent on whether people approved of the mass gathering in question?” According to the article, “To many, the answer seemed to be ‘yes.’” Mark Lurie, a professor of epidemiology at Brown University said, “Instinctively, many of us in public health feel a strong desire to act against accumulated generations of racial injustice. But we have to be honest: A few weeks before, we were criticizing protesters for arguing to open up the economy and saying that was dangerous behavior. I am still grappling with that.”



To his credit, Lurie recognized the failure to separate his role as a scientist from his role as a citizen with views about public policy after he took his daughter to a protest early in June. “We felt afterward that the risk we incurred probably exceeded the entire risk in the previous two months,” he said. “We undid some very hard work, and I don’t see how actions like that can help in battling this epidemic, honestly.”



Luckily, it appears little damage was done by this crossing of the boundaries between science and politics. A recent paper using cellphone tracking data shows that cities with protests saw increased social distancing compared to cities that did not have protests—presumably because nonprotestors changed their behavior. And net COVID-19 case growth did not differentially increase in those cities that experienced protests.



Though by itself “science” cannot dictate our personal or policy choices, in some cases the information it provides can make those choices rather clear with few additional considerations. If the benefits or harms of a medical decision (such as taking a medicine or vaccine) are large and discontinuous (an abrupt change in outcome with respect to exposure or dose), even with the confidence‐​interval and sample‐​size qualifications previously described, then “science” leads fairly easily to decisions. If the harm from a medication or vaccine increases abruptly with the dose and the benefits do not decrease abruptly below that dose, then the appropriate dose is below the threshold at which side effects appear.



In the COVID-19 pandemic, the wearing of masks seemed initially to fall into the category of decisions that follow simply and directly from the science. The problem is that new evidence led scientists to change their understanding of viral transmission. At the start of 2020, scientists thought that coronavirus transmission occurred only from people exhibiting symptoms, such as its genetic cousin Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) does. Thus, general mask wearing was a waste of resources and reduced those supplies available to those dealing with active infections. Hence, the early universal public health advice was not to wear masks.



But evidence accumulated that asymptomatic COVID-19 transmission was real and large; 35–60 percent of infections cause no symptoms. Thus, the advice to stay home if you’re sick may have been insufficient. More aggressive measures, such as ordering healthy people to wear masks, may have been necessary.



The transition from masks are not required and not helpful to masks are required and you are irresponsible if you do not wear one was not easy even for scientists. European public health scientists resisted the claims of asymptomatic transmission. As the _New York Times_ reported:



Sweden’s public health agency declared that [the original journal article reporting asymptomatic transmission] had contained major errors. The agency’s website said, unequivocally, that “there is no evidence that people are infectious during the incubation period”—an assertion that would remain online in some form for months. French health officials, too, left no room for debate: “A person is contagious only when symptoms appear,” a government flyer read. “No symptoms = no risk of being contagious.”



Science is always a conversation about current knowledge and new results.



Science is always a conversation about current knowledge and new results. And science is by its nature conservative in that it worries greatly about accepting new or unusual results because they may be the result of random error or mistakes. But sometimes that conservatism is wrong. And that appears to have been the case with asymptomatic coronavirus transmission and the utility of generalized mask wearing. Researchers have not conducted trials, but when people wore masks in a seafood plant and on a cruise ship, the proportion of severe cases decreased dramatically, reducing hospitalizations and deaths.



All nonscientists have noticed, however, that the surgeon general of the United States has dramatically reversed course. In late February he tweeted, “Seriously people‐ STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!” By early July he told NBC’s Today, “As we talk about Fourth of July and independence, it’s important to understand that if we all wear these, we will actually have more independence and more freedom because more places will be able to stay open. We’ll have less spread of the disease.”



This reversal, along with the contradictory advice of epidemiologists toward demonstrations, has left many people skeptical of experts and expertise.



Absent an abrupt change in benefits or harms, recommended behaviors do not depend on the science alone; other considerations and their importance are relevant, including economic costs and benefits as well as religious or philosophical values. Policy disagreements are largely about the differing weight that people assign to these other considerations. Science does not tell us how to weigh incrementally increased risk of COVID-19 transmission against other values, such as freedom to operate a business or pursue one’s livelihood. This statement doesn’t refer only to the daily fight between supporters and opponents of President Trump regarding the value of returning to a “normal” economy. John Jenkins, president of the University of Notre Dame, made an argument about the role of values in the context of deciding to reopen the university during the COVID-19 pandemic.



If we gave the first principle [to protect the health of our students, faculty, staff and their loved ones] absolute priority, our decision about reopening would be easy. We would keep everyone away until an effective vaccine was universally available.



However, were we to take that course, we would risk failing to provide the next generation of leaders the education they need and to do the research and scholarship so valuable to our society. How ought these competing risks be weighed? No science, simply as science, can answer that question. It is a moral question in which principles to which we are committed are in tension.



Even under the best of circumstances, “science” can lead easily to policy choices only if the relevant research results are large and discontinuous and if there are no other competing considerations. In all other circumstances, decisions follow from “science” only with the addition of values that allow us to assess the relative importance of outcomes. And because individuals weigh these other considerations differently, collective choices involve conflict about how to aggregate individual differences in the evaluation of those outcomes.



The use of “science” as a guide to COVID-19 policy is even more complicated because our scientific knowledge about infectious respiratory diseases is limited. The data analytic site _FiveThirtyEight_ put it more bluntly: “Why It’s So Freaking Hard to Make a Good COVID-19 Model.” In the 1918 influenza outbreak, why did the spring wave go away, and why did it come back in the fall? Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, says, “We don’t know.” In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) feared that SARS would return in a devastating wave that fall, but instead it was extinguished. In 2009, experts worried that the H1N1 flu would be severe, but it was not. “You’ve got to have a lot of humility with these viruses,” Osterholm said. “I know less about viruses than I did 10 years ago.”



Dr. Peter Piot, the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is a legend in the battles against Ebola and AIDS. But he misjudged the coronavirus, “I underestimated this one—how fast it would spread. My mistake was to think it was like SARS, which was pretty limited in scope. Or that it was like influenza. But it’s neither.” If he didn’t know how to react to the coronavirus in real time, who would?



On February 20, when the WHO was reporting the existence of 79,748 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, Philip Tetlock’s superforecasters (people with alleged expertise) thought that the probability of more than 200,000 cases of COVID-19 being reported by the WHO only one month later on March 20 was about 3 percent. The actual number that the WHO reported on March 20 was over 266,000.



Not only is our scientific understanding of respiratory viruses limited, but the coronavirus has characteristics that make the use of scientific inferences about it as a guide to policy even more difficult. First, given the prevalence of asymptomatic transmission, stopping transmission by confining only those who are sick is not effective because so many people do not know they are infected. Second, the false negative rate for the polymerase chain reaction active virus tests is about 33 percent and maybe more among the asymptomatic. Thus, even among those who are tested, a third have the virus but are declared not to have it and can transmit it to others. Third, active virus tests also generate false positive results because of the presence of genetic fragments from the virus but no actual infection. Taia Wang, a viral immunologist at Stanford University, told the _New York Times_, “We really need to know, how long does it take the body to clear the virus? How long are people contagious? We don’t know the answer to that.” This happens with viruses. Genetic material from the measles virus can show up in tests six months after the illness. And genetic fragments of Ebola and Zika viruses are known to persist even longer in the body. The implication of these three characteristics of COVID-19 is that figuring out in real time which people to isolate from whom to stop viral transmission is very difficult.



Even if we could identify all infected individuals in real time and resources existed to follow them and their contacts (and U.S. attempts at contact tracing seem extremely ineffective), many contract tracing exercises would find no infections. During the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea in 2015, 89 percent of patients did not appear to transmit the disease. In the COVID-19 pandemic this year, a husband and wife in Illinois both became gravely ill and were hospitalized. Both recovered. State public health officials traced their contacts—372 people, including 195 health care workers. Not a single contact became infected. A new study suggests that the coronavirus arrived in places around the world more than once without starting runaway outbreaks. In these cases, there was little or no transmission, and the virus simply died out.



So the belief that expertise in infectious viruses provides obvious and clear answers for policy is misguided. And that is why we observe so much variation worldwide in the modeling recommendations of epidemiologists. Should decisionmakers rely on the model developed at the University of Pennsylvania or the model developed at the University of Washington? The former suggested that the District of Columbia would need 1,453 ventilators; the latter suggested it would need 107. Neither England nor Sweden initially implemented lockdown orders. But on March 16, 2020, Imperial College London published a model that predicted over 500,000 deaths in the United Kingdom, and it embraced a lockdown while Sweden did not. Japan limited testing to only the most severe cases even though it has the oldest population of any country in the world (unless you count Monaco), and the government never forced businesses to close. Yet Japan’s reported COVID-19 mortality rate is low. If science is the answer, which scientists do you listen to when they disagree?



Even though perfect science is rare, and even then it rarely translates directly into decisions, and even though infectious disease knowledge, in general, and coronavirus knowledge, in particular, is strikingly incomplete, why is science invoked so often as _the_ answer? In the language of economics, the invocation of science is the equilibrium outcome of the interaction of public officials, scientists, and the public.



Most people don’t understand science; most people don’t understand statistics; most people don’t understand what scientists do, how they argue, or what the scientific method is.



First, science serves the interests of public officials. Science legitimizes policy decisions and reduces discussion about them. Most people don’t understand science; most people don’t understand statistics; most people don’t understand what scientists do, how they argue, or what the scientific method is. In some ways, the “scientific community” is akin to a modern version of the priesthood. 



Scientists wear lab coats instead of vestments, but like clerics, they have the authority that comes with access to knowledge unavailable to laypersons. Insisting that we yield to their judgment can be very useful in policy debate because it elevates some policy preferences relative to others. Instead of having to say that you would like the policy outcome to reflect your preferences rather than someone else’s, you invoke science: “‘Science’ has concluded that my preferences are legitimate and that your preferences are out of bounds.” Robert Pindyck describes this in the context of climate science: “The use of a complex IAM [Integrated Assessment Model] or related model throws a curtain over our lack of knowledge, and creates a veneer of scientific legitimacy that suggests we know more than we do.” 



Second, for some scientists, expertise is power. For many, science is simply the investigation of how the world works and nothing else. Stanley W. Trimble, professor of geography emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles, said, “I learned early on to avoid academic bandwagons of any sort and that true scholarship can scarcely abide political causes.” For some, scientific expertise allows you to lead and others to follow analogous to the role that priests played for rulers in pre‐​modern civilizations. In the words of Roger Pielke, who studies the role of science in public policy, “For those with scientific expertise, it consequently makes perfect sense to wage political battles through science because it necessarily confers to scientists a privileged position in political debate.” 



Third, for the public, following expertise is a rational response to the complex division of labor that exists in the modern world. Each of us knows a tiny slice of the world very well and very little about anything else. We all rely on others’ knowledge except for the very few things we have mastered. In addition, when decisions involve important matters such as health, relying on experts can relieve the anxiety associated with important decisions. 



Finally, in the current pandemic, favoring “science” has become shorthand for saying, “I worry about COVID-19 more than I do about the economy or freedom or anything else.” It has also become shorthand for saying, “I don’t like any other approach to the pandemic including President Trump’s.” But it seems no one criticized the president of Notre Dame as being anti‐​science because he decided to reopen the university even though he wouldn’t have if minimizing the risk of infection had been his only objective. 



At its best, science explains relationships between cause and effect: no more and no less. No normative conclusions about individual or collective decisions follow directly from science. Instead costs, benefits, and other values properly enter both individual and collective decisions.



Sadly, science about infectious respiratory diseases, in general, and the coronavirus, in particular, is limited, creating more difficulties in the use of scientific understanding to inform decisions. Leading virologists have been very open about how little we know about the 1918 flu pandemic as well as SARS and MERS and how their initial views about coronavirus transmission were anchored in their understanding of SARS and MERS, which turned out to be incorrect for COVID-19.



For this coronavirus, about 35–60 percent of infections cause no symptoms. The conventional wisdom at the start of 2020 was that could not possibly be true. And thus, experts advised against masks except for those in obvious infection settings. But now asymptomatic infection has quickly become the new conventional wisdom, and wearing a mask is a wise choice. To scientists this is just good updating given new information, but this abrupt change has caused many nonscientists to give up on the idea of expertise.



In addition to asymptomatic transmission, the test for the virus has large false negative rates. And molecular evidence suggests that the virus arrived more than once in the past year with little or no transmission. The combined result of all the characteristics of COVID-19 is that in real time, identifying whom to isolate to reduce viral transmission is very difficult.



The essential problem with the role of science in public policy is that some scientists, most politicians, and the public want science to do more than it can. Some scientists want to tell others what to do. Expertise is not only information; for some it is power. Most politicians want to hide behind the veil of science so that they do not have to openly discuss why they favor some outcomes over others. It is much easier to say, “The experts made me do it.” And finally, the public and journalists often want “answers” particularly about “safe” and “unsafe” rather than nuanced statements about likely changes in health outcomes given various behaviors or exposures. Science actually can tell us more when the pressure for it to answer all our questions is less.

Note: this isn’t the High Court legal law case that has been decided, as that remains, but his own company’s internal investigation.
New Delhi: An internal committee of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) found its director general RK Pachauri guilty in a sexual harassment case.
Reportedly, the three-member panel of Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) found that Pachauri made repeated attempts at establishing a personal bond with the young woman colleague, which caused her “harassment”.
The panel also noted that when the woman resisted, Pachauri retaliated by ‘taking away her work’.
TERI committee recommended disciplinary action against the accused.
Last week, the Delhi High Court refused to cancel immediately the anticipatory bail granted by a trial court to Pachauri.
The matter has been posted for July 16 after the counsel for Pachauri sought more time to file response to the application move by the 29-year-old woman, who has alleged that “free and fair investigation” cannot be carried out if Pachauri is “allowed to roam around freely.”
The complainant had moved the High Court seeking cancellation of the anticipatory bail granted to Pachauri by the trial court in the case. The complainant’s counsel alleged before the court that Pachauri was “dictating what needs to be said to witnesses” in the case.
He claimed there was “overwhelming evidence” against Pachauri that he misused the bail conditions. A criminal case on charges of sexual harassment, stalking and criminal intimidation was registered against Pachauri on February 18 by the police.

"_Warning: This story contains images some people may find distressing_
**With the Ethiopian government conducting a military offensive in the northern Tigray region, some people have taken the opportunity to spread misinformation online.**
This includes material either not directly related to the conflict or, sometimes, altered to make it look like it is.
Some have been sharing photos they say show an S-400 Russian missile defence system, claiming it is in use in the Tigray region to ward off Ethiopian air attacks.
They also claim a Russian-made flamethrower system is being used.
Accompanying text reads: ""This weapon you see on the picture, even Ethiopia doesn't own it as a country.""
""The Tigrayans have it to protect themselves from air strikes.""
The photos each show a soldier in what appears to be the uniform of Tigray special forces, standing nearby.
But these images have been manipulated, with the soldiers added in.
Their shadows are either pointing in the wrong direction when compared with those from other objects or are too dark.
In one of the photos, the soldier is also out of proportion when compared with the background.
An online image search revealed the photos of the weapons system are from military exercises in the Astrakhan region, in southern Russia.
A Russian-language video of that exercise was posted online in September, showing the system in action.
The S-400 is an advanced Russian surface-to-air missile system, which only a few foreign countries have bought.
And Ethiopia is not one of them.
""Ethiopia has never imported an S-300 series or S-400 series... system and neither have any neighbouring countries,"" says Justin Bronk, of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), in London.
Hundreds of Facebook users have been sharing a picture purporting to show a downed Ethiopian military plane burning on the ground.
One post says: ""Tigray special forces were attacked from the air.
""They have destroyed one [Ethiopian] fighter jet and killed lots of special-force military (commando).
""The fight is still going on.""
But a reverse image search reveals this picture is not from Ethiopia.
An identical image appears:
Some have been sharing photos from the site where a civilian Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 crashed, killing more than 150 people shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa in March last year.
A misleading Facebook post - now deleted - claimed they showed body bags near the Tigray region, containing the remains of soldiers from the neighbouring Amhara region.
There've been militia forces from Amhara fighting along with Ethiopian government forces.
But other users pointed out correctly that these images were nothing to do with the current fighting in the Tigray region.
A Facebook page which supports the Ethiopian government's operations in Tigray has shared a video which appears to show military action in a mountainous area.
The text for the video says it shows Ethiopian forces attacking fighters from Tigray, and talks about ""victory for our army.""
The post has had 1,000 shares, but the video is not from Ethiopia.
We found this same video on a Twitter handle affiliated to the Ministry of Defence in Armenia.
The Armenian video - showing conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region - was uploaded online on 4 October and pre-dates the start of hostilities in the Tigray region of Ethiopia.
Screenshots of what appears to be a tweet by Ethiopian Health Minister Lia Tadesse have been circulating, mocking her for apparently posting Covid safety instructions to the military during a conflict.
The translation of the supposed tweet reads: ""With social distancing, sanitiser and wearing our masks properly, let all concerned bodies contribute towards the peaceful end of the war.""
But the screenshot is fabricated.
And this tweet does not appear on her actual Twitter timeline.
A look at genuine posts by the minister also shows she posts using an iPhone - and not an Android device as shown in these screenshots.

In response to the _Orlando Sentinel’s_ investigative reporting that many private schools participating in the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program have “anti‐​LGBTQ” policies, some lawmakers have been actively using social media to attack companies that donate money to fund private school scholarships for low‐​income students in the state. Two lawmakers are even congratulating companies for pulling scholarship funding from these disadvantaged families because, according to State Rep. Anna Eskamani, the private school choice program is a “discriminatory anti‐​LGBTQ voucher program.”



Her statement is incorrect, and her efforts are unintentionally hurting the very children she is claiming to help. First, the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program awards scholarships to students regardless of their sexual orientation. Families can use those scholarship dollars to attend a wide array of religious or nonreligious private schools in the state. Calling the program “discriminatory” and “anti‐​LGBTQ” is disingenuous.



Taking away educational options from hundreds of low‐​income and minority students is nothing to celebrate.



The school choice program currently serves over 100,000 disadvantaged students in the state. Of those students, 100% are from low‐​income families, and about 70% of those students are African American or Hispanic. The average student lives in a household earning just $26,578 each year.



Thus, these lawmakers are literally congratulating corporations for taking scholarship funding away from hundreds of low‐​income and minority students. Democratic State Rep. Shevrin Jones, a former public school teacher, understands these implications. “Ripping scholarship funding out from underneath thousands of economically vulnerable students whose only chance at a safe environment and solid education is not the answer,” Jones said.



Taking away educational options from low‐​income families does not help anyone. Yes, some schools chosen by families using scholarships in this program are religious and have policies against gay and transgender lifestyles. We do not personally agree with those policies. However, it is their right to religious freedom to do so, and it is the right of families using the scholarships to avoid those schools if they do not agree with their policies.



But possibly the worst way to be critical of those anti‐​gay and transgender policies is to defund the scholarship program. That has very little effect on schools with the policies while doing a great deal of harm to the disadvantaged students in need of those scholarships.



Defunding the program also means fewer scholarships for gay and transgender students. A 2017 analysis of school climates conducted by the Gay, Lesbian, & Straight Education Network found that “private non‐​religious schools were more positive environments for LGBTQ youth than public or religious schools.” Cutting gay and transgender student access to choice scholarships prevents them from finding a more positive environment. Those advocating for defunding the scholarship program will arguably harm the very students they are claiming to help — students such as Elijah Robinson, who recently said, “If I would have stayed at my previous school, I honestly would have lost my life.” Elijah obviously benefits from using the school choice program in Florida.



The choice program is not “anti‐​LGBTQ.” Taking scholarships away from gay and transgender students is anti‐​LGBTQ.



Critics like Eskamani and some journalists also adamantly refer to the scholarships as “public dollars.” That’s not true either. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that tax credit scholarships are private dollars because private funding does not become public funding until it has “come into the tax collector’s hands.” Furthermore, the Florida courts most recently ruled that “tax credits offered under the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program involve no public funds.”



Corporations are obviously free to do what they want with their own private dollars. But the misinformation and attacks on the scholarship program should stop. One company, Fifth Third Bank, had withdrawn its funding from the scholarship program in response to critics but decided just one week later to resume funding after getting a more complete picture. Others should follow its lead.



After all, taking away educational options from hundreds of low‐​income and minority students is nothing to celebrate.

"It is no longer credible to deny that the average temperature around the world is rising and that other phenomena, such as extreme weather events, are also shifting. People can now see with their own eyes that the climate is changing around them. Nor is it tenable to deny that the Earth’s warming is driven by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting from human activities, such as the production and burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Such denial is only now promoted by cranks and conspiracy theorists who also think, for instance, that the Covid-19 pandemic is linked to the development of the 5G network.  So instead, a different form of climate change denial is emerging from the polemical columns of rightwing newspapers. They paint a Panglossian picture of manmade climate crisis that will never be catastrophic as long as the world grows rich by using fossil fuels. The “lukewarmers” are on the march and coming to a bookshop near you. Two prominent lukewarmers are now launching new manifestos: False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor and Fails to Fix the Planet by Bjorn Lomborg, and Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All by Michael Shellenberger. Although they are aimed primarily at American audiences, they will appeal to anyone who, like the authors, proclaims themselves to be an environmentalist, but despises environmental campaigners. Both books contain many pages of endnotes and references to academic publications, conveying the initial impression that their arguments are supported by reason and evidence. But the well-informed reader will recognise that they rely on sources that are outdated, cherry-picked or just wrong. The content of False Alarm will be familiar to those who have read Lomborg’s previous books, The Skeptical Environmentalist and Cool It. New findings and evidence are twisted and forced into the same haranguing narrative for his new contribution. Shellenberger’s book is far easier to read, at least near the beginning, but gradually descends into a bitter rant against environmentalists, the media and politicians who do not share his fervour for nuclear power. Not everything that Lomborg and Shellenberger write is wrong. They are both correct in saying that the world should be investing far more in making populations, particularly in poor countries, more resilient to our changing climate. Even if the world is successful in its implementation of the Paris Agreement and limits global warming to well below 2C by the end of the century, the impacts will continue to grow over the coming decades, threatening lives and livelihoods across the globe. But their argument that adaptation to climate crisis impacts is easier and cheaper than emissions cuts is undermined by their admission that the economic costs of extreme weather are rising because ever-more-vulnerable businesses and homes are being built in high-risk areas. Lomborg is also right that the world should be spending far more on green innovation to develop technologies to help us to tackle climate breakdown. But he is pinning all his hopes on the breakthrough discovery of a magical new energy source that will be both zero-carbon and cheaper than fossil fuels. This is wrong-headed for at least two reasons. The first is that most innovation occurs through the incremental improvement of existing technologies and we will probably need several different sources of affordable and clean energy. The second is that climate crisis results from the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that is already happening, so we cannot afford to delay the deployment of today’s alternatives to fossil fuels. I also have some sympathy for Shellenberger’s argument that nuclear power has a role to play in creating a zero-carbon energy system. However, instead of calmly explaining its advantages over fossil fuels, he attempts to promote it by trash-talking about new renewable technologies, particularly wind and solar. He is right that we cannot yet store energy affordably on the scale needed to power an entire electricity grid with intermittent renewables. But he also claims that windfarms might be responsible for an alarming decline in insect populations in Germany, which entomologists have blamed on agricultural practices. And he complains that the turbines “are almost invariably loud and disturb the peace and quiet”, although he stops short of repeating Donald Trump’s ridiculous falsehood that the noise causes cancer. Both Lomborg and Shellenberger also make some legitimate criticisms of “alarmism” by environmentalists. One of the most difficult problems in making the case for action on climate crisis is that the elevated levels of greenhouse gases we create over the next few decades will have consequences not fully realised until the next century and beyond. Some campaigners deal with this communications challenge by wrongly warning of imminent catastrophe. However, many scientists do suspect that we are approaching, or have already passed, thresholds beyond which very severe consequences, such as destabilisation of the land-based polar ice caps and associated sea level rise of several metres, become unstoppable, irreversible or accelerate. Lomborg and Shellenberger both downplay these huge risks because they fatally undermine the fundamental basis for their lukewarmer ideology. Lomborg’s book relies heavily on the creative use of the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (Dice). William Nordhaus, who won the Nobel prize for economics in 2018 for his pioneering work on climate change, created the Dice model, but it has been strongly criticised for omitting the biggest risks. A graph in Lomborg’s book shows that he has used Dice to predict that 4.1C of global warming by the end of the century would only reduce global economic output, or GDP, by about 4%. He also finds that even more extreme warming of 7C would lead to a loss of GDP of just 15%. These are hard to reconcile with the scientific evidence that such temperature changes would utterly transform the world. Lomborg also exaggerates the costs of action by automatically doubling researchers’ estimates for reducing emissions. He justifies this by referring to an obscure study in 2009 that concluded it may prove twice as costly as the European commission expected for the member states to cut their collective emissions by 20% by 2020. But the European Union reached its target ahead of schedule in 2018, with the price of emissions permits over the previous decade usually at less than half of the level anticipated by the commission. Nevertheless, Lomborg doubles Nordhaus’s estimates of the costs of global action and concludes that the “optimal” level of global warming, balancing both damages and emissions cuts, would be 3.75C by 2100. This calculation made me laugh out loud because modern humans have no evolutionary experience of the climate that would be created by such a temperature rise. The last time the Earth was more than 2C warmer than pre-industrial times was during the Pliocene epoch, three million years ago, when the polar ice caps were much smaller and global sea level was 10 to 20 metres higher than today. Only lukewarmers would claim that modern humans are best suited to a prehistoric climate! In short, these new books truly deserve their place on the bookshelf among other classic examples of political propaganda.

"**The United Nations has expressed concern about possible war crimes after a threat by the Ethiopian army to start an assault on the northern Tigray region's capital.**
A deadline set by the government for fighters in the region to surrender is due to expire on Wednesday.
Fighting between the government and regional forces in Tigray has been going on for almost three weeks.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed and tens of thousands have fled.
Aid groups fear the conflict could trigger a humanitarian crisis and destabilise East Africa.
The UN said it was alarmed by the threat of major hostilities if the Ethiopian army advanced on Tigray's capital Mekelle, home to about 500,000 people.
However, a UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the fighting in Tigray ended without a statement, according to AFP news agency, with African countries reportedly requesting more time to allow for diplomatic efforts by the African Union to continue.
On Sunday, Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed issued a 72-hour ultimatum to Tigray's forces, telling them to surrender as they were ""at a point of no return"".
But Tigray's forces have vowed to keep fighting, with their leader Debretsion Gebremichael saying they are ""ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region"".
Meanwhile, Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a youth group from the Tigray region of being behind a massacre earlier this month in which it says more than 600 civilians were killed.
The commission says the group stabbed, bludgeoned and burned to death non-Tigrayan residents of the town of Mai-Kadra with the collusion of local forces.
Human rights group Amnesty International first highlighted reports of a massacre in Mai-Kadra but was unable to confirm who was behind it, or exactly how many died.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party which controls Tigray, denied involvement, and called for an independent international investigation into the killings.
The conflict started after Ethiopia's central government accused the TPLF of holding an illegal election and attacking a military base to steal weapons.
In response, Mr Abiy - a former Nobel Peace Prize winner - ordered a military offensive against forces in Tigray, accusing them of treason.
The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing Mr Abiy does not have a mandate to lead the country after postponing national elections because of coronavirus.
Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed ""alarm at reports of a heavy build-up of tanks and artillery around Mekelle"".
She called on all sides to give ""clear and unambiguous orders to their forces"" to spare civilians.
""The highly aggressive rhetoric on both sides regarding the fight for Mekelle is dangerously provocative and risks placing already vulnerable and frightened civilians in grave danger,"" Ms Bachelet said. ""I fear such rhetoric will lead to further violations of international humanitarian law.""
The rhetoric has been ramped up in recent days. On Sunday, the Ethiopian army said there would be ""no mercy"" for Mekelle's residents when its soldiers ""encircle"" the city.
Such talk could constitute a war crime, Ms Bachelet said.
Mr Abiy has repeatedly said the Ethiopian army would protect civilians in its campaign against forces in Tigray.
But Ms Bachelet said a virtual communications blackout in Tigray was making it difficult for the UN to monitor the human rights and humanitarian situation.
""Reports continue to emerge of arbitrary arrests and detentions, killings, as well as discrimination and stigmatisation of ethnic Tigrays,"" the UN said.
At least 40,000 refugees have already crossed into neighbouring Sudan. The UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
A couple sit looking pensive by the wall of the UN building in Hamdayit in eastern Sudan's Kassala region.
Smoke rising from a charcoal burner partially blurs their faces. The woman lines up tiny cups as she waits for coffee to boil in an earth kettle.
A traditional coffee ceremony is performed even in the worst of circumstances.
They've recently arrived at the transit camp, having fled from Tigray.
A young man interrupts this moment when he walks up to me. He worked as a customs official in the Tigray town of Humera but fled three days ago, he tells me.
I ask why he hasn't yet moved to the refugee camp further away from the border. ""I am waiting for my family,"" he says.
They are still trapped inside Tigray. Families have been torn apart by the conflict.
The conflict is rooted in longstanding tension between the TPLF, the powerful regional party, and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations deteriorated.
The TPLF said the central government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election.
In September the party held its own election, which the central government said was ""illegal"".
Then, on 4 November, the Ethiopian prime minister announced an operation against the TPLF, accusing its forces of attacking the army's northern command headquarters in Mekelle.
The TPLF fighters, drawn mostly from a paramilitary unit and a well-drilled local militia, are thought to number about 250,000. Analysts believe the conflict could be long and bloody given the strength of Tigray's forces."

Testimony before Congress was based on model hindcast, actual data ignored
Guest essay by Michael Wallace, Hydrologist
Members of the global science and lay communities have begun to learn of the confirmed omission of 80 years of instrumental data from contemporary ocean acidification (OA) scientific products. The missing ~2 million data points comprise a majority of the world’s historical ocean pH measurements.   The data was replaced without disclosure, by a model hind cast. The substituted history, known as the FEEL2899 report (1) was itself used as the technical basis for testimony to the US Congress (2). In turn, OA mitigation research funding was augmented, and the regulation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was strengthened and deepened.
This occurrence of a model-replacing-data-without-disclosure has few publicized precedents of this scale. Already some in media have chosen to headline this as a case of “pHraud” (3). Whatever it is called, a fundamental question remains whether or not this omission will ever be corrected. Currently the major obstacle to rapid correction appears to be a consensus among those in power, that ocean pH cannot (and could never) be instrumentally measured using any conceivable means for any conceivable ocean purpose by any conceivable scientist. Therefore those in power effectively assert that the world must put aside expectations of data accessibility and transparency, and accept the PMEL authors’ formerly undisclosed SeaCarb model hindcast replacement as the entire truth of past ocean pH.
I came into awareness of the ocean pH data omission myself, purely through research activities, which led to personal communications with the authors of the omission (4). I learned through two of those authors some facts concerning the origins, pervasiveness, and structure of the omissions.
Originally I had simply hoped to find somewhere a complete basic ocean instrumental pH time series data set, in order to compare to other ocean and climate indices of interest to me.   Although it was a detour from my primary research, I found it necessary to begin to construct my own time series and geospatial products, based on the new information, obliquely brought to my attention by the PMEL authors towards the end of our communications, which I later downloaded.
I have continued to follow up through ongoing stochastic evaluations of the actual omitted instrumental data (5). I think this information largely speaks for itself and so I’ve adapted some of those evaluations for the attached figure. In addition I’ve traced some of the OA citation pathways in order to focus on the most likely reasons for the existing disconnects between the OA research community and the rest of the aqueous pH measuring communities.
One of the greatest disconnects relates to the question of instrumental measurement accuracy.   In my communications with the FEEL2899 authors from the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL), they asserted that instrumental ocean pH measurements prior to around 1988 were not sufficiently accurate (4).
Figure 1-a. includes a subset of the FEEL2899 pH time series product as the thick reddish curve. Some aspects of the NOAA World Ocean Database (WOD) (6) global ocean pelagic pH data (GOPpH) are plotted over the same time frame. These include the ten year moving average in blue, and a rounded version of that as open green circles. Please note that although there doesn’t appear to be a clear trend up or down, both of the WOD-based curves suggest an oscillatory behavior, over the period shown.

NOAA’s WOD pH data are typically published to two decimal places. This is presumably because of the 0.01 pH unit accuracy of the meters utilized. This accuracy is standard for many modern day glass electrode pH (GEpH) meters as well. In addition, the natural global ocean pH (GOpH) values for all depths can range over 4 full pH units.   That yields at least 400 unique possibilities along a continuous ocean pH curve, that can be accurately identified by any pH meter of its time.   Even a measurement taken with an accuracy of only one decimal place yields 40 possible points along that curve. Either accuracy should be more than adequate for initial and publishable GOpH and/or GOPpH trend analyses.
As a rough illustration, I have included the green open circles of Figure 1.a., which are simply the blue curve data rounded to the nearest 0.1 pH unit. The apparent oscillatory pattern of the more refined time series is preserved. This holds even though I’ve already severely restricted the pH range of that data set due to the 10 year averaging filter.
The real data continue to receive additional confirmatory support. For example, I have been profiling outside natural indexes which appear to correlate with the WOD GOPpH data set (5). These include the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Otowi stream gage in the US Southwest.   I’ve included part b. of Figure 1 to summarize some of those findings here (7). As shown, my construction of the GOPpH time series shows a higher correlation to a premier continental stream gage (the Otowi gage of the Upper Rio Grande in the US Southwest) than correlations of that gage to the El Niño – Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and atmospheric CO2 (from Mauna Loa Observatory).
To me, this is interesting. I know that the correlation between GOPpH and the Otowi stream gage is not high enough to be useful by itself for forecasting purposes. Yet it would appear to be more justified than ENSO and/or CO2, even though those are the ‘go to’ drivers employed to justify contemporary assertions about hydrology in this region.
In any case, given such reproducible and stochastically interesting outcomes for GOPpH, why do OA researchers consistently maintain that GEpH meters are insufficiently accurate for any conceivable ocean hydroclimatologic use? Why do they also assert that only spectrophotometric (SP) based pH meters are up to the claimed accuracy challenge?
These assertions appear to be largely based upon invalid referencing (8,9) to the document known as “SCOR Working Group 75” (SCOR75) (10). The SCOR75 report contradicts those claims by clearly stating that “Under the best circumstances, the absolute value of pH is only known within 0.01 pH unit”.   Moreover, it appears that the validity of SP based pH measurements is only supported when those measurements are backed up by, of all things, GEpH meter readings. In fact, one of the FEEL2899 authors has contributed to a report where this GEpH specification is repeated many times (8).
Perhaps even these inconsistencies are overshadowed by another twist; why do SP based pH measurements also require the use of conventional pH indicator dyes? Unlike typical applications for SPs, the emission or absorption of the target ion species (hydronium in this context) is not directly measured. Rather, the SPs in this context appear to be nothing more than expensive, exotic, titration- fed colorimeters.
The non-OA community might benefit to know of this pernicious limitation that all ocean scientists are now constrained to.   Is it conceivable that if only for consistency, authorities soon will pressure the rest of us to abandon GEpH meters in favor of a technology that is no more accurate, yet exponentially more expensive and time consuming?
No doubt I have biases, but I believe that the scientific consensus will eventually condense around the omitted NOAA WOD GOpH data as the most practical and useful foundation for any credible and complete ocean pH time series analyses. It is amazingly rich and informative, and appears to align with many independent hydroclimatologic patterns and expectations.
The ocean pH data omission was an unprecedented and disturbing incident in the history of hydrological sciences. Only NOAA can likely correct this. That’s because NOAA contains the source of the problem (the FEEL2899 pH time series product) as well as its solution (the WOD database). To help resolve that paralyzing disorder, scientists and others may wish to consider signing a petition that I have authored at (11). It may seem overly prescriptive, but in some ways it merely asks that the ocean pH data omissions be corrected by NOAA, and that GOpH measurements follow the OA authorities’ own published guidelines.

Guest essay by Patrick J. Michaels
Day after day, year after year, the hole that climate scientists have buried themselves in gets deeper and deeper. The longer that they wait to admit their overheated forecasts were wrong, the more they are going to harm all of science.
The story is told in a simple graph, the same one that University of Alabama’s John Christy presented to the House Committee on Natural Resources on May 15.
The picture shows the remarkable disconnect between predicted global warming and the real world.
The red line is the 5-year running average temperature change forecast, beginning in 1979, predicted by the UN’s latest family of climate models, many of which are the handiwork of our own federal science establishment. The forecasts are for the average temperature change in the lower atmosphere, away from the confounding effects of cities, forestry, and agriculture.
The blue circles are the average lower-atmospheric temperature changes from four different analyses of global weather balloon data, and the green squares are the average of the two widely accepted analyses of satellite-sensed temperature. Both of these are thought to be pretty solid because they come from calibrated instruments.
If you look at data through 1995 the forecast appears to be doing quite well. That’s because the computer models appear to have, at least in essence, captured two periods of slight cooling.
The key word is “appear.” The computer models are tuned to account for big volcanoes that are known to induce temporary cooling in the lower atmosphere. These would be the 1982 eruption of El Chichon in Mexico, and 1992’s spectacular Mt. Pinatubo, the biggest natural explosion on earth since Alaska’s Katmai in 1912.
Since Pinatubo, the earth has been pretty quiescent, so that warming from increasing carbon dioxide should proceed unimpeded. Obviously, the spread between forecast and observed temperatures grows pretty much every year, and is now a yawning chasm.
It’s impossible, as a scientist, to look at this graph and not rage at the destruction of science that is being wreaked by the inability of climatologists to look us in the eye and say perhaps the three most important words in life: we were wrong.

We know President Trump’s general orientation towards executive power: “when somebody’s the president of the United States, the authority is total.” What limits, if any, does Joe Biden recognize when it comes to the powers of the office he seeks? 





Good luck figuring that out from the current campaign, what discussion we’ve had on that subject has been sporadic and incidental. At the ABC News town hall two weeks ago, for instance, Biden seemed to reject the “pen and phone” approach to governance:



“Some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends even occasionally say, ‘Well, if you can’t get the votes by executive order, you’re going to do something.’ [There are] things you can’t do by executive order unless you’re a dictator. We’re a democracy. We need consensus.”



Music to my ears… but: where have I heard that song before? Oh yeah:



“Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own.… That’s not how our democracy functions. That’s not how our Constitution is written.”



That was President Barack Obama in 2011, explaining why he couldn’t unilaterally rewrite immigration law, about a year before deciding to do just that.



In fact, the Biden‐​Harris platform contemplates plenty of pen and phone governance, including a raft of “Day One” executive orders on climate change. And this summer, the former veep insisted the president’s powers were broad enough to impose a national mask mandate: “Our legal team thinks I can do that.” in September. If so, they’re as enamored of crank constitutional theories as Donald Trump during a wee‐​hours tweeting jag: there’s no statutory, let alone constitutional, authority for that kind of move, which is likely why Biden has since walked back the claim.



For a deeper dive into Joe Biden’s executive‐​power philosophy, such as it is, you have to go back much earlier in the campaign, to a candidate survey conducted by the _New York Times’s_ Charlie Savage and published in September 2019. For each of the last four presidential election cycles, Savage has pressed the candidates to answer a questionnaire fleshing out their views on the powers of the office. With the exception of the 2016 race, he’s succeeded more often than not in getting the contenders on the record. Last fall, all 17(!) Democrats then running—including Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris—played along.



As it happens, Joe Biden has been through _two_ rounds of Savage queries: in the 2008 cycle and the current race—so it’s possible to compare his answers and spot some telling shifts between Biden 2008 and Biden 2020. It seems the former veep’s views on the powers of the office “grew in office”–dramatically, in some cases. 



For one thing, Biden now leaves himself a lot more wiggle room on war powers than he did prior to his vice‐​presidential stint. In the 2008‐​cycle version of the Savage survey, then‐​Senator Biden was concise and unequivocal: “The Constitution is clear: except in response to an attack or the imminent threat of attack, only Congress may authorize war and the use of force.” (Indeed, on the campaign trail at around the same time, Senator Biden promised that if George W. Bush “takes this nation to war in Iran, without congressional approval, I will make it my business to impeach him.”)



The Constitution, Biden now says, vests the CINC with “the power to direct limited U.S. military operations abroad without prior Congressional approval when those operations serve important U.S. interests and are of a limited nature, scope, and duration.” In other words, if the president thinks bombing another country is a good idea and doesn’t think we’ll get bogged down for too long, he can order up a _little_ war, splendid or otherwise. Still, Biden‐​2020 allows that a preventive strike on Iran or North Korea might be a bigger deal, rising to the level of “a ‘war’ in the constitutional sense that would require authorization by Congress.”



That “limited nature, scope, and duration” bit comes almost verbatim from the Obama Office of Legal Counsel opinion rationalizing the Libyan adventure. You may recall that in the 2008 race, Senator Barack Obama _also_ pledged to respect congressional war powers, telling Savage that the president had no constitutional authority “to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.” That answer got thrown in his face repeatedly three years later when, as president, Obama unilaterally launched a seven‐​month bombing campaign against Libya, a country that presented no threat whatsoever and that his own secretary of defense admitted wasn’t a “vital interest” of the United States.



Even if, as Biden now insists, he was a Libya skeptic at the time, he’s not going to get caught saying that the Obama‐​Biden administration launched an unconstitutional war. If you wanted to be especially charitable, you might ascribe Biden’s current views on the assassination of American citizens—“U.S. citizenship alone does not immunize such individuals from being detained or even targeted”—to a similar calculus. Whatever the reason, the former vice president now embraces a suite of executive war powers that a younger, wiser Biden rightly considered dangerous.



One of the most revealing queries Savage included in his latest survey covers “Potential Post‐​Trump Reforms.” He gave each candidate a list of 10 policy areas where Congress might rein in executive discretion and asked which restrictions they’d be willing to sign into law. One or two that Biden says he’d support, like restrictions on removal of special prosecutors, could have serious bite. But for the most part, the reforms Biden provisionally endorses are aimed at avoiding Trump‐​style conflicts of interest: mandating release of the president’s tax returns; forcing him to divest major business holdings; tightening restrictions on nepotism; and regulating self‐​serving uses of the pardon power. The former vice president has already released his tax returns, he doesn’t own a hotel chain, and unless he wants to dangle pardons to cronies or put Hunter in charge of Middle East peace, these are fairly low‐​cost concessions. They likely wouldn’t cramp a President Biden’s style all that much.



What’s more significant is what Biden leaves out. The first item on Savage’s list proposes new restrictions on the “ability of a president to declare a national emergency and activate various standby powers.” In his answer, the former veep glides right past that proposal, leaving it unmentioned.



Aggressive exploitation of emergency powers is one of the few genuinely new weapons Donald Trump has added to the presidential arsenal. As Senator Chris Murphy put it after the president’s border‐​wall emergency declaration last year:



“If Trump can use a legislative stalemate to declare an emergency to divert military dollars to build a border wall… What stops a Democratic President from declaring a climate change emergency and using military dollars to build solar farms and wind turbines?”



Biden’s silence here suggests that when it comes to emergency powers, he may be keeping his options open.



Senator Kamala Harris’s views on presidential power are of particular interest now, given the distinct possibility she’ll soon be the proverbial “heartbeat away” from the presidency. Not to be too morbid about it, but if elected, Joe Biden would be 78 on Inauguration Day, older than any previous president. From an actuarial standpoint, his odds of living through at least one term are pretty good. Still, so far, eight vice presidents have gained the presidency as a result of a death in office.



In her answers to Savage’s queries, Senator Harris is, if anything, more evasive and less reassuring than the top of the ticket. Like her running mate, Harris declines the opportunity to back emergency‐​powers reform. On war powers, the California senator allows that it’s past time for Congress to “rewrite” the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force; still, she “won’t hesitate to do what it takes to protect our country in the face of an imminent threat in the future.” Does that include bombing North Korea or Iran? Those situations, Harris says, “would require careful consideration of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.” Ah. Is it lawful to hold American citizens without trial as “enemy combatants” or kill them with drone strikes? Harris: “Any president should reserve the right to act quickly to protect the country from attack, but decisions of such consequence must rely on our values and constitutional principles.” Well, that clears it up, thanks.



All of this is a reminder, if one was needed, that real presidential power reform isn’t going to come from within the executive branch. The sorts of men and women who are willing to do what it takes to become president are unlikely, having won the prize, to turn around and say: “you know what? Now that I’ve finally made it, I’d like a whole lot less power!” At best, they’ll grudgingly accede to restraints imposed from the outside. Will the next Congress force the issue?

The main points are emphasized in bold print.
1. Trends in Extreme Weather Events since 1900 – An Enduring Conundrum for Wise Policy Advice
It is widely promulgated and believed that human-caused global warming comes with increases in both the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. A survey of official weather sites and the scientific literature provides strong evidence that the first half of the 20th century had more extreme weather than the second half, when anthropogenic global warming is claimed to have been mainly responsible for observed climate change. The disconnect between real-world historical data on the 100 years’ time scale and the current predictions provides a real conundrum when any engineer tries to make a professional assessment of the real future value of any infrastructure project which aims to mitigate or adapt to climate change. What is the appropriate basis on which to make judgements when theory and data are in such disagreement?
The compilation of temperature records are a source of problematic methodology of a kind not seen elsewhere in science. Under the umbrella term of “homogenisation”, there now seem to be a growing myriad of post-hoc adjustments to the original raw data that all seem to go in one direction, namely to increase the overall rate of global warming. This happens even on official websites. The total change is often somewhat greater than the 0.8-1ºC rise over the 20th century that is agreed by most people, critics or not. This is exemplified by data in Figure 4. This makes the problem of dispassionate engineering assessment almost impossible to achieve. Hansen (1981) wrote : “A remarkable conclusion from Figure 3 is that the global temperature is almost as high today as it was in 1940.” It is not clear now why this should be remarkable, although at the time, the rise in temperature from about 1975 had cancelled out some of the cooling since 1940 in the then available data. At the time, he [Hansen] showed 1980 temperatures were about 0.15ºC cooler than 1940. Now, NASA shows 1980 temperatures about 0.2ºC warmer than 1940. They have made a relative shift of +0.35ºC, and the adjustment represents ~40% of the century variation. The lesson from this is that the data integrity for claiming extreme events needs to shown to be of the highest order, and that the results claimed do not depend on the data manipulation itself.”

2. Quantification of the Diminishing Earth’s Magnetic Dipole Intensity and Geomagnetic Activity as the Causal Source for Global Warming within the Oceans and Atmosphere
Quantification of the Diminishing Earth’s Magnetic Dipole Intensity and Geomagnetic Activity as the Causal Source for Global Warming within the Oceans and Atmosphere
Quantitative analyses of actual measurements rather than modeling have shown that “global warming” has been heterogeneous over the surface of the planet and temporally non-linear. Residual regression analyses by Soares (2010) indicated increments of increased temperature precede increments of CO2 increase. The remarkably strong negative correlation (r = -0.99) between the earth’s magnetic dipole moment values and global CO2-temperature indicators over the last ~30 years is sufficient to be considered causal if contributing energies were within the same order of magnitude. Quantitative convergence between the energies lost by the diminishing averaged geomagnetic field strength and energies gained within the ocean-atmosphere interface satisfy the measured values for increased global temperature and CO2 release from sea water. The pivotal variable is the optimal temporal unit employed to estimate the total energies available for physical-chemical reactions. The positive drift in averaged amplitude of geomagnetic activity over the last 100 years augmented this process. Contributions from annual CO2 from volcanism and shifts in averaged geomagnetic activity, lagged years before the measured global temperature-CO2 values, are moderating variables for smaller amplitude perturbations. These results indicated that the increase in CO2 and global temperatures are primarily caused by major geophysical factors, particularly the diminishing total geomagnetic field strength and increased geomagnetic activity, but not by human activities. Strategies for adapting to climate change because of these powerful variables may differ from those that assume exclusive anthropomorphic causes.

3. Reassessing the Climate Role of Carbon Dioxide
The authors evaluate the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) “consensus” that the increase of carbon dioxide in the earth’s atmosphere is of anthropogenic origin and is causing dangerous global warming, climate change and climate disruption. They conclude that the data do not support that supposition. Most of the currently accepted scientific interpretations are examined and the given impression that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide will increase the earth’s surface and/or air temperature is questioned. New insight is offered drawing a conclusion that no additional warming is possible due to the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Acceptance of that IPCC paradigm is incurring costly and draconian efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, tax such emissions and replace fossil fuel combustion by alternative energy systems whether such alternatives will achieve the desired results or not. The totality of the data available on which that theory is based is evaluated here, from Vostok ice core measurements, to residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere, to more recent studies of temperature changes that inevitably precede CO2 changes, to global temperature trends, to the current ratio of carbon isotopes in the atmosphere, to satellite data for the geographic distribution of atmospheric CO2, to the effect of solar activity on cosmic rays and cloud cover. Nothing in the data supports the supposition that atmospheric CO2 is a driver of weather or climate, or that human emissions control atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, CO2 is not a pollutant, but an essential ingredient of the Earth’s ecosystem on which almost all life depends via photosynthesis. This paper rejects the new paradigm of “climate science” and asserts that the traditional, century old meteorological concepts for the factors that control weather and climate remain sound but need to be reassessed.

Joe Bastardi at his Daily Update here says it’s going to get “as cold as you’ll ever see it at this time of year”.
It’s going to get uncharacteristingly cold – not something we ought to expect after one hundred years of alleged accelerating global warming. In fact the 25-year trend in Germany shows spring arriving later and later – something the media will never tell us.
How icy is it supposed to get? German CHIP magazine here writes: “It sounds like a bad joke: This weekend it’s going to snow in many areas in Germany. Are we about to get hit by snow chaos in April?”

The chart above shows frosty conditions across much of Great Britain, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Scandinavia by Monday morning.
Coldest late April week in decades
A low pressure system will be bringing cold Arctic air down across Euroipe as daytime temperatures plunge below 10°C this weekend. At night temperatures will drop to around freezing and precipitation is expected to fall to elevations as low as 200 meters.
CHIP reports: “On Monday it could get even colder”.
Weather records show that the cold blast will make this year’s late April  one of the coldest in decades.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) measurement, corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, and socially responsible investing (SRI) are increasingly important research topics in both academic and professional areas. This recent research focus has been primarily due to the increased number of assets invested following ESG principles, now reportedly more than one‐​quarter of the $88 trillion of assets under management globally. While there is growing evidence of an association between ESG and CSR activities on security pricing, comparatively little is known about the channels through which ESG factors may affect asset prices.



A question of primary importance in this area is whether ESG investments have value to investors beyond the expected risk and return attributes of a security. For instance, if we were to present investors with a high‐​ESG security and a low‐​ESG security whose risk and returns are identical, would investors pay more for the high‐​ESG security? While standard arguments suggest that these securities should price identically, there is a growing literature that argues otherwise. Several studies present theoretical models where investors are willing to give up financial benefits to invest in environmentally friendly or socially responsible assets.



There is evidence of these effects showing that both investors and managers value green investments for their societal benefits. In experimental markets, investors respond positively to reports of green investments even when they are independent of future cash flows and risk, suggesting a tradeoff between wealth and societal benefits. The critical question is whether such experimental results generalize to actual market settings.



In our analysis, we focus on U.S. municipal issuers because these entities have been one of the largest issuers of green bonds. This setting is ideal for exploring our research question because these securities are explicitly issued to fund environmentally sustainable projects. As important, the way municipalities issue bonds provides a novel experiment to assess whether investors value the societal benefits associated with ESG activities. We leverage three unique institutional features of the U.S. municipal securities market to implement a methodological approach that is less prone to the standard correlated omitted‐​variable critique of prior ESG research.



The first is that municipal issuers commonly price multiple tranches of securities, both green and nongreen securities, on the same day with similar maturities. This occurs for several reasons, such as issuer requirements to track their use of funds to comply with IRS requirements and limits to bond issuance by state constitutional mandates.



The second feature of municipal bonds is that the credit for these green bonds is identical to the credit for their nongreen counterparts. Green bonds are identical to ordinary municipal bonds in all ways except that the use of proceeds is allocated to fund “environmentally friendly projects” (e.g., sustainable water management and energy production). The only effective difference between a green bond and a nongreen bond is the use of proceeds. Thus we can attribute any differences in security pricing to investor preferences for nonmonetary security features rather than differences in expectations about future cash flows or risk.



Finally, there are strong reasons to believe that our setting is one where we are most likely to find a greenium (if it exists), though it is a relatively small and specialized asset class. Specifically, the average issuance size (supply) in our sample is small ($5.36 million on average) compared with corporate green‐​bond issuances, which are often hundreds of millions (or even billions) of dollars. Since the size of green issues is small, there is ample opportunity for green investors to be the marginal trader (which would not be the case for very large green issues in a market setting where green investors do not have the capacity to buy most of the offering). Thus our focus on small issues of green municipal securities is very likely to provide a powerful test of whether a greenium exists.



The primary result of our paper is that the greenium, or the premium that green assets trade to otherwise identical nongreen securities, is precisely equal to zero. Our results are based on a sample of 640 matched pairs of green and nongreen issues given out on the same day, with identical maturity and rating, and issued by the same municipality. We observe an economically trivial difference in yield (and spread) between green and nongreen bonds of approximately 0.45 basis points (indicating a slight green‐​bond discount). In fact, in approximately 85 percent of matched cases, the differential yield is exactly zero. These results provide strong evidence that investors are unwilling to sacrifice returns to support environmentally friendly projects, and thus the greenium is equal to zero.



We also examine how much investment bankers charge for issuing green securities (or the underwriter’s discount) in comparison to nongreen securities. This is important for two reasons. First, it indicates whether banks consider green securities as riskier or more challenging to underwrite. Second, one of the primary challenges attributed to the growth of green bonds in municipal markets is the perceived cost of issuance. For our matched sample, we find that the underwriting cost charged for issuing green bonds is higher than nongreen bonds. Specifically, borrowing costs are on average approximately 10 percent higher for green securities than almost identical nongreen securities. The combination of equivalent yield and higher transactions costs is not consistent with the existence of greenium.



Concerns over greenwashing have arisen among investors due to the absence of a universal set of standards on whether a security is actually green. In response to these concerns, several agencies have created a new form of economic certification to ensure that issuers of green bonds are using the financing proceeds for environmentally friendly purposes. The Climate Bonds Initiative is the leading provider of these services and has been used by a number of municipalities to provide third‐​party certification. We explore the pricing effects of this certification and find no evidence that this leads to incremental yield benefits to municipalities. This finding mitigates concerns that greenwashing is responsible for our documented lack of premium. Additional tests relate to the underlying use of proceeds, and bond‐​specific green ratings also support these inferences.



In our final sets of tests, we explore various nonissuance cost‐​related benefits associated with green issuances. Specifically, some issuers have suggested that green issuances help to broaden the issuers’ base of investors. We find evidence consistent with this, as green issues have a lower amount of ownership concentration by approximately 12–20 percent. Other market participants have also suggested that while a greenium does not currently exist, as the market matures and gains momentum, a greenium may emerge. We hypothesize and find that those states that value environmental sustainability issue more green bonds and pay these slightly higher costs for their perceived future benefits. Despite this effect, even in states with the highest level of green preferences (and therefore issuance), we still find no evidence of a current greenium.



Our analyses also provide new policy‐​relevant insights on the pricing of green securities of municipal markets and the benefits of third‐​party certification. Based on prior research that claims to document a greenium, some policy analysts are calling for more green‐​bond issuance to reduce the cost of government borrowing. Our results suggest just the opposite conclusion. Not only is there no pricing differential but investment banks also appear to charge slightly more to issue green bonds on average. As there are other costs associated with green‐​bond issuance, our results suggest that municipalities increase their borrowing costs by issuing green bonds.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEuropean climate science dissenters beware.
Recall how the effort in the US of some 20 attorneys general to silence climate skeptics backfired. In the story the attorney generals wanted to go after oil companies and think tanks because the scientific views they held differed from their own.

Public domain image
Well, in Europe it is not just a group of activist attorneys general who are calling for silencing dissent, but the EU itself!
According to Deutsche Wirtschaftsnachrichten – DWN – (German Business News), “The EU is planning penalties for parties that do not represent ‘the values of the EU“.
The move is apparently in response to the rising wave of right wing parties currently sweeping across Europe – especially Austria, which saw a right wing figure almost winning national Presidential elections last Sunday. Europe’s established parties are spooked, and they aren’t coping well with growing opposition and voter dissatisfaction. Their latest solution: to punish it.
A number of EU parliament leaders apparently believe that political parties should not provide a platform for citizens to express their dissatisfaction with failing EU policies. The proposal has been floated by the EU socialists, led by EU Parliament President Martin Schulz and Denmark’s Helle Thorning-Schmidt. The aim, according to DWN, is to prevent “rightwing radical or foreigner-hostile” being represented in the EU Parliament.
Of course the exclusion of radicalism always appears to be a noble cause at first glance, but achieving it by regulation as some leading WU parliamentarians are proposing opens up very dangerous doors to abuse. It would be the first major step to dictating speech and opinion, and that on a continent that likes to claim it protects.  The move would be a threat to anyone holding a different opinion on controversial EU issues like energy, fiscal policy, social orientation, economics and immigration.
Skeptics of climate science could be targeted
The proposal reveals the EU’s growing discomfort with the democratically and legitimately led opposition. Brussels is in fact (unwittingly) sending a terrible message: Democracy is okay, but only if you agree with us. That’s arrogance, and it should be no surprise voters are punishing the established politicians by voting against them. These people seem to think dissenters are need of upbringing.

Deny funding to parties
The proposal calls for punishing political parties that don’t conform to EU norms by denying them EU party funding. Parties would only get money if they agreed with the opinions of the money givers.
Fortunately, many established politicians, even Green ones, are able to see the plan for what it is, and are against it. EU Green parliamentarian Nicholas Villumsen told: “That would be like the Parliament imposing penalties against parties with wrong opinions. It is very worrisome that the European Parliament wishes to punish parties for their views,” the DWN quotes.
So it starts. What’s next?
Punishing the Catholic Church for its views on gay marriage and abortion?
The fining of climate “deniers”?
The DWN comments:
In fact such a regulation is very dangerous. It opens the door and gate to pressure opinion. […] In a tense crisis climate, EU critics could be forcibly silenced with such an EU rule. The right to freedom of expression can be suppressed with such a regulation. […]
The enforcement of belief to ‘values’ is undemocratic.
It is the first step to a totalitarian system.”
Obviously for the socialists in power in Brussels, that is precisely the idea. They can’t win the debates on the merits of their arguments, so they resort to the very radical right-wing type authoritarian measures they proclaim to fear and from which we need to be protected.

"In the early days of the pandemic, many people urged that societies could not and should not return to business as usual afterwards. Coronavirus not only confronted us with danger, but showed what was possible. By forcing massive overnight change, it demonstrated that dramatic action could be taken when a crisis was urgent enough; that many people could agree to make sacrifices when truly necessary; and that governments could invest trillions when the future of their countries demanded it. But as the great pause has turned into a gradual reopening, there is little sign that these lessons have been learned. Greta Thunberg’s call for climate action should be seen in this context. The campaigner, writing for the Guardian to mark the second anniversary of her first school strike, says the world has wasted that time. While millions have been inspired to follow her in protest, and the European parliament has declared a climate and environmental emergency, little action has resulted.  Over the last six months or so, the pandemic has not only demonstrated that change can be quicker than anyone anticipated, it has also offered a practical opportunity to reconfigure economies. Governments are spending money as they have never done in peacetime. Germany and South Korea have seized this chance for big green investments. Others, including the UK, have not. Shockingly, G20 countries are spending much more in support of fossil fuels than on low-carbon energy in their rescue packages; few even imposed green targets when they bailed out the airlines, as France did. Boris Johnson promised that Britain would “build back greener” and Rishi Sunak pledged a green recovery. Yet the chancellor’s summer statement showed precious little sign of that beyond the £3bn insulation programme – unimpressive given the £9bn promised in the Conservatives’ November manifesto. These shortcomings look all the more glaring when the UK is not on course to meet its 2025 or 2030 carbon targets, and when it will host next year’s crucial UN climate change conference. They are also more concerning as we experience rising temperatures and strange weather patterns. A week ago, scientists warned that the past decade was the hottest ever recorded. In recent weeks Britons have sweltered through a heatwave and farmers have warned of the worst wheat harvest since the 1980s due to consecutive seasons of extreme weather. Ms Thunberg’s article, co-written with fellow activists, notes that the movement’s demands may seem unrealistic – but that it is much more so to believe that our societies could survive the global heating and other disastrous ecological outcomes we are heading for: “The question is, will the changes be on our terms, or on nature’s terms?” they ask. Just over a decade ago, the UN secretary general and others urged a Green New Deal in response to the global financial crisis. The world missed that opportunity, and looks set to repeat its mistake. But the benefits of a drastic shift in priorities are clearer than ever: economists and health experts say that they would outweigh the costs. The World Economic Forum said last month that tackling what it calls the global nature crisis could create 400 million jobs and $10tn (£8tn) in business value each year by 2030 – while the current rate of destruction threatens half of global GDP. There is still time to act. Economic rescue packages are still being shaped; Berlin’s has shown what is possible. In the UK, coal’s role in power generation has slumped from almost 25% to 2% in just a few years, and the offshore wind industry is thriving. The ban on petrol and diesel cars slated for 2035 should be accelerated, and the installation of gas boilers outlawed. But above all, pandemic response spending must be directed to those parts of the economy that can reduce global heating, not worsen it."
"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria  —   In a   concrete house on the outskirts of this city along the airport road, Abdulrahman Adam’s    body trembled as he struggled to keep down what little food he had in him. At first, his grandmother, Hauwa Saleh, sitting by his side on the dusty floor, thought Abdulrahman was teething. But everything he ate came right back up. It continued for days in September and he added a cough and started to have diarrhea. By then, the signs were clear: It was not a simple illness. In this northeastern part of Nigeria ravaged by the terrorist group Boko Haram, where there is not enough food to go around and no one goes to bed full, Abdulrahman was withering away from malnutrition. Nearly everyone in his neighborhood, crumbling under the influx of refugees fleeing the Islamist rebels, is skin and bones, starving and slowly dying. Nearby in the house, his    mother, Iyatu Adam, seven months pregnant and weak, slipped in and out of consciousness, and could not help. She had not eaten enough, either. The boy’s father had left the capital of Borno State to find a job as a day laborer because there were few jobs in the city. His uncles worked all day laying bricks to earn $1 each. With no one else able to help, Abdulrahman’s survival depended on his    grandmother. Over the next 40 days, she took him to one public hospital and then another. Both denied him. There were no vacant hospital beds, they told her. An uncle spent $35  —   nearly a month’s pay  —   to pay for his admission to a private hospital for a few days. He received fluids and medication and was released. Back home, his grandmother continued to care for Abdulrahman. They shared the only mattress in the house with the other young siblings. Everyone else slept on the ground, a thin mat between them and the hard floor. The backyard was strewn with trash, a hole dug in the ground for a toilet. Ms. Saleh walked 600 feet to retrieve the family’s drinking water from a well and took home what she could carry in small containers. Abdulrahman ate what grains the family could afford, or what was left over after they paid their rent with their harvest of groundnuts and beans, or what scraps their neighbors gave them. But the family was careful not to eat too much for dinner. They had to save something for breakfast. By early November, Abdulrahman’s health had rapidly declined. He was always tired and had a fever, no appetite and a stiff neck  —   a sign of deadly meningitis. His mother, who was near full term, was no better. His grandmother rushed her grandson and her daughter again to a public hospital, Umaru Shehu Ultra Modern Hospital, praying that this time it had enough room for them. A part of the hospital with 24 beds that had opened only weeks earlier, and was operated by the relief organization International Rescue Committee, accepted them on Nov. 4. Abdulrahman was placed in a bed enclosed in a mosquito net, with other malnourished children nearby. About 200 children die every day in this area of Nigeria, the international group Save the Children reported in November. “Our true way of being was always associated with extreme hunger,” said Ms. Saleh, sitting on the concrete stoop at the house. She has been the head of the household since her husband died seven years ago. “Ever since, my struggle to provide the family began, because I was left with no option other than to work hard and see the children grow,” she said. At the hospital, the boy’s mother was taken to a separate area and received intravenous fluids and medication. Her health improved, and Ms. Adam gave birth to a girl, who was named after her grandmother. But Abdulrahman’s health deteriorated. He died on Nov. 15, another victim in a region plundered by Boko Haram rebels, who have destroyed houses and schools, kidnapped thousands of young women and forced millions to flee their homes, plunging Nigeria into the worst recession in decades. During its yearslong insurgency, Boko Haram stripped the area’s farmland dry, stealing crops in the country’s most fertile region to feed its fighters. Farmers fled, and many have not returned. The rebels have warned that they left behind mines on the fields. “We only need food, food, food, and nothing else,” Ms. Adam said in an interview in December. “Hunger nearly killed me. ” By December, the International Rescue Committee’s center in the hospital had treated 210 children with severe acute malnutrition.   had died. In the first 11 months of 2016, Borno State had nearly 75, 000 extremely malnourished children. The World Food Program has declared that the region, where millions lack sufficient food, is experiencing “faminelike conditions. ” “The need for stabilizing children with severe acute malnutrition with medical complications is high,” said Mohamed Kassim, the operations manager of the International Rescue Committee’s medical center in the city. The center is working this year to treat up to 60 malnourished children a month, an increase from 50 a month in 2016, he said. Founded in 1933 and based in New York City, the International Rescue Committee is the newest beneficiary organization supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Of the eight groups assisted by the fund, it is the only one that works beyond the New York region. In 2015, the organization helped over 23 million people affected by conflict and disaster in more than 40 countries and 26 cities in the United States, with a focus on health, education and economic  . In addition to its health center in the city, the core of humanitarian and military support in Borno, the International Rescue Committee provides food and hygiene supplies to residents, and offers services for   violence and therapy sessions. “This crisis is sorely underfunded and has largely been ignored by the international community, despite the extreme violence and clear evidence of crisis levels of food insecurity,” said Stephanie Puccetti, the organization’s senior emergency program coordinator in Nigeria. In the two months since Abdulrahman died, Ms. Saleh and her daughter have returned home to lives still filled with uncertainty and peril. Ms. Saleh, who earned $10 a month as a housekeeper for a family, has not worked since that family left town. The   job was grueling and the pay was only enough to cover the cost of the bus fare there and back, so she had started to walk the approximately six miles round trip to save some money. But it paid in other ways: The family gave her leftovers to take home. Her sons, after a day’s work of laying bricks, pool their $2 to buy food to bring home. Ms. Adam is eating more often, but not the nutritious food she needs while she nurses her newborn daughter, Ms. Saleh said. A few weeks ago, Ms. Adam’s husband sent $15 to her that he had made working in another city. It paid for food. “We have been praying that may God grant that we get out of this situation soon,” Ms. Saleh said. “And for now, it’s only prayer, prayer and prayer. ”"

 Guest essay by Robert Johnson

How plasma connects the Sun to the climate
The Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) are a plasma phenomenon caused by charged particles from the solar wind entering the Earth’s upper atmosphere. Magnetic storms in the ionosphere, which have occasionally damaged satellites in orbit, are also evidence that the Earth’s upper atmosphere is electromagnetically connected to the Sun via the plasma in interplanetary space.
It’s recently been recognised that the atmosphere below the ionosphere is also a weak plasma due to the ionisation caused primarily by cosmic rays. So it’s plasma all the way down! The weather regions are directly connected to the Sun; even the air we breathe is all part of the same system.
This talk at the recent SIS meeting introduces plasma to the general reader and investigates how it enables variations in the Sun’s output to directly influence the weather systems here on Earth.

"WASHINGTON  —   Travelers were stranded around the world, protests escalated in the United States and anxiety rose within President Trump’s party on Sunday as his order closing the nation to refugees and people from certain predominantly Muslim countries provoked a crisis just days into his administration. The White House pulled back on part of Mr. Trump’s temporary ban on visitors from seven countries by saying that it would not apply to those with green cards granting them permanent residence in the United States. By the end of the day, the Department of Homeland Security formally issued an order declaring such legal residents exempt from the order. But the recalibration did little to reassure critics at home or abroad who saw the president’s order as a retreat from traditional American values. European leaders denounced the order, and some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to back down. As of Sunday evening, officials said no one was being held at American airports, although lawyers said they believed that dozens were still being detained. More than any of the myriad moves Mr. Trump has made in his frenetic opening days in office, the immigration order has quickly come to define his emerging presidency as one driven by a desire for decisive action even at the expense of deliberate process or coalition building. It has thrust the    administration into its first constitutional conflict, as multiple courts have intervened to block aspects of the order, and into its broadest diplomatic incident, with overseas allies objecting. The White House was left to defend what seemed to many government veterans like a slapdash process. Aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had consulted for weeks with relevant officials, but the head of the customs and border service in the Obama administration, who resigned on inauguration day, said the incoming president’s team never talked with him about it. White House officials blamed what they portrayed as a hyperventilating news media for the confusion and said the order had been successfully carried out. Only about 109 travelers were detained in the first 24 hours, out of the 325, 000 who typically enter the United States in a day, they said. As of Sunday evening, the Department of Homeland Security said 392 green card holders had been granted waivers to enter. That did not count many visitors who remained overseas now unable to travel. Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Trump simply did what he had promised on the campaign trail and would not gamble with American lives. “We’re not willing to be wrong on this subject,” he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “President Trump is not willing to take chances on this subject. ” The order bars entry to refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days and from Syria indefinitely. It blocks any visitors for 90 days from seven designated countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the order would bar green card holders from those seven countries from returning to the United States. With thousands of protesters chanting outside his White House windows and thronging the streets of Washington and other cities, Mr. Trump late on Sunday defended his order. “To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,” he said in a written statement. “This is not about religion  —   this is about terror and keeping our country safe. ” He noted that the seven countries were identified by former President Barack Obama’s administration as sources of terrorism and that his order did not affect citizens from dozens of other predominantly Muslim countries. “We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days,” he said. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for victims of the   civil war in Syria. “I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria,” he said. “My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as president, I will find ways to help all those who are suffering. ” While Mr. Trump denied that his action focused on religion, the first iteration of his plan during his presidential campaign was framed as a temporary ban on all Muslim visitors. As late as Sunday morning, he made clear that his concern was for Christian refugees, and part of his order gives preferential treatment to Christians who try to enter the United States from   nations. In a Twitter post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump deplored the killing of Christians in the Middle East without noting the killings of Muslims, who have been killed in vastly greater numbers in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. “Christians in the Middle East have been executed in large numbers,” he wrote. “We cannot allow this horror to continue!” His order, however, resulted in a second day of uncertainty at American airports. The American Civil Liberties Union said it was investigating reports that officials were not complying with court orders in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Chicago. New York’s attorney general sent a letter to federal authorities demanding a list of all individuals detained at Kennedy International Airport. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday evening that it was “in compliance with judicial orders. ” Still, at Dulles International Airport outside Washington, even the arrival of four Democratic members of Congress did not prompt customs officers to acknowledge whether they were holding anyone or provide lawyers access to anyone detained. The lawmakers arrived after 3 p. m. and were rebuffed by police officers when they tried to enter the Customs and Border Protection offices at the airport. Representative Gerry Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, said he was told to call the main office of the agency in Washington. His staff got a legislative liaison from the customs service on the phone, and “they said we’ll put you in touch with the deputy commissioner,” Mr. Connolly said. “I said that’s not acceptable,” he continued. “We want to talk to the person in charge of operations at Dulles Airport. That’s where the problem is, and that’s where the federal judicial ruling is applicable. ” The clash over the order provoked emotional responses. At a news conference, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader from New York, choked up as he vowed to “claw, scrap and fight with every fiber of my being until these orders are overturned. ” The mayors of New York, Chicago and Boston spoke out, as well. In Dallas, Mayor Mike Rawlings personally offered regrets to four released detainees at   Worth Airport. “We have wished them welcome, and we have apologized from the depths of our heart,” he said. Chelsea Clinton joined a protest in New York. The order roiled relations with America’s traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East. The spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said she “is convinced that the resolute fight against terrorism does not justify blanket suspicion on grounds of origin or belief. ” Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who met with Mr. Trump in Washington on Friday and has sought to forge a friendship with him, initially declined to comment on the policy on Saturday when pressed by reporters during a stop in Turkey. But under pressure from opposition politicians, her spokesman later said the British government did “not agree with this kind of approach. ” The matter was especially sensitive in Muslim countries, and Mr. Trump spoke by telephone on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. White House statements on the calls said they discussed the fight against terrorism but did not say whether they discussed the immigration order, which did not include their countries. In Washington, protesters gathered by the thousands outside Mr. Trump’s front lawn to denounce his order and show solidarity with Muslim Americans. “Shame,” they chanted, hoisting homemade signs toward the executive mansion, where Mr. Trump was scheduled to host a private screening of the movie “Finding Dory. ” “No hate, no fear,” they added later. “Refugees are welcome here. ” Security fencing and reviewing stands still in place from the inauguration prevented the crowd from getting more than a couple hundred yards away from the building, but did not stop crowds from swelling through the afternoon, when protesters departed to march to Capitol Hill. Some Republicans grew increasingly alarmed by the backlash to the order. “This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,” Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement. “That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. ” Some conservative donors also criticized the decision. Officials with the political network overseen by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire conservative activists, released a statement on Sunday criticizing Mr. Trump’s handling of the issue. “We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families,” said Brian Hooks, a chairman of the Kochs’ donor network. “The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive. ” Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the order was “poorly implemented” and urged the president to “make appropriate revisions. ” Other Republicans were more circumspect. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, said the issue would be decided by the courts. Mr. Trump fired back at Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham on Twitter. “They are sadly weak on immigration,” he wrote. “Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III. ”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe more CO2-obsessed climate scientists deny the sun’s powerful role in driving climate, the more that other serious scientists are finding out that it is in fact truly The Dominant Player in climate.

The Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestial Physics here has a recent paper where scientists have found a “significant relation” between sunspots and El Niño Southern Oscillation.
Image source: here
This once again indicates that the sun indeed drives climate in a complex and interwoven variety of ways and that the belief that 100 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere is in the climate driver’s seat is astonishingly naive.

Unfortunately this paper was not mentioned by the main stream media, and likely will likely be ignored by the CO2-obsessed IPCC, as is the case with so many other papers.
Sincere thanks to reader Rick for bringing it to our attention.
The abstract follows (emphasis added):
The various techniques have been used to confer the existence of significant relations between the number of Sunspots and different terrestrial climate parameters such as rainfall, temperature, dewdrops, aerosol and ENSO etc. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can explore the information about the related variables. This study uses a Markov chain method to find the relations between monthly Sunspots and ENSO data of two epochs (1996–2009 and 1950–2014). Corresponding transition matrices of both data sets appear similar and it is qualitatively evaluated by high values of 2-dimensional correlation found between transition matrices of ENSO and Sunspots. The associated transition diagrams show that each state communicates with the others. Presence of stronger self-communication (between same states) confirms periodic behaviour among the states. Moreover, closeness found in the expected number of visits from one state to the other show the existence of a possible relation between Sunspots and ENSO data. Moreover, perfect validation of dependency and stationary tests endorses the applicability of the Markov chain analyses on Sunspots and ENSO data. This shows that a significant relation between Sunspots and ENSO data exists. Improved understanding and modelling of Sunspots variations can help to explore the information about the related variables. This study can be useful to explore the influence of ENSO related local climatic variability.
This is just the latest paper joining dozens of others showing that the sun is the earth’s only real climate engine.

"**The Ethiopian prime minister, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, has rejected a request for peace talks as the conflict in Tigray deepens.**
Tigray's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael, wrote to the African Union (AU) last week to request talks.
But PM Abiy Ahmed said in a tweet that there would be no dialogue ""until our efforts to ascertain the rule of law are achieved"".
Hundreds have died since the conflict in Ethiopia's northern region erupted.
Last Wednesday, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive after an army base in the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, was taken over by forces loyal to the regional government of Tigray, following months of worsening tension between Tigrayan leaders and the federal government.
On Friday Mr Debretsion wrote to the AU asking for help. The chairman of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, on Monday urged the federal government and the Tigray state authorities to engage in dialogue.
But on Tuesday Mr Ahmed said in a series of tweets that he wanted ""to assure Ethiopians again"" that there would be no dialogue until after rule of law was achieved.
He added: ""Our law enforcement operations in Tigray are proceeding as planned: operations will cease as soon as the criminal junta is disarmed, legitimate administration in the region restored, and fugitives apprehended & brought to justice - all of them rapidly coming within reach.""
In other developments:
It is difficult to say but reports indicate hundreds of deaths on both sides.
The national armed forces have killed 550 Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) fighters, the state broadcaster in Ethiopia has said.
The claim has not been independently verified.
In addition, government forces took control of Humera Airport in Tigray, state media reported on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, 17 military personnel, including senior officials, have been arrested, the federal police say.
They are accused of disrupting communications between the Northern Command and the rest of the national armed forces when the Northern Command was attacked last week.
Residents have fled Tigray.
Officials in Sudan, which shares a border with the Tigray region, say at least 6,000 Ethiopians have arrived in the country.
The Sudanese authorities are preparing for a further 200,000 people to cross in the coming days.
Al Sir Khalid, a commissioner for refugees in Sudan's Kassala state, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that some of those fleeing had walked for two or three days to escape ""bombardment"", and that they included Ethiopian soldiers.
The federal government has cut off the phone lines and internet, Alula Solomon, the director of a Tigray media house based in the US told BBC Newsday.
His family, who live in Tigray the border near Sudan, were able to contact him by using Sudanese telephone lines. They have now fled to Sudan.
On Tuesday, Mr Debretsion accused the neighbouring Eritrean government of launching attacks on the Tigrayan state.
The accusation was denied by both the Eritrean government and the Ethiopian national army.
Mr Abiy won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade conflict with Eritrea, which began when the TPLF dominated the Ethiopian government. Relations between the TPLF and Eritrea remain extremely bad.
The TPLF was the most powerful bit of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after winning power in 2018 on the back of anti-government protests.
Relations got worse last year after Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, which was made up of several ethnically based regional parties.
He merged them into a single, national party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption, and say Mr Abiy is an illegitimate leader, because his mandate ran out when he postponed national elections due to coronavirus.
The simmering row boiled over in September after the TPLF defied the nationwide ban on elections, and held a vote which was declared illegal by the central government.
Mr Abiy won the prize in 2019 for his role in resolving the border conflict with Eritrea.
Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a bitter border war from 1998-2000, which killed tens of thousands of people.
Although a ceasefire was signed in 2000, the neighbours technically remained at war until July 2018, when Mr Abiy and Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki signed a peace deal."

By guest writer Kenneth Richard
According to the below graph (Fig. 2 a) found in Gregory et al., 2013 in Journal of Climate (“Twentieth-Century Global-Mean Sea Level Rise: Is the Whole Greater than the Sum of the Parts?”), there was a very substantial increase in the glacier and ice sheet melt contribution to sea level rise in the early 20th century, reaching up to 2 mm/year sea level rise equivalent.

Source: Gregory et al., 2013 in Journal of Climate 
In recent years, the documented rise in sea levels contributed from glacier and ice sheet melt has not come close to reaching the high levels attained during the 1920s and 1930s period as documented by Gregory et al., 2013.
For example according to Shepherd et al., 2012 (see below), the total ice sheet melt contribution from the Antarctic (AIS) and Greenland (GIS) ice sheets combined was 0.59 mm/year (~2.3 inches per century) during the 1992-2011 period and the total ice sheet or glacier melt from all other land sources (not the AIS or GIS) was 0.41 mm/year (~1.6 inches per century) for 2003 to 2010 according to Jacob et al., 2012 (see below).
Together, the total melt contribution from global land ice was about 1 mm/year (~4 inches per century) through the first decade of the 21st century, which is still well below the melt rates achieved during the 1920s and 1930s.
Interestingly, during the 1920s to 1930s period of very high glacier melt rate contributions to sea level rise, human CO2 emissions were flat and only averaged about 1 GtC/year (see graph below).
In contrast, during the 1990s to 2010/2011 period, CO2 emissions rates reached 6 to 9 GtC/year.

Unanswered question
If anthropogenic CO2 emissions are truly driving ice sheet and glacier melt contributions to sea level rise, why was the melt contribution significantly higher during the 1920s and 1930s when CO2 emissions rates were flat and about 1/6th to 1/9th of what they’ve been in recent years?

"**Aid agencies are calling for an immediate temporary ceasefire in northern Ethiopia to allow aid to reach civilians affected by fighting.**
The UN wants humanitarian corridors set up after two weeks of conflict between Ethiopia's military and forces backing the leadership in the Tigray region.
Hundreds of people are reported to have been killed in the clashes.
On Friday Ethiopia's government said it had captured the city of Aksum and the town of Adwa.
The government said that forces battling its military in both areas had ""surrendered"".
However, the claims have not been independently verified and information is difficult to confirm because phone and internet connections have been down since the beginning of the conflict.
Aksum is one of the largest cities in the Tigray region and the mountainous town of Adwa is also considered strategically important.
Earlier this week, central government forces seized two other towns in Tigray - Shire and Raya - and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said his army was advancing on the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle.
Ethiopia has so far rejected calls for talks over the crisis, seeing its operation as internal ""law enforcement"".
The conflict is rooted in long-standing tension between powerful regional party the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and Ethiopia's central government.
When Mr Abiy postponed a national election due to coronavirus in June, tension escalated between the two sides. The TPLF sees the central government as illegitimate, arguing that Mr Abiy no longer has a mandate.
Aid agencies have no access to the conflict zone, but they fear that thousands of civilians may have been killed since fighting erupted at the beginning of November.
At least 33,000 refugees have already crossed Ethiopia's border into Sudan and the UN refugee agency has said it is preparing for up to 200,000 people to arrive over the next six months if the fighting continues.
On Friday, the TPLF was accused of firing rockets into the city of Bahir Dar in the neighbouring Amhara region. The Amhara government said there were no casualties and no damage caused.
But the reported incident in Amhara, which has a long-running border dispute with Tigray, has raised concerns that the conflict could extend into a wider war after regional forces were sent to support federal troops.
Meanwhile, the UN has raised concerns about the influx of refugees into Sudan, which it says could destabilise a nation already supporting about a million people displaced from other African countries.
The refugees arriving in Sudan, the majority of whom are believed to be children, are hungry and frightened, aid agencies say, and an immediate ceasefire would allow them to help thousands of civilians still trapped inside Ethiopia.
A researcher for the human rights organisation Amnesty International in Ethiopia, Fisseha Tekle, said the conflict must be conducted in accordance with international law, which requires the protection of civilians ""including access to humanitarian services"".
""As much as possible, human rights organisations, like Amnesty, should be given access to monitor the human rights situation,"" he said.
Aid agencies are appealing for $50m (Â£38m) for food and shelter for the new arrivals.
**1\. The Kingdom of Aksum was centred in the region.** Described as one of the greatest civilisations of the ancient world, it was once the most powerful state between the Roman and Persian empires.
**2\. The ruins of the city of Aksum are a UN World Heritage Site.** The site, dating from between the 1st and 13th Century AD, features obelisks, castles, royal tombs and a church which is believed by some to house the Ark of the Covenant.
**3\. Most people in Tigray are Ethiopian Orthodox Christians.** The region's Christian roots stretch back 1,600 years.
**4\. The region's main language is Tigrinya** , a Semitic dialect with at least seven million speakers worldwide.

"Flooding continues to afflict many parts of southern Britain. Areas of the Somerset Levels have been submerged for weeks, large parts of the Thames Valley are under water and the River Severn is bursting to the brink. The coasts of Cornwall and Wales have been battered by storms, and farmland and buildings have been flooded from the sea. This barrage of wet weather begs the question: is climate change to blame and what might we expect in the future?  The evidence that human activity is leading to an increase in global average temperature is extremely strong, and was presented most recently in the IPCC’s report published in September last year. However, it is not really fair to ask whether one individual event (or indeed season) was caused by climate change. A more appropriate question is whether the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has changed the risk of experiencing extreme events.  A gambling analogy illustrates this: if we throw a pair of sixes, we put this down to luck. If we then throw several pairs of sixes, we begin to believe that the dice are loaded. Climate change is loading the dice. Global average sea level rose approximately 19cm between 1901 and 2010, and around 5cm since 1993. It therefore takes less of a storm surge for coastal flooding to occur now than it did a few decades ago. Warmer air can hold more water, and across many parts of the world we have seen more heavy rain over the last few decades. The UK has had several bouts of serious flooding in the last few years – the floods of 2007 and 2012 come readily to mind – but the flooding this year appears to be more extensive, more extreme and to have lasted for longer than we’ve recently experienced. What is more uncertain, however, is the extent to which increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are leading to changes in the occurrence and intensity of storms. Most large scale flooding across the UK is primarily driven by prolonged and persistent rain coming – usually from the Atlantic – in a sequence of rain-bearing weather systems called depressions. We now know that such prolonged wet and stormy weather across the UK is strongly linked to the position and strength of the North Atlantic jet stream.  We in the UK are at the downstream wet end of the jet stream, and therefore very sensitive to how it varies from year to year. The North Atlantic Jet Stream has been very strong this year, which has been linked with unusually heavy rainfall over Indonesia, and the tropical western Pacific Ocean. But many different factors may also influence the jet stream. Weather in one part of the world can be strongly connected with what is happening elsewhere. Looking ahead, we expect sea level to carry on rising and heavy rainfalls to become even more frequent. Most projections of future climate across the UK suggest that we will experience wetter conditions in winter, and therefore that flood risk will continue. Because of our sensitivity to the position of the jet stream and the large variability from year to year, it is currently difficult to predict exactly how flood risk will change. However, we can be confident that relying on past experience and the historical record to estimate flood risk will probably lead us to underestimate our future exposure to flooding.  When the waters recede and we start to think about how to cope with future floods – as we clearly need to do – two things are necessary. First, we need to work out how to estimate what climate change might do to flood risk. This means we need to understand how different parts of the global weather system fit together – this is the subject of much new research. Second, we need to accept that we probably will not be able to estimate precisely how flood risk may change in the near future. The climate system is complex and requires that we develop ways of coping with risk that are flexible and adaptable – and which leave options open in the future."

Last month’s vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union gives control over trade policy back to British officials, who are now faced with the difficult task of creating new domestic institutions and formulating trade and other international economic policies. 



Some of their immediate work is obvious. The UK must negotiate a new economic relationship with Europe, both with the EU and with non‐​EU countries. The UK’s relationship with the EU could be along the lines of what Norway or Switzerland currently have with the EU, or it could be something less extensive, such as the trade agreement Canada and the EU have been negotiating. As to trade with the non‐​EU part of Europe, it makes sense for the UK to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) (it could even consider becoming part of EFTA). In addition, the UK will need to make a decision on whether to be part of the EU customs union, which will have a significant impact on how much control it has over its trade policy.



The UK must also restructure its relationship with its trading partners at the World Trade Organization (WTO). It was an original member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and remains a member of the WTO in its own right. However, as it subsumed its trade policy to that of the EU over the years, the EU took over negotiations on its behalf, and the UK’s WTO membership is now intertwined with that of the EU. The job of the UK trade negotiators is to disentangle themselves, and establish the UK as a fully independent member of the WTO.1



Beyond Europe and existing international institutions, the possibilities for UK trade policy are more open ended, with a great deal of discretion on future directions. Two big questions are: (1) How free‐​trade oriented will the UK be? And (2) how will the UK approach trade negotiations with countries outside Europe? This paper evaluates the UK’s options, and makes recommendations for how it should proceed.



The motivations for the UK leaving the EU were complex and varied, and many issues played a role. In the area of trade policy, it is difficult to discern a single view among those supporting Brexit. Some Leave proponents have hinted at protectionism, whereas others were strong free traders.



On the protectionist side, UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage noted that leaving the EU would offer greater protection against China’s dumping of steel. He also complained about EU procurement laws, stating: “Whether we are building a warship or whatever it is, under EU rules we have to tender this out to German companies and French companies as well.”2 On the free trade side, by contrast, economist Patrick Minford, a member of the Economists for Brexit group, argued for cutting import tariffs to zero immediately after the vote.3



So how will this conflict between supporters of the vote to leave the EU be resolved? There is a tradition of free trade within the UK. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 is still held out as one of the great examples of unilateral free trade. In today’s political climate, pure free trade of this sort is difficult to achieve. Nonetheless, hopefully the post‐​EU leaders of the UK will draw on the views of their ancestors, and try to keep the UK as a champion of free trade. When there are choices to be made as to whether to be protectionist or not, the UK should err on the side of openness and liberalization.



These days, however, free trade is largely an international issue. Governments negotiate mutual reductions in trade barriers, with international agreements to enforce their commitments. 



But there are many models for these negotiations, with different countries taking different views about what a trade agreement should involve. The UK has a blank slate in front of it and thus has many options available.4 The two most important questions for future UK trade agreements are: (1) With whom should the UK negotiate? And (2) what should it negotiate about?



As noted, the UK will be negotiating a new relationship with the EU and with other European neighbors. This is not in doubt. There are questions, though, about how the UK should select other trade negotiating partners.



To maximize the value of its initial trade negotiations, the UK should think about several factors: (1) Which countries have the most to offer in terms of a substantial economic relationship; (2) with which countries would the negotiations be the smoothest; and (3) which countries would involve the least external controversy in a trade negotiation.



To achieve the greatest economic gains, the UK should look for fairly large economies as negotiating partners, so as to maximize the impact of its initial negotiations.



To ensure a speedy and smooth negotiation, the UK should look for countries with whom it shares cultural ties and/​or political values. Trade negotiations often get bogged down in various disagreements. Having a good overall relationship can help minimize this.



And to minimize controversy, the UK should avoid, at least for its initial trade negotiations, trade agreements with large developing countries, whose cheap labor is seen by some as a threat. This is a political reality, rather than a rational economic assessment.



With this guidance in mind, and weighing and balancing all of these factors, the best candidates for the initial trade negotiations would be Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States; and perhaps developed countries such as South Korea and Japan. These countries maximize the potential value of an international economic agreements; the agreement could be done relatively quickly, and they would minimize any controversy. Of these countries, Australia and New Zealand are likely to be the ones most open to fully liberalized trade. Some of the others might resist full liberalization, but the size of their markets makes them important nonetheless.



With regard to developing countries, one possible exception to their initial exclusion would be a North Atlantic trade agreement that included Mexico in addition to Canada and the United States. But as a general matter, if the UK wants to complete trade agreements quickly and without controversy, large developing countries may have to wait a bit. China and India, for example, offer great possibilities. Unfortunately, negotiations with these countries will lead to objections from a range of groups.5



Perhaps the most important question for the UK in deciding on a new trade agreement policy is what to negotiate about. Ongoing trade negotiations such as the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the EU, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) have dragged on for years. The UK should try to avoid a process that takes five years or more. A quick agreement done in one or two years would be preferable.



To achieve this, the UK should consider a streamlined approach to negotiating trade agreements that focuses on core trade liberalization issues and leaves out the more complex and controversial regulatory and governance issues that have led to delays in other trade negotiations.



To get a sense of this, consider various chapters in the CETA. There are chapters on technical barriers to trade and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, which mostly duplicate what already exists at the WTO. There is a chapter on investment, even though investment barriers between Canada and the EU are limited. And the investor state dispute settlement mechanism engenders great controversy, without clear evidence that it actually encourages investment. There is a competition policy chapter that achieves very little. There is a chapter on intellectual property, even though the benefits of intellectual property protections that go further than what already exists are questionable, and including such chapters in trade agreements has been controversial. And there are chapters on sustainable development, labor, and the environment that stray far beyond trade liberalization.



Instead of the broad global economic governance agreements that have become the norm in the trade negotiating world, the UK should negotiate trade agreements that focus on trade liberalization. They should cover tariff reductions, services liberalization, and opening procurement markets. There should also be a placeholder for negotiating future mutual recognition agreements for trade in specific goods and services.



With regard to tariffs, the UK should be bold and propose zero tariffs on all products. Trade negotiations can get bogged down in balancing out the demands from each side for continued tariff protection and in determining how long phase‐​out periods should be. However, the simplest and most beneficial tariff policy is to remove all tariffs as quickly as possible. Certain trading partners may resist, but UK trade negotiators should take zero tariffs as the starting point. If the UK is willing to eliminate all of its tariffs, it sends the right message about its seriousness in the negotiations and will, hopefully, lead to trading partners reciprocating with zero tariffs of their own.



Services are traded differently than goods, and the barriers tend to be regulatory in nature. That makes services negotiations inherently more controversial than simple tariff lowering. With services trade, the UK should focus on particular areas that are less sensitive. As an example of a controversial sector, the TTIP negotiations have been undermined by concerns that the UK’s National Health Service could be subject to challenge by U.S. healthcare companies. The UK should make clear at the outset that regulations and policies such as this are not going to be covered by a trade negotiation (although domestic reform of the National Health Service would be welcome). It needs to establish general principles and specific rules that leave no doubt about this.



A cross‐​cutting area, which covers both trade in goods and services, is government procurement. Many trade agreements in the past have been successful in opening procurement markets to competition from foreign providers. The UK should also push hard in these negotiations to open its market and those of its trading partners.



Beyond these core issues, there is the potential for mutual recognition of domestic regulations related to product standards and services qualifications, under which goods and services that satisfy the regulations of one country are deemed to satisfy those of other countries as well. But trying to negotiate these issues comprehensively has proved extremely controversial in the TTIP context, and is unlikely to have greater success in UK trade negotiations. Instead, the agreements should merely refer to the possibility of future discussions on specific products and services, and leave this issue for a later date.



By keeping trade negotiations simple and focused in the ways described above, the UK can push quickly for significant trade liberalization, without the process getting bogged down, either during the negotiations or subsequently with the domestic ratification.



One final area where the UK has an opportunity to be bold is trade remedies, which covers antidumping, countervailing duties, and safeguards. Ideally, the UK would use these measures in a very limited manner, or even not at all, as part of its domestic trade regime. But practically speaking, these trade measures are a core part of today’s trade policy world, and it is unlikely the UK will abandon them.



However, what is possible is that, for its trade relations with close trading partners, the UK might consider a mutual decision not to apply trade remedies. There is precedent for this in various free trade agreements, such as the Australia‐​New Zealand Closer Economic Relations agreement, in which Australia and New Zealand agreed not to apply antidumping duties against each other.6 Anti‐​dumping laws are a particular problem in trade relations, and have been criticized for their lack of economic justification.7 The negotiation of new UK trade agreements provides an opportunity for reform, as allegations of “dumping” often focus on competition with cheap labor in developing countries. With trading partners who are at similar development levels, it may be possible to escape the usual arguments about fear of low‐​priced products.



With regard to the potential trading partners mentioned above, the United States is the least likely to agree to such a proposal. However, as noted, Australia and New Zealand have already agreed to this between themselves. And Japan was traditionally only a limited user of trade remedies (although it has increased its use in recent years). Thus, there is a chance that if the UK proposed the elimination of one or more trade remedies, some of these countries might agree.



The UK faces some difficult tasks in terms of formulating a new trade policy. First of all, it needs to hire trade negotiators. While there are some UK government officials who have expertise in this area, this type of work has been largely farmed out to European officials for decades. The UK needs to start from scratch to a great extent, which could slow down its progress.



But it will put a team in place eventually, and that team will be faced with many difficult choices. In this short paper, I have tried to kick off the debate by suggesting some general ideas for how the UK might approach the negotiation of trade treaties in a manner that draws on its tradition of free trade. In the coming months and years, after the UK sorts out its trade relationship with the EU and takes back competence over trade policy,8 the specific details will continue to be fleshed out.

"I know a stiff wind. They call this place Storm Lake, after all. But until recently most Iowans had never heard of a “derecho”. They have now. Last Monday, a derecho tore 770 miles from Nebraska to Indiana and left a path of destruction up to 50 miles wide over 10m acres of prime cropland. It blew 113 miles per hour at the Quad Cities on the Mississippi River.  Grain bins were crumpled like aluminum foil. Three hundred thousand people remained without power in Iowa and Illinois on Friday. Cedar Rapids and Iowa City were devastated. The corn lay flat. Iowa’s maize yield may be cut in half. A little napkin ciphering tells me the Tall Corn State will lose $6bn from crop damage alone. We should get used to it. Extreme weather is the new normal. Last year, the villages of Hamburg and Pacific Junction, Iowa, were washed down the Missouri River from epic floods that scoured tens of thousands of acres. This year, the Great Plains are burning up from drought. Western Iowa was steeped in severe drought when those straight-line winds barreled through the weak stalks. A multi-decade drought is under way in the Central Plains and the south-west. Wildfires are spreading from Arizona to California, and are burning ridges north of Los Angeles not licked by flames since 1968. Cattle in huge Kansas, Texas and Oklahoma feedlots will drink the Ogallala Aquifer dry in 20 years. This drought, which could rival or exceed the Medieval Drought that occurred about AD1200, could last 30 to 50 years, according to research from the Goddard Space Institute. It will become difficult to grow corn in southern Iowa, and impossible in western Kansas. By mid-century, corn yields could decline by 30%, according to the Iowa State University climatologist Dr Gene Takle. Takle notes that the 20th century was the wettest on record. This could be the driest. “The last century was our Goldilocks period,” Takle said. “Just right. And that period is coming to an end.” We have cyclone bombs in winter and derechos on top of tornadoes. We have 500-year floods every 10 years. And we have a steady increase in night-time temperatures and humidity that makes it difficult for the corn to breathe even with the latest in genetic engineering. Protein content in the kernel is falling. Livestock and plants fall prey to new diseases and pests along with extreme heat stress. It will lead to a reckoning more quickly than most of us realize. The pandemic exposed the fragility of the food supply when meat processing plants teetered last spring for lack of healthy workers. Prices shot up 50% at the grocery counter. Farmers didn’t share in that windfall. Corn prices are at a 10-year low in a broken industrial system propped up by government design. When Takle was a teenager, baling hay in 1960, there were 18-20 days a year when the temperature would get above 90 degrees. By the end of the century, Takle warns, this region could be scorched by temperatures over 100 degrees 50 to 60 days a year. Soil that can hold water and defy heat is losing that capacity to erosion driven by extreme rains. Poor soil, combined with the extreme heat Takle describes, assures crop failures. Takle said corn crops could fail every other year if we go on with “business as usual” pumping out carbon. It’s already happening in Latin America. Decades of drought are driving Guatemalan campesino refugees to Storm Lake to work in meatpacking. Similarly, epic migrations were driven by the Medieval Drought. It is believed that the Mill Creek people who settled here were driven north up the Missouri River to the Dakotas as they were droughted out of Iowa. That drought also led to wars in Europe, not unlike the contemporary conflicts and migrations in Africa whose roots are in failing agricultural and food systems. The impacts of climate change are real and profound for our most basic industry: food. Fortunately, sound science tells us that we can make a real impact on climate change by planting less corn and more grass that sequesters carbon. Paying farmers to build soil health and retain water is a better investment than writing a crop insurance check for drought. Farmers on the frontlines of climate change are trying to become more resilient to extreme weather by planting permanent grass strips in crop fields, and planting cover crops for the winter that suck up nitrogen and CO2. The rate of adaptation would be quickened if conservation funding programs were not always under attack. The derecho is yet another destructive reminder that heat leading to extreme storms will destroy our very food sources if we don’t face the climate crisis now.

"Dear Nigel, I was concerned for you on the news the other night. I’ve never seen you looking uncomfortable in front of the camera before. Answering questions about climate change with water all around you left you short of breath and a bit panicky, I thought. A pint in your hand would have helped settle the nerves. I’ll buy you one – it would give me a chance to talk through a couple of things (I’m with you on the straight glass thing by the way). You said to the journalist: “I have no idea whether CO2 emissions are contributing to climate change.” Well, I’m an academic at the Open University, a social scientist working with climate scientists and technology specialists, so I can help you with that one. In the mid 1980s it was agreed by governments and the top science institutions around the world that humans might cause changes to the climate, and that we’d better look into it. That’s when the IPCC was born: a panel of top scientists conducting a massive review of all the relevant science. The first report said that some uncertainties would decrease over time and some would increase. For sure some uncertainties have increased. But they have got much more confident about the role of humans in climate change with every report. But this is difficult stuff to hear when everything we do seems to depend on fossil fuels. The result has been that many people with an interest have turned climate change into a truth war. Personally I find it much more helpful to instead think of climate science as a risk assessment, and climate policy as risk management. No sides, or battles, just different appetites for risk. The IPCC risk assessment came in years ago, with absolute clarity: the message was that we shouldn’t risk the future for the sake of cheap oil and coal. But you might say I’m missing your point: many opposed to climate change action, but who accept some of the basics of the science, say the cure is worse than the disease, right? Wrong. Board members of some of Britain’s biggest companies, including car manufacturing, consumer goods, energy and water industries, can point to no-regrets tech progress their companies have made in key sectors, driven by commitments to act on climate change and pursue resource efficiency. They’re delivering better products to consumers, reducing bills and gaining market share. They’re fitter to compete globally too. You and I also care about the quality of everyday life for those oft-mentioned but oft-neglected hardworking ordinary British people. But again I think you’ve got the wrong end of the stick. Things like green transport and housing policies can help to make people healthier, happier and richer across a lifetime, and reduce tax burdens around health care and welfare. The T-shirt version: climate action = better lives, lower taxes. So long as the policy people start early and learn as they go. But what if the IPCC is wrong? What if the maverick naysayers are on the nail? The most convincing (to me) climate contrarian arguments are rooted in the idea that we’ll “get lucky”. In other words, that climate sensitivity will be at the lowest end of the range of scenarios. This line is nicely summarised by the climate contrarian’s mascot scientist Richard Lindzen in his contribution to the UK House of Commons Climate Change Committee hearing on the IPCC’s latest report: “It is entirely possible there is no problem.” But, luck. Chance. Optimism. Hope. A bet. A gamble. A roll of the dice. How did that go with banking? Yes. It is entirely possible that there is no problem, but almost all the good evidence available to me points in another direction. Happily most of the things that are likely to be required can, if well thought through, carry some huge benefits to honest hard working British people and British businesses. Let’s have that pint. Straight glasses. Cask ale. And talk more about the weather. Yours, Joe PS: The next time TV journalists do that thing where they make you stand in a flooded street and ask you about climate change you can say the IPCC would stress that the capacity to directly attribute extreme weather events directly to climate change is years away, if it’s even possible. But if you do borrow that line of argument do please promise to read some of the other things they’ve got to say."
"**After being ensconced in power in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region for nearly three decades, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) could be preparing to return to the mountains to launch a guerrilla war against the federal government.**
But the Ethiopian military believes that it can prevent this from happening through the offensive it launched on 4 November to oust the TPLF and arrest more than 70 of its leaders and military officers.
They include veterans of the 17-year guerrilla war that led to the TPLF seizing power in the federal capital, Addis Ababa, in 1991 and who then controlled the country's military and intelligence services until Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed purged them when he took office in 2018. He accused them of being repressive and corrupt - charges they deny.
Having retreated to their strongholds in Tigray while Mr Abiy established his control over the rest of Ethiopia, earlier this month they seized control of a key federal military base - which is part of the Northern Command - located near Tigray's capital, Mekelle, apparently without much resistance.
The International Crisis Group (ICG), a non-governmental organisation which focuses on conflict-prevention, described it as the federal military's largest regional military command.
The TPLF seized an array of weapons, including rockets and missiles, though the Ethiopian military still has considerable air power, including fighter jets and helicopter gunships.
Their operation came after Mr Abiy's government decided to redirect funding away from the Tigray leadership, accusing them of holding an ""illegal"" election for the regional legislature in September, rather than abiding by a federal decision to postpone all polls because of coronavirus.
TPLF officials say they took the parts of the Northern Command because they believed that federal intervention was imminent. Mr Abiy responded by accusing the TPLF of crossing the ""final red line"", and ordered air strikes and the deployment of troops to Tigray.
Twenty-two days into the conflict, Mr Abiy says the army is now launching the ""final phase"" of its operation in Tigray to take control of Mekelle, which will be over in the ""coming days"".
But TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael has been defiant, telling AFP earlier in the week: ""We are people of principle and ready to die in defence of our right to administer our region.""
ICG Ethiopia analyst William Davison says the TPLF may be able to call on more than 200,000 fighters - from militias in villages to special forces in the regional government.
""Because of the changed political dynamics over the last two years, there has been significant recruitment and training in Tigray,"" he told the BBC.
The ICG does not give an estimate of the strength of the Ethiopian military, but Reuters news agency quotes the Janes security data group as saying that it has around 140,000 active personnel, most of them in the army.
If these estimates are correct, the Ethiopian military may have fewer soldiers than the TPLF, but it can bolster its numbers by drawing on the special forces of other regional governments - Ethiopian law allows each of them to have these paramilitary units to provide security within their territory.
Significantly, special forces from the Amhara regional government - which has a long-running land dispute with Tigray - helped federal troops secure territory in western Tigray when the conflict started.
""In the west, joint federal and Amhara control may be more established because those forces outnumbered and overpowered local Tigray forces,"" said Mr Davison.
""There are also more flat areas in the west, giving a conventional army more advantage,"" he said, adding that this was unlike the terrain in the ""core"" of Tigray, around cities in the east, like Mekelle, where it was rugged and mountainous, making it more conducive for guerrilla warfare.
Arhe Hamednaca, who took part in guerrilla wars against previous Ethiopian governments and went on to become an MP in Sweden, said the offensive in the west had also been aimed at securing the border with Sudan.
He said this was vital - to prevent the TPLF from setting up bases there as it had done when it fought the Marxist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam 29 years ago.
""The only way for the TPLF to escape and to get fresh supplies is through Sudan,"" he said.
Furthermore, there is also no outlet to the Red Sea through Eritrea, as there was in the 1980s, when Eritrea forces were allied with the TPLF against Mengistu.
Prime Minister Abiy has become a staunch ally of Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki, who fought a bitter border war with the Ethiopia, when it was under TPLF control.
""Times have changed. The TPLF's supply routes are not flowing, and to its north is President Isaias Afwerki's Eritrea, its principle enemy,"" BBC Tigrinya editor Samuel Ghebhrehiwet said.
Several sources in Eritrea have told the BBC that Ethiopian troops have been crossing the border to regroup and to treat their wounded in military hospitals - though both governments deny Eritrean involvement in the Tigrayan conflict.
""Tigray is blockaded. The TPLF cannot sustain a conventional war,"" Mr Davison said.
But that doesn't necessarily mean that federal forces will have the quick victory they hope for.
Mr Arhe notes that there are numerous examples of guerrilla fighters taking on better armed opponents.
""The Americans had all sorts of drones and fighter jets in Afghanistan, but the Taliban survived,"" he said.
""The Houthi rebels in Yemen have survived UAE and Saudi weapon superiority.""
Mr Davison said that while federal troops were advancing towards Mekelle, it was unclear how many towns and cities they had actually taken control of along the way and how many they had just passed through.
Either way, many Tigrayan fighters may eventually retreat to villages and surrounding mountains to prepare for a guerrilla war that could receive significant public support, he added.
""Though federal officials claim the opposite, many Tigrayans seem to oppose the intervention because they believe it is to remove a legitimately elected regional government,"" Mr Davison said.
Moreover, they generally support the federal system that the TPLF helped introduced after it took power in Addis Ababa in 1991, as the best way to protect their political, linguistic and cultural rights, he added.
In contrast, the TPLF accuses Mr Abiy of trying to establish a more unitary type of government.
The BBC's Tigrinya editor says that while a surge in Tigrayan nationalism could work in the TPLF's favour, the possibility that many people may instead back the federal government cannot be ruled out.
""During the armed struggle [against Mengistu], the people of Tigray were fully behind the fighters. But in the nearly three decades that the TPLF has been in power, many Tigrayans objected to the leadership because of systemic corruption and oppression,"" Mr Samuel said.
He believes that the outcome of the battle for Mekelle will determine whether or not the TPLF can wage a guerrilla war, but even if the Ethiopian military gains the upper hand, he does not envisage the conflict ending without proper negotiations between the different sides."

Nothing is more dangerous than bad science driven by arrogance. Readers here are very much aware of this when it comes to climate science. Yet, as surprising as it may sound, the problem of junk science is even far worse in the field of Nutrition.
Book (right) available at Amazon.
Recently I read a book written by Dr. Weston Price, published in 1938 – almost 80 years ago: Nutrition and Physical Degeneration.
Weston Price was an American dentist who had been shocked by the wave of physical degeneration he observed among patients, who suffered tremendously from caries and facial deformities, along with the number of crippling diseases that seemed to accompany it.
To find out what was happening, he journeyed to many remote regions across the globe to study “primitive” tribes and people who were still isolated from “modern” living. What he found was stunning and revealing: These people were in tremendous physical and mental condition. He observed that physical degeneration had little to do with genetics, was mostly nutrition-based, and that it took only one generation to turn a physically superior community of people into a health and societal basket case.
He journeyed to isolated areas of the globe where the so-called “primitive” people relied on their own local natural food sources and customs for nourishment and health. Their practices had been perfected over generations. Price examined tens of thousands of teeth, facial forms, dental arches of not only living persons, but also of exhumed skulls. He found near dental perfection and few modern diseases among them. Health was at an impeccable level.
No matter if it was a community in Switzerland or Polynesians in the South Pacific, those who relied on their traditional food staples were in a state of excellent health and near physical perfection.
Throughout the book Price describes natives of great physical strength, well-being, keen intelligence and near zero crime rates within their communities. Cancer, heart disease and metabolic syndrome – our modern diseases – were almost non-existent.  But as soon as these peoples and tribes came into contact with western “modern” nutrition, their health deteriorated rapidly and dramatically.
What follow are sample photos of what Dr. Price typically found. It did not matter where or what race he examined. They were all healthy and shared a common denominator: excellent animal-based nutrition.

Isolated communities living on “primitive” diets had near perfect health. Rates of caries were close to zero. Shown above is a sample of people from various locations around the globe. Modern diseases were rare. Photos: Weston Price Foundation
It was only when the “modern” western foods of “civilization” – comprising in large part sugar, white flour, syrups, polished rice and canned goods – were introduced by the whites did a profound and rapid deterioration in the health of these isolated tribes and groups take place.
Price often observed parents of superior physique, facial form and dental health –  but whose children had been ravaged by caries, deformed dental arches and poor health because they had switched to the “modern foods”.
As was common back in the early 20th century, “experts” often blamed the facial deformities and poor health on race mixing. Another scientific debacle.

What follows is a table showing a selection of isolated, “primitive” tribes and peoples that Price studied, and who had robust physiques and health. Note the very low rates of caries – all without the need for “modern” dentistry.


The above table is just a sampling of many tribes and peoples Price studied.
But once the modern western foods were introduced, many of these healthy societies literally collapsed. What the diseases of the encroaching “modern” civilization didn’t kill off, the newly introduced “modern” foods did the rest, laying many of these once healthy societies to waste.
When we look at the above tables, it is clear that one thing stands out: The common food staples necessary for good health are in large part made up of natural, animal-based foods such as fish, shellfish, organ meat, animal fat, dairy, vegetables, plant life, insects and some fruit.
In short: their diets were as remote of a vegan or vegetarian diet as one could possibly get. Price writes that many of these tribes and peoples also had advanced medical, veterinary and engineering skills, which also were lost since the invasion of “modern” junk food.
The key component to these healthy individuals was animal product. Price confirmed it in his book.
Western society is deep in the Nutrition Dark Ages
It becomes clear that our modern nutrition has completely diverged from what the human species was originally designed to consume. Worse, it is evident that modern nutrition risks diverging even further away as junk diet fads such as veganism are being promoted as the way to health. Here many greens are unwittingly advocating the worst of both worlds.
The truth today, as Price reveals, is that our modern society is deep in the Dark Ages of Nutrition and it’s going to take a lot of time, effort, education and resources to crawl back out of that abysmal pit. Unfortunately many more tens of millions in western society will further suffer from the ravages of our “modern” food before things get better. The burden risks collapsing our entire society if something is not done soon.
Of course no one advocates returning to “primitive” life standards. But why isn’t it possible to integrate the advanced nutrition of these isolated natives with our modern society?
Today tens of millions are suffering and dying from metabolic syndrome and its related diseases. Hundreds of millions more are at high risk. It is one of the great scientific catastrophes of human history.
What is needed is a Nutrition Renaissance – and quickly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeorg Etscheit at the climate alarmist Klimaretter here whines about the Greens in Munich setting a poor example when it comes to (ab)using jet-fuel burning commercial airlines.
This reminds us of serial private jet flier Leonardo DiCaprio, who took his private jet 12,000 kilometers and burned 30,000 liters of jet fuel to pick up an environment award.
Munich Green official took airliner to attend “bicycle traffic conference”. Public domain photo.
It turns out that in the Bavarian capital city of Munich the opposition Greens were looking for a way to create an issue with which to put the ruling socialist-conservative coalition administration on the defensive, and so they sent a query to the city government demanding to know who abused (ab)used commercial flights the most. They hoped to place the blame for damaging to the environment squarely on those responsible. Before 2014, Munich was governed by a SPD socialist/Green coalition. Since then it has been governed by an SPD (socialist)/CSU (Christian conservative) coalition.
Surely the recent government must be abusing air travel and irresponsibly damaging the environment.
Hat-tip: Die kalte Sonne.
Fliegen für mich, nicht für dich
It turns out the opposition Greens should have never posed the question. The answer came back from the Munich city administration, and it is truly embarrassing for them. According to Etscheit:

It’s the Greens. By a wide margin who fly the most often, more often than members of the other political fractions. According to the SZ [Süddeutscheteitung] 23 flights were logged by the Greens, while the members of the SPD party, which is twice the size, flew half the number [12], the CSU even less [6].”
Etscheit bemoans that this is in line with a 2014 survey conducted by news weekly Der Spiegel, which found that greens are “passionate fliers”. I wrote on this here, whereby a reliable survey found that:
…Green Party voters fly the most: 49% have flown at least once in the past 12 months. They were followed by the communist Die Linke (42%), the conservatives CDU (36%) and lastly by the socialists SPD (32%).”
That’s remarkable behavior given that the Greens are the most vocal when it comes to protesting airport expansions or nighttime landings and takeoffs. They loudly protest such projects, but then end up being the ones using them the most.
Air travel to a “bicycle traffic conference”
The Munich Greens write here that they were surprised to discover that they are the biggest abusers of air travel, despite being a comparatively small party.
But they had good reasons, blaming: “inconvenient connections”, and official business such as being the only party to send an official to attend “Kiev Pride”, or to participate at a “bicycle traffic conference” in Rostock, or to visit a day-conference in Venice.
So why is it that Greens in general are most often involved in widespread (ab)use of the commercial airlines? Etscheit writes it is because they tend to be high income earners.

From Oregon State University and the department of “we fully understand Earth’s climate, we just need more funds” department comes this bit of a surprise. (h/t to Dr. Leif Svalgaard)
Researchers find 200-year lag between climate events in Greenland, Antarctica

CORVALLIS, Ore. – A new study using evidence from a highly detailed ice core from West Antarctica shows a consistent link between abrupt temperature changes on Greenland and Antarctica during the last ice age, giving scientists a clearer picture of the link between climate in the northern and southern hemispheres.
Greenland climate during the last ice age was very unstable, the researchers say, characterized by a number of large, abrupt changes in mean annual temperature that each occurred within several decades. These so-called “Dansgaard-Oeschger events” took place every few thousand years during the last ice age. Temperature changes in Antarctica showed an opposite pattern, with Antarctica cooling when Greenland was warm, and vice versa.
In this study funded by the National Science Foundation and published this week in the journal Nature, the researchers discovered that the abrupt climates changes show up first in Greenland, with the response to the Antarctic climate delayed by about 200 years. The researchers documented 18 abrupt climate events during the past 68,000 years.
“The fact that temperature changes are opposite at the two poles suggests that there is a redistribution of heat going on between the hemispheres,” said Christo Buizert, a post-doctoral research at Oregon State University and lead author on the study. “We still don’t know what caused these past shifts, but understanding their timing gives us important clues about the underlying mechanisms.
“The 200-year lag that we observe certainly hints at an oceanic mechanism,” Buizert added. “If the climatic changes were propagated by the atmosphere, the Antarctic response would have occurred in a matter of years or decades, not two centuries. The ocean is large and sluggish, thus the 200-year time lag is a pretty clear fingerprint of the ocean’s involvement.”
These past episodes of climate change differ in a major way from what is happening today, the researchers note. The abrupt events of the ice age were regional in scope – and likely tied to large-scale changes in ocean circulation. Warming today is global and primarily from human carbon dioxide emissions in the Earth’s atmosphere.
The key to the discovery was the analysis of a new ice core from West Antarctica, drilled to a depth of 3,405 meters in 2011 and spanning the last 68,000 years, according to Oregon State paleoclimatologist Edward Brook, a co-author on the Nature study and an internationally recognized ice core expert.
Because the area where the ice core was drilled gets high annual snowfall, Brook said, the new ice core provides one of the most detailed records of Antarctic temperatures at a very high resolution. Greenland temperatures were already well-established, the researchers say, because of high annual snowfall and more available ice core data.
“Past ice core studies did not reveal the temperature changes as clearly as this remarkable core,” said Eric Steig, a professor in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington, who co-wrote the paper. Steig’s laboratory made one of the key measurements that provides past Antarctic temperatures.
“Previous work was not precise enough to determine the relative timing of abrupt climate change in Antarctica and Greenland, and so it was unclear which happened first,” Steig noted. “Our new results show unambiguously that the Antarctic changes happen after the rapid temperature changes in Greenland. It is a major advance to know that the Earth behaves in this particular way.”
Kendrick Taylor, chief scientist on the project, said the core enabled the research team to get the relative timing of Greenland and Antarctic temperatures down to several decades.
“We needed a climate record from the Southern Hemisphere that extended at least 60,000 years into the past and was able to resolve fast changes in climate,” said Taylor, from the Desert Research Institute in Nevada. “We considered sites all over Antarctica before selecting the site with the best combination of thick ice, simple ice flow and the right amount of annual snowfall.”
Taylor and colleagues formed a science and engineering team consisting of 28 laboratories from around the United States. “The resulting information provides unprecedented detail about many aspects of the Earth’s past climate,” Taylor said. “This will provide a generation of climate researchers a way to test and improve our understanding of how and why global climate changes.”
OSU’s Buizert said it is “very likely” that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, is involved in these abrupt climate reversals.
“This ocean circulation brings warm surface waters from the tropics to the North Atlantic,” said Buizert, who is in OSU’s College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences. “As these water masses cool, they sink to the bottom off the ocean. This happens right off the coast of Greenland, and therefore Greenland is located in a sweet spot where the climate is very sensitive to changes in the AMOC.”
Brook said the AMOC seems to be critical, but was probably part of a combination of factors that ultimately controlled these past abrupt changes.
“Although ocean circulation may be the key, there are probably other feedbacks involved, such as the rise and fall of sea ice and changes in ice and snow cover on land,” Brook said. “There is probably some kind of threshold in the system – say, in the salinity of the surface ocean – that triggers temperature reversals.
“It’s not a problem to find potential mechanisms; it’s just a question of figuring out which one is right. And the precise timing of these events, like we describe in this study, is an important part of the puzzle.”

The paper:


Precise interpolar phasing of abrupt climate change during the last ice age


Nature 520,661–665(30 April 2015) doi:10.1038/nature14401









The last glacial period exhibited abrupt Dansgaard–Oeschger climatic oscillations, evidence of which is preserved in a variety of Northern Hemisphere palaeoclimate archives1. Ice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the warm phases of the Greenland Dansgaard–Oeschger cycle and vice versa2, 3, suggesting an interhemispheric redistribution of heat through a mechanism called the bipolar seesaw4, 5, 6. Variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength are thought to have been important, but much uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics and trigger of these abrupt events7, 8, 9. Key information is contained in the relative phasing of hemispheric climate variations, yet the large, poorly constrained difference between gas age and ice age and the relatively low resolution of methane records from Antarctic ice cores have so far precluded methane-based synchronization at the required sub-centennial precision2, 3, 10. Here we use a recently drilled high-accumulation Antarctic ice core to show that, on average, abrupt Greenland warming leads the corresponding Antarctic cooling onset by 218 ± 92 years (2σ) for Dansgaard–Oeschger events, including the Bølling event; Greenland cooling leads the corresponding onset of Antarctic warming by 208 ± 96 years. Our results demonstrate a north-to-south directionality of the abrupt climatic signal, which is propagated to the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes by oceanic rather than atmospheric processes. The similar interpolar phasing of warming and cooling transitions suggests that the transfer time of the climatic signal is independent of the AMOC background state. Our findings confirm a central role for ocean circulation in the bipolar seesaw and provide clear criteria for assessing hypotheses and model simulations of Dansgaard–Oeschger dynamics.

 _These lawyers and men of learning, and moneyed men that talk so finely, and gloss over matters so smoothly, to make us, poor illiterate people, swallow down the pill, expect to get into Congress themselves; they expect to be the managers of this Constitution, and get all the power and all the money into their own hands, and then they will swallow up all us little folks, like the great Leviathan…yes, just as the whale swallowed up Jonah._



— Amos Singletary, delegate from Worcester County at the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention, January 25, 1788



In October 1787, only a month after the Constitutional Convention ended its deliberations and sent the finished Constitution to the states for ratification, Robert Yates, a judge from upstate New York, penned a prescient essay arguing against ratifying the Constitution. Yates worried the proposed constitution would create a government unaccountable to the people and that those in power would use it for the “purposes of gratifying their own interest and ambition.” “It is scarcely possible,” Yates wrote, “in a very large republic, to call them to account for their misconduct, or to prevent their abuse of power.”



Yates was an Anti‐​Federalist, the name given to opponents of ratifying the Constitution. History is written by the winners, the saying goes, so nowadays the Anti‐​Federalists are taught as a footnote in junior high American history class. Given our national reverence for the Constitution, they’re remembered as opponents to progress, as enemies to a government ordained and established by the people. At worst they’re considered knuckle‐​dragging philistines who allowed their parochial concerns about states’ powers to trump the good of the nation. They’re the Pharisees of our political religion.



But the Anti‐​Federalists are always with us, if in spirit rather than name, and we ignore them at our own peril. Country judges who complain about the highfalutin ways “back East,” populist governors who rail against the temerity of an overweening federal government, and the millions of people who just want to be left alone by Washington are all examples of the Anti‐​Federalist impulse. Sometimes that political impulse sits in the background of the American political conversation, and sometimes it becomes the most popular show in town.





Cato’s annual Constitution Day symposium marks the day in 1787 that the Constitutional Convention finished drafting the U.S. Constitution. We celebrate that event each year with the release of the new issue of the _Cato Supreme Court Review_ and with a day‐​long symposium featuring noted scholars discussing the recently concluded Supreme Court term and the important cases coming up.



This crazy election year, the wispy‐​haired, demagogic blowhards who came to prominence on both the left and the right—inciting the people against “the establishment,” attacking banks and Wall Street (i.e. “stockjobbers”), and generally calling the entire government stupid and disconnected from the average man—carry the Anti‐​Federalist impulse in their veins. When the political establishment ignores Anti‐​Federalist sentiments for too long, it can rise up and take over, which is partially what happened during the long, surreal election of 2016.



The Anti‐​Federalists taught us valuable lessons about good government that have always been relevant and will never go away.



 **What the Anti‐​Federalist Got Right**



The original Anti‐​Federalists were wrong on many things—the federal government, for example, did not obliterate and override states’ powers to tax their citizens—but they got three basic ideas right, and all ideas have become increasingly relevant in modern American politics.



First, the Anti‐​Federalists predicted that the federal government the Constitution created would increase its power until states were merely secondary considerations. Second, that this powerful federal government would be too big and distant for the people to effectively control, and thus vainglorious men of ambition and avarice would control it to enrich themselves off the common people.



Third, that it was unwise to govern a diverse and large population from a remote and distant government that would hold such immense power over the daily lives of common people, and, as a result, politics would become something more primitive than civilized, characterized by constant discord and fighting as different factions tried to control the lives of their fellow citizens.



These three ideas can be combined into one salient and perceptive question: Will a remote and distant government that wields a large amount of power over a vast land and a diverse people increasingly be seen as not representing the people, and, in the process, sow discord between them?



This essay will discuss these three Anti‐​Federalist ideas in modern context. I implore you not to think of this as a partisan plea for “states rights.” Questions about proper government structuring—that is, how government should act and at which level, local or national—are different than the more partisan “What should government do?” Maybe there should be a single‐​payer health‐​care system, or maybe there should be a school voucher program, but which level of government should implement those programs? That question is one of good governance, not partisanship.



It is time to remove the Anti‐​Federalists from the historical refuse pile where we’ve traditionally placed failed prognosticators such as Neville “peace in our time” Chamberlain or Thomas “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers” Watson. Rather than continuing to ignore the Anti‐​Federalists, this is a perfect time to find wisdom in the words of our “other” founders. Sometimes, the folk remedies of old are the best prescription to present ills.



 **A Federal Government of ‘Great and Uncontroulable Powers’**



Robert Yates actually attended the first five weeks or so of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, having been chosen along with John Lansing Jr. and Alexander Hamilton to be the delegation from New York. Lansing and Yates were “Clinton-men”—meaning they supported populist New York Gov. George Clinton, an Anti‐​Federalist and strong supporter of states’ rights—and they had been sent to the convention to counterbalance and overrule Hamilton, who was decidedly neither a Clinton‐​man nor an ardent defender of states’ rights.



Yates and Lansing watched the delegates vote to replace rather than amend the Articles of Confederation, something they believed was beyond the convention’s authority. They watched as delegates passed resolutions that would give great power to a new national government. They would have none of it. Both decided to leave the convention in early July, believing the delegates were creating an illegitimate and uncontrollable national government. When Yates saw the final version of the Constitution, it confirmed his fears.



Yates picked up his pen. In the fashion of the time, he wrote anonymously under the pseudonym “Brutus,” and choosing the name of Caesar’s assassin was certainly no accident. In his mind, he had a potential king to slay.



Under the proposed Constitution, Yates wrote, the government “has authority to make laws which will affect the lives, the liberty, and property of every man in the United States.” That power, in Yates’s view, was so great that it would eventually swallow the state governments, “for it will be found that the power retained by individual states, small as it is, will be a clog upon the wheels of the government of the United States; the latter therefore will be naturally inclined to remove it.”



Yates understood the temptations of power. “It is a truth confirmed by the unerring experience of ages,” he wrote, “that every man, and every body of men, invested with power, are ever disposed to increase it, and to acquire a superiority over every thing that stands in their way.”



Perhaps, in a modern context, we should think of this in less dastardly terms than the kind of encroaching despotism Yates seems to imply. As any government official knows, local control and individual freedom can stand in the way of the well‐​meaning designs of government programs. A painter cannot create a beautiful, harmonious picture if another painter controls part of the canvas, and he certainly can’t do so if some of the paint keeps moving around of its own accord. To paint his harmonious picture, something has to be done about the other painter and the disobedient paint. They’re “clogs upon the wheels.”



For Yates and other Anti‐​Federalists, the Constitution’s Necessary and Proper Clause, which grants the federal government power to make all laws “necessary and proper” to executing government’s powers, contained the seeds of absolute control.



“Under such a clause as this,” asked an Anti‐​Federalist writing as “An Old Whig,” “can any thing be said to be reserved and kept back from Congress?” “The Federal Farmer” (thought to be Richard Henry Lee or Melancton Smith) wrote that “it is impossible to have a just conception of [Congress’s] powers, or of the extent and number of laws which may be deemed necessary and proper.”



The Anti‐​Federalists were proved correct. When combined with other clauses, in particular the Commerce Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause has been used precisely as they predicted. Applying the Necessary and Proper Clause to the Commerce Clause has permitted Congress to reach nearly every non‐​commercial activity imaginable, turning the Commerce Clause into more of a general powers clause.



Whether or not that is a good thing, it is certainly different than what the Framers contemplated, which was a government of limited and enumerated powers that left most questions of local governance—such as education and health care—to the states.



 **A Government of the ‘Base, Idle, Avaricious and Ambitious’**



For the Anti‐​Federalist “Cato” (probably Clinton himself), a large and powerful government was particularly prone to being captured by “ambitious people” of “large fortunes” who will realize that they can become “happy, great, and glorious by oppressing [their] fellow citizens.” Such a person would “raise himself to grandeur, on the ruins of his country” because in a large republic “the public good is sacrificed to a thousand views.”



Furthermore, given “the vast extent” of the United States’ territory, as well as “the complication of interests” reposed in the government, “the science of government will become intricate and perplexed, and too mysterious” for the average person to “understand and observe.”



The Federal Farmer thought representatives in the federal government would be “too far removed from the people, in general, to sympathize with them, and too few to communicate with them.” It is a “consideration well worth pursuing,” he asked, “how far this house of representatives will be liable to be formed into private juntos,” creating groups of “unprincipled men, often distinguished for their wealth or abilities,” who will “combine together and make their object their private interests and aggrandizement.”



Centinel (probably Samuel Bryan) concluded that “the organization of this government…is devoid of all responsibility or accountability to the great body of the people, and that so far from being a regular balanced government, it would be in practice _a permanent_ ARISTOCRACY.”



A majority of members of Congress are millionaires. Eighty‐​one percent of people think the government can be trusted to do what’s right only some of the time or never, and 75 percent see widespread government corruption. We seem to have reached peak animosity and disappointment toward those in Washington, with the ire coming from both the left and the right. Increasing numbers of Americans believe Washington DC does not represent their views.



For many, the city on the Potomac has might as well be a later‐​stage Rome, sliding into decadent splendor and orgiastic self‐​absorption. Or, in the words of Cato, the “federal city” would be “the asylum of the base, idle, avaricious and ambitious,” that would “possess a language and manners different from yours.”



 **A People ‘Constantly Contending with Each Other’**



A national government imbued with unrestrained power would be a bad idea, thought Yates, because the people of the country were too diverse to be effectively centrally governed. A remote, national government given such great powers would cause a “constant clashing of opinions; and the representatives of one part will be continually striving against those of the other.”



This was because the “laws and customs of the several states are, in many respects, very diverse, and in some opposite; each would be in favor of its own interests and customs, and, of consequence, a legislature, formed of representatives from the respective parts, would not only be too numerous to act with any care or decision, but would be composed of such heterogeneous and discordant principles, as would constantly be contending with each other.”



Quoting the Constitution’s preamble, Cato sounded the same concerns:



[W]hoever seriously considers the immense extent of territory comprehended within the limits of the United States, together with the variety of its climates, productions, and commerce, the difference of extent, and number of inhabitants in all; the dissimilitude of interest, morals, and politics, in almost every one, will receive it as an intuitive truth, that a consolidated republican form of government therein, can never form a perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to you and your posterity.



No, thought Cato, such a government would be “unkindred,” and the constant clashing would “emphatically be like a house divided against itself.”



Here the Anti‐​Federalists were perhaps the most prescient. Political polarization has reached a fever pitch, and it shows no signs of abating. As Pew recently concluded:



Across 48 different questions covering values about government, foreign policy, social and economic issues and other realms, the average difference between the opinions of Republicans and Democrats now stands at 18 percentage points…nearly twice the size of the gap in surveys conducted from 1987–2002.



Congressional polarization is no better, having increased to the point where the two parties essentially always vote in lockstep with one another and rarely overlap. The “representatives of one part” are truly “continually striving against those of the other.”



There have been many theories and solutions offered for increasing polarization. Some solutions are rooted in controlling political information, whether through campaign finance laws, lawsuits against those who spread “disinformation,” or trying, in some way, to hold media accountable. At best these seem overly optimistic, and at worst they are blatant violations of the First Amendment. Given the way the Internet is personalizing our “feeds” in music, movies, art, and, well, everything, it seems wiser to conclude that, for the foreseeable future, political opinions will become more idiosyncratic, personal, and disparate.



But during the founding era, unlike perhaps any other time except for our own, political opinion was idiosyncratic, personal, and highly disparate. Newspapers and pamphlets by the hundreds were the primary source of political information, and those sources were biased to the extreme. There was no mass media, only private “feeds.” Maybe, therefore, the wisdom of the Anti‐​Federalists is even more relevant to soothing our currently polarized soul.



 **The Constitution as Peacekeeper**



What can we learn from these three prescient Anti‐​Federalist predictions? Primarily, that the Constitution is a peacekeeper. Good fences make good neighbors, but why? It’s less about keeping things out than keeping things in, that is, defining who has control over your yard, your house, and the things that happen inside.



A Trump supporter and a Clinton supporter living next door to each other can get along cordially due to the separation between the two houses. If either one were allowed to control the internal “policies” of the other house, however, things would get ugly. It’s no different in politics. The Constitution, as it was originally conceived, also tried to keep peace between neighbors, that is, between the different states that make up the union.



The Framers partially understood what the Anti‐​Federalists argued: the more that government gets involved in the daily lives and values of common people, the more it will sow discord if those people are dissimilar. The Framers, however, believed they had created a government that would not encroach too far into the internal politics of the states—that the Constitution effectively limited the federal government to questions of truly national, not local, importance. The Anti‐​Federalists predicted that government would eventually jump the constitutional guardrails and assert local authority over a diverse and numerous people.



The Anti‐​Federalists were right. Those constitutional guardrails are almost non‐​existent and, insofar as they still exist, they are often based on tradition or maintained at the sufferance of the national government. The federal government, for example, merely tolerates marijuana use in states that have legalized it, the DOJ having instructed its officers to not generally enforce the national drug laws within those states.



If a President Chris Christie, however, decided to bring the full force of the federal government into the legalizing states, and to essentially override local governance, there would be no principled, constitutional reason he couldn’t. The only protection would be the unpopularity of such an action, which seems an awfully thin reed to rest our freedoms upon.



Regardless of your views on the proper size and scope of the government—whether the government should provide health care, prohibit drugs, guarantee education, create social safety nets, engage in environmental protection, or whatever—this situation should concern you. Americans are at war with each other, an increasingly primitive and tribal war, over fundamental questions that implicate our deepest values—which education plan we should have, which health‐​care plan we should have, and what drugs we’re allowed to ingest, just to name a few.



But why should Georgia and Massachusetts have the same health care, education, and drug laws? Many people in those states can hardly stand to be in the same room together, so why would we let them govern each other?



 **Congressional Majorities Don’t Authorize Dictatorships**



This problem is bipartisan. On April 23, 2006, President Bush signed the Student Protection and Affordable Education Act, better known as the AEA or just “Bushucation.” The law creates a school voucher program in every state, and, in so doing, seeks to make education better and more affordable through the introduction of market competition.



The law is incredibly complex. It mandates that states expand their education spending to fund a massive school voucher program or, if they choose not to, to lose all current federal education funding. There are extensive subsidies for families of lesser means, and states are required to set up “education marketplaces” where parents can trade their school vouchers and efficiently shop for the best education options.



Finally, it requires everyone to pay into a mandatory school voucher fund, even if those people don’t have or don’t plan to have children. Without a single Democrat vote, the Republicans pushed the law through.



I’m lying, of course. That law doesn’t exist as an education law signed by President Bush. It does exist, however, as a health‐​care law signed by President Obama. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, better known as the Affordable Care Act or just “Obamacare.”



The law is incredibly complex. States were mandated to expand their Medicaid coverage or lose all current Medicaid funding (the Supreme Court struck this down). There are also extensive subsidies for those with lesser means. One essential part of the law’s structure was the so‐​called “individual mandate,” which required certain people who were not insured through their jobs or other programs to purchase health insurance.



Aside from the policy questions, arguably the most culturally significant thing about the ACA is that it is the most consequential national law ever passed without a single vote from the opposing party. In some sense, half the country imposed health‐​care policy on the other half. Of course, if George W. Bush could have done the same with an education law, perhaps Common Core, he might have imposed an education policy on half the country.



In the Affordable Care Act (and the hypothetical school vouchers law), the federal government once again used its “limited” powers how the Anti‐​Federalists predicted. Local, state‐​level control of health insurance was seen as a “clog upon the wheels,” in the words of Yates, to a great national plan. Moreover, an individual decision to not purchase health insurance was also seen as a “clog” that needed to be overridden.



Yes, the Democrats won the 2008 election and controlled Congress and the presidency, and some might argue that elections authorize majorities to rule over minorities. Yet, in a system of limited government, majorities aren’t dictatorships authorized to impose their unfettered will on the minority. Furthermore, even if something is allowed, it might still be unwise.



Such unfettered majoritarianism can be dangerous in a large and diverse country. As Cato warned, a country with the “immense extent of territory” as the United States, that contains people with a “dissimilitude of interest, morals, and politics,” should not be brought under one general government. Otherwise, we would have “a house divided against itself.”



That “house divided” can create real problems, and not just in terms of political backlash. Laws like the ACA don’t magically self-execute—rules need to be written, programs developed, and thousands of administrators and politicians around the country need to be involved in implementing them.



Furthermore, the ACA includes numerous provisions that necessitate state‐​level involvement. As much as Democrats would wish otherwise, some of those state‐​level politicians charged with implementing the law would be Republicans, and many of them resisted the law, just as many Democrat state officials would have resisted the hypothetical school voucher law. But partisan political division is a reality to be confronted, not an obstacle to be bulldozed. Major pieces of legislation require compromise, not ramming it down the throats of the opposition.



This is not to say that Republicans have done and would do the exact same. But this is where the lessons of the Anti‐​Federalists can be applied in the most salutary manner. If we stop trying to control each other in our local and personal matters, if 51 percent of the country stopped trying to impose its will on the 49 percent, then maybe we could get along better. To do that, however, we need to have a concerted and nonpartisan move toward localism.



 **We Need to Start Leaving Each Other Alone**



Let me ask the question again: Will a remote and distant government that wields a large amount of power over a vast land and a diverse people increasingly be seen as being unrepresentative of the people, and, in the process, sow discord between them? Yes.



We rightly revere our Constitution, but, apart from debates over how it should be interpreted, it is a “living document” in at least one sense: The attitudes of the people breathe life into its words, which carry no real force of their own. But the Anti‐​Federalists didn’t go away; their ideas still help animate the Constitution’s words, and their concerns have merged into ongoing the political conversation of the country.



The Anti‐​Federalists taught us valuable lessons about good government that have always been relevant and will never go away. Yet it seems there is something different about this election. Two of the most unpopular major‐​party candidates in history are vying for our votes. Given that a majority of Americans dislike both, whoever wins, most of us will be unhappy.



Yet, at his or her respective victory party, the victor will still claim that “the people have spoken.” When he or she sits down in the Oval Office, the new president will feel emboldened by “a mandate from the people,” even though more than half of his or her fellow citizens find this president unacceptable.



Nevertheless, he or she will take that sense of purpose into the most powerful office on the planet—as the head of the most powerful organization in the history of humankind—and will start pulling levers and flipping switches that will drastically affect the daily lives of Americans, for good or for ill. In four years, will we have overcome our malaise? Will this be seen as a bout of temporary insanity? For reasons that the Anti‐​Federalists first articulated, I think not.



Good government is not just about the question “What should be done?” It’s also about the question “What can we do together, cooperatively rather than combatively?” We are stronger together, yes, but someday soon the only way we can continue living together might be by leaving each other alone.
"
"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called for a Royal Commission of Enquiry into the Scientific Evidence for Man-made Climate Change.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that the Sydney APEC Declaration was a clear signal that most APEC nations are not going to swallow the pseudo-science and economic poison being peddled by Dark Greens from yesterday’s states like Europe and New Zealand.
The APEC nations told Australia, as politely as possible “You may commit economic suicide if you wish, but we are not going to put our feet on the sticky paper.” This “Never-Never” declaration is a warning call that Australia should re-examine the basis for its enormous waste of money on “Global Warming”.

China and India recognise clearly that “Global Warming” is just another European plan to hobble economic competition from Asia. The Global Warming Scam would deny cheap clean power to millions of energetic Asians.
France closed its last coal mine in 2004 and is now heavily dependent on nuclear power. German coal mines are no longer economic, and even in Britain, fewer than 5,000 coal miners work the mines that once fuelled an empire. Thanks to their Dark Greens, Europe is now dependent on imported coal for steel production and gets its power from imported uranium and gas piped in from Russia and beyond.
France has always envied and feared the cheap and abundant coal of the Anglo American world. The world dominance of Britain and then America in steel, manufacturing, metals, steam, railways, electricity and naval power was fuelled by coal, supported later by oil. China and India are about to tread the same road. The Dark Greens of Europe, secretly supported by their decaying industrialists, fear the growing power, energy and competitiveness of these emerging giants.
This is not about climate – it is about using public hysteria to benefit certain countries, business interests and ideologies.
There was no declaration of carbon emission targets from last week’s Russian delegation to Queensland. Russian scientists are not sucked in by distortions, exaggerations, half truths and poor science being peddled by the likes of Al Gore and Bob Brown.
The Russians, the Arabs, the Indians and the Chinese cannot believe the apparent stupidity of the English speaking world. They have no intention of adding to their energy costs or forcing their businesses to waste money on dreamtime research such as carbon sequestration – they are cynically planning exploit the declining competitiveness of western industries and to milk stupid westerners of any “carbon offset credits” they can find or invent.
There is already a groundswell of opposition from well informed scientists, engineers and individuals all over the world to the lack of evidence supporting the Greenhouse Religion. A recent scientific conference in Melbourne organised by the Lavoisier Society drew scientists and delegates from all over Australia and South Africa. Even the PM’s own backbench contains well informed climate sceptics, and the ranks of scientific sceptics are growing all over the world.
A Royal Commission taking evidence from more than a few government or United Nations hacks would soon establish the facts that:

1934 was the hottest year of the twentieth century.
There was no global warming from 1940 to 1980, a time when CO2 emissions grew strongly.
There has been no global warming since 1998.
Current temperatures are not extreme or unusual.
Past records and scientific evidence show that changing surface temperature is more likely to be a cause (not a result) of increased CO2 in the atmosphere.
CO2 and water vapour have always been essential components of the atmosphere. Neither is toxic, both tend to retain some of the sun’s warmth, and both are absolutely essential and beneficial to all life on earth.
The most likely causes of variations in surface temperature are connected with solar cycles, variations in the heat output of the sun and eras of volcanic activity.
More CO2, water vapour and warmth in the atmosphere would be a boon to most of humanity.
There is empirical evidence to suggest that earth’s temperature is more likely to fall than rise – ice ages are more normal than today’s balmy climates.
There is significant scientific opposition to the proposition that man’s emissions of CO2 are causing global warming or any other harm.

Earth’s climate is always changing and we must do what every generation of our ancestors did – “adapt to whatever nature has in store for us”.
Our ability to adapt is severely reduced by crippling our economy and misdirecting billions of dollars of research funds into nonsense like carbon sequestration or rich man’s toys like windmills and solar panels.
While billions of dollars are being spent on naïve attempts to build ever more complex computer models of atmospheric heat circulation, our oceans are largely unexplored. The vast deposits of methane under our oceans are both a threat and a promise for future generations, but too little research is being done in this field. And the hundreds of thousands of undersea volcanoes, which may hold the key to past and future climate change, remain largely unmapped and un-monitored.
Australia, an island almost alone in the Great Southern Ocean which circles the globe, should take the lead in ocean research instead of letting scheming politicians from abroad mis-direct our research priorities to spurious questions.

"Don Ciccone may never have achieved the fame of Frankie Valli, but he was a vital member of the Four Seasons, and sang on some of their biggest hits. That is his catchy voice on tastier sections of “Who Loves You” and “December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night),” both revived in the smash Broadway musical “Jersey Boys. ” Mr. Ciccone also led The Critters in the 1960s, with hits like “Younger Girl” and “Mr. Dieingly Sad,” and was a musical director and bassist for Tommy James and the Shondells in the ’90s. An obscure footnote to his extensive recording career was an unreleased batch of songs he recorded in the early 1970s with his longtime friend Brian Gari, 64, a   who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Gari wrote the songs and backed Mr. Ciccone on piano on recordings they made as demos to interest record labels. Of 20 selections, several were produced and released as complete songs, but even on the remaining sparse tracks, Mr. Ciccone’s vocals shone. “Don had that    kind voice and we always liked the tapes,” said Mr. Gari, who hung on to those old    demo tapes for the next 45 years. He and Mr. Ciccone would occasionally prod each other to dust them off and release them as a “Ciccone Sings Gari” album. In early October, Mr. Ciccone contacted Mr. Gari and said he planned to finally do just that, but a week later Mr. Ciccone died of a heart attack at age 70. “The week before he died, Don told me he wanted to put out the demos,” Mr. Gari recalled. “He said, ‘My next project is ‘Ciccone sings Gari. ’” Mr. Gari said he decided to realize Mr. Ciccone’s “last wish,” and, on a recent weekday, he was in a music studio near Union Square working with a sound engineer, Peter Millrose, to give Mr. Ciccone’s remarkable vocals on the old tapes a proper setting. One number called, “I Just Had to Say My Last Goodbye” had the jaunty, melodic feel of Todd Rundgren, or the band Chicago in the 1970s. Working from Mr. Gari’s stylistic cues, Mr. Millrose layered piano, bass and drums, and then toyed with horns, strings and other effects to punctuate Mr. Ciccone’s phrasings. As Mr. Gari suggested various riffs or motifs, Mr. Millrose played them on a keyboard and added them to the digital recording until the spare track had become a slick, sturdy, fully orchestrated song. Mr. Millrose worked from sheet music of lyrics and chords written by a teenage Mr. Gari with help from his mother, who unlike Mr. Gari, had the musical training to write the melodies on music paper. Some original elements would not be preserved, like the simulated rainstorm augmenting a lover’s farewell in “She Left on Good Terms. ” The two recorded the song in Mr. Gari’s apartment and used the bathroom shower for rainfall sound effects, along with Mr. Ciccone making sounds of thunder. Mr. Gari called the project bittersweet, bringing him both the joy of hearing Mr. Ciccone’s youthful voice again, but also a twinge of sadness that he was not around to participate and enjoy the results. “It had been my dream to do this album, but I never thought it would happen after he died,” said Mr. Gari, who kept the tapes among a large trove of materials he has amassed in the sprawling,   apartment on West End Avenue where he has lived for more than 50 years while writing almost 1, 000 songs, several books and the music and lyrics for “Late Nite Comic,” which had a brief Broadway run in 1987. Mr. Gari has been married twice and held both his weddings in the apartment, which is full of memorabilia, including a vast archive of Upper West Side photos and film clips he has shot since he was in elementary school. One room is packed with items from Mr. Gari’s maternal grandfather, Eddie Cantor, the movie and radio star. Shortly before his death, Mr. Cantor wrote a letter to the    Brian, praising his creativity and anointing him as “the one to carry on the tradition of show business in the family. ” Mr. Gari immediately began writing songs and riding the bus around Manhattan, selling his songs to music publishers. He enjoyed watching Mr. Ciccone perform with The Critters on “ ” an afternoon dance show hosted by John Zacherle, known as “The Cool Ghoul. ” Mr. Gari wrote an adoring fan letter to Mr. Ciccone in 1966. Mr. Ciccone wrote back and their ensuing correspondence led to a friendship. By 1971, Mr. Gari was a struggling songwriter and Mr. Ciccone was looking for his next recording contract. Mr. Gari would play him the catchy teenage love songs he had written with melodies that he described as in the “sunshine pop” vein. Of the 20 songs they recorded, several were made into fully produced songs, including “Bicycle Ride,” and “Silent Celebration,” which were issued by the Metromedia label on a 45 r. p. m. record. They recorded through 1973, when Mr. Ciccone joined the Four Seasons for a tenure that lasted through 1981. One of his Four Seasons bandmates from the era, Lee Shapiro, will produce one of the songs, Mr. Gari said. Mr. Gari said he hoped to release a CD of the 20 songs, several of which will include guitar work by his friend Dean Bailin, who played the memorable guitar fills on the 1979 hit “Escape (The Piña Colada Song). ” Mr. Gari said he would be happy if the “Ciccone Sings Gari” CD sold just enough copies to cover his recording costs. “I’m doing it because it’s the right thing to do. I’m doing this in his honor,” he said. “It fulfills my dream and his last wishes. I’m taking his death and making something positive out of it. ”"

====================================
Explosive (Non-Anthropogenic) Warming in the Early 20th Century
By Kenneth Richard
As Figure 1 depicts, human CO2 emissions were essentially flat during first half of the 20th century.

Yet, the world’s climate warmed dramatically throughout this period. For example notice how steep the rise in near-surface (0 – 20 m) ocean temperatures was between 1900 and 1945 according to Gouretski et al. (2012, “Consistent near-surface ocean warming since 1900 in two largely independent observing networks“).

As the Gouretski et al. (2012) graph indicates, near-surface ocean temperatures rose by about 1.2°C between 1900 and 1945. But then, in the next 65 years, between 1945 and 2010, the near-surface ocean only warmed by about 0.3°C in total, which includes a 30-year cooling trend (1945 – 1975).
If we compare the two trends, the early 20th century (1900 – 1945) near-surface ocean waters warmed at a rate of almost 0.27°C per decade, whereas the more recent period (1945 – 2010) only warmed at a rate of under 0.05°C per decade. Interestingly, it was the more recent 1945 – 2010 period that contained the rapid expansion of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, with rates rising from ~1 GtC/year (1900 -1945)  to nearly 10 GtC/year by 2010.
These warming (and cooling) trends in the near-surface ocean are the opposite of what would be expected if human CO2 emissions were the primary driver.
Sea level rose 8 mm/year between 1930 – 1948

What follows are some of the details of this dramatic early 20th century warming as documented by Princeton geologist Dr. Erling Dorf, a veritable expert on the subject. Notice from the summaries provided below that sea levels were observed to be rising at a rate of about 8 mm/year between 1930 and 1948 (6 inches in 19 years), which is more than double today’s modeled satellite altimetry rate (3.2 mm/year).
These early 20th century temperature and CO2 trends beg the question: What were the physical mechanisms that caused this dramatic global-scale warming, since anthropogenic CO2 emissions were both low (~1 GtC/year) and stable during this period?
Summary of the 1900 to 1950 warm period as described in Dr. Dorf’s (1959) “CLIMATIC CHANGES OF THE PAST AND PRESENT”.

A 14°F (+7.7°C) warming in the Arctic (North Pole region) between the early 1900s and 1950, with ice-free ports 7 months out of the year rather than the mere 3 months per year that were common at the turn of the century.
A 5°F (+2.8°C) warming in Antarctica.
“Catastrophic” and “violent” wasting away of glaciers, with Muir Glacier retreating 2 miles (3.2 km) in 10 years.
A snow line rise by 2700 feet (823 meters) in the Peruvian mountains.
A 6-inch (15 cm) rise in sea level between 1930 and 1948, a rate of about 32 inches (+80 cm) per century and 8 mm/yr  (more than double today’s alleged rate per satellite altimetry [3.2 mm/yr]).  A 600% increase in the rate of sea level rise in the 1920s.
Agricultural crop lines shifted 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) northward, with 10-day longer growing seasons.
Tree lines moved 65 feet (20 meters) up the mountains in Sweden.
Many birds and mammals extended their habitats northwards; about 25 species of birds advanced from the south up into a warmer Greenland; codfish replaced seals along the coasts of Greenland, which led “Greenland Eskimos” to switch to cod-fishing rather than seal-hunting.

Excerpts from Dr. Erling Dorf, 1959:
CLIMATIC CHANGES OF THE PAST AND PRESENT
It has been observed, however, that the greatest temperature increases during the last hundred years have been in the Arctic regions. In Spitsbergen, only about 10 to 12 degrees from the North Pole, the mean winter temperatures have risen about 14° F. since 1910 (Willett, 1950). Ice-free ports there are now open to navigation about 7 months of the year as compared with only 3 months fifty years ago (Ahlmann, 1953, p. 32). If the warming trend of the north polar region should continue at its present rate, it has been estimated that the entire Arctic Ocean would be navigable all year long within about a hundred years. At the opposite end of the world, according to recent reports from the Weather Bureau (Wexler, 1958), the Antarctic region has undergone a rise of about 5°F. in average temperature in the last fifty years. There has been no appreciable rise, however, in the mean annual temperatures in the tropical regions of the world.
What have been some of the notable results of this warming trend during the last hundred years? Glaciers throughout the world have been melting away at a rapidly increasing rate. Brooks (1949, p. 24). the eminent British paleoclimatologist, stated that “Since the beginning of the 20th Century glaciers have been wasting away rapidly, or even catastrophically.” In the Juneau region of Alaska, all but one of the numerous glaciers began melting away as far back as 1765. Muir Glacier, for example, has retreated as much as two miles in 10 years. Baird and Sharp (1954, p. 143) have referred to the “alarming retreat of glaciers” in the Alaskan region; along the Pacific Coast of North America and in Europe they believe the glacial melting “appears to be progressing violently.” In the north polar region, measurements of melting of the ice islands in the Arctic Sea indicate an approach toward an open polar sea (Crary, Kulp, and Blarshall, 1955). In only a few regions of the world, such as the Pacific Northwest, are there any records of glaciers advancing during the past century, and these have been mostly since 1950 (Hubley, 1956). The warmer temperatures have also caused a general rise of the snow line throughout the mountainous regions of the world, even in the tropics: in northern Peru it has risen about 2700 feet during the 60 years.
Believed in large part to be the result of the melting of the world’s glaciers, sea level has been rising at a rapidly increasing rate, amounting to as much as a 6-inch rise from 1930 to 1948 (Marmar, 1948). This is about four times the average rate of sea level rise during the past 9000 years, as recorded by Shepard and Suess (1956). It should be noted that more than a six-fold increase in the rate of sea level rise occurred in the mid-1920’s at the same time there was a striking change in the rate of glacial melting in the north (Ahlmann, 1953, Fig. 11).
Changes in vegetation brought about by the warmer temperatures include the encroachment of trees into the subpolar tundra as recorded in Alaska, Quebec, Laborador, and Siberia. In the Canadian prairies the agricultural crop line has shifted from 50 to 100 miles northward as a result of the lengthening of the growing season by as much as ten days. In parts of northern New England and eastern Canada the birch trees have been dying off over large areas, and the spruces and balsams have begun to suffer as a result of the rise in summer temperatures. In Sweden the timberline has moved up the mountain slopes as much as 65 feet since 1930 (Ahlmann, 1953, p. 35).
In the animal world many southern types of both birds and mammals have been extending their habitat ranges northward as a result of the warming trend. The cardinal, the turkey vulture, the tufted titmouse, and the blue-winged warbler, as well as the warmth-loving opossum, have slowly moved their ranges into the northern United States. A good many central European species of animals have been shifting their ranges northward into Scandinavia, Greenland, Iceland, and the Faero Islands. Twenty-five species of birds alone are reported to have invaded Greenland from the south since 1918 (Jensen and Fristrup, 1950). Codfish from the Atlantic have replaced the seals in the waters along the coast of Greenland. It is reported that compared to a shipment of 5 tons of codfish from Greenland in 1913, the 1946 shipment had risen to over 13,000 tons; the Greenland Eskimos have become cod fishermen instead of seal fishermen (Kimble, 1950). Farther south tunafish have moved northward into the waters off New England, and tropical flying fishes have become increasingly common off the coast of New Jersey.

"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."
"I don’t think I had a single conversation about air conditioning until 2005, when a burst of August weather that we would now consider a respite felt like the mouth of hell. Sitting in a pub living some Smiths lyrics (gasping, dying, but somehow still alive), a lugubrious friend who took delight only from grim irony said: “If this carries on – which it will, because it’s not a freak event – everyone will want air conditioning, which will only make climate change worse.” I said: “Don’t be ridiculous; this is freak weather, not British weather. Nobody will want air conditioning, because it’s an Americanism, culturally anathema, like Halloween.” Fifteen years later, air con is all anyone talks about. I may also have been wrong about Halloween.  We were so hot last week that we got into full, five-way family combat about whether we would rather have air con or still have a coastline by 2100. This culminated in my 12-year-old insisting that he definitely would not be alive by then and me yelling: “You’ll be 92! That’ll be a spring chicken in 2100.” It is so far south of moot, this point, because it is over my dead body. I don’t even believe in fans. I believe, implacably, that you should be able to tell exactly how hot it is outside from how hot you are inside. Install air con and you might as well be living in a shopping mall. Why not brick over your windows and put in a brow bar while you are at it? But it was this conversation – or, more specifically, having a cross-generational argument about it – that rammed home how different things are. Generations have been separated before by epochal change, by wars and whatnot, but, émigrés aside, we have always had a few constants – what good weather looks like, what hot means, whether April is indeed the cruellest month, whether or not to cast a clout before May is out. My kids are growing up in what is already a completely changed climate. They can still whistle for air conditioning, though. Even when they have left home, it is on my disinherited list, right up there with motorbikes. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
"GLEN ELDER, Kan.  —   Doug Palen, a   grain farmer on Kansas’   plains, is in the business of understanding the climate. Since 2012, he has choked through the harshest drought to hit the Great Plains in a century, punctuated by freakish snowstorms and suffocating gales of dust. His planting season starts earlier in the spring and pushes deeper into winter. To adapt, he has embraced an environmentally conscious way of farming that guards against soil erosion and conserves precious water. He can talk for hours about carbon sequestration  —   the trapping of    gases in plant life and in the soil  —   or the science of the beneficial microbes that enrich his land. In short, he is a climate change realist. Just don’t expect him to utter the words “climate change. ” “If politicians want to exhaust themselves debating the climate, that’s their choice,” Mr. Palen said, walking through fields of freshly planted winter wheat. “I have a farm to run. ” Here in   Kansas, America’s breadbasket and conservative heartland, the economic realities of agriculture make climate change a critical business issue. At the same time, politics and social pressure make frank discussion complicated. This is wheat country, and Donald J. Trump country, and though the weather is acting up, the conservative orthodoxy maintains that the science isn’t settled. So while climate change is part of daily conversation, it gets disguised as something else. “People are all talking about it, without talking about it,” said Miriam Horn, the author of a recent book on conservative Americans and the environment, “Rancher, Farmer, Fisherman. ” “It’s become such a charged topic that there’s a navigation people do. ” Mr. Palen  —   he plays his politics close to his vest but allows that he didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton  —   and others here in Glen Elder and across the state illustrate the delicate dance. Farmers like him focus on practical issues like erosion or dwindling aquifers. “When you don’t get the rainfall, it’s tough times,” he said. Regional politicians and business leaders speak of pursuing jobs that clean energy may create, rather than pressing the need to rein in carbon emissions. A science teacher at a community college  —   whose deeply religious students sometimes express doubts about the trustworthiness of science that contradicts biblical teachings  —   speaks to his class about the positives of scientific discovery (electricity) in order to ease into more contentious subjects (global warming). And an editor for a closely followed agriculture magazine, Successful Farming, recently made a controversial move, drawing a flurry of angry letters: He broke with longstanding policy to address climate change  . “Some readers thanked us,” the editor Gil Gullickson said. “But some wondered whether we’d been hijacked by avid environmentalists. ” The climate has not always been such a partisan issue. Richard Nixon, a Republican president, set up the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the Clean Air Act. Ronald Reagan ushered in the Montreal Protocol, the first global treaty to protect the global atmosphere. Much of that consensus has broken down, in no small part because of a   push by   interests, together with influential Republican allies, to attack   research on topics like global warming and push back on environmental regulation. That push began in earnest during the George W. Bush administration as attempts to undercut the Clean Air Act, and since then, the divide has widened. President Trump has famously said he believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and his administration has purged nearly all mention of   programs from the White House and State Department websites. It has also ordered a freeze on federal grant spending at the E. P. A. and other government agencies. The fact that the   discourse has also become dominated by liberals has alienated some conservatives, including Mr. Palen. Many people here in particular resent how, in the polarized political landscape of recent years, conservative Americans have been painted as hostile to the environment. The Trump campaign successfully seized on that schism, painting Democrats as overzealous environmentalists with little sympathy for the economic realities or social mores of rural America. “Many of our federal environmental laws are being used to oppress farmers instead of actually helping the environment,” Mr. Trump quipped in a widely circulated Q. and A. on FarmFutures. com. “Farmers care more for the environment than the radical environmentalists. ” Still, “it would be a huge mistake to think people voting for Trump were voting against the environment,” Ms. Horn said. If Trump follows an aggressive   agenda, she said, “there will be a big backlash in the heartland. ” In many ways, Mr. Palen sees himself as the ultimate conservationist. His   the son of an immigrant from Luxembourg, was the first to farm in this stretch of   Kansas. Mr. Palen grew up on the farm, took it over in his 20s, and looked to make his mark. In college, he learned of a farming technique called “no till,” which is intended to more closely mimic the natural prairie ecosystem, and was intrigued by its promise to protect his family fields from Kansas’ relentless winds and sudden downpours. The idea behind   farming, he now explains to anyone who will listen, is that plowing the soil destroys its natural structure, causing it to lose its precious moisture and nutrients. That makes it vulnerable to erosion. Mr. Palen’s fields aren’t tilled. There are no neat furrows. The residue of plants from previous plantings still carpets the earth, offering a layer of protection, and his fields are never bare even after harvest. He alternates wheat and other crops with what he describes as a cocktail of grasses and leafy plants, like grain sorghum, sunflowers and alfalfa, a gesture toward the diversity of the wild prairie. “They say there’s more organisms in a handful of soil than people on the planet,” Mr. Palen said, making his way through a field between plantings. He stooped his tall frame down, dug up a clump of earth, and rolled it between his fingers. He is   yet when he talks of the earth, his excitement is obvious. “See how it’s firm and holds together?” he said. “See how it doesn’t break down into goo?”   farming addresses a dire problem facing American farmers: Almost 1. 7 billion tons of topsoil are blown or washed off croplands a year, according to the Department of Agriculture, resulting in billions of dollars in losses for farmers. Keeping the soil healthy and covered also reduces evaporation by 80 percent, helping farmers conserve water, the department estimates. Farmers like Mr. Palen also happen to be protecting a vast and valuable carbon sink, making him an ally to   campaigners. The soil traps far more carbon in its depths than all plant and animal life on the earth’s surface, scientists estimate. A 2013 study estimated that   and other restorative farming methods could achieve up to 15 percent of the total carbon reduction needed to stabilize the climate. Despite his conservationist streak, Mr. Palen has no affinity for environmentalists. He feels vilified, he says, for his continued use of chemical herbicides and pesticides. (Some organic farmers control weeds by tilling the soil, which Mr. Palen argues causes more ecological harm.) And he remains suspicious of any expansion of government regulations that ignore realities of rural America. “We want to be left alone,” Mr. Palen said. He singled out the Clean Water Rule, an E. P. A. regulation designed to protect streams and other waterways, as regulatory overreach. Washington types wanted to dictate what he could do with every creek, every puddle, on his farm, he said, putting impossible burdens on farmers. And most of them had probably never spent any time on a farm, he said. “We’re the ones working to protect the environment. We’re the ones whose lives are tied to the earth. ” Carl Priesendorf, a science teacher at Metropolitan Community College in Kansas City, Mo. has learned strategies to talk about climate change without completely alienating climate skeptics. He teaches geology and meteorology. Those subjects would usually be innocuous, but not here. “I’d show the CO2 data  —   how we’d had the hottest year on record,” Mr. Priesendorf said. “But I get students who basically say what I’m teaching is nonsense. My car’s been keyed. I get notes from students saying they’re praying for my soul. ” One such note that he shared reads, “Know that God’s love surpasses knowledge. ” Since a particularly contentious debate in class  —   a student threw a book bag at him, he said  —   Mr. Priesendorf has taken a step back to focus on the everyday positives of science. “I ask: ‘Do you like the light bulb? Do you like electricity?’ That’s science,” he said. “Then I ease into more contentious topics, like climate change. ” That is an uphill battle. A 2013 survey found that just 8 percent of farmers in the Midwest believed that “climate change is occurring, and it is caused mostly by human activities. ” An earlier Pew Research Center poll found that only 48 percent of people in the Midwest agree with the statement that there is “solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer,” a number below other regions in the country. And conservatives have been pushing back against classroom standards adopted by the state of Kansas that treat evolution and climate change as scientific concepts. Last year, the United States Supreme Court declined to review a nonprofit group’s lawsuit that claimed that those standards promote atheism. But now, under a Trump administration, Mr. Priesendorf felt science itself was under fire. “If even your government starts telling your country that scientists are lying to you, it’ll be even tougher for science teachers,” he said. “I’m going to focus on keeping my students’ minds open to the possibility that the science is correct. ” Annie Kuether, a Democrat and   advocate in the   Statehouse and a member of the State Utilities Committee, has for years pushed for more renewable energy. One obstacle, though, is that the committee’s chairman does not believe in climate change. A St. Louis native who landed in Topeka as a young bride four decades ago, Ms. Kuether is used to working alongside adversaries. Her county voted for Mr. Trump, along with all but two counties in the state. She has sat through committee meetings where climate skeptics, including the discredited scientist   Soon, blasted the science behind global warming. “Carbon Dioxide, CO2, is merely a bit player in climate change,” reads one slide Mr. Soon presented in 2013. “Rising CO2 is largely beneficial to plant and human life. ” “I remember being horrified,” Ms. Kuether said. Still, over the years, she has forged powerful business alliances by focusing, in her arguments, on jobs and the economy. She has also found increasing support from farmers and landowners who count on wind turbines and solar panels they host on their property for income. “Gradually, from a political standpoint, you can build a constituency that benefits from this industry,” said Mark Lawlor, one ally and an executive at Clean Line Energy Partners, which is building a    transmission line to deliver 4, 000 megawatts of wind power from western Kansas to Missouri, Illinois and other neighboring states. “Just like grain, cattle, airplanes, wind’s another valuable resource Kansas can export,” he said, referring to Kansas’ sizable agricultural industry, as well as the Cessna Aircraft Company, which is based in Wichita, Kan. “Kansas has a lot of pragmatic folks here, and we recognize benefits. ” Kansas’ dwindling water sources have been another issue that Ms. Kuether has found strikes a nerve among voters here, whatever their beliefs on climate change. That has helped to build some support for measures to save the state’s shrinking aquifers, a lifeline for communities in western Kansas, though not yet any decisive action. In fact, her focus on the practical is a big part of what has kept getting her elected, she said, in a State Legislature where she is outnumbered by Republican lawmakers, two to one. “I’ve always felt that families have always been concerned about water  —   whether they’re Democratic, Republican or independent,” she said. Mr. Gullickson of Successful Farming, who usually writes about topics like pigweed, gypsum and runoff, has started to push the envelope on debates over climate change. An   veteran of the magazine, where he is the crops technology editor, Mr. Gullickson said he had long been on the fence about climate change. But that began changing five years ago, when he attended a workshop where a University of Kentucky professor gave a convincing argument, backed by data. “I started looking at the evidence, at the data and what farmers were doing,” he said. “And it’s clear: The weather has become more extreme these days. And I thought, ‘I’ve never heard of any successful business publication that stayed in business by withholding information. ’” So for the first time in the storied magazine’s    history, a cover story squarely addressed the science of climate change. The October 2014 piece was published under the headline, “@#$*% Weather!” “I know what you’re thinking: Climate change is just some figment of Al Gore’s imagination adopted by liberal   who want to tank the U. S. economy,” Mr. Gullickson wrote. “Still, think back over some rough weather you’ve endured in recent years and ask yourself these questions,” he continued. “Are springs getting wetter? Are droughts increasing in severity? Are rainstorms increasing in intensity?” The clear answer, he said: “Yes. ” Mr. Gullickson said that he and his editor had held lengthy discussions leading up to the article’s publication. His editor in chief, Dave Kurns, was supportive, he said, but also warned that the piece could generate backlash. Mr. Kurns spoke candidly over concerns of a backlash in an editor’s note that led the issue. When he became the magazine’s editor two years earlier, he said, he had been warned, “Never use the words ‘climate change. ’” “I was told: ‘Readers hate that phrase. Just talk about the weather,’” he wrote. The industry publication, which has a circulation of 390, 000, was influenced by some of the biggest names in agriculture taking a stand on the issue, Mr. Gullickson said. The agricultural giant Cargill has started to lobby members of Congress and urged farmers to take climate change seriously, saying inaction would be detrimental to the United States economy. The response to the magazine’s take on the issues has been split. “When you start quoting ‘climate scientists’ and the United Nations,” wrote in one reader, Bill Clinger, a farmer based in Harpster, Ohio, “you are as nutty as Al Gore. ” Measures to control emissions, he said, “are just seductive names for socialist programs intended to micromanage people and businesses. ” Mr. Gullickson said some readers thanked him. “Finally, a farming magazine comes to terms with what is going on with the weather,” wrote Paul Jereczek of Dodge, Wis. Reached by phone, Mr. Jereczek, who runs a dairy farm, expressed exasperation at people’s inability to speak openly. “The phrase has become so politicized, it’s just hard to talk about,” he said. “But we talk about everything else. Even round here, protecting soil is such a hot topic right now. But we talk about the soil, saving fertilizer, that sort of thing. ” Mark Salvo, vice president at the wildlife conservation group Defenders of Wildlife, might be a walking, talking stereotype of the kind of environmentalist who so frustrates Mr. Palen. An Oregonian now based in Washington, he spent 15 years in the American West fighting to conserve fish and wildlife on public lands. But Mr. Salvo thinks he knows an unlikely  —   and highly sympathetic  —   character to bring Kansans and others together around climate change: the lesser  . Known for its shock of yellow hair and bright orange cheeks, the lesser   once roamed the Great Plains. Today, though, the grouse is under threat  —   its populations reduced to isolated pockets in western Kansas, Colorado and the   Mexico border as its habitat succumbs to   drought, farming, drilling and other human activity. The group has been petitioning the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist the lesser   as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The bird found itself taken off the list after a lawsuit in 2014 backed by the oil and gas industry, which argues that any protective measures would mean added costs for energy developers. Mr. Salvo has found that to gain allies it doesn’t always help to start with the role climate change plays in harming the bird’s habitat. Instead, his movement has tried to find common ground, highlighting the historical heritage of the lesser  . In the “Little House on the Prairie” novels, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote about eating   mush. Mr. Salvo also stresses how   practices can be good for farming, too, backing a federal program that provides financial aid to private landowners who adopt those practices. Leaving corn stubble standing after harvest gives the birds food and places to hide, for example, while also helping farmers protect the soil. “Sometimes, to gain allies, it helps to focus on issues of common concern, to support local economic development as well as species conservation,” he said. “It helps everybody come to the table. ” Last week, Mr. Palen, the farmer, was again talking weather  —   if not climate change  —   at a conference of   farmers  in Salina, Kan. Sessions included “Using Your Water Efficiently,” “Making Weather Work for You in 2017” and “Building Healthy Soil With Mob Grazing,” a practice that helps to fertilize the land. And yes, Mr. Palen says, he is on board with saving the lesser  . “I often think of ways I can protect their habitat,” he said. “I enjoy wildlife. ”"
"The flooding of the Thames and Severn rivers over the past week has brought the misery of being flooded to many more people beyond the sodden Somerset Levels. Such a prolonged period of rainfall – the wettest winter since records began – has overwhelmed the soil and groundwater’s natural capacity to draw water away. While the flooding has caused widespread disruption and inconvenience, that’s not to say they’re the worst “in living memory”. There are records kept for most rivers in the UK that record river flow going back around 40 years, with records at a handful of sites such as York, Nottingham and Teddington on the Thames in west London going back for more than a century. These records are invaluable in helping us map and understand flood risk. Where few instrumental records exist we can use other forms of evidence such as flood marks and documentary accounts such as those found in diaries or newspaper reports. Flood marks such as these provide insight to the level of floodwaters in the past. When these pictures were taken earlier this week at Wallingford, the flood was comparable to the level reached in 2003 and 2007 – both “in living memory” – but was far below the high-water mark of the largest flood recorded on the Thames in the last couple of hundred years, here in 1894. Flood levels may vary throughout a catchment area, so a flood level may be higher or lower upstream or downstream of a site as a result of local factors such as drainage, run-off, vegetation and additional water from tributaries or upwelling groundwater. While some care is needed in interpretation of the records, what this shows is that the current flooding is not quite as rare as some have claimed. Over the past few hundred years large floods occurred on the Thames in 1774, 1852, 1894 and 1947. The British Evening Post of London recorded on March 15 1774: At Kingston, the water having reached up to the town hall, and spread over far the greater part of the town; the people could not keep the market there on Saturday last … At Teddington, the water rose in the church to a considerable height. And at Twickenham, the flood on Saturday evening was full one feet higher than it was 115 Years ago; though at that time it was higher than was ever known before … At Isleworth, the water was so high, that they could not get to the church without boats, so that this flood in the River Thames, was, in all probability, the greatest that ever was in this river. Major floods struck the Somerset levels in 1811, 1876, 1894 and 1929, and the Severn in 1672, 1770, 1795, 1852, 1869 and 1947. The floods across southern England in 1947 were the 20th century’s worst, in extent and cost of damages. In the past decade or so the UK has witnessed a number of serious floods, with those that struck Yorkshire and central England in  2000 signalling the start of the apparently flood-rich phase which we are currently passing through. It seems from the historical record that this is not unknown – a number of such phases can be identified over the last 500 years. But up until 2000 there had been relatively few severe floods since the 1920s (for example 1968 and 1947, and the east coast floods from the North Sea in 1953). With memory and experience of floods reduced in many communities, expectations of what could be expected is reduced. So we should take note from our current predicament and learn from this and from past events. We must develop long-term sustainable approaches to managing the risk of floods and not fall back on short-term responses that will be unsustainable, and ultimately won’t improve the situation over the long term."
"Social media shook with emotion. Headlines shouted the news. Legal scholars debated the order’s scope. But the most immediate effect of President Trump’s executive order barring refugees from entering the United States and halting entry from seven predominantly Muslim countries could be quantified on a human scale: refugees and other immigrants from those seven countries, some on their way to the United States on Friday when Mr. Trump signed the order, who were no longer able to enter the United States. Here are some of their stories. Hearing of Mr. Trump’s plan to slam the door on Muslim immigrants this week, Mr. Shareef hurried his wife and three children onto a plane in the Iraqi city of Erbil in the early hours of Saturday. They had been cleared to resettle in Nashville  —   a new life that Mr. Shareef considered a great opportunity. After the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, Mr. Shareef worked as a translator with American officials, and he received death threats. But after the Shareefs arrived in Cairo on Saturday, a   official spoke to Mr. Shareef. “He said they had just received an email from the U. S. Embassy in Baghdad,” Mr. Shareef said. “It said we could not get on the flight. ” Speaking by phone from an airport lounge, Mr. Shareef said he had sold the family home and car. His wife had given up her job. His two daughters, 10 and 17, had quit school. He had spent $5, 000 on flights. “I thought in America there are institutions, democracy,” he said. “This looks like a decision from a dictator. I don’t understand. ” “Donald Trump ruined my life,” he said. Ms. Omer, 39, is a green card holder, has lived in the United States since 1993, and graduated from Harvard University. On Friday night Ms. Omer was detained at Kennedy International Airport as she returned from Sudan, where she is a citizen, after a research trip for her anthropology Ph. D. at Stanford University. Ms. Omer said customs officials were apologetic and appeared confused about what they were supposed to do with the detained travelers. “I have to do this,” one told her. For five hours they asked about her travels, her academic research and her views on Sudanese politics, which they admitted to knowing little about. At one point, she said, they aggressively patted her down and handcuffed her. They removed the restraints when she began to cry, but the detainees brought in for questioning after her arrived in handcuffs, she said. “For the brief moment I was handcuffed, I couldn’t control myself and I just started crying,” Ms. Omer said. “It was humiliating. I thought I was going to be returned to Sudan. ” After Ms. Omer was released she said she felt like one of the lucky ones. “There are a lot of people being treated much worse or are being sent back,” she said. “If they get sent back to Iraq or Syria it is a    situation. ” Hazhir Rahmandad, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management, said his parents who hold green cards and split their time between the United States and Iran, were due back in Massachusetts on Tuesday to celebrate the birthday of Mr. Rahmandad’s twin children. Now they will not travel. Professor Rahmandad set up a Google form for people from countries affected by the immigration order to report and share their experiences attempting to travel to the U. S. “I was so concerned,” he said. By Saturday evening, his spreadsheet had over 200 entries, most of them concerning people from Iran. Mr. Abdi, 30, a Ph. D. student in anthropology at Yale with permanent residency in the United States, said he left the United States on Jan. 22 for Afghanistan, where he planned to do field research for much of the next year. He had participated in the women’s march in Washington the day before. Now, he said he was in legal limbo as he awaited a visa from the consulate of Afghanistan, unable to return to the United States even with a green card and fearful of returning to Iran because of his activism about human rights issues there. Speaking by phone from Dubai, Mr. Abdi said his current visa limits his stay in the United Arab Emirates to about a month. The possibility that green card holders and refugees could be barred from the United States did not occur to him when he left, he said. “We didn’t believe it really, that it was going to be implemented,” he said. “Maybe we were taking the Trump administration less seriously than it is. ” Nada, a Yazidi woman from Iraq, was on her way to be reunited with her husband, Khalas, who lives in Washington. The two of them, their last names not released, were granted special immigrant visas to the United States as part of a program created to help thousands of Iraqis with ties to the United States, according to The New Yorker. Khalas, a former interpreter for the United States Army, was granted his visa in April. Nada’s visa was approved about a week ago, and her passport on Thursday. She was turned away, however, when she arrived at the gate for her flight in Dubai, wrote Kirk W. Johnson, the founder and executive director of the List Project to Resettle Iraqi Allies. “The flight crew sent her back,” Khalas texted Mr. Johnson, “saying they got orders that no Iraqis with American visas should be boarded. ” Ms. Assali, 25, a   medical student from Allentown, Pa. said six of her Syrian relatives had arrived in Philadelphia on a flight from Doha, Qatar, on Saturday morning, only to be detained and put on a flight back less than three hours later. The group had obtained   immigrant visas. Ms. Assali said in a telephone interview that her six relatives  —   two uncles, two aunts and two teenage cousins, whom she did not name out of fear of endangering them or their case  —   are Christians who live in Damascus. Her father was on his way to pick up the relatives from the airport when he got a call from a customs official, she said, who said his family would not be leaving the airport. “They told him they’re not coming out, and to just go back. ” Ms. Assali said. “And that it’s confidential and he can’t tell them why. They said it was an issue with their paperwork. ” Mr. Darweesh, a husband and father of three who worked for the United States military in Iraq for about a decade, was detained after arriving at Kennedy Airport on Friday night. He was granted a special immigrant visa on Jan. 20. When he filed for it, he said he had been directly targeted because of his work for the United States as an interpreter, engineer and contractor. Mr. Darweesh was released on Saturday after lawyers filed a writ of habeas corpus in federal court seeking freedom for him, as well as for another Iraqi detained at the airport. Speaking to reporters and some protesters who gathered outside Kennedy Airport, Mr. Darweesh called the United States the greatest nation in the world. He said he was thankful for the people who had worked on his behalf. “This is the humanity, this is the soul of America,” he said. “This is what pushed me to move, leave my country and come here. ” Ms. Tayari, a resident of the United Kingdom who holds an Iranian passport, was unable to get back to Glasgow, where she works as a veterinarian, from Costa Rica, where she was vacationing, because her flight traveled through New York, according to The Guardian. Ms. Tayari grew up in Italy and told the newspaper that she had never experienced anything like it. She said it might cost her a month’s salary to book a new flight home. “I am destroyed,” she said. “I did not know that I could cry for so long. It feels like the beginning of the end. How this is possible? I am really afraid about what is going on. ” The family members have been living in a refugee camp in Turkey, and were scheduled to fly to the United States on Monday, according to US Together, a refugee resettlement agency quoted in The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. The agency had found an apartment for them to rent with another family of Syrian refugees in Cleveland. Those plans have been canceled after Mr. Trump’s order. “It was going to be really perfect,” Danielle Drake, a community relations manager for US Together, told the newspaper. “I can’t even imagine how the family feels right now. ” Mr. Saravi, a young scientist in Iran, had been scheduled to travel to Boston, where he had been awarded a fellowship at Harvard to study cardiovascular medicine, according to Thomas Michel, the professor who was to supervise his research. Then the visas for Mr. Saravi and his wife were suspended, Professor Michel said. “This outstanding young scientist has enormous potential to make contributions that will improve our understanding of heart disease, and he has already been thoroughly vetted,” Professor Michel wrote to The New York Times. “This country and this city have a long history of providing research training to the best young scientists in the world, many of whom have stayed in the U. S. A. and made tremendous contributions in biomedicine and other disciplines. ” Mr. Alshawi, who worked for a United States contractor in Iraq, was detained after he landed at Kennedy Airport on Friday. He had flown from Stockholm to New York, en route to Texas to see his wife and son. “He gave his package and his passport to an airport officer, and they didn’t talk to him, they just put him in a room,” his wife, who asked to be referred to only by her first initial, D, told The New York Times. “He told me that they forced him to get back to Iraq. He asked for his lawyer and to apply for an asylum case. And they told him: ‘You can’t do that. You need to go back to your country. ’”"
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s executive order on immigration is straining relations with the partner the United States needs most to reclaim the Islamic State’s stronghold in Mosul: the Iraqis. Iraqi officials were taken aback by the directive, which they learned about through the American news media because they had not been consulted first. The order blocks citizens from Iraq and six other predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days. That lumps Iraq together with Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, nations with no strategic alliance with Washington. “The effect is that many Iraqis will feel that the United States does not want a   relationship with Iraq,” said Lukman Faily, who completed a   stint as Iraq’s ambassador to Washington in June. “We hope it is a blip. It makes it difficult for us to decipher what President Trump is up to with regard to Iraq. ” Mr. Faily has been directly affected by the order. Though he holds dual British and Iraqi citizenship, he said information he had received from the American Embassy in Baghdad indicated that he would not be allowed to travel to the United States in the coming weeks to participate in a   conference, he said in a telephone interview from Iraq. The edict followed inflammatory comments that Mr. Trump made during a visit to the C. I. A. this month, in which he said that the United States should have “kept” Iraq’s oil after the   invasion and might still have a chance to do so. More broadly, it clashes with a memo that Mr. Trump issued on Saturday calling on the Pentagon to submit a new plan for stepping up operations against the Islamic State, including by empowering “coalition partners. ” With Iraq furnishing the ground forces for the coming assault on western Mosul, and with more than 5, 000 American troops in the country, the political support of Baghdad is essential. But current and former American officials are worried that the directive will have a corrosive effect on   relations at a critical stage in the fighting. “My brothers in Iraq’s Army, who I proudly fought with, are fighting ISIS tonight,” Mark Hertling, a retired Army lieutenant general who led American forces in northern Iraq, wrote on Twitter. “The Iraqi govt is now winning. And we ban their citizens?” The order, which administration officials said was drafted without the input of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Middle East experts at the State Department, has offended the Iraqis in several respects. During the Bush administration, the United States and Iraq signed a Strategic Framework Agreement, which calls for close diplomatic, economic and security ties and is still in effect. “If I were an Iraqi, I would be waving this signed agreement in the face of the current administration,” said Ryan C. Crocker, who negotiated the accord and served as the United States ambassador to Iraq under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “It is totally inconsistent. ” Iraqis who are already skeptical about Washington have also seized on the order to stir up opposition against the United States. Moktada   the fiery cleric whom many Iraqi Shiites support, accused the United States of “arrogance. ” “So get out U. S. citizens from Iraq before you expel communities from U. S.,” he said on Twitter. To contain the political damage, officials said a   call between Prime Minister Haider   of Iraq and Mr. Trump might be arranged for this week. Mr. Trump spoke on Sunday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and with the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, but neither Saudi Arabia nor the Emirates are covered by the new order. Iraqi officials who are close to the Americans worry that the Islamic State will exploit the policy in its propaganda to recruit new volunteers. As of early Sunday, the terrorist group had made no official pronouncement. However, individual members and supporters have been sharing the order and news articles about it. Yet another worry has been expressed by veterans, and even members of Mr. Trump’s own party: that the order will interrupt the flow of former Iraqi interpreters and cultural advisers who have worked closely with the Americans and have sought special visas to move to the United States for their own protection. “The people we need to accomplish the mission are nervous, and rightly so, that our country is going to turn our backs on them,” said Steve Miska, a retired Army colonel, who spent 40 months and three deployments in Iraq. Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Republicans who have been strongly supportive of the military, expressed concern that a strict application of the order might even block Iraqi pilots from coming to the United States for training. “This executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies,” they wrote in a statement issued Sunday. The more fundamental question is whether the White House can balance the fulfillment of a campaign promise to carry out “extreme vetting” of citizens from Muslim countries with the need to maintain strong ties with Muslim partners in its fight against the Islamic State. The air bases that the United States uses to bomb the group are all in Turkey or Arab countries, as are American troops. “The president’s actions on refugees and immigration are certain to backfire,” said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counterterrorism Center. “The policies validate the terrorists’ claim that we are at war with Islam, and will alienate our Middle East allies and isolate American Muslims here at home. ”"

Guest essay by Eric Worrall
The unfolding Greek financial crisis is front page news. The repercussions – bank runs, unsustainable debts, deadlocked creditors – could easily lead to major consequences worldwide. However misconceived the Euro currency was, its downfall will be painful on a global scale.
How much of Greece’s current economic problems were caused by the made Hellenic dash into renewable energy? The answer, unsurprisingly, is most likely quite a lot.
Greece, like many small European economies, has placed a substantial focus on green energy, seeing it as a quick leg up into the big league – an easy way to attract generous funding from rich green neighbours like Germany. On paper it must have seemed a fantastic opportunity – build green energy infrastructure, using a mixture of easy finance and generous grants from Germany and other rich green neighbours, then sit back and profit from selling carbon credits, on the pan-European, or even a global carbon market.
The promised European carbon market never really manifested, thanks mostly to an embarrassing oversupply of carbon credits – a surplus which was created through a combination of domestic overissuing of carbon credits, and through clever gaming of the defects in the Kyoto accord.
The consequences for Greece of this economic miscalculation have been nothing short of tragic. With money in short supply, Greece has been forced to retroactively roll back generous carbon credits, which has undoubtably bankrupted local investors, and which likely contributed to a sense that investing in Greece is unsafe.
I’m not suggesting all of Greece’s financial problems are due to Greece embracing the false promise of green wealth. But the massive misallocation of resources and domestic green wealth destruction can’t have helped. Greece now stands on the brink of defaulting on a $1.73 billion IMF payment – a payment which Greece might have been able to afford, had they not been lured into squandering billions of Euros of borrowed money, on the empty renewable energy pipe dream.

"What’s the best way to reduce the roughly half a million annual deaths from smoking in the US alone? Nearly half a million lives cut short, often with untold suffering, by a commercial product that has been known to kill its consumers for more than half a century. We can raise the price of cigarettes through taxes, which is known to reduce demand, especially among young people who are the industry’s reservoir of future addicts to their legal product.  We can introduce plain packaging, which replaces the glamourous, glittery gold of Benson & Hedges with the graphic image of a lung destroyed by cancer. Or we can put warning labels on packs, in bus shelters, on TV. The possibilities are almost endless. Many policy options exist, and research has shown that they work. Tobacco control policies save lives. They also save addicts the money they no longer pour into tobacco industry coffers. No wonder, then, that the tobacco industry spent decades undermining the pervasive scientific consensus on the adverse health effects of tobacco.  The seminal book Golden Holocaust by Robert Proctor, whose publication the tobacco industry infamously sought to suppress, provides a chilling analysis of the industry’s ruthlessness. These efforts to undermine the science continue to this date. So why are tobacco control measures now in place in many countries around the world? Why has the rate of smoking in California declined from 44% to less than 10% over the last few decades? Why can we now debate the policy options for a further reduction in public harm, such as plain packaging or tax increases? It is because the public demanded action. This happened once the public realised that there was a scientific consensus that tobacco was harmful to health. The public wants action when they perceive that there is a widespread scientific agreement. Those who wish to maintain a status quo, whether it involves tobacco or fossil fuels, have long understood this principle. In 2002, Republican strategist Frank Luntz advised politicians to undermine the scientific consensus on global warming, in order to influence their views on climate change. And the tobacco industry infamously stated that “doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the ‘body of fact’ that exists in the minds of the general public.” A scientific consensus is necessary to understand and address problems that have a scientific origin and require a scientific solution. The public’s perception of that scientific consensus is necessary to stimulate political debate about solutions. When the public comes to understand the overwhelming agreement among climate scientists on human-caused global warming, acceptance of the science and support for climate action increase.  Consequently, one of the principal strategies of people who reject the scientific evidence on climate has been to try to maintain the consensus gap by creating the appearance of a scientific debate where there is none.  That is why among newspaper opinion pieces from 2007 to 2010, the most common myth promoted by syndicated conservative columnists was that “there is no scientific consensus about global warming”.  There is clear evidence that closing the gap between the scientific consensus and the perception of it by the public is key to stimulating the constructive policy debate we should be having.  In a recent article, Mike Hulme argued that the debate “needs to become more political, and less scientific”.  We agree, because the scientific debate has moved on from the fundamentals – there is no scientific debate about the fact that the globe is warming from human greenhouse gas emissions. So we need to hammer out political solutions rather than “debating” well-established scientific facts. Hulme also suggested that, in reference to a paper by John Cook,  “merely enumerating the strength of consensus around the fact that humans cause climate change is largely irrelevant to the more important business of deciding what to do about it.” The data we have just reviewed show otherwise: there is strong evidence that the public’s perception of an overwhelming scientific consensus is key to stimulating the constructive policy debate we should be having. Underscoring the consensus is therefore essential to counter the pseudo-scientific myths that are injected into the public debate by what scholarly evidence has recently revealed to be a nearly US$1 billion-a-year effort of political and vested interests in the US alone. The infamy of those lobbying efforts is evident to anyone who understands the extent of the scientific consensus. When Hulme queries the value of consensus on human-caused global warming in the peer-reviewed literature, he has it backwards in two important ways. Closing the consensus gap is an important step towards the public debate about climate policy which he rightly calls for. The problem is the attack on climate science and the overwhelming consensus, not the research supporting it."
"As the sun finally emerges from behind a cloud, I catch sight of a pair of dragonflies, yoked together in a mating position to rival the Kama Sutra. Yet this copulating couple, performing in a watery ditch on Canvey Island in Essex, are no ordinary members of their family. They are southern migrant hawkers: a species virtually unknown in the UK until a decade or so ago. The southern migrant (also known as blue-eyed) hawker is just one of half-a-dozen “dragons and damsels” to have gained a foothold in Britain since the turn of the millennium. Together, they’ve brought the total number of UK species close to the 50 mark. The new arrivals include the lesser emperor dragonfly, a duo of jewel-like damselflies – willow and southern emeralds – and the dainty damselfly. This tiny insect was lost from Britain in the 1953 East Anglia floods, but has now recolonised a few sites in Kent. More are poised to follow: there have been breeding attempts by the vagrant emperor, some of which fly here all the way from north Africa; while four other continental species have been seen in the UK for the first time during the last 25 years. Other species, once confined to the warmer south and east, are rapidly expanding northwards and westwards. As its name suggests, the migrant hawker used to be mainly a seasonal visitor to the UK; it now breeds over much of England and Wales, and I regularly see it in my Somerset garden at this time of year. Another species extending its range, the scarce chaser, has recently colonised the drains and ditches of the nearby Avalon Marshes. But while the possibility of seeing these new species is exciting for naturalists, we do have to temper our delight a little. There can be no doubt that their northward surge across the Channel is driven by current climate changes, and in particular the very warm weather of the past three springs and summers. So, what might be good for them – at least in the short term – is a timely warning to us. As dragonfly expert Dave Smallshire, co-author of Britain’s Dragonflies and Atlas of Dragonflies in Britain and Ireland, points out: “While about half a dozen species appear to be in decline, 20 species have increased; the overwhelming reason being climate change”. Until quite recently, a passion for Odonata (the scientific group which comprises dragonflies and damselflies) was confined to a handful of experts. Indeed, until 1937, when scientist Cynthia Longfield produced her pioneering book The Dragonflies of the British Isles, these familiar insects did not even have common English names, and were always referred to using scientific ones. Longfield – whose passion and expertise earned her the nickname Madame Dragonfly – began the slow process of creating vernacular names for each species. However, it was not until long after the second world war that the terms hawker, chaser, darter and skimmer were finally widely accepted. Several of these names are getting increasingly unsuitable, as species such as scarce chaser and Norfolk hawker become more widespread. Towards the end of the 20th century, birders like me began to take an interest in dragonflies and damselflies, which are often visible on hot summer days when birdlife can be hard to find. At the same time, other naturalists were also becoming fascinated by these charismatic creatures. As a result, there is now a network of experts all across the country, recording changes in range and noticing new arrivals. Trends over the past half-century are currently being analysed, using more than 1 million records gathered by these citizen scientists. Given that some species can only be told apart from one another by tiny differences in pattern, or, in the case of the common and scarce emeralds, by the shape of their anal appendages (yes, really), then expertise is certainly required. For the beginner, dragonflies and damselflies are, fortunately, relatively easy to tell apart. Dragonflies are generally much larger than their slenderer cousins, and many species sport distinctive patterns and colours. When perched, a dragonfly holds its wings out at right angles to its body – looking rather like a first world war biplane – whereas damselflies either hold their wings tight along their abdomen, or, in the case of the emeralds, at a 45-degree angle. Contrary to popular belief, neither are able to sting you, though dragonflies are fearsome predators of other insects, including their smaller relatives. Dragonflies are very mobile, so they are ideally placed to take advantage of changes in the climate With so many exciting new species colonising southern Britain, we should not ignore what is happening at the other end of the country. In Scotland, dragonfly expert and wildlife guide Jonathan Willet has noticed some significant changes over the past two or three decades. “Species that were once very rare and localised are getting much commoner and more widespread,” he tells me. For example, until quite recently the southern hawker was known from just a few scattered sites; now it is found across much of the country, as far north as Aberdeenshire. He says: “Dragonflies are very mobile, so they are ideally placed to take advantage of changes in the climate, including a run of very mild winters.” Scotland’s rather limited dragonfly fauna has also been boosted by new arrivals, including the emperor and the migrant hawker, both of which have now managed to cross the border. It’s not all good news for Scotland’s dragonflies and damselflies. Warmer, drier summers are likely to cause some habitats to dry out, which could reduce numbers of northern specialists such as azure hawker, white-faced darter and northern emerald. Having been around for at least 300 million years, dragonflies are pretty adaptable but the rapid pace and unexpected consequences of the climate emergency means that some might struggle to cope. Dragonflies and damselflies certainly respond to changes in climatic conditions very rapidly, but they are not the only insects doing so (see below). Last summer, I caught up with the long-tailed blue butterfly, a Continental European species which invaded Sussex that year. This year I watched a large tortoiseshell butterfly – a species which disappeared as a British breeding species following the second world war – feeding on a buddleia bush on the Isle of Portland in Dorset. As with the mating pair of southern migrant hawkers, however, the thrill of seeing these new species was tempered by the knowledge that their colonisation is somehow ‘unnatural’, as it is being driven by anthropogenic climate change. Several butterfly and moth species are also close to colonising the UK. Large tortoiseshellThis larger cousin of the familiar small tortoiseshell vanished from the UK in the mid-20th century but recently it has started to appear at several sites in Dorset. Long-tailed blueOne of the world’s commonest butterflies, this species has been arriving in good numbers in summer along the Sussex coast. Camberwell beautyFirst identified in Camberwell in 1748, this butterfly occasionally turns up in the south-east. Jersey tigerClassified as ‘nationally scarce’, this strikingly patterned day-flying moth is seen in good numbers across southern Britain. Death’s-head hawkmothMade famous by The Silence of the Lambs, this huge and impressive hawkmoth, sporting a skull and crossbones on its thorax, is seen more and more often."
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump on Friday afternoon approved a sweeping executive order that suspended entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, barred Syrian refugees indefinitely, and blocked entry into the United States for 90 days for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It also barred green card holders from those countries from   the United States, the Department of Homeland Security said, though the administration said exemptions could be granted. Here are some major excerpts from the executive order, with comments by The New York Times. The full text of the order is available here. Most of the 19 hijackers on the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Shanksville, Pa. were from Saudi Arabia. The rest were from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Lebanon. None of those countries are on Mr. Trump’s visa ban list. The nation’s founding principles, as reflected in the Declaration of Independence, included dissatisfaction with what were said to be overly restrictive immigration practices. “There is no statutory requirement that noncitizens entering the United States support the Constitution,” said Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University. “The executive order seems to suggest that even temporary visitors like tourists and students should support the U. S. Constitution, which doesn’t make a lot of sense. ” This provision is the key to the power Mr. Trump claims. It says: “Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. ” The provision “gives the president capacious authority to deny entry to any alien or class of aliens,” Professor Spiro said. “No court has ever reversed a presidential order under it. ” But he added, “In terms of the number of prospective immigrants involved, this is by far the most significant use of the power by any president. ” Some critics say the order runs afoul of a later law that bars discrimination “in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person’s race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence. ” The tension between the two laws has not been definitively resolved by the courts. Jennifer Chacon, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said that a challenge to the executive order based on the later law’s   principles was the most promising line of attack. In an opinion article in The New York Times, David J. Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian group, said Mr. Trump had at least violated the spirit of the later law. “Even if courts do find wiggle room here, discretion can be taken too far,” Mr. Bier wrote. “If Mr. Trump can legally ban an entire region of the world, he would render Congress’s vision of unbiased legal immigration a dead letter. ” The countries are Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. These exceptions are mostly for diplomats, people traveling to the United Nations in New York, and others involved in international organizations. The initial list may soon change and expand. This provision suspends all admissions of refugees, not limited to the seven countries. As a general matter, this will give priority to Christian refugees over Muslim ones. Though framed in a neutral way, this part of the order may raise questions of   discrimination. Mr. Trump has said that he means to favor Christian refugees. That violates the First Amendment’s ban on government establishment of religion, according to David Cole, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. “One of the critical questions with respect to the validity of executive action challenged under the Establishment Clause is its intent and effect,” he wrote in a blog post. “If intended to disfavor a particular religion, it violates the Establishment Clause. ” This effectively expands the ban on immigrants from Syria. This cuts the cap on refugees in half."

Australian of the Year Tim Flannery attempted to scare the horses recently by baldly claiming greenhouse gases are now at levels far higher than has ever been publicly admitted before. Is this a cry of warning from an eco-warrior or yet another blast of climate-porn from one of the world’s leading climate pornographers?
Traditionally pornographers produce material their audience may regard as obscene, or at least titillating. Climate pornographers produce material that is obscene, regardless of your viewpoint – extremist, alarmist and designed to frighten regardless of the facts, or the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the information to hand.

And, no, pornographer is not too harsh a word to use in regard to the climate change debate. Polemics such as Flannery and Al Gore have taken to using very harsh rhetoric in an attempt to silence their critics and anyone who dares question climate change dogma. If you want to live by words you risk death by words.
According to one website the earliest use of the term ‘climate porn’ to describe the excesses perpetrated by the mass media, environmental groups, politicians and celebrity eco-warriors to attract attention was this, in the Financial Post, as long ago as 2004:
Parental warning: Better lock down the Discovery channel along with the Playboy channel next Thursday unless you want to subject your kids to hours of climate porn and scenes of polar bears being killed off by the evil legacy of the industrial revolution and human addiction to speed, technology, power, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll.
The same site, wordspy.com, defines climate porn as ‘extremist or alarmist language or images used to describe the current or future effects of man-made climate change.’
Flannery’s latest claims are the very definition of climate porn. He revealed to Australia’s ABC the contents of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) update report not due to be released until next month.
Why? Could it not wait a few weeks? Perhaps to alarm? Perhaps to get his name in the news again? According to the ABC news website Flannery was able to reveal, no doubt in tones of impending doom, that greenhouse gases are at ‘dangerous’ levels ‘far higher than has ever been publicly admitted before.’ One presumes the reference to public admission was intended to imply that governments, presumably those headed by Bush and Howard, have somehow conspired to hide data from an unsuspecting public. The problem of course is that governments do not control this data. In fact, the IPCC consists of thousands of scientists and reports to the UN, which is not exactly a hotbed of right-wing pro-business, oil-company loving conspirators.
Flannery was quoted as saying the new figures (the ones he had rushed to reveal ahead of proper scrutiny and release by the scientific community) show greenhouse gases had reached levels already deemed dangerous by mid-2005. Of course he neglected to reveal that there is no consensus about what these dangerous levels should pegged at. Nor did he rush to explain why, if the levels are ‘already’ so dangerous, the dire predictions he constantly peddles had not already come to pass.
Worse, he claimed these new figures, which only he is currently privy to, were ‘beyond the worst-case scenario as we thought of it in 2001’; and that the levels of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere were far beyond those previously modelled by climate scientists. Which all begs another question – if these climate models, which vary from one researcher to another by orders of magnitude are so accurate, why should we put any faith in them now they are apparently all proven to be wrong? Even the ‘worst-case scenarios’.
Then, the climate pornographic climax from Prof. Flannery: ‘We are already at great risk of dangerous climate change – that’s what the new figures say. It’s not next year, nor next decade; it’s now’. Now – no ifs, buts or maybes, dangerous climate change is upon us.
Flannery is intent on making constant outrageous predictions. He has claimed ‘there is a fair chance that Perth will be the 21st century’s ghost metropolis’ and that ‘we face … rapidly rising sea levels, maybe up to 6 metres and hundreds of millions of refugees, because there are whole cities going under.’
Flannery is a man who likes to mix possibilities and imagination to come up with apocalyptic headline-grabbing scenarios. Try this one: ‘Let’s project ourselves 50 years out and imagine that the rate of melt has continued so that the sea level has come up three or four metres. What that means is there’s barely a functioning port facility on the planet. So how do we go about international trade which is actually the centre of our global civilisation?’ Discounting the likely response of engineers and government completely this whole nightmare is constructed on the term ‘imagine’, not on science. On fear, not fact.
These types of gloom and doom catastrophe claims are starting to have an impact quite the reverse of that expected by the claimants. Just last week a leftist Think-Tank in the UK released a report arguing the overwhelmingly alarmist claims about climate change and global warming peddled in the mass media is ‘confusing, contradictory and chaotic, and with the likely result that the public feels disempowered and uncompelled to act.’
Warm Words: How are we telling the climate story and can we tell it better? was published by the Institute for Public Policy Research. It declares that the use of the sort of alarmism in which Flannery and Gore specialise is counterproductive. They say eco-celebrities and the mass media largely portray climate change as ‘awesome, terrible, immense and beyond human control.’ As one might expect from a leftist think-tank they then go on to recommend ‘communications from government and green groups should treat climate-friendly activity as a brand that can be sold, making it feel natural to the large numbers of people who are currently unengaged with the problem.’ Marketing tactics are better than fear tactics, they seem to argue.
But the point they are making appeals to common sense – if extremist fear tactics are in constant use the masses will soon feel disempowered. Not long after that they will give up all hope of participating in the debate and whatever reasonable changes might actually be required.
In other words climate porn is likely to be counterproductive. That which outraged our grandparents is now standard fare on Channel 10 – to them it was pornography, to today’s teenagers it is but entertainment.
Much of the alarmism and the fear tactics may very well be misplaced. Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth implies, wrongly, that Hurricane Katrina’s devastation can be put down to global warming. Links between Australia’s recent drought and global warming are also unproven. Use of terms such as fear, inevitable, catastrophe, freak weather, chaos, the collapse of civilisation, submerged, global threat and disaster in every headline, article and press release is unreasonable and the common man senses it.
Not every bad weather event is related to global warming. Not every catastrophe predicted by Flannery will come to pass. In fact most of his claims are so extreme, so pornographic, that perhaps none ever will?
Who knows – it might even turn out to be the best thing for the environment if Prof. Flannery and his fellow travellers stuck to science and swore off climate porn.

===================================================
The Sun in March 2016
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
Our mother star was once again less active than normal in March. The observed solar sunspot number (SSN) was 54.9, which was about 2/3 of the mean value (82.5) for this month into the cycle. Here’s what the current solar cycle (SC) looks like so far:

Figure 1: The course of the current SC 24 since it began in December 2008, up to March 2016 (month 88) in red, the mean of the previous 23 cycles is shown in blue, and the similarLY (since month 73) behaving solar cycle number 5, which occurred from May 1789 to December 1810, shown in black.
 The accumulated sunspot numbers this far into the cycle are plotted as the anomaly from the mean for each cycle. It shows that the current cycle is one of the weakest on record:

Figure 2: The accumulated sunspot numbers for each cycle, shown as the anomaly from the mean, 88 months into the respective cycle, going back to 1755.

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




 SC 24 is the weakest since SCs 5, 6 and 7, a time known as the Dalton Minimum (1790-1830). It appears that the current cycle may very well wind up being weaker than SC 7 when it ends. Our sun is a very mediocre star of the spectral classification G2, similar to our neighbor star Alpha Centauri A. That is one of the reasons evolution had enough time to spawn intelligent life. A more active star most likely would not have allowed it due to the powerful solar winds that would “blow away” a planet’s atmosphere.
What follows is a beautiful picture from the Hubble space telescope:

Figure 3: The light blue star inside the “bubble” of dust and gases is very active. Through pressure it generates its stellar winds that shape a sphere that measures 10 light years in size. Near the surroundings of the star a planet with an atmosphere would be inconceivable. Photo source: NASA
So can single super flares (extremely powerful eruptions of a star’s surface) from the sun be excluded? A new study by a team of scientists led by Christoffer Karoff of the University of Aarhus in Denmark concludes: No – something of the sort could in fact happen! There are indications that in the year 775 a flare occurred, one that was much more powerful than anything we could expect in modern times, e.g. Carrington- Event 1859.
A massive explosion on the sun that could be 100 times more powerful is improbable, yet cannot be excluded. If such a flare hit the Earth, things indeed would get very uncomfortable because all power transmission lines would be impacted. Our modern energy and communication networks would be interrupted globally, and for a long time.
The requirement for this? A huge sunspot.
If one did occur, there first would be a warning period. But what precautionary measures could be implemented? Up to now we can only hope to be spared of such a massive solar flare of energy. In a sense the Danish study tells us just how dependent the Earth is on the sun’s power, its electromagnetic radiation, and its magnetic field.

"**The fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray state may not only have drastic implications for the future of the country but could also seriously affect its neighbours.**
Seeking to calm tensions a day after fighting started, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that ""the stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region"".
With a population of more than 110 million and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, what happens in Ethiopia inevitably has a wider impact.
Despite this, the federal government has so far resisted calls for diplomatic intervention to end the hostilities with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which runs the state.
Instead it has launched a charm offensive aiming to persuade the world that this is an internal matter. The government has described the conflict as a ""law-enforcement operation"" against a ""clique"" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order.
This fighting may have been the result of long-standing tensions between the TPLF and the federal authorities, but the thousands of refugees crossing into Sudan indicates how this has spread beyond Ethiopia's borders, whether the government likes it or not.
""The war is already regional,"" says Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst.
""The Sudanese are involved and at some point it will involve other countries in the region, and also beyond, because it is a strategic region. The impact is huge.""
He also believes that the conflict has drawn in Eritrea, which shares a long border with Tigray.
Eritrea has a history of poor relations with the TPLF, with its own scores to settle, and its President, Isaias Afwerki, is an ally of Ethiopian Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed.
There is no doubt that attacking across Tigray's northern border would open up a new flank in the fighting, but so far the Eritrean authorities have denied involvement in the crisis.
There is also a danger that the federal government's focus on Tigray could weaken its involvement in backing the government in Somalia against al-Shabab militants.
Ethiopia has already withdrawn about 600 soldiers from Somalia's western border, though they were not tied to the African Union's mission in Somalia (Amisom), which Ethiopia also supports.
""If the situation deteriorates further and Mr Abiy is forced to pull out of Amisom, that would be catastrophic... it will create an opportunity for al-Shabab to regrow and regroup again,"" says regional analyst Mr Abdi.
The International Crisis Group agrees, saying that unless the conflict is urgently stopped, it ""will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa"".
Regardless of the current involvement of Ethiopia's neighbours, some argue that the conflict could weaken the Ethiopian state, which could have damaging regional consequences in itself, with other groups in the multi-ethnic country emboldened to take on the central government.
Mr Abdi told the BBC that ""what you will see essentially is the regions drifting away from the centre and the centre becoming weaker, unable to assert itself"".
But the director of Nairobi-based think-tank the Horn Institute, Hassan Khannenje, understands that Prime Minister Abiy needed to bring Tigray back in line with the federal government to avoid a situation where others could follow its example.
""Mr Abiy sees this as setting a bad precedent for the other regions... a unilateral movement towards a potential secession will mean the balkanisation of Ethiopia, which could mean the end of Ethiopia as a nation-state,"" he told the BBC.
""His endgame is to bring the state back into the fold and hopefully move into elections next year as a united country. Which is going to very hard to do in practice, but it is not impossible.""
In the meantime, the crisis could lead to thousands being forced from their homes either directly because of conflict, or because of the fear of conflict.
Growing numbers have been crossing into Sudan and on Friday the UN's refugee agency said that the speed of new arrivals risked ""overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid"", the Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman as saying.
The Sudanese government has agreed to the establishment of a camp for 20,000 people 80km (50 miles) from the border and more sites are being identified, the UN says.
Added to this is the spectre of food shortages, with the region being one of the worst-affected by a desert locust infestation, with threats of new swarms arriving in the coming weeks, according to a recent UN humanitarian report.
About 600,000 people in Tigray - about 10% of the population - already rely on food aid and across the country around seven million people face food shortages, the UN says.
If the fighting does continue, the numbers of people needing assistance would increase rapidly in a region already under pressure on other fronts.
The UN adds that the threat ""of uncontrolled diseases and desert locust infestation"" reaching other parts of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries ""is high"".
Ethiopia's size and strategic position in the region means that what happens in the country cannot necessarily be isolated, whether that is the fighting itself or the humanitarian fall-out.
The prime minister is confident that this will be a short conflict and insists that it is a purely Ethiopian issue, but if it is prolonged then it could have serious repercussions for many of its neighbours."
"My grandmother, F. Helen Hunt, was tough. I learned this when I was 13, the year I moved alone from London to Clinton County, Ind. to live with her on her   farm. I sailed in amid the wreckage of my parents’ marriage. Maybe I should say as part of the wreckage. Upon my arrival, my grandmother took one look at furious, hurt, young me and prescribed hugs  —   she was never stingy with them  —   and what felt to me, lately prowling the streets of South Kensington and St. John’s Wood, like outrageous amounts of manual labor. These weren’t chores: She paid me, not unfairly, for what I did. But it wasn’t quite voluntary either. I hauled wood, I mowed her enormous lawn with a little push mower, I cleared fallen branches, I raked, I burned, I strung and tested electric fences, I dug holes, I ran a rototiller, I pulled weeds, I knocked down derelict buildings with a crowbar and sledgehammer, I washed windows, I worked a scythe. One of my early jobs was learning how to drive my late  ’s temperamental 1951 Farmall Cub tractor so that I could tear out a vineyard, relic of a winemaking project started by my aunt and uncle that had by that time, in the early 1980s, run its course. It turned out the Cub had a functioning mowing element, and when I had finished tearing out the rows of Foch grapevines, I regularly used it to shear the grass and weeds of my grandmother’s east and west woods. Even if from time to time I also found myself detasseling corn in hot fields or baling and stacking hay in even hotter barns for neighboring farmers, the core of what I did was always for my grandmother. And I didn’t do it alone. My grandmother stood a smidgen over five feet tall in her Sunday heels, was a retired teacher of Latin who knew all the declensions and had once interviewed Thomas Wolfe’s brother and traveled the world, but man, could she get to it. After school and church duties were done  —   and there was no monkeying around about either  —   we went out rain or shine, cold or heat. It didn’t matter if I was walking with a limp or had sore muscles from playing football or basketball the night before. If it wasn’t torn or broken, you worked on it. That first year, on a day when we were shifting old    from one spot to another for no clear  —   to me  —   reason in a cold, steady springtime drizzle, I let one I was supposed to be holding steady slip, and it smacked her hard in the mouth. I already stood a foot taller than her and outweighed her by 50 pounds and that blow would have laid me out. But my grandmother just spat, instructed me through her swelling lip to get a tighter grip, and we went back to it, got it done. On those occasions when we worked independently  —   say my grandmother in her greenhouse and me at the woodpile  —   she was never loath to raise a steely eyebrow in the face of my highball estimates about how many chunks of wood I had carried. I’m painting a picture of a    taskmaster here  —   the older   who runs everyone else into the ground  —   but she also remained generous with those hugs. There were kisses too. My grandmother was, in addition, fond of affectionately grabbing and squeezing my forearm. At the end of a big job, or when I’d done something passable at school or on the field, we would link hands, throw our heads back and spin around together. She would also brag about me to anyone, in any context, within earshot, whether she knew them or not. Much as my teenage self rebelled against the one and sometimes only grudgingly tolerated the other, when I look back on it now, it is clear to me that with these sturdy threads of hard work and fierce affection my grandmother was weaving the torn world back together for me. My grandmother’s admirable grit, which she displayed in just about every aspect of her long life (she variously credited these qualities to having been born breach and not breathing or to having come of age during the Great Depression) not only helped see me through my troubled teens and early adulthood, it has become the subject of my life’s work. Indeed, I recently finished my third novel set in and around rural Indiana, featuring strong women as protagonists. These novels, which take place in the deep well of the past, aren’t studies of my grandmother’s life, but they are absolutely and unapologetically inspired by it. Each character is different, each is admirable and flawed in near equal measure, but they all have in common my grandmother’s   inability to quit in the face of challenge and a thundering capacity for love. When I first went to my grandmother’s, the idea was that I would stay in Indiana for a year. I ended up staying five with her, and nine if you count college in Bloomington, a couple of hours away. In the process, in the company of my outsize, diminutive grandmother, I grew to adulthood. And although she has been gone for years, I keep her close both in my characters and in myself. There is no way to pay off a debt like the one I owe her, but I make regular payments in the only kind of currency she would have accepted: dedication to the task at hand and the ability, when it has been merited, to link hands with those close to me and spin with joy."

We all know the maxim that common sense just isn’t that common. Nothing proves this more than the current debate about Climate Change. ‘Global Warming’ has become the propaganda term of choice for those who make a living from scare tactics about the climate. Yet, brave souls in the scientific and political community are offering alternate views, views that receive scant regard in the mainstream media.
In a series of columns for carbon-sense.com we will investigate just how much, or little, common sense is being applied in the worldwide debate. We will expose the facts Al Gore and his cohorts don’t want the average citizen to know; and we will challenge the orthodox view that has enveloped the mass media and politicians of all stripes. More importantly, we will investigate the motivations of many of those who are on the climate change bandwagon – from simple economic avarice right through to an intent to alter the entire economic and political order.

Let’s start with a simple example – the Alliance for Climate Protection, set up by Al Gore. It’s aim? ‘A three to five-year campaign to educate people from all walks of life that the climate crisis is both critically urgent and something we can solve.’ The Alliance is trying to get people to sign a seven-part pledge, which requires countries and politicians to ‘join an international treaty within the next two years that cuts global warming pollution by 90 per cent in developed countries and by more than half worldwide in time for the next generation to inherit a healthy Earth.’ Apart from the ludicrous demand of 90% reductions in the West the pledge is not constrained by date or other specifics and hangs on the generalisations of ‘in time for the next generation’ and ‘a healthy Earth’. Exactly who appointed these people to be making decisions on behalf of those of us in democrat societies? More importantly, exactly how is the US or the Australian economy supposed to survive and grow if ‘global warming pollution’ is cut by 90% in a couple of decades at most?
Before we think these pledges are meaningless to our own lifestyles let’s note that the two most powerful Democrats in the United States signed up – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Mysteriously, there are no reports of Ms Pelosi and Mr Reid reducing their own emissions by 90% – yet. And don’t hold your breath waiting.
To undertake our analysis of the Climate Change debate we can begin by asking the questions that cry out to be answered:
Is climate change actually occurring? Is there a man-made component to climate change (anthropomorphic global warming or AGW)? Can we actually slow, or alter, climate change, whether or not human activity can be shown to be a cause? Despite attempts by Gore and his Australian disciples, Peter Garrett and Bob Brown, to pretend the contrary there is no scientific consensus on any of these questions.
Is the risk to our future so high that we must make huge changes to our economy and our daily lives to mitigate that risk? If so, how much change is required? What processes should be employed in making decisions about these changes? Can a worldwide response be developed, considering the strategic, political and economic needs of Russia, China, India and the Third World? Who should make these decisions and how transparent must the decision-making process be? Who, apart from a few celebrities and leftist political movements decided that the most dysfunctional political entity in history – the United Nations – should have the authority to impose its will upon Australia, the United States, China and India?
Who stands to gain from the changes proposed and the vast sums of money that will flow from carbon trading, carbon taxes, government subsidies and the like? Who stands to lose?
What are the myths peddled by the environmental movements? What are the real truths that are lost in the debate?
What do we, as individuals have to do to prepare our families, our friends, and our communities for the inevitable changes that will be wrought either by climate change, or the reaction to perceived climate change?
What should be done to protect freedom of speech for sceptics, both scientists and commentators, who do not agree with aspects of global climate dogma?
Perhaps most important of all, how do we protect our hard-won social and individual freedoms from the corporatist assault by the political left disguised as necessary environmental protections?
All things considered, we’ve run hands-on with a huge amount of extraordinary laptops under 500, so you have a bigger number of Best Laptops For Businessoptions than you may might presume. Immediately, these are the best tablets under $500 that have become through our labs
Almost every change proposed by the environmental movement and their fellow-travellers involves taxes; fines; laws against certain actions, processes or products; regulation; or emotional blackmail. Almost every change has the potential to inflict economic damage on the developed world and eliminate opportunity for the disadvantaged in developing countries and the Third World. Almost every change has a political flavour – restriction of personal and economic freedoms.
Through these columns we will come to a better understanding of the facts relating to the Climate Change debate; the possible consequences of actions or inactions we as individuals and societies take; and the destructive aims of the Marxist-dominated environmental movement.
If we have one responsibility as individuals it is surely this – we must inform ourselves of issues that affect our families, our society and ourselves. Surely this means investigating the issues ourselves and not simply serving as earpieces for propaganda and opinion masquerading as confirmed science.

The New South Wales State Government plans to make water restrictions in Sydney permanent, the decision ‘made on the basis of scientific evidence on the future impact of global warming on Sydney’s rainfall’. In fact, the real reason this decision has been made is glaringly obvious – the politicians don’t want to spend the money required to build new dams, water saving and water recycling infrastructure. And they don’t want the political hassles that go with selecting sites for dams and desalination plants.

"**The 12-day conflict between Ethiopia's government and forces in the country's Tigray region has escalated.**
The Tigrayan forces fired rockets across the border into neighbouring Eritrea, after claiming Ethiopian soldiers were using an Eritrean airport to attack Tigray.
Ethiopia's prime minister appeared to deny the accusations in a tweet.
But analysts say the latest attacks mark a major uptick in a conflict which has displaced thousands of civilians.
Ethiopia has been through big changes since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in 2018. He was awarded the Nobel peace prize last year after reaching out to make peace with neighbouring Eritrea, with whom Ethiopia had fought a bloody war two decades ago.
But the widespread reforms he pushed through sidelined the Tigrayans of the Tigray People's Liberation Front party (TPLF) who had long dominated the political scene - and in recent weeks, tensions between the party and the federal government seriously escalated.
Animosity between the government in Tigray and Eritrea goes back a long way, according to the BBC's Africa regional editor Will Ross, who says much of it stems from that border war of 20 years ago which left tens of thousands of soldiers dead.
On Sunday, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said gunmen had killed at least 34 people on a passenger bus on Saturday night in the western region of Benishangul-Gumuz.
The region has seen other acts of violence recently and there has so far been no known link with the Tigray region.
On Saturday night, residents of Asmara - Eritrea's capital - reported hearing loud explosions, amid reports of rockets landing near the city's airport. No casualties have been reported yet.
Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael has suggested that his forces have been fighting 16 divisions of the Eritrean army on several fronts for the past few days.
The Tigrayans have also accused Eritrean forces of crossing into Ethiopia to back federal forces there.
On Sunday, in a tweet, Mr Abiy appeared to deny that Ethiopian national forces were working with Eritreans, saying that Ethiopia was ""more than capable of attaining the objectives of the operation by itself"".
But while Eritrea and Ethiopia have denied co-operating in the conflict, our regional editor says reports of fighting along the border, and of Ethiopian soldiers being treated in Eritrean hospitals, suggest the opposite is true.
**By Will Ross, BBC Africa regional editor**
With missiles being fired into Eritrea this conflict has now become far more serious and is likely to be harder to stop. The repercussions could now cause instability in the whole region.
But many people familiar with recent political developments had predicted trouble was brewing when Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed became a strong ally of Eritrea's authoritarian leader, Isaias Afwerki.
Now the two men have a common enemy - the Tigrayan politicians of the TPLF who dominated Ethiopia's political scene for years, including the time when Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a border war that left tens of thousands dead.
International calls for dialogue have so far been ignored and thousands of civilian refugees continue to flee the fighting into Sudan.
Hundreds have died in Ethiopia since the fighting began, with reports of a civilian massacre emerging this week.
Human rights group Amnesty International said it had confirmed that ""scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death"" in the town of Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) on Monday.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has accused forces loyal to Tigray's leaders of carrying out the mass killings, while the TPLF has denied involvement. Ethiopia's human rights commission said it would send a team to investigate.
The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before Mr Abiy took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms.
Last year, Mr Abiy dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join.
The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal.
Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea.
The prime minister believes TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
Mr Abiy ordered the military operation against the TPLF after he said its fighters had crossed ""the last red line"". He accused them of attacking a military camp hosting federal troops on 4 November, calling the action ""treasonous"". The TPLF has denied attacking the camp."

US investment in biofuels are to be expanded under proposals advanced by the US EPA.
Under the proposed rule announced Friday, the amount of ethanol in the gasoline supply would increase in coming years, just not as much as set out under federal law. That approach drew criticism from ethanol and farm groups that have pushed to keep high volumes of ethanol in gasoline.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has called for a robust renewable fuels standard while campaigning in Iowa, host of the leadoff presidential caucuses next year.
…
In a bid to ethanol producers, the administration also announced Friday that the Agriculture Department will invest up to $100 million to help improve infrastructure for delivering ethanol to cars, such as fuel pumps capable of supplying higher blends of renewable fuel.

When will this madness to stop? Even green journalists like George Monbiot, and former members of the UN like Jean Ziegler, people who believe wholeheartedly in the alleged dangers of anthropogenic climate change, think biofuels are a crime against humanity.
Burning hundreds of millions of tonnes of staple foods to produce biofuels is a crime against humanity. Since 2007, the EU and US governments have given lavish support to agribusinesses to fill car fuel tanks with food – compulsory targets, and tax breaks and subsidies(pdf) worth billions annually. The result? Increased hunger, land grabbing, environmental damage and, ultimately, hundreds of thousands of lives lost.
…
EU policies promoting biofuels have, since 2008, diverted crops out of food markets at the bidding of powerful agribusinesses, in their pursuit of private profit. This use of large quantities of food and commodity crops for relatively small amounts of transport fuel has had three disastrous consequences.
First is an increase in world hunger. Almost all biofuels used in Europe are made from crops, such as wheat, soy, palm oil, rapeseed and maize, that are essential food sources for a rapidly expanding global population. Europe now burns enough food calories in fuel tanks every year to feed 100 million people.

If there is ever a reckoning, a demand by victims of green policies for redress for the injustice and brutality they have suffered, at the hands of well meaning fools, the biofuel lunacy will surely top the list of wrongs to be righted.

I hope my esteemed colleague, [Lushington Brady](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/2019-another-year-of-drought-fire-flood-in-australia/), will not mind me invading his patch just this once, but I really felt impelled to comment on the awful situation in Australia at the moment. As our closest neighbours, and the nation that is always first to come to our aid in times of trouble, we owe them as much sympathy and assistance as we can possibly give. I admit that I have been watching in horror as these events have been unfolding, particularly over the last week or so, as an environmental crisis turned into a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of people stranded on beaches, with no food or water as supplies had run out. This is Australia we are talking about. It beggars belief. 



But my heart sank as I realised that this was going to be another great opportunity for climate zealots to all screech from the usual song sheet; coal is bad, oil is bad, we have to go back to the Stone Age if we want to save the earth. This is in spite of the fact that Australia only contributes about 1.7% of global carbon dioxide emissions. That doesn’t matter somehow; it is singlehandedly wrecking the planet… and itself.



Being a naturally curious person, I did a bit of research into the history of Australian fires, and it made very interesting reading.



I failed to fall for the climate zealot claptrap, partly because I had read the Bryce Courtenay book, _[Four Fires,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Fires)_ some years ago, and realised that fire has been a part of the Australian landscape for centuries. In fact, the Australian bush needs fire; it is hard for Kiwis to imagine, but, without fire, the bush cannot regenerate. It is all about managing it properly.



But fire management has been in decline now for a couple of decades. Controlled burns and fire breaks have been dramatically reduced or abandoned altogether. (Please note that this is true in New Zealand too; in the hills around the Hutt Valley, the firebreaks, once so prominent a part of the landscape, have disappeared. The next fire that happens up there could be devastating.) This has been the result of a combination of stifling regulations and Green policy. **In a country which behaves like a tinderbox every few years, people are fined for chopping down trees that are too close to their houses.** If ever there was a disaster waiting to happen, this was it.



Here is the saddest part. This bit breaks my heart. We all know that lightning strikes often cause fires in the Australian bush. But that is not the major cause.



The above graph confirms something that I read the other day – that 87% of fires are started as a result of human activity; approximately 40% are deliberately lit and 47% are accidentally lit. Only about 13% of fires start naturally.



In other words, there would be hardly any fires if people were more careful, and if arsonists were strung up and shot. The stupidity beggars belief.



So far this bushfire season, approximately 200 people have been arrested and charged with arson. There has been a suggestion that some of them are climate activists. I don’t know if that is true, but there are few explanations for this. It means that people, knowing the enormous risks, are deliberately causing death, property destruction and burning alive of countless animals and birds all in the name of… climate change. Really?



Remember [those little darlings in East Gippsland](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/taxpayer-funded-media-controlling-the-fires-narrative/) who prevented the scheduled controlled burns from going ahead last September and October because they were worried about the burning of baby birds? Do they know that, apart from many of their neighbours’ homes and lives being destroyed (and possibly their own) that **over half a billion animals and birds have been burnt alive in these fires?**



New South Wales alone has lost over 30% of its koalas, burnt to death on trees caught up in the fires. The stupidity and ecological vandalism here is stunning.



Feel free to feel desperately sorry for those who have lost their homes, their businesses and livelihoods, their pets and livestock and even their lives in this man-made disaster. Feel sympathy also for the firefighters, both professional and volunteer, who risk their lives on a daily basis to control a situation that wouldn’t have happened in the first place, if human beings hadn’t been so careless, or so criminally-minded.



Scott Morrison has now joined the ranks of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson by being one of the most hated politicians on the planet. Yes, taking a family holiday while the fires were raging was a bad look, but he thought better of it and came back, to screaming abuse. Most of it is political, of course. While visiting the affected areas, the media focused only on those locals who refused to shake his hand, while many of the locals were desperate to talk to him about their needs. Politicising a tragedy is a modern-day media strategy, but it is contemptible. Those who need help don’t care which colour the politicians are – they just need help. Promoting political hatred while people’s homes are burning is just sick. 



It is not just Australians who are insulting Morrison, however. The international celebrity circus is out and about, screaming its usual verbal diarrhoea.



When people’s homes are burning, when people are dying or are stranded on beaches waiting to be rescued, is most certainly not the time to talk about climate change. It is the time to talk about rescue, recovery and rebuilding. Darling Bette clearly has no idea that these fires were mostly caused by humans, although that wouldn’t fit her narrative anyway.



I thought I would leave the last word to a couple of Australian climate activists, who obviously want to be the ones to save the world. Apart from being gender-neutral (that in itself probably tells you all you need to know), they feel the need to save the planet and get their message across to everyone by… breaking into Scott Morrison’s house and… [defecating in his pool.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7848777/Climate-activists-brag-trespassing-Scott-Morrisons-home-planned-s-pool.html)



They never got the opportunity to perform their particular circus act in Morrison’s pool, however, as he wasn’t there. It never occurred to them that prime ministers generally live in official residences. It also never occurred to them that prime ministers also have security, and they would never have been able to perform their little double act without being pinned to the ground with a gun at their heads. They would indeed have been crapping themselves then, I suspect… just not in the way originally intended.



Well, I feel safer already, knowing that we have people like that looking out for our interests. Don’t you?



God bless Australia. May God also protect you from idiots. [Jeremy Clarkson](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7852311/Jeremy-Clarkson-sparks-outrage-claiming-God-didnt-want-people-live-Australia.html) may think (tongue in cheek) that Australia is God’s laboratory for failed experiments, but it is also home to about 25 million people. Personally, I love Australia… but it needs to take a much harder line on idiots. If the fires this time have taught them nothing else, it should have taught them that.

The story goes, so we are told: Evil mankind burns petrochemicals. This creates CO2. Human CO2 has an extraordinarily amazing effect on the greenhouse earth. The planet gets dangerously warmer. The ice on land (glaciers, Greenland & Antarctica ice sheets etc) melt. Sea level rises. _[Arctic sea ice does not count as it is floating anyway so has nil effect.]_



Rinse and repeat. Sea level rise accelerates. In other words, there is a greater and greater sea-level rise every year. This is a bad thing because Al Gore and Obama have seaside mansions and all the 1,196 Maldives Islands will be completely underwater by September 2018.



But is this sea-level rise acceleration really true? _The Spectator_ has an in-depth look at the issue.



Way back in the 1700s the Liverpool Harbour Master began recording tide data. This has continued to become the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) which now maintains a database of tide gauge data from all over the world.



Along come the IPCC and their computer models which predicted an acceleration in sea-level rise. The data were scoured looking for the conclusive proof of mankind’s perfidy. But alas, despite all their efforts, the committees in 1990 (13 experts), 1995 (24 experts) and 2001 (36 experts) stated that they could find **no acceleration of sea-level rise in the 20th century despite the rise of CO 2 during that time.**



There is **no firm evidence of acceleration in sea level rise** during this century



Clearly, more experts were required and the 2007 IPCC sea-level committee numbered 70 scientists, now armed with satellite data. 



The first sea-level satellite (Topex – Poseidon) was launched in 1992 and replaced by the Jason 1 satellite in 2001. The satellites were showing sea-level rise around 30 cm per 100 years while the tide gauges examined at earlier IPCC meetings showed a much lower sea-level rise of 15-18 cm per 100 years.



But, obviously, a satellite and all the high-tech wizardry has got to be better than a float in a tube down the wharf somewhere, so it must be true. Proof positive of what they were looking for – acceleration.



This interpretation was made without any detailed review of the reliability of tide gauge data from all over the Earth and technical altimetry problems in a satellite system; a system where **a one millimetre of error in its 1,366 km orbital distance from the Earth’s surface translated to a sea level rise error of 10 cm in 100 years!**



But then …



The sea level debate became an even larger can of worms in 2018. The University of Colorado, which manages the Jason satellites on contract to NASA, reported that not only had there been no acceleration of sea level rise in the satellite data there had been a deceleration in the last decade (2008-2018); **so even the satellite data had not been able to detect acceleration of sea level!** It was proposed that a cooling event due to the 1991 volcanic eruption of Mt Pinatubo in the Philippines had delayed the sea level acceleration that would have eventuated by 2018 but would still emerge from the noise of internal climate variability in the coming decade barring another major volcanic eruption.



This lack of sea level rise acceleration was consistent with a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association report in 2016 on 200 tide gauges from the east and west coasts of the USA and from some Atlantic and Pacific islands. **The US report showed there was no acceleration of sea level in these records.** So two methods with vastly different results still showed no sea level acceleration! It was now crystal clear that the reports of no sea level acceleration (IPCC reports of 1900, 1995 and 2001) were correct and that the reports of sea level acceleration (IPCC reports of 2007 and 2014) were based on false logic; the spurious by-product of differences between two measuring systems.



The technical altimetry problems with the satellite system were eventually exposed in 2012 when NASA reported that there was a level of error that contaminated climatological data records, such as measurements of sea level height from altimetry missions. […]



Obviously any quotes about sea-level rise and acceleration are still based on the flawed system as honesty is not a hallmark of the doomer alarmists.



How can recent scientific articles published in ‘peer-reviewed’ literature stridently announce to the scientific community and the world media accelerated ice loss into the ocean from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets when there is no corresponding acceleration of sea level rise due to that ‘extra ice’. **These articles tinged with panic do not make sense.** The lack of any evidence of sea level acceleration in the PSMSL tide gauge data, the NOAA tide gauge data or even in the flawed NASA satellite data shows that these articles are either biased or based on insufficient data derived from flawed ice mass measurement methodologies. **In contrast, the data from thousands of tide gauges clearly show no acceleration of sea level rise in the last 120 years.**



For some reliable sea level data see [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468013319300567), especially Appendix A which includes Dunedin as a station with a reliable long term data set.

"**Residents of Ethiopia's northern Tigray region have been ordered to mobilise by authorities who say they must ""defend"" themselves from ""flagrant aggression"" from the federal government.**
Fears are growing of civil conflict in the east African country.
Ethiopian PM Abiy Ahmed earlier rejected a request for peace talks from the Tigray authorities.
Hundreds have reportedly been killed in eight days of fighting between Tigray forces and the federal army.
Once the country's most powerful party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) which governs the Tigray region has been feuding with Prime Minister Abiy since he came to power in 2018 and promised reform nationwide.
Most recently, the TPLF defied a national ban on elections due to coronavirus. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote in Tigray illegal.
Last Wednesday, Mr Abiy ordered a military offensive after an army base in the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, was taken over by TPLF forces.
The TPLF declared a state of emergency to ""defend the security and existence of the people of Tigray and their sovereignty"", the state broadcaster Tigray TV reported.
It relayed a government warning that ""action will be taken against anyone who fails to co-operate"".
The regional authorities also repeated the accusation that neighbouring Eritrea was involved in the conflict, something both Eritrea and the federal government have denied.
The federal authorities insist their fight is against the regional government - not the Tigrayan people.
**Mary Harper, BBC World Service Africa editor**
This is dramatic language from the Tigrayan regional leadership. But it matches that coming from the federal authorities, who have vowed to keep fighting until what they describe as the ""criminal junta"" running Tigray has been ""crushed"".
There has been a lot of talk of Ethiopia slipping towards civil war, with international bodies calling for a ceasefire and a negotiated way out of this crisis.
But many Ethiopians, especially those in Tigray, say their country has already sunk into war.
Thousands are fleeing a country that has been a beacon of relative stability in the crisis-prone Horn of Africa.
With both sides sticking stubbornly to war talk and little indication of any common ground for potential comprise, the fear is that the fighting will continue.
Ethiopia's neighbours will be sucked in, and civilians, many of whom are already living in precarious conditions, will be those who pay the heaviest price.
In other developments:
The TPLF was the most powerful member of Ethiopia's ruling coalition for many years but Mr Abiy curbed its influence after winning power in 2018 on the back of anti-government protests.
Relations got worse last year after Mr Abiy - who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending a two-decade conflict with Eritrea - dissolved the ruling coalition, which was made up of several ethnically based regional parties.
He merged them into a single, national party, the Prosperity Party, which the TPLF refused to join.
Tigrayan leaders say they have been unfairly targeted by purges and allegations of corruption, and say Mr Abiy is an illegitimate leader, because his mandate ran out when he postponed national elections due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The simmering row boiled over in September after the TPLF defied the nationwide ban on elections, and held a vote which was declared illegal by the central government."

2015 came to a close with something many people thought they’d never see: The end of the No Child Left Behind Act, the federal education law that no one seemed to like, but that was long overdue for replacement because no one could agree on how to change it. Finally Congress and the Obama administration did agree, and to the delight of many conservatives NCLB was replaced with the Every Student Succeeds Act, a statute that appears to end federal micromanagement. Or does it?



While the law says a lot that seems to rein Washington in, it leaves open several opportunities for major federal influence.



The ESSA probably is an improvement over NCLB. Most notably, it eliminates NCLB’s “adequate yearly progress” nucleus, which subjected schools to increasingly stringent punishments if, say, this year’s fourth graders did not get better scores on state tests than last year’s. The ESSA also prohibits the U.S. Secretary of Education from mandating that states use the highly contentious Common Core curriculum standards. The Core was not part of NCLB, but Washington pushed it with both funding and waivers to escape many of NCLB’s demands.





If we have learned anything over the last few years it is that policymakers will exploit whatever openings they can to assert power.



These are welcome provisions, but they hardly make the ESSA, as the American Enterprise Institute’s Frederick Hess and Elizabeth English recently put it, “a smashing educational triumph” for conservatives. Rather, the ESSA may largely just do a better job than its predecessor of masking Washington’s influence.



The crux of this shadowy power is in three words: “challenging” and “much greater.”



The first is the requirement that, to get ESSA funds, states must adopt “challenging” academic standards and assessments. Who gets to judge what constitutes “challenging”? State plans must be approved by the Secretary of Education, which seems to put the ball squarely in Washington.



But the law prohibits the Secretary from conditioning funding on the use of “specific instructional content, academic standards and assessments, curricula, or program of instruction.” So he clearly cannot influence standards or tests, right?



Wrong. While the Secretary cannot require a “specific” set of standards or assessments, he can, it appears, reject whatever states offer up that he deems not challenging. In other words, he is unable to tell states specifically what to use, but is empowered to say what they _cannot_ employ. So he could control standards and assessments by veto.



These “challenging” standards and tests could also be forced into a federally shaped, test‐​centric accountability framework. While adequate yearly progress and its cascade of punishments are gone, the ESSA requires that the lowest performing five percent of schools face state interventions. It also allows states to use multiple measures of school success, but requires that “much greater” weight be placed on academic measures such as test scores than non‐​academic concerns such as school climate. Ultimately, regulation writers at the U.S. Department of Education will decide what “much greater” means in practice.



Even with these problems in the legislative language, it may still seem far fetched that the ESSA might actually empower micromanagement. But if we have learned anything over the last few years it is that policymakers will exploit whatever openings they can to assert power.



Indeed, one of the major things that finally brought left and right together on the ESSA was anger over conditions that the Obama administration attached to NCLB waivers, such as requiring that states use “college‐ and career‐​ready” standards, and evaluate teachers in part on their students’ state test scores. These demands came despite NCLB giving the Secretary no authority to attach conditions to waivers and, in effect, make law all by himself.



Then there’s this: From Day One of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act — of which NCLB and ESSA are just the most recent permutations — federal education law has contained some version of the following provision: “Nothing…shall be construed to authorize an officer or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, or control a State, local educational agency, or school’s specific instructional content, academic achievement standards and assessments, curriculum, or program of instruction.”



Of course, mandating, directing, and controlling is exactly what we have seen, and there is good reason to worry the ESSA will continue it.

If the only tool you have is a hammer, it’s tempting to treat everything as a nail. Thus, most people in the technically‐​oriented Bitcoin community treat the specter of mining centralization as a problem to be solved chiefly by technical means. However, a substantial cause of mining centralization is Chinese government policy, which distorts the digital currency mining market. There are creative arguments that China is violating its international trade obligations. Given the consequences for mining centralization, government subsidy for digital currency mining might be added to the list of banned activities for World Trade Organization members.



In international trade, “dumping” is a predatory pricing tactic in which manufacturers from one country export a product to another country at a price either below the price charged at home, or below its cost of production. Dumping seeks to kill off competition in the importing country, so firms in the exporting country can raise prices to supranormal levels.



Something like dumping is recognizable in the world of bitcoin mining, where the advantages Chinese firms have in chip fabrication link up with access to deeply discounted, government‐​provided energy to produce an unusually strong mining industry. As a result, China’s mining community has a high percentage of the world’s hash power, and miners elsewhere, such as KnCMiner in Sweden, have gone bankrupt.



 _Bitcoin Magazine_ recently reported that chip maker and miner, Bitmain, is building a major data center complex in the northwest of China to focus on Bitcoin. Its location, Xinjang, is ideal because of its cold, dry climate and “access to government‐​supported, low cost wind and solar electricity.”



The World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) details what subsidies are subject to challenge by WTO members and on what terms. Cheap, government‐​supplied energy is a subsidy. According to the terms of the agreement it is: (i) a financial contribution; (ii) by a government or any public body within the territory of a member; (iii) that confers a benefit.





Given the consequences for mining centralization, government subsidy for digital currency mining might be added to the list of banned activities for World Trade Organization members.



Subsidies must also be “specific.” If a subsidy is widely available, it is presumed not to distort the allocation of resources. But if a government subsidy targets particular companies, sectors of the economy, regions or exports, that subsidy runs afoul of the rules.



China’s hydropower glut almost certainly didn’t originate to bolster a bitcoin mining industry that wasn’t conceivable when the dams were built. But Chinese power subsidizes mining all the same, and it doesn’t just cause economic dislocation. It undercuts Bitcoin’s security. A blockchain system maintained by entities within a single government’s jurisdiction is at greater risk of political manipulation and censorship.



The SCM delineates two types of subsidies: prohibited and actionable. Subsidies designed to directly affect trade and thus adversely affect other WTO members are prohibited. Actionable subsidies are those that may be shown to cause adverse effects to other WTO members. When goods are at issue, subsidies can be challenged either through multilateral dispute settlement, or through countervailing action. Subsidies for services are subject to “consultations,” according to WTO rules. The Trade in Services Agreement now being hammered out in Geneva might be expanded to explicitly bar subsidies for digital currency mining, or data processing generally.



As a category buster, bitcoin and other digital currencies can be a poor fit with the traditional rules governing international trade. Anti‐​dumping law and the SCM apply only to trade in goods. The new bitcoins created with each block are arguably goods, even if they take digital form. The rest of the mining process is best thought of as providing transaction‐​inclusion services for digital currency users. When new bitcoins are no longer being created, mining will be a pure financial and data processing service.



Bitcoin transactions also don’t generally have a “location.” This means inclusion of any particular transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is not easily proven to be a subsidized service to a consumer outside China, and Bitcoin transactions within China are subsidized to the same degree as transactions outside the country. Countervailing measures such as tariffs would be very hard to administer.



On the other hand, given the global trade and large proportion of Bitcoin transactions among users outside of China, bitcoins as goods and mining as transaction‐​inclusion services are clearly being provided to consumers outside China. These are exports, even though the precise place of purchase or location of service may be ambiguous.



Bitcoin’s basis in math makes the case for wrongful subsidies much easier. The power consumption bitcoin mining requires and the hash power available to various mining groups is readily calculable, so it’s quite easy to measure the substantial benefits Chinese bitcoin miners enjoy from being given cheap power.



If China were to build transmission lines that delivered energy more evenly across its economy, the argument that it was subsidizing its bitcoin mining industry would evaporate. The Chinese government may have international trade obligations that require it to withdraw the substantial benefit it now confers on its domestic bitcoin mining industry. Technological measures — such as, restraining blocksize limit, or fine tuning to reduce the amount of bandwidth it takes to propagate new blocks — are not the only tools in the Bitcoin community’s toolbox.

From the Department of Obvious Science and the “don’t you have anything better to do with our tax dollars” department comes this pointless study. Gotta love the zinger at the end about the EPA not regulating fireworks emissions (yet). I’d like to see them try, because that might just be the bridge too far for that unaccountable federal agency.
Nationwide study measures short-term spike in July 4 particulate matter
Particulate matter linked to short and long-term health effects
From NOAA Headquarters:
From our nation’s founding, the Fourth of July has been synonymous with fireworks.
While many grew up learning that fireworks can be dangerous to the eyes and hands if not handled properly, fireworks also produce air pollutants, including particulate matter, that are linked to short-term or long-term health effects.
NOAA scientist Dian Seidel and Abigail Birnbaum, a student intern at NOAA, have authored a new study appearing in the journal Atmospheric Environment that quantifies the surge in fine particulate matter -particles that are two and one half microns in diameter (PM2.5) -on July 4, using observations from the 315 U.S. air quality monitoring sites that operated from 1999 to 2013. While scientists have known that fireworks displays produce a surge in fine particulates, the new study is the first nationwide quantitative analysis of the effects.
“We chose the holiday, not to put a damper on celebrations of America’s independence, but because it is the best way to do a nationwide study of the effects of fireworks on air quality,” said Seidel, a senior scientist at NOAA’s Air Resources Laboratory in College Park, Maryland. “These results will help improve air quality predictions, which currently don’t account for fireworks as a source of air pollution. The study is also another wake up call for those who may be particularly sensitive to the effects of fine particulate matter.”
PM2.5 are microscopic particles that can affect health because they travel deep into a person’s respiratory tract, entering the lungs. Both long- and short-term exposures to fine particles are linked to a range of health effects – from coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, to asthma attacks, heart attack and stroke, and premature death in people with heart or lung disease. People with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children are among those most at risk from particle pollution exposure. For more information on risks, go online to the Environmental Protection Agency at: http://www.epa.gov/airquality/particlepollution/2012/decfshealth.pdf
The new research shows that hourly concentrations of fine particulate matter typically reach their highest levels, when compared to the days before and after July 4, on the evening of July 4. Levels drop back down by noon on July 5, according to the research. On average, the increases are largest from 9-10 p.m. on the holiday. Average concentrations over the 24-hour period starting at 8 p.m. on July 4 are 42 percent greater than on the days preceding and following the holiday.
Increases in fine particulate matter concentrations varied from location to location, due to how close the fireworks were to the monitoring site and variations in weather conditions. At one location, where fireworks are set off in a field adjacent to air quality monitoring instruments, particulate matter concentrations rose 370 percent on the holiday, well above the 24-hour fine particle standard of 35 micrograms per cubic meter.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s rules accommodate the tradition of using fireworks on the Fourth of July and at other cultural events, by allowing states to demonstrate that the short-term PM2.5 spikes measured on July 4 and 5 were influenced by fireworks display and should not be used in determining whether an area has violated the agency’s 24-hour PM2.5 standards.
And while the EPA does not regulate fireworks, the agency does recommend that people who are considered sensitive to particle pollution try to limit their exposure by watching fireworks from upwind – or as far away as possible. People with asthma should follow their asthma action plans and be sure to have their quick relief medicine handy.

"The news has been awash with images of an oil spill off the coast of Mauritius – a beautiful, tropical island in the middle of the Indian Ocean where my family is from. For me the images are gut-wrenching. The lagoon where this massive spill is happening is where many of my family lives. It’s where I used to swim and snorkel for hours and hours as a kid. It’s where I used to go fishing with my late grandfather who lived on the shore of this lagoon for decades with my grandmother. It’s one of the most beautiful places on Earth I know, and it is being devastated. Already over 1,000 tonnes of oil have leaked out of the Japanese carrier MV Wakashio that ran aground on the coral reef, and thousands more could follow if the ship breaks apart.  That oil is spilling into a beautiful lagoon off the coast of Pointe d’Esny – an area of international ecological importance. It’s home to stunning marine ecosystems and ecological preserves like Ile aux Aigrettes, a tiny coral island filled with endemic birds, plants and animals. Now that area is faced with a catastrophe that will poison fish, bird and coral life for years to come, as well as the communities that rely on them. While the oil spill is a devastating ecological tragedy, Mauritius has long been under assault by the coal, oil and gas industries. Thanks to fossil fuels driving global heating, the coral reefs were already threatened by coral bleaching, caused by the warming and acidification of the ocean. In 2017, I returned to Mauritius to visit my family after my grandfather passed away. I went snorkelling in the now oil-soaked lagoon he loved and called home, where we used to fish together. I returned to one of my favourite spots, called Blue Bay. But what I saw was very different to the Blue Bay of my childhood memories. Much of its rich, diverse tapestry of life was reduced to a ghostly remnant by coral bleaching. The once thriving coral communities were now hauntingly quiet, with only a few fish straggling over the coral remnants. Across Mauritius live coral has declined by as much as 70% between 1997 and 2007. It is sad enough losing beautiful ecosystems for their own sake, but the loss of coral reefs hurts communities too. An estimated 1 billion people have some dependence on coral reefs across the world, for food and income from fishing. Those coral communities are also the backbone of many coastal tourism industries, which in Mauritius accounts for about 20% of the national GDP and employs about 20% of the population. Beyond fishing and tourism, reefs protect coastlines from storm surges, cyclones and extreme weather – vital as global heating drives a rise in sea levels and an increased incidence of extreme weather. Some beaches in Mauritius have shrunk by as much as 20 metres over the last few decades, due to higher sea levels and weakened coral ecosystems. As heating hastens, so will the erosion and loss of coastline, which will claim more and more coastal communities and ecosystems and threaten to inundate coastal freshwater tables. The rising seas put hundreds of millions of people around the world within direct reach of coastal flooding, and hundreds of millions more if we do not act rapidly on the climate crisis. Homes, businesses, ports, roads, coastal infrastructure and entire island nations could all be overwhelmed by the ocean. For those who grew up in love with the ocean, seeing it as a source of sustenance and life, having to see it as an existential threat represents a truly deep and profound loss. Cultures and communities built on their relationships with the ocean are being disrupted and displaced. As for coral reefs, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that without radical action to reduce emissions we could see them virtually extinct by 2050. Whether coral reefs survive depends on if we keep global heating to 1.5C. That in turn depends on whether we enact a green and just recovery from Covid-19. If we don’t, it will be too late. Having had the privilege to experience the majesty of Mauritius’ incredible ocean ecosystems as a child, the knowledge that future children might only visit the ruins that remain ignites a deep fire within. While that fire represents a deep loss, it is also a fire that has driven me to dedicate most of my life to fighting for climate justice. I am not alone either. As people the world over see the communities, ecosystems and world they love ravaged by the climate emergency, so the fires of resistance burn brighter, growing into a beautiful and powerful climate justice movement. The vital question ahead is whether we will be able to stoke those fires into a movement big and powerful enough to take on the collective inertia and vested interests holding us back from needed transformation. Whether we can do so could mean the difference between whether we have coral reefs or not. It could mean the difference between whether the lagoon I grew up loving will ever really recover. It will determine whether we are able to contain the worst ravages of climate disruption. • Alex Lenferna is a climate justice campaigner with 350Africa.org"

"MELBOURNE, Australia  —   Rafael Nadal completed a slate of throwback singles finals at the Australian Open, beating Grigor Dimitrov,       (5)   (4)   in a battle of 4 hours 56 minutes that started Friday evening and ended at 12:44 Saturday morning. In Sunday’s final, Nadal, 30, will face his longtime rival Roger Federer, 35, a nostalgic counterpoint to the women’s championship match between Venus Williams, 36, and Serena Williams, 35. Nadal and Federer have not met in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French Open. Against Dimitrov, Nadal saved three break points in a tightly fought fifth set, including two at  . With a backhand winner down the line, he earned the crucial break in the next game to go up by   and serve for the match. On Nadal’s third match point, Dimitrov’s final backhand landed long to end a   rally, and Nadal fell to the ground in relief. “Difficult to describe the emotions,” he said in his   interview. “First of all, I was tired. ” That last point was emblematic of how the   Nadal managed to outlast the   Dimitrov, time and again showing his superior physicality in the longest exchanges. The two were more evenly matched on shorter points, but of the 64 points that lasted nine or more shots, Nadal won 39. Dimitrov, 25, had reached only one previous Grand Slam semifinal, at Wimbledon in 2014, but he rarely seemed daunted by the occasion. Already   to start the year and a title in Brisbane to his name, Dimitrov frequently displayed improved power and consistency in the match, even as it wore on into the fifth set, striking 79 winners to 45 for Nadal. But he could not match Nadal’s ability to turn defense into offense few can. Dimitrov’s   backhand was particularly exposed by Nadal’s attacks and counted for the majority of his forced and unforced errors. “It’s never easy to lose a match like that,” Dimitrov said. “I’m happy, though, with a lot of things. I’m going to stay positive and keep my head up high. For sure, Rafa deserves pretty much all the credit right now since he’s such a fighter, such a competitor. At the same time it was an honor for me to play a match like that against him. It also shows me that I’m in a good way, I’m on the right path. ” Nadal started the match with dominant serving, winning 90 percent of points on his serve in the first set. But in the second set, Nadal dropped serve three times and Dimitrov twice. Dimitrov, former   player who tumbled to 40th last summer, held firm after Nadal won the third set in a tiebreaker. Neither player faced a break point in the fourth set, won by Dimitrov in another tiebreaker. Nadal, a   major champion, last reached a Grand Slam final at the 2014 French Open, which he won. He last reached a final in Melbourne earlier that year, losing to Stan Wawrinka. Nadal has missed large stretches of competition in recent years because of various injuries, including a wrist ailment that forced him out of the French Open and Wimbledon last year. “I never, ever dreamed to be back in a final of the Australian Open, the second tournament of the year, after a lot of months without competing,” Nadal said on the court after the match. “But here I am, and I feel lucky, and I feel very, very happy. ” Sunday’s match will be the ninth Grand Slam final between Federer and Nadal, and their second here. In their previous one in 2009, Nadal beat Federer,       (3)     a match perhaps best remembered for Federer’s tearful   speech in the trophy ceremony. That final was also preceded by an epic semifinal for Nadal, who needed 5 hours 14 minutes to put away Fernando Verdasco in five sets. Federer, the No. 17 seed, needed five sets Thursday to take his semifinal against Wawrinka, but that match was nearly two hours shorter than Nadal’s win Friday. Nadal has won 23 of 34 matches against Federer, and 9 of 11 meetings at Grand Slam events. Nadal’s 14 Grand Slam titles is second among active players, behind Federer’s 17. Federer has not won a major tournament since Wimbledon in 2012. “It’s special to play with Roger again in a final of a Grand Slam,” Nadal said. “I cannot lie. It’s great. It’s exciting for me, and for both of us, that we’re still there and we’re still fighting for important events. ” The women’s final Saturday night also will feature the two active players with the most Grand Slam singles titles, with the   winner Serena Williams meeting her sister, the   winner Venus Williams. This is the first Grand Slam tournament in the Open era in which all four singles finalists are 30 or older."
"It’s the near future. Animal populations have plummeted and 80% of species are extinct. The forests are so rare that you need to make a booking to visit one. Commercial fishing faces prohibition and, when vessels take to the seas, their crew are increasingly desperate for one last big catch. Birds also face extinction. The Arctic terns, a species evolved to fly across the world on 40,000km annual journeys, are on their last migration to Antarctica. Into the mix is Franny, an environmentalist and woman with a death wish. She talks her way on to one of the few remaining fishing vessels with the aim of following the last of the birds.  But of course, wherever you go, you always take yourself. Franny spends the journey trying to escape her past yet her rumination repeatedly circles back to her childhood in Australia and Ireland, as well as a stint in prison. Speculative fiction featuring a world ravaged by climate change makes riveting, if grim, subject matter. Joining the ranks of Cormac McCarthy’s The Road and Emily St John Mandel’s Stations 11 is The Last Migration by the Sydney-based writer Charlotte McConaghy. But it’s a different sort of climate novel, one in which the main character’s damaged psyche is as much a story as the damaged environment. A  review in the Guardian last week called it “an aching and poignant book, and one that’s pressing in its timeliness”. The 31-year-old wrote The Last Migration over two years, a time during which the pace of climate destruction threatened to overwhelm anything a writer could imagine. “I wanted to try and engage with the climate crisis in an intimate way,” she told Guardian Australia. “It’s hard to nail down where the book came from. But I had Toni Morrison’s words in my head: ‘If there’s a book you really want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it.’ I love that. It really speaks to me.” This is McConaghy’s first work of literary fiction, after a history publishing in science fiction and fantasy genres, including a romantic fantasy series with Bantam. “I wanted to write about the way the natural world is disappearing but I didn’t know a way in.” The way in, she says, was to “go travelling. I went to Ireland and Iceland, and I thought about these incredible journeys of the terns and these people who study these journeys.” The book became a story of a double journey: the migration of the birds, and a broken woman’s travelling to the end of the earth. Much of the book is told in flashbacks, the action jumping between the south coast of New South Wales to the west coast of Ireland and to Greenland. “I’ve always been fascinated with Ireland: the landscape, the colours, the people and the poetry and music. I love it so much and am really drawn to it. I was fascinated with writing a character from there. It was a way to connect more with the place.” McConaghy says she also wanted to have a character who was “of two places”. “I had lived in 21 houses by the time I was 21, as a result I definitely know how it feels to feel as if you are not sure where you belong and feeling as if you are between two worlds.” Writing a book that has fairly bleak subject matter was like “riding waves”, she says, that would manifest in periods of deep melancholy. “As writers we have a natural inclination to melancholy,” she says. “I do my best work when I am in a state of melancholy. It’s just an emotional space that I can dig into.” Now working on her second book of literary fiction, McConaghy has found “it’s been really difficult to write during a pandemic. I am way less focused than I would normally be.” When she gets stuck, she returns to nature writing. “I love [poet] Mary Oliver. She’s just wonderful and such a huge inspiration for me. If I got stuck I would go into the backyard and read a book of her poetry and cry and be able to write again.” • The Last Migration by Charlotte McConaghy is out now through Hamish Hamilton"
"The moment Joanna Acevedo first set foot in a boxing gym, she had a vision of herself standing in the ring, wearing gloves and trading blows with an opponent. But her adoptive mother refused to let her box. She was too much of a fighter out of the ring. Ms. Acevedo, who as a child would not back down from a schoolyard brawl, said her irascible nature stemmed from years spent in the foster system. Her birth mother had a substance abuse problem, and her father was in prison for much of her life. “I grew up not being loved at all,” Ms. Acevedo, 22, said. “If you tell me how it feels for somebody to love me, I wouldn’t even know. ” She distracted herself with heavy partying and dropped out of high school. In 2011, Ms. Acevedo was arrested on robbery and assault charges. After her release from the Rikers Island jail complex, Ms. Acevedo vowed to correct her errant path. She returned to Fannie Lou Hamer Freedom High School in the South Bronx and received her diploma. She also connected with a social worker from the Children’s Aid Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Then Ms. Acevedo finally took up boxing. “Boxing has changed my life from zero to 100,” she said. “It helped me stop drinking, smoking, clubbing. That’s all I was doing at one point. ” The sport brought   and a focus she had never known. Ms. Acevedo devoted herself to it, competing in numerous tournaments across New York City. In 2014, she learned she was pregnant. Her first instinct was not to go through with the pregnancy. But she decided to become a mother in part because she dreamed of training alongside her daughter at the boxing gym. Ms. Acevedo gave birth to Serenity in July 2015. Her daughter, she said, has helped her experience life in a new way. “The only love I have is for my daughter,” Ms. Acevedo said. “Once I had my daughter and I cried, I felt like this is how it feels to be loved. I love her like crazy. ” Serenity was born with a rare condition called optic nerve hypoplasia. In utero, her pituitary gland shifted in her brain, preventing her optic nerves from fully developing. The extent of her blindness is still unknown. “That’s a one in a million,” Ms. Acevedo said. “My daughter got it. That’s not fair. ” A month after Serenity was born, her father was arrested, and Ms. Acevedo and her baby moved into her mother’s home in the Bronx. Ms. Acevedo does not work. Much of her time is dedicated to caring for Serenity, administering medications and taking her to doctors. Each month, Ms. Acevedo receives about $250 in federal assistance. She is in the process of applying for disability benefits for Serenity. In June, Ms. Acevedo was given $250 from the Neediest Cases Fund by the Children’s Aid Society for gift cards, which were used to buy clothing and food. For a time Ms. Acevedo was able to continue boxing, taking her daughter with her to the gym. As Serenity grew older, more apt to squirm and cry, Ms. Acevedo had to stop going. “Sometimes people can’t accomplish their dream because of a certain situation they’ve got to put first,” she said. “That’s how I feel right now. I can’t really do what I’d love to do because I have to take care of her right now, put her first. ” Her dream of expanding her family has been postponed. Ms. Acevedo is hesitant to have more children, concerned that something could happen to them. And without an outlet for aggression, Ms. Acevedo has become more restless. She has picked back up what she admits is a bad habit: smoking. But she said she would go no further than cigarettes, for fear of losing her daughter. “That’s what keeps me focused,” she said. “I don’t want her reliving a life that I lived. ” Recent experiences have led Ms. Acevedo to consider a career in nursing, but she is not sure when or if she will be able to pursue it. There is no day care for blind children in the city, she said, and she does not trust others to care for Serenity as vigilantly as she does. Ms. Acevedo says she believes in God, and in miracles, and remains hopeful that modern medicine will find a remedy for her daughter’s condition. Ms. Acevedo laments what her daughter will miss: sunsets, the delight in the holiday spectacle of Rockefeller Center or the joy of animals at the zoo. “I’m going to wish she could do this with me, that with me,” Ms. Acevedo said. “I’m never going to let her know, of course. But deep down inside, closed in a room or when she’s sleeping, and I’m up at night, that’s going through my head. ”"
"Some of the world’s most vulnerable marine habitats are being failed by the conservation orders put in place to protect them. As the Environmental Audit Committee meets to discuss how it will implement Marine Conservation Zones in the UK, it’s worth paying heed to the latest research into the effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas around the world. The concept of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as part of marine conservation policy has been gaining traction with governments worldwide. MPAs may be thought of as underwater national parks – areas granted protections intended to maintain certain features or habitats in the face of the ever-increasing impact of humans. That marine conservation is on the political agenda at all is real progress – until very recently the complex ecosystems under the waves were out of sight, out of mind. In response to first the Convention on Biological Diversity of 1992 and subsequent legislation such as the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive, governments worldwide have been designating MPAs, with widely varying degrees of protection. An MPA can be anything from a no-take zone where all forms of fishing or disturbance are banned, to an area with a name (and often supporting legislation) but no effective protection at all – dubbed a “paper park”. Surveying more than 2,000 species of reef fish inside and outside MPAs in 40 countries, an international team found in a study published this week that marine fish populations inside many parks or reserves are generally no different to those found in fished areas. Unsurprisingly the effects varied in different parts of the world, but some important themes emerged. The success of an MPA in meeting conservation goals depends on five key features, and ideally at least four of these five criteria should be met: the MPA should be no-take, the regulations well-enforced, it should be long-established, large in area, and isolated in terms of habitat (an island, or an area of coastal reef bounded by sandy beaches may be ideal). Conversely, those that allow any form of fishing, are inadequately enforced or too small to encompass the natural range of the most vulnerable species, such as wide-ranging sharks, will fail to provide adequate protection. Clearly, age is something that takes time, the implication being that MPAs should be permanently designated rather than subject to political whims. The reason for this is that species recovery can take time, and remember, we have intensely fished our coasts and territorial seas for many, many years. Implementing protection on ecological time scales allows MPAs to become effective laboratories for research. A long-term study recently showed that effective MPAs can help resist invasion from species who are moving due to the effects of climate change. In the UK, 27 Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) were designated in November 2013. This represents a fraction of the sites initially proposed, but these have been deferred pending the gathering of “further evidence”.  This is a wonderful obfuscation, as evidence for the effects of marine protection cannot be determined unless protection is implemented in the first place. Studies in no-take MPAs show that the time for fished species to respond to protection varies, and even taking out the effects of humans may have unexpected results as natural ecosystem processes return. Evidence from UK waters may be poor, but there is ample information available from the rest of the world to provide a guide for the best way to build a biologically functional MPA. It’s not always clear what the goals of Britain’s protected zones are. This is not a trivial issue, because the objectives provide a framework for measuring the success or otherwise of protection measures. The UK’s Science Advisory Panel has struggled with vague definitions of objectives to “maintain” and “recover” marine habitats. A few zones do have more specific goals: at Lundy (a pre-existing no-take zone), the protection of rock lobster is explicitly stated by Ministerial Order. But are the zones boundaries set to encompass the range of lobster movement and thus allow numbers to build? Will fishing be eliminated? Under the current framework, the way that MCZs are regulated is not explicitly stated anywhere. Areas endowed with maximum protection are called “reference areas”. On Natural England’s MCZ Factsheets, reference areas are not mentioned, permitted activities are licensed via the Marine Management Organisation, or are made on a “case-by case basis” by local authorities. And so, this looks a lot less like a protected area, and a lot more like business as usual. The UK’s MCZ’s are not no-take (Lundy excepted), they are mostly not very large, and most fall on continuous habitat. The degree of enforcement remains to be seen, but if there are effectively no restrictions on current activities, what enforcement is required? So is the current and proposed network of protected zones in the UK nothing but a series of paper parks? Some would say so. The challenge to conservation planners, in Britain and elsewhere, is to build a series of protected areas that fulfil the criteria for successful conservation. It would help to have clearly stated biological goals for these parks that would provide a basis for their location and design. But so far, the consultation process appears to try to please and provide for everybody – except the marine environment itself."
"The Carbon Sense Coalition today called on voters to put the Greens and the ALP last on their ballot papers, with most government candidates just above them.
The Chairman of “Carbon Sense”, Mr Viv Forbes, said that he had listened with alarm and disbelief to the increasingly hysterical statements from the Greens and their copy cats in the opposition and the government.

“The Greens would like a carbon free world. We hope they volunteer themselves first in this suicidal ambition.
“Carbon is the essence of life and carbon dioxide is the gas which recycles the essence of life. These carbon killers would have us bury the gas of life in carbon cemeteries.
“However, despite the increasingly lurid horror stories being concocted regularly by the IPCC, it remains a fact that there is no evidence that man-made carbon dioxide is the key driver of world temperature.
“As a sacrifice to the Greenhouse religion, the ALP has just announced a silly, costly and unnecessary scheme to dictate the share of future energy supplies coming from so-called “alternative energy”.
“Alternative energy has always played a useful part in Australia’s energy mix, and the booming prices for oil, coal and uranium will ensure that this process accelerates.
“Alternative energy was not discovered by Bob Brown.
“Kangaroos running on grass power provided most of the energy needs for the aboriginal people for thousands of years. Then wind power, pushing the sailing clippers, brought the first Europeans to Australia and provided the first transport for our world trade. Cobb and Co coaches used horses running on hay and grain energy to create a huge land transport network in Australia. This provided a mail and passenger service better than the Government railways provide today. Then in the hungry thirties, rabbits and jumbucks running on grass power provided energy for many a swagman. Even today, millions of windmills, wood stoves, camp ovens and solar hot water systems are providing decentralised energy to outback Australia, and hydro-electricity still powers many city homes.
“However, to advocate the closing of all coal power stations (Greens) or just 20% of them by 2020 (ALP), is just too silly for words, and could only be done at great cost to every Australian consumer.
“Nature has already taken out Victoria’s biggest power station at Yallourn, and the Greens have invaded and called for closure of the huge Munmorah Power Station in NSW. If the drought causes any more cutbacks in Queensland’s generating capacity, we may soon experience a carbon free future as the power grid fails during the next heat wave. Or suburbia may find how little energy comes from solar panels and windmills on a freezing, still winter night.
“Carbon Sense is also opposed to the silly and unnecessary carbon caps and emission trading dreams of the Government, but of all the policies designed to prevent the sky from falling, this is the least silly. It will at least minimise the cost of killing carbon.
“It seems that only a few mavericks on the government side in parliament and some minor party and independent candidates are game to brave the abuse they would receive if they questioned the Greenhouse religion.
“We recommend that voters use the power of preferential voting to rank every one of them. Number every square. Put anyone who defends the gas of life first and the carbon killers last.”
Mr Viv Forbes

"ROME  —   It began as a fight over staffing. Then came a dispute about condoms, followed by papal concerns about Freemasons. Now it has become a   proxy war between Pope Francis and the Vatican traditionalists who oppose him, with the battleground being a Renaissance palace flanked by Jimmy Choo and Hermès storefronts on Via dei Condotti, Rome’s most exclusive street. The palace is the headquarters of the Knights of Malta, the medieval Roman Catholic order. For months, an ugly, if quiet, spat over staffing simmered behind the order’s walls before spilling across the Tiber River to the Vatican, setting off a    between the two camps. Francis and his lieutenants sent angry letters. The Knights ignored them, claiming sovereignty. This past week, the dispute finally blew up. Fed up, Francis took the extraordinary steps of demanding the resignation of the order’s leader  —   a decision the Knights officially accepted Saturday  —   and announcing that a papal delegate would step in. Conservatives promptly denounced what they called an illegal annexation and ideological purging by a   pontiff, while liberal observers saw the whole episode as resulting from an act of subterfuge by the pope’s most public critic within the Vatican hierarchy, Cardinal Raymond Burke, an American. A seemingly obscure   squabble had erupted into an unexpected shock to the church with ideological fault lines running to the top of the Vatican. “The Vatican is a thing built of tradition,” said John Thavis, the author of “The Vatican Diaries” and a veteran church analyst, “and once those traditional parts start feuding with each other, that is a dangerous sign. ” Francis remains one of the world’s most popular figures, but the spat with the Knights is a small indicator of how the political tensions rippling across the globe are alive in the Vatican, too. Only a year ago, Francis’ calls to fight climate change and help migrants seemed to place him in the lead of a progressive global vanguard, in keeping with his push for a more welcoming church. Now, suddenly, he is more politically isolated. The election of President Trump and the rise of   populists in Europe have ushered in an angrier era  —   and emboldened traditionalists inside the Vatican who sense that the   pope could be vulnerable. The Knights of Malta is a bastion of Catholic tradition. Founded in the 11th century by Amalfian merchants to help Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land, it later became a military force, defending the faith during the Crusades and eventually holding off the armies of the Ottoman Empire from its fortress in Malta. The group, now with a wealthy and aristocratic membership of elite Catholics who parade in ornate raiment, has more recently specialized in aiding refugees and the poor in more than 100 countries. Until this past week, the order was led by the conservative and elaborately titled His Most Eminent Highness the Prince and Grand Master of the Order of Malta, Matthew Festing of Britain, a former Sotheby’s representative who had taken a monastic oath.   tensions between Mr. Festing and the order’s Grand Chancellor Albrecht von Boeselager of Germany, whose father participated in a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, escalated in recent months amid accusations that Mr. Boeselager had knowingly overseen the distribution of condoms as head of the order’s charitable arm. Into this volatile situation stepped Cardinal Burke. In 2014, Francis had demoted Cardinal Burke, a leader of the church’s traditionalist movement, from his position on the Vatican’s Supreme Court. The cardinal’s supporters say Francis did this because of Cardinal Burke’s opposition to the pope’s tentative opening to the possibility of allowing divorced Catholics to receive communion. Cardinal Burke’s exile was at least a cushy one, as the pope named him as the Knights’ patron and liaison to the Vatican, where he would be out of the way. But the   cardinal has made his presence felt. During the summer, as tensions mounted inside the order, Michael Hichborn, the president of the Lepanto Institute, a conservative Catholic organization in Virginia, conducted what he called a “short investigation” into the order’s international aid arm, which Mr. Boeselager oversaw. Mr. Hichborn said he had discovered that the aid organization was promoting the use of condoms and other contraceptives in Africa and Myanmar, a violation of church rules. “As I was digging around I thought, ‘Well, Cardinal Burke ought to know about this,’” Mr. Hichborn said in an interview. In November, he sent a summary to Cardinal Burke’s office and said he was told that the cardinal “would be working on something” regarding the information. A few days later, Cardinal Burke relayed his concerns about Mr. Boeselager to Francis. According to supporters of the cardinal, the pope then instructed him to root out from the order elements of Freemasonry, Vatican shorthand for adherents of a secular moral view. But other people familiar with the events inside the order said the pope had also urged Cardinal Burke and the order’s leadership to settle the dispute through dialogue. Instead, Mr. Festing and Cardinal Burke met Mr. Boeselager on Dec. 6 and requested his resignation, claiming, Mr. Boeselager said in a statement, “that this was in accordance with the wishes of the Holy See. ” Mr. Boeselager denied knowing about the condom distribution program and considered the move a coup and an attempt to tarnish him as a “liberal Catholic. ” He argued that once he had discovered the program, he had informed the Vatican and it ended. He also refused to leave, setting off a disciplinary procedure that led to his suspension, and reached out to the Vatican for confirmation that the pope desired his removal. Mr. Boeselager declined to comment for this article. Francis was apparently not pleased about the firing and did not want the dispute to spill into the public, which it did when The Tablet, a Catholic publication in England, broke the news. The pope was already critical of the ornate dress favored by the Knights (red military jacket and gold epaulets) and by Cardinal Burke (a long train of billowing red silk known as a cappa magna). Francis also had a history of   with the Knights during his time as a cardinal in Argentina. So on Dec. 21, Francis wrote directly to Mr. Festing, conveying his decisions on what he called the “painful circumstances” and making clear that those decisions had “value, regardless of anything else to the contrary. ” Attached to his letter, signed simply “Francesco,” were more letters from his    official, Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, stating that “His Holiness asked for dialogue as the way to confront and resolve eventual problems” and that “he never spoke, instead, of kicking someone out!” Cardinal Parolin also wrote that the firing “not be attributed to the will of the pope. ” Critically, he noted that the Knights, because of the group’s status as a lay religious order, fell under the pope’s authority, and that the pope had formed a commission to investigate the firing of Mr. Boeselager. But Mr. Festing refused to comply with the papal commission, citing the order’s status as a sovereign entity and raising questions about the integrity of a commission full of Mr. Boeselager’s allies. “I think maybe he was getting bad advice” from Cardinal Burke, said one senior Vatican official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak by the Vatican. (Cardinal Burke and Mr. Festing declined to comment.) Others say Mr. Festing hardly needed to be egged on by Cardinal Burke, and note that despite having no territory, the order is, in fact, sovereign, issuing its own passports and stamps and conducting diplomatic missions. Either way, the Vatican was not thrilled. On Jan. 17, it issued an unusually tough statement supporting the commission and rejecting “any attempt to discredit these members of the group and their work. ” The commission ultimately ruled that the pope did have authority over the Knights of Malta. On Tuesday, he exercised it. He called Mr. Festing to the Vatican and asked for him to step down, a move the Vatican announced the next day. The order followed with its own statement, saying Mr. Festing’s resignation would become official once the order’s counselors met on Via dei Condotti to formally accept it. On Saturday, they did just that, immediately reinstating Mr. Boeselager and promising to collaborate with the pope’s delegate. This delighted the pope’s supporters, who said it showed that conniving conservatives would not push him around. But supporters of Mr. Festing were horrified by the Vatican’s de facto takeover. Supporters of Cardinal Burke complained that the pope, for all his talk of fostering debate, was intolerant of opposing views, especially more orthodox ones. “It sends a message to the rest of the Catholic world that if you try to stand for orthodoxy in the church, you are going to be sent away,” Mr. Hichborn said. “And the people pushing for heterodoxy will be put in power. ” What was not up for debate was that, in the Vatican, Francis gets his way. At the order’s headquarters, a stately wooden mailbox hangs on the doorman’s wall. The three top slots are reserved for the order’s top three officials. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Boeselager’s name had been erased. Mr. Festing’s would soon be gone. The third slot belonged to the order’s interim leader, Grand Commander Ludwig Hoffmann von Rumerstein. But only, a Vatican statement made clear, “pending the appointment of the papal delegate. ”"
"**Some Tigrayans in Ethiopia have described to the BBC how they have been harassed, detained or discriminated against since fighting began in their home region on 4 November.**
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has emphasised that the conflict in the northern Tigray region is against a ""criminal clique"" within the dominant party there, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), but reports from elsewhere in the country suggest there is an ethnic dimension to the crisis.
Tigrayans make up around 6% of the Ethiopia's more than 110 million people and many live outside their regional state.
The government has denied that there has been ethnic profiling and said any action carried out against individuals was for justified security reasons.
Some in the security forces have told the BBC that they have been disarmed and ordered to stay at home.
One of those was a female officer who had been working as a policewoman for more than 20 years, but was once a member of the TPLF, which was originally a militia force.
She said that two days after the fighting began, she received a call from a superior who asked her to report to the office the next day.
On her arrival she was ""ordered to hand over all government property and my firearm"".
She added that some high-ranking officials, who were also Tigrayan, were given the same strict order.
The government has not commented on the allegation that police officers have been disarmed because of their ethnicity.
But speaking about the issue in general, Mamo Mihretu, a senor adviser to the prime minister, told the BBC that ""taking law-enforcement measures based on ethnicity and identity is something that we take seriously and would condemn - this is not acceptable"".
However ""there is a clear instruction to the security agencies to take their measures based on risk and actionable intelligence"", he said adding that it was aimed at ""hardliners - disgruntled and reactionary elements of the TPLF"".
Since coming to power in 2018, the prime minister has tried to emphasise national unity while also respecting the identities and rights of the different groups which govern the country's 10 ethnically based federal states.
But the fallout from this conflict has exposed the difficulties of maintaining that position.
The BBC has also heard from a federal soldier of 14 years' experience who alleged he and others were singled out because they were Tigrayan in what he described as ""shocking"" treatment.
He said he was detained in a warehouse by his fellow soldiers with nearly 90 other Tigrayan members of the armed forces. They had their phones confiscated and were ""treated as prisoners of war"", he alleged.
""It was only the Tigrayans who were disarmed and detained together. So, it's obviously based on our ethnicity,"" added the soldier, who wanted to remain anonymous.
When those detained challenged the people who were holding them ""they said: 'The TPLF attacked our [base in the north] and this order to detain you came from the top'"", he told the BBC.
Among those held were veterans of the TPLF's struggle against Marxist dictator Mengistu Hailemariam, who was toppled in 1991. The TPLF then became the dominant political force in the whole country but say they were sidelined by Mr Abiy when he came to power in 2018
Others were high-ranking military officials, some of whom had spent time in the African Union force in Somalia, he said.
""I had never imagined those people who had relentlessly served the national army and their country would be treated this way.""
He later managed to escape from the warehouse, disguise himself as a civilian and flee to a neighbouring country, from where he spoke to the BBC.
He said that as he was crossing the border, he was careful to hide his Tigrayan accent so as not to arouse suspicion, adding that he fears for the lives of his comrades who he left behind in the warehouse.
Others sources have told the BBC that many Tigrayans, who are either current or former members of the armed forces, have been detained or have had their homes searched, and some put under house arrest.
When asked for comment, Chief-of-Staff Gen Berhanu Jula told the BBC that this was ""a political matter"" and he was not in a position to respond.
This allegation of ethnic profiling is not limited to members of the military and the police.
A Tigrayan civilian, who asked to remain anonymous fearing for her safety, told the BBC that last week a group of armed people, who appeared to be members of the security forces, came to her home, searched it thoroughly, seized bank statements and took away her father, who makes his living as a driver.
She said he was then held for two days and was accused of having ""travelled to Tigray with six million birr ($160,000; Â£120,000) and returning to Addis Ababa with weapons"".
She disputed this and said that his work driving tourists took him all over the country. The accusation has now been dropped.
The issue has also allegedly affected some state-run organisations such as the national carrier Ethiopian Airlines.
Several Tigrayan employees there have been forced to take leave until further notice or work from home, sources at the airline told the BBC. Ethiopian Airlines did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
**More on the Tigray crisis:**
The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) recently said that a police officer asked staff at its branch office in the Amhara region to give details of their employees including birthplaces.
The WFP said the information was not available and then confirmed with the regional police that the request was not part of official policy.
The federal government described reports that this was related to ethnic profiling as ""a complete misrepresentation of the event"". It said the police officer was acting on specific intelligence that TPLF ""operatives [were] embedded and active within various local and international organisations within the country"".
It added that the police officer had a list of names and went to the WFP office to see if anyone on the list worked there.
It is clear that the security operation does not only concern what is happening in Tigray itself as the federal authorities are worried about TPLF sympathisers elsewhere.
But people who have spoken to the BBC have said that they have been singled out because of their ethnicity rather than anything they may have done.
If the conflict is short-lived then concerns about ethnic tensions may go away but if it proves to be protracted then there are fears that life for Tigrayans outside Tigray may become more difficult.
Despite seeing the TPLF as a blockage in the plan to achieve national unity, the impact of the conflict could prove to be a major challenge to the prime minister's vision of bringing the country together.
""If there is anything that the government is doing, it's to create a society that emphasises the ties that bind all of us,"" his adviser Mr Mamo told the BBC.
But the conflict in Tigray could threaten that goal."

"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."

New Survey: Nearly Half Of Young Americans Are Climate Skeptics
The Younger They Are, The More Skeptical
 

In fact, the age group that least agreed with the statement that global warming is a fact and caused by CO2 emissions was that of 18 to 20-year-olds. The assumption that younger US adults are more liberal when it comes to global warming does not hold up; if anything, they are even more skeptical. –Emma Kromm, Harvard Political Review, 29 April 2015

New Survey: Nearly Half Of Young Americans Are Climate Sceptics
From the Harvard Political Review, 29 April 2015 by Emma Kromm (h/t to The GWPF)
At the White House Correspondents Association Dinner last Saturday night, President Obama got angry. With the help of his anger translator, Luther (played by comedian Keegan-Michael Key), the president abandoned his usual reasonable tone to condemn those who deny climate change. “The science is clear,” he began. “Every serious scientist says we need to act. The Pentagon says it’s a national security risk.” As the president continued, it became clear that he no longer needed Luther to reveal his inner anger, and he drew laughs from the crowd after letting loose. “It is crazy! What about our kids? What kind of stupid, shortsighted, irresponsible… ”
While the president’s skit might have been the highlight of the night, do Americans really need this kind of angry reminder that climate change is a problem? Some seem to think we are living in a world where climate change is widely acknowledged as an irrefutable fact. Mary Robinson, the seventh president of Ireland and founder of the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice, has argued that the generation in power now is the first to fully know about climate change, and the last with the ability to prevent its projected effects. She and others are of the opinion that, at this point, all but a few outliers understand global warming, its causes, and its dire consequences.
New data from the Harvard Public Opinion Project tell a very different story. Only 55 percent of survey participants agreed with the statement,
“Global warming is a proven fact and is mostly caused by emissions from cars and industrial facilities such as power plants.” Twenty percent held the belief that “Global warming is a proven fact, and is mostly caused by natural changes that have nothing to do with emissions from cars,” and the remaining 23 percent who answered the question believe that “Global warming is a theory that has not been proven yet.”
Even more surprising, these numbers are the same across the board for participants between 18 and 29 years old, with 51-56 percent agreeing that global warming is a fact and is caused by fuel emissions across age groups. In fact, the age group that least agreed with the first statement was that of 18 to 20-year-olds. The assumption that younger adults are more liberal when it comes to global warming does not hold up; if anything, they are even more skeptical.
Consequently, young Americans are often unsupportive of government measures to prevent climate change that might harm the economy. Less than a third of those surveyed agreed with the statement, “Government should do more to curb climate change, even at the expense of economic growth,” and only 12 percent strongly agreed with it. Again, the youngest survey respondents were more conservative than any other age group, with only 28 percent of 18 to 20-year-olds in agreement and eight percent in strong agreement with that statement. In contrast, other age groups varied between 30 percent and 34 percent in agreement and 11 percent to 14 percent in strong agreement. Not only are the newest voters less convinced of climate change as a reality; they are also less likely to support government funding of climate change solutions.

Kudos to President Bush, the first world leader whose administration has pronounced the Kyoto Protocol stone, cold dead. 



It’s about time —- and it’s about mathematics. Kyoto was probably the dumbest international instrument signed by an American chief executive. 



Strong words, but easy to back up with a little primer on climate change. If we continue on our way, doing nothing and with no specific attempt to spread technologies that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the earth will continue to warm. Averaging the so called “general circulation climate models” used in the upcoming U.N. compendium on climate gives a 2.2ºC (4 degrees Fahrenheit) warming for the next 100 years. 



When run backwards, most (but not all) of those models “hind cast” too much warming in recent decades. When their mean prediction is adjusted for this fact, and for the scientific truth that a small fraction of recent warming is from changes in the sun, the expected warming in the next 100 years drops to around 1.4ºC (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit). Several scientists, ranging from those in the service of the British government (whose radical position on global warming resulted in riots last summer), to those in libertarian think tanks, have replicated this calculation and come up with the same answer. 



That’s not a large number, and it is disproportionately distributed into a warming of the coldest winter temperatures. But, even so, what would Kyoto do about it? 



The answer is, nothing. 



At least nothing that could have any discernible impact on how climate influences our lives. Clinton administration scientists answered this one for us: If all of the nations did what they said they would do under Kyoto, the net amount of warming reduced by the year 2100 would be 0.14ºC. That’s 6.4 percent of the average warming of those U.N. models. 



How much does it cost? Estimates range from 1 percent to 3.5 percent of GDP per year. The larger figure assumes very little “emissions trading” between nations, where we could take credit for emissions prevented in, say, Africa, by giving them less emissive technology. Incidentally, our European friends don’t want us to make up the majority of our emissions by doing this humane thing. The cost figure also looms large if we can’t “sequester” our emissions in trees and soils, and are instead forced to raise energy prices. Again, our European allies won’t let that happen, either. So the 3 percent‐​GDP range is the more likely figure. 



If anyone wants to see a microcosm of what Kyoto would bring, look no further than California, except that the lack of energy must also be exacerbated by excessive energy taxes. 



These numbers are well known to the Bush Administration—which needs to get them out in public—and to the environmental press, which never mentions them. 



Think of them in terms of “insurance,” and substitute “your house” for GDP. According to Kyoto, you would pay 3 percent of the value of your property, each and every year. And should your house burn down, Kyoto will reward you with 6.3 percent of its total value. Is that all you get for your money? 



It’s worse than this. Kyoto would probably wreak great harm on the environment. It is well known that the more affluent a society is, the more it protects the environment. Among other things, people have more capital to invest in the development of efficient technology. Taking this capital away in the form of the onerous energy taxes required to promulgate Kyoto has the additional pernicious effect of giving our government a virtually limitless fund to squander, when the investing should be left up to individuals. I have personally lost thousands of dollars on Ballard Power Systems, a fuel‐​cell company, and I drive a gas‐​electric Honda Insight (a great car that really does get 70 mpg). But it is not your responsibility to buy stock or cars for me or anyone else. 



Finally, Kyoto is irrelevant. History teaches us that we cannot anticipate the technological changes of the next 100 years, but we can be sure that what gives us power, and how we move things, will be very different than what runs us today. Compare horse‐​drawn 1900 to Internet‐​driven 2000 for an example. I don’t know what will charge the world of 2100, but I doubt that it will produce a lot of greenhouse emissions, whether or not they are harmful. 



Do the math. Kyoto was a bad deal, whether or not you care about global warming. And it’s a good deal that finally there is a world leader with the courage to tell the truth.

The 2010s have been the best decade ever. The evidence is overwhelming. Start with the United Nations Development Report. Framed as a warning about inequality, it plays down the good news: “The gap in basic living standards is narrowing, with an unprecedented number of people in the world escaping poverty, hunger and disease.”



The World Bank reports that the world‐​wide rate of extreme poverty fell more than half, from 18.2% to 8.6%, between 2008 and 2018. Last year the World Data Lab calculated that for the first time, more than half the world’s population can be considered “middle class.”



Health progress has been remarkable. People have better access to water, sanitation, health care and vaccines than ever. The incidence of malaria in Africa declined almost 60% from 2007 to 2017, and antiretroviral therapy reduced HIV/AIDS deaths more than half.



Tin‐​pot strongmen, looting politicians and punctilious bureaucrats make mischief with societies and economies. But mankind creates faster than they can squander, and repairs more than they can destroy.



Global life expectancy increased by more than three years in the past 10 years, mostly thanks to prevention of childhood deaths. According to the U.N., the global mortality rate for children under 5 declined from 5.6% in 2008 to 3.9% in 2018. A longer perspective shows how far we’ve come. Since 1950, Chad has reduced the child mortality rate by 56%, and it’s the _worst‐_ performing country in the world. South Korea reduced it by 98%.



Hasn’t this all come at the cost of a despoiled environment? No. At a certain point developed countries start polluting less. Death rates from air pollution declined by almost a fifth world‐​wide and a quarter in China between 2007 and 2017, according to the online publication Our World in Data.



Rich countries use less aluminum, nickel, copper, steel, stone, cement, sand, wood, paper, fertilizer, water, crop acreage and fossil fuel every year, as Andrew McAfee documents in “More From Less.” Consumption of 66 out of 72 resources tracked by the U.S. Geological Survey is now declining.



Global warming remains a challenge, but wealthy societies are well‐​positioned to develop clean technologies and to deal with the problems of a changing climate. Annual deaths from climate‐​related disasters declined by one‐​third between 2000-09 and 2010–15, to 0.35 per 100,000 people, according to the International Database of Disasters—a 95% reduction since the 1960s. That’s not because of fewer disasters, but better capabilities to deal with them.



Progress isn’t guaranteed. Look how wealthy Venezuela collapsed under the burden of crazy policies. A war between major powers, or a financial crash after a decade of easy money, could throw the world off course. So could never‐​ending trade wars and an unraveling of globalization.



Yet we’ve lived through a period of populist revolts and geopolitical tensions, and wherever societies have been open and markets free, scientists, innovators and businesses persisted and made greater progress than ever.



That’s the case for optimism. Tin‐​pot strongmen, looting politicians and punctilious bureaucrats make mischief with societies and economies. But mankind creates faster than they can squander, and repairs more than they can destroy.

"Sitting on a bar stool, the glass in front of him mostly drained, the actor Richard Roxburgh leaned in to make a point. It was early afternoon on a Tuesday, but the muscles in his jaw were slack, his blue eyes vague. He spoke with quiet urgency, his words faintly misshapen, and when he gestured for emphasis, he didn’t seem to notice that his hands were right in my face. The sober boundaries of social behavior had dissolved, abruptly, in an alcoholic haze. That was the idea, of course. Perched in the window of an espresso bar on West 47th Street, drinking nothing stronger than a cortado, Mr. Roxburgh, 55, was demonstrating a   skill: playing drunk. “In terms of the study of alcohol and its effects, I probably have an unfair advantage in that I am, A, Australian, and, B, an actor,” he said, his eyes perfectly clear now, glinting with humor. “I’ve had probably an unhealthy overexposure to the shenanigans of booze over time. ” If so, he’s putting it to good use. Through March 19 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, he’s starring opposite Cate Blanchett in “The Present,” a Chekhov adaptation that floats along on a vodka tide, gradually snaring his character, Mikhail, in the undertow. (It does not help that Mikhail downs a whole bottle of the stuff in Act III.) Back home, on the Australian television series “Rake,” Mr. Roxburgh has spent several seasons playing a different sort of alcoholic, a lawyer determined even in middle age to keep the party going. Performing drunkenness requires striking what is, for many actors, an elusive balance  —   somewhere between sloshy and straight. “Seeing bad drunk acting is probably like watching an actor trying to squeeze out tears,” Mr. Roxburgh said. “It’s kind of     excruciating. ” This is his advice for getting it right. “That would be my first question always: Why are you doing it?” Mr. Roxburgh said. “Because we all do it for a reason. ” How to play the character, and the drunkenness, depends in part on the answer. “A lot of what I do is instinctual in a way,” Mr. Roxburgh said, “and it’s based on observations that I made over a life of being surrounded by Australian actors, and stealing from it. ” Well, that and muscle memory a family man these days, he drinks less than he used to. But he’s familiar with the moment when a pleasant buzz gives way to a loss of control, and he recognizes the difference between sanguine drunks and the darker sorts, like Mikhail, whose vodka demons keep him company. Mr. Roxburgh stood up, planting his feet some distance apart. “There’s a stance that might happen at a certain point, which is a kind of slightly wider leg stance. If your legs are together, your center of gravity is a much more dangerous element, and you will literally fall over. A very drunk person, the room is doing this for them,” he said, tilting his arms from one side to another. “It’s as if they’re on a ship at sea. ” That doesn’t mean they will lurch or clutch, but they might rest a hand on a chair, “just for a little bit of support,” a fixed point of physical reference. “The more you try and stand up straight, there’s always a part of you that has to know the world is spinning. ” “There’s also a very subtle kind of tipping that might happen in the body,” Mr. Roxburgh said, and as he leaned, his eyes clouded over. For a moment, he might have been utterly wasted. “Another element is the gaze, which is that famous   thing where somebody is talking to you, but they’re not quite there. The world is bleary to them, and your face at a certain point becomes, to all intents and purposes, pixelated. So they’re not looking with any clarity into your eyes. ” “It’s fascinating reading things like the police studies into blood alcohol levels and what they actually do to your response times” behind the wheel, Mr. Roxburgh said. “The same thing obviously applies in terms of your conversation, your responses, the way you inhale and feed out information just in the normal sense of conversation when you’re drunk. “But it can be very subtle stuff, I suppose the way you might slightly stutter on a word or rethink the way that you’re going to go into a sentence. It blocks clear thinking that’s a fact. ” Counterintuitive, yes, but Mr. Roxburgh was adamant that this is an essential part of playing drunk: struggling against the sloppier effects of inebriation rather than giving in to them. “Remember that the person that you’re playing almost invariably doesn’t want to appear drunk,” he said. “In bad drunk acting, you see somebody wobbling around all over the place and slurring their words in a very overt way. ” In the real world, though, the   try to get their minds and bodies to obey the normal rules: speaking clearly, making sense, not falling over. And it’s precisely that extra focus that can give their game away. The more determined they are not to seem drunk, Mr. Roxburgh said, the more clearly drunk they will seem."

It is difficult to debate with those who will not communicate. The climate change examination is no longer about the issue but about the crushing of alternative views. We are all guilty of that from time to time. The first sign of desperation is not being able to withstand the scrutiny of your stance. 



There are only two camps: Alarmists or deniers. This very narrative highlights the pettiness that has dominated this debate. It is much easier to mark those with alternative views with derogatory labels rather than respecting their views but agreeing to differ. 



Whilst my views on man-made climate change are very clear, I’m yet to be convinced that “man” is responsible for the warming or whether “man” can successfully intervene if the planet is warming. There is one very glaring factor that supports my reasoning and that is the calibre of those who refuse to consider opposing views. 



The whole climate change debate is politically motivated right back to Al Gore’s rant and subsequently promoted by the UN, our own COLs and almost all left-leaning political movements. My question is: If the climate change activists are so convinced they are right, why are they so opposed to alternative views been aired? 



We have the absurdity of _**Stuff**_ [refusing to publish](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/stuff-disgracefully-implies-that-disagreement-equals-mental-illness/) any alternative discussion so their way of promoting their “truth” is through **censorship**. We have the UN and our COLs actively [indoctrinating children](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/state-organised-bullying-of-kids/) to promote only one side of the debate. These children are shielded from any information that contradicts the view of the State. In any democracy, this should not be tolerated. 



We have the absurdity of a [Minister for Climate Change](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/minister-only-listens-to-advice-when-it-suits-him/), who leads a Party, which was rejected by 94% of the electorate, issuing “educational” tools into state schools promoting only one side of the issue. This is called a dictatorship. The manipulation of children into representing your advocacy is psychological abuse.



The further you delve into the calibre of those at the coal face of the debate the less credible their argument becomes. They don’t know the truth, nor do I. Almost every prediction of doom has [not materialised](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fails-summary/); therefore may I suggest that the science is rather more restless than settled. 



It is the height of arrogance to suggest the end is nigh, but stupid people can’t separate arrogance from fact. Even the community of [scientists is undecided](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/500-scientists-tell-un-there-is-no-climate-emergency/) on this issue.  
I know Nature is considerably more qualified in managing our climate so I will let her take care of me. The only disappointment I have is that I won’t be around in a hundred years to tell them “I told you so”. But then again, all these activists will be dead also: Which proves that in climate, every cloud has a silver lining.

Did legendary Australian poet Henry Lawson call his country’s bushfires climate change? He most certainly did not. It’s nothing more than Mother Nature at her fiery worst. Tragic as it may well be, it’s happened before and it will happen again. It’s just a question of how they live with and manage the Australian bush. [Fail to ‘back burn’](https://thebfd.co.nz/2020/01/its-ok-to-burn-colonists/) during the cooler, less windy months, the fuel load will surely grow and sooner or later, due to either man or lightning strike, it will surely burn, often with dire consequences for those who choose to build and live nearby.

Our comment primarily concerns the Department of Energy’s (DOE) use of the social cost of carbon (SCC) in the cost/​benefit analysis of the Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Compressors proposed rulemaking. The DOE’s determination of the SCC is discordant with the best scientific literature on the equilibrium climate sensitivity and the fertilization effect of carbon dioxide—two critically important parameters for establishing the net externality of carbon dioxide emissions. It is also at odds with existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines for preparing regulatory analyses. It is based upon the output of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which have little utility because of their great uncertainties. They provide no reliable guidance as to the sign, much less the magnitude of the social cost of carbon. Additionally, as run by the Interagency Working Group (IWG) (whose results were incorporated by the DOE in this action), the IAMs produce illogical results that indicate a misleading disconnection between climate changes and the SCC value. Further, we show that the sea level rise projections (and thus SCC) of at least one of the IAMs (DICE 2010) is not supported by the mainstream climate science.

It was a hashtag prosecution, a social‐​media campaign posing as a legal case: #ExxonKnew. And like yesterday’s media balloon become today’s litter, its deflated remains floated back down to earth last week in a New York courtroom.



Whatever you think of them otherwise, ExxonMobil’s communications on climate change had neither the intent nor the effect of wronging the company’s investors. New York’s since‐​disgraced attorney general Eric Schneiderman had no business bringing a securities‐​fraud case on that basis, and there was nothing his successor, Letitia James, could have done to rescue the case.’



In a 2003 case called _Nike v. Kasky_ , no less a liberal authority than Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer warned that it was dangerous to freedom of speech to arm ideological adversaries with legal power to bring fraud charges against businesses based on those businesses’ public statements about contentious issues. (The full Court in _Nike_ did not reach that issue, instead dismissing the case on other grounds.)



New York’s prosecution of Exxon deserves to be studied in law schools for years to come. But not for the reasons its authors once hoped.



The _Nike_ case involved claims by the apparel maker about the treatment of its workforce, but the climate issue offered a similar line of attack. Since at least 2012 activists had been looking for ways to gin up lawsuits or even prosecutions over what they termed climate denial — or, to use a more neutral phrase, advocacy on the wrong side of climate debates. Win or lose, and First Amendment or no, gaining access to the internal files of energy companies and their ideological allies could be politically valuable. The ambitious Schneiderman, widely spoken of as a future New York governor, was willing to go first.



As part of the same effort, a team of state AGs used subpoenas to go after free‐​market non‐​profits such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute as well as university scientists deemed too close to Exxon’s views. The pushback on both that and the Schneiderman suit was intense, from places such as the editorial boards of _USA Today_ (an “exercise in politics” raising “serious First Amendment concerns”) and the _Washington Post_ (“Exxon deserves criticism, but it didn’t commit a crime .… Legitimate scientific inquiry depends on allowing strong, even unfair, criticism of the claims that scientists make.”)



At the last minute Schneiderman’s successor as New York attorney general, James, dropped two counts that would have required a showing of intent by the oil company. That still left the state’s elastic, ultra‐​broad Martin Act, which gives her office unusual powers that are hard to square with due‐​process protection. (“The Martin Act is a nearly empty vessel into which the AG can pour virtually any content that he wants,” per _Reuters_).



But even the Martin Act charges failed. Over the course of the trial, Judge Barry Ostrager also chided the state — to quote the _New York Post_ ’s account — “for being unprepared, for indulging in ‘agonizing, repetitious questioning about documents that are not being disputed’; for pretending a witness was an expert when she wasn’t,” and much more.



In his full, scathing opinion, Judge Ostrager rejected each of the state’s themes. “ExxonMobil’s public disclosures were not misleading.” While the company had used figures for a proxy cost of carbon that varied at different times and places, it gave intelligible and legitimate reasons for doing that. Despite three and a half years of investigation and pre‐​trial discovery, New York had “failed to establish” any misrepresentation material to investors. While not reaching the issue of damages, the court “would have found that the Office of the Attorney General failed to prove any damages.”



In particular, “The Office of the Attorney General produced no testimony either from any investor who claimed to have been misled by any disclosure, even though the Office of the Attorney General had previously represented it ‘would call such individuals as trial witnesses.’” The state had made a fuss over various reports from the company without being able to demonstrate that the content of those reports ever influenced investment analysts or had any other market impact.



That was just for starters. New York’s conduct of the prosecution, the judge noted, had begun with “politically motivated statements” by Schneiderman claiming that a “longstanding fraudulent scheme” had been “sanctioned at the highest levels of the company,” which had supposedly erected “a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of climate change regulation” for its business operations. “The Court finds these allegations to be without merit.” As the state’s withdrawal of its intent‐​based charges late in the game made clear, the misrepresentations on this set of issues were not the ones emanating from Texas.



The Exxon corporate culture, known as a straight‐​arrow kind of place that emphasizes meticulous planning and documentation, came off well at trial. There “was not a single ExxonMobil employee whose testimony the Court found to be anything other than truthful.” Meanwhile, the judge wrote, cross‐​examination had “eviscerated” the contentions of the state’s expert witnesses. In one particularly dubious bit of legal argumentation, the state had argued that an anti‐​Exxon press hit in the _Los Angeles Times_ that momentarily nicked the company’s share price should itself be taken as evidence of the state’s claims about investor harm, being “corrective disclosure.” The _L.A. Times_ piece, of course, reflected agitation by the same body of activist critics who had urged Schneiderman to sue. The judge aptly declared the theory “circular.”



New York’s prosecution of Exxon — a legal vendetta against a target chosen for essentially political reasons — deserves to be studied in law schools for years to come. But not for the reasons its authors once hoped.

"HONG KONG  —   You might call it a Noah’s Ark for an era of melting polar ice sheets. An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward, with the government of French Polynesia agreeing to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon. The project is being put forward by a California nonprofit, the Seasteading Institute, which has raised about $2. 5 million from more than 1, 000 interested donors. Randolph Hencken, the group’s executive director, said work on the project could start in French Polynesia as early as next year, pending the results of some environmental and economic feasibility studies. “We have a vision that we’re going to create an industry that provides floating islands to people who are threatened by rising sea levels,” Mr. Hencken said. The group’s original founders included Peter Thiel, a billionaire investor and prominent supporter of President Trump, although Mr. Thiel is no longer donating to the institute, Mr. Hencken said. Mr. Hencken said that the project’s pilot islands would cost a total of $10 million to $50 million and house a few dozen people and that the initial residents would most likely be   buyers from the developed world. He added that the institute was seeking to build the islands in what would be a nautical version of a special economic zone and that it would showcase innovations in solar power, sustainable aquaculture and   wind farms. The project’s leaders face many hurdles, such as building   systems for the islands and convincing investors to buy property in such an untested environment. Joe Quirk, a spokesman for the Seasteading Institute, said in a 2014 video that the cost of housing on the artificial islands would initially be on par with real estate in London or New York City. But the project also appears to show how the acceleration of climate change has prompted technology entrepreneurs to devise innovative solutions to   problems like rising sea levels. “The oceans are the most ignored part of the planet, so I’m excited by the possibilities which will emerge when you get some of Silicon Valley’s more adventurous souls focusing on the sustainable use of our coastal and marine areas,” Lelei LeLaulu, a development entrepreneur from Samoa who specializes in the Pacific Islands and advises the International Finance Corporation on sustainable business, said in an email from French Polynesia. But the project has critics in French Polynesia and beyond. Alexandre Le Quéré, a radio host at the station Polynésie 1ère, said this month that the Seasteading Institute’s project reminded him of a plan to build artificial islands off the Indonesian resort island of Bali that has drawn heavy criticism amid concern over its projected environmental effects. “One might think the engineers behind Seasteading have responses to these ecological questions,” Mr. Le Quéré said. “Nevertheless, it doesn’t stop skepticism about this slightly crazy project. ” Mr. Hencken said that he expected the project to eventually include dozens of artificial islands and that similar projects could someday be built in other atoll nations or coastal areas threatened by rising sea levels. He added that the cost of housing would decrease as the   island platforms became cheaper to manufacture. “I certainly don’t think this is a project that is exclusively for the wealthy,” he said, adding that his background was in social justice activism. But experts familiar with climate change and the South Pacific said they doubted the project would be feasible on a wide scale in a region with some of the world’s poorest countries. They also wondered whether the money could be better spent on education or health care. “I wouldn’t write it off entirely I just come to these things with a healthy skepticism,” said Matthew Dornan, the deputy director of the Development Policy Center at Australian National University in Canberra. “There is a tendency for very technologically focused solutions to the challenges in the Pacific without any real input from the Pacific Islanders themselves,” he added. Simon Donner, a geography professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who studies the effects of climate change in the Pacific Islands, said that the French Polynesia project looked intriguing and that he had no reason to doubt that its backers were well intentioned. But he said the project reflected a cruel reality: The developed world is both responsible for climate change and better able to cope with it. The French Polynesia project would effectively be a “cruise ship,” Professor Donner said. “Meanwhile, the other actual islands in the Pacific are stuck with the impacts of climate change. ” Mr. Hencken disputed that assessment, saying it was unfair to compare his initiative with traditional aid projects. “We’re not taking French Polynesia’s money,” he said. “We’re investing our own money with the hopes of making a direct and indirect benefit to our host. ” The French Foreign Ministry did not respond to an emailed request for comment on the Seasteading Institute’s plan. Recent climate models predict that the world’s oceans could rise five to six feet by 2100, roughly twice the increase reported as a plausible   scenario by a United Nations panel in 2013. Atoll nations in the Pacific are seen as uniquely vulnerable to sea level rise because they are often   and extremely narrow. One of them, Kiribati, has become an unofficial champion of a movement to call global attention to the threat. In an interview with The New York Times last year, Kiribati’s president at the time, Anote Tong, said he had commissioned experts from the government of the United Arab Emirates to study the feasibility of artificially raising Kiribati’s islands as a climate adaptation strategy. But he declined to provide specifics, and subsequent attempts to reach officials in Kiribati and the United Arab Emirates for details were unsuccessful. Koen Olthuis, an architect in the Netherlands whose projects are entirely   said that interest in amphibious construction among developers and municipalities had surged worldwide in the last four years and that floating projects could potentially have an enormous range of beneficial social uses. An early example, he said, is a floating school he designed recently for Bangladesh, where sea level rise threatens   coastal communities. Mr. Olthuis said that the technical challenges of artificial island construction could be resolved and that he hoped the French Polynesia project would succeed. But it was still an open question, he added, what the ultimate goal or scale of such projects should be. “What do we want to save? How much money do we want to spend on it, and what does it bring for those people?” he said. “With billions, you can save 300, 000 people. But you can also take them away and put them in other countries and use those buildings to help people in slums worldwide. ”"

"TEHRAN  —   As Iranians woke on Saturday to the news that none of them would be able to enter the United States for at least 90 days, on the orders of President Trump, panic reigned. They were turned back from flights to the United States in Tehran and in the major transfer hubs of Istanbul and Dubai. Some of those who arrived in the United States after midnight, when the decree went into effect, were held or deported, rights groups and airline representatives said. No one, not passengers, airline representatives or even United States border control officials, seemed to know how to interpret the executive order that went into effect at midnight on Friday. Under the new policy, refugees, immigrants and almost anyone from seven countries deemed to be hotbeds of terrorism are banned from the United States for 90 days, pending a review of policies. Officials are just interpreting the directive by themselves, said one representative for an international airline who was based in Tehran. He said the airline did not know if Iranians could fly to the United States or not. On Saturday, three international airlines shuttling passengers between Iran and the United States  —   Emirates, Lufthansa and Qatar Airways  —   had stopped allowing Iranians with visas or even permanent residence cards to board their planes. The Qatar Airways office in Tehran confirmed that all Iranian passengers without United States passports were stopped from flying to the United States on Friday evening and sent back to Iran. In Istanbul, during a stopover on Saturday, passengers reported that security officers had entered a plane after everybody boarded and ordered a young Iranian woman and her family to leave the aircraft. Holders of green cards, which confer the right to live and work indefinitely in the United States, received conflicting information about whether or not they would be permitted to return to the United States. But on Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security clarified the executive order, saying it applied even to permanent residents from the seven   countries named in the ban: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. “It will bar green card holders,” Gillian Christensen, the Department of Homeland Security’s acting spokeswoman, told Reuters. Many were blindsided by the decree while on vacation in Iran. “How do I get back home now?” said Daria Zeynalia, a green card holder who was visiting family in Iran. He had rented a house and leased a car and would be eligible for citizenship in November. “What about my job? If I can’t go back soon, I’ll lose everything,” he said. It is unclear how many Iranians have green cards, but experts say the number runs into the hundreds of thousands. In an online survey tracking entry challenges, two out of 112 passengers holding green cards said they were not allowed into the United States, but the reasons were unclear. Card holders can be barred, for instance, if they owe back taxes. Others spent years preparing to study in the United States only to see their plans abruptly thwarted on Friday. About 4, 000 Iranians are granted study visas to attend American universities each year, often after a long and complicated process that can take years. Shadi Heidarifar, a philosophy student just admitted to New York University, said in a message on Twitter that she had spent three years trying to apply to universities in the United States. “I had to work to save money, gather documents. The application fees were so expensive that a whole family could live for a month” on them, Ms. Heidarifar wrote. When she was accepted recently, she was over the moon. “But now my entire future is destroyed in one second. ”"
"**Ethiopia appears to be fast approaching civil war. Fighting between forces loyal to the federal government headed by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has claimed hundreds of lives and is threatening to rip the country apart.**
While battles rage on the ground, the two sides are also fighting a war of words. Each is trying to rally their people and also to convince the world that they have the moral high ground.
The government in Addis Ababa and the TPLF accuse one another of starting the conflict. Mr Abiy has said that army officers were murdered in cold blood.
The Tigrayan leader Debretsion Gebremichael says there was a co-ordinated attack by Ethiopian special forces and troops from neighbouring Eritrea.
Until there is an independent investigation, the rival stories remain allegations, which are being used to whip up hostile sentiments.
The two sides see Ethiopia's history totally differently.
Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in a revolution in 1974. A military junta known as the Derg seized power.
It inflicted the infamous ""Red Terror"", when tens of thousands of young people were murdered by the military regime, and a prolonged civil war against insurgents across the country.
The Tigrayans remember those as years of darkness, when daily bombing raids by air force jets forced them to move only at night. In one terrible air raid in 1988 on the town of Hausien, 1,800 marketgoers died and the smoke and dust from the bombardment literally turned a bright day as dark as midnight.
A coalition led by the TPLF, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) defeated the military government in 1991.
On the day they took power, the EPRDF leader Meles Zenawi, a Tigrayan, said that his number one goal was for Ethiopians to be able to eat three meals a day.
Over the EPRDF's 27 years in power the child mortality rate fell from about one in five to one in 20.
Famine was banished. Large-scale civil war was ended.
But Ethiopia did not see democracy. Prime Minister Abiy and his followers call these ""27 years of darkness"".
A rising generation of young people felt silenced and shut out of political participation.
They argue that a clique of Tigrayans dominated politics, the army and the economy for their own benefit.
Abiy Ahmed, an ethnic Oromo, was swept to power on a wave of discontent. The EPRDF chose him as party leader - and hence prime minister - in 2018.
He rapidly liberalised politics. He dissolved the EPRDF coalition and set up a new party - the Prosperity Party.
These moves won him popular acclaim. His critics acidly remarked ""to dismantle is not to build"".
Mr Abiy made peace with Eritrea, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, and became a close confidante of President Isaias Afwerki, despite the Eritrean leader's long-stated aim of dismantling Ethiopia, beginning with its army.
Mr Abiy is a devout Pentecostalist and often speaks as though his mandate is from God.
His writings, including his PhD summary, read like self-help business school manuals. He has supreme confidence that dynamic, self-assured active leadership generates its own reality.
He is believed to be now drawing much of his support from ethnic Amharas in Addis Ababa and the Amhara region. But neither he nor his new party have faced any electoral test.
Yet Mr Abiy says that the TPLF crossed a red line when it held regional elections in September.
The federal government had not authorised those elections and the Prosperity Party was not able to contest.
The TPLF counters that national elections had been scheduled for earlier in the year and repeatedly postponed - partly because of Covid-19 - and that the government's term had expired without a firm date for a poll. They say that theirs is the only regional government with a mandate from the voters.
The political battleground is Ethiopia's constitution.
The country has a federal system in which the major ethnic groups administer their own regions.
This was adopted in 1994 shortly after the EPRDF took power. Mr Abiy wants to do away with it.
Uniquely, Ethiopia's regional states have a right to self-determination.
The spirit of this provision was that if there were to be a democratic collapse at the centre, a region could go its own way.
This was demanded not just by the Tigrayans, but by leaders from other historically marginalised groups, including the Oromo - Ethiopia's largest ethnic group.
The TPLF has not demanded separation. But the logic of today's confrontation is leading them down that path.
TPLF political domination was resented by many Oromos and other ethnic groups in southern Ethiopia. But all of them treasured the self-government articles in the constitution.
Indeed, one of these groups - the Sidama - voted to have their own federal state last year.
This year, Mr Abiy has turned against the Oromo youth movement that brought him to power.
After the killing of the Oromo singer Hachalu Hundessa, more than 150 people died in riots and Mr Abiy clamped down and imprisoned upwards of 10,000 people.
Among them are Jawar Mohamed, founder of the Oromo Media Network, who faces terrorism charges. Another is veteran opposition leader Lidetu Ayalew who remains in prison despite a court ordering his release.
Armed gangs calling themselves the Oromo Liberation Army killed more than 50 Amhara villagers in Wollega district two weeks ago.
Mr Abiy blamed ""Ethiopia's enemies"" determined to ""rule or ruin the country"" - code words for the TPLF.
His power base is among a mostly Amhara political elite that wants to abolish the federal system in favour of a unitary government system.
There are many good reasons to criticise ethnic federalism, but Ethiopia's diverse groups have made it clear that - well armed and politically aware - they cannot be ruled against their will.
Reports from the war front indicate a massacre of Amhara civilians. Reports from Addis Ababa and other towns tell of the mass round-up and internment of Tigrayans.
Government forces have been accused of imposing a news blackout on Tigray, and of mounting a total blockade on the region, halting supplies of humanitarian aid.
The TPLF says it has captured Eritrean troops who invaded Tigray.
Mr Abiy's declared war aim is to impose federal control on Tigray.
No observer of Ethiopia believes that is possible. Eritrea's president, who some believe may have been involved in the planning of the military operation in Tigray, has not spoken.
Ethiopia's conflict is escalating out of control by the day.
This will probably cost tens of thousands of lives. And as the government's own 2002 national security white paper foresaw: ""The prospect of disintegration cannot be totally ruled out.""

"Government advisers and leading infrastructure experts have said ministers must do much more to protect the UK’s infrastructure from extreme weather, as the fiercest heatwave in decades gave way to thunderstorms and deluges over large parts of the country. Storm warnings are in place over the weekend for most of England, Wales and large parts of Scotland. The Met Office said the current weather was likely to stay in place at least until next Tuesday, bringing heat, lightning and downpours to many regions of the UK, though some of the far north was likely to avoid the worst of it.  Temperatures reached above 34C (93.2F) for six days in a row last week for the first time since 1961. Across Europe, countries have had localised heat records beaten and a long stretch of hot weather has given way to storms in many places, with France and Belgium beset by thunderstorms after more than a week of sweltering heat. Parts of the Arctic have experienced the highest temperatures ever recorded this summer, and fires have raged again in some areas of the far north.  German farmers have complained of a plague of mice eating their harvests, in hot and dry conditions. Southern Europe has had more typical weather. Last summer was the hottest on record for many European countries, and this year’s heat is likely to come close. Heatwaves are growing more likely in the UK, with 2020 on course to be the hottest year on record. Engineers and infrastructure experts are growing increasingly concerned that vital infrastructure – from homes and buildings to transport, water and energy networks – is unable to cope with the added strain. Several pointed to last week’s Stonehaven derailment, in which three people were killed and many more injured. The derailment may have been caused by a landslip after heavy rain, as experts cited it as an example of the kind of incident that may grow more frequent unless urgent action is taken to make the UK more resilient to the impacts of the climate crisis. • Temperatures stayed over 34C for six consecutive days last week in the UK, the longest such run since comparable records began in the 1960s • Spring was the sunniest on record in the UK, even as millions of people were stuck indoors by lockdown. There were more hours of sunshine than in any year since the series began in 1929, and May was the driest in more than a century • February was the UK’s wettest ever, with 202.1mm of rainfall as storms battered the country • July was unusually wet and cool • In April, meteorologists forecast that 2020 would be the world’s hottest year since records began • Last year was Europe’s hottest on record, with 11 of the 12 hottest years on record having occurred in the past two decades • Siberia has experienced temperatures more than 10C above average this summer, in an Arctic heatwave that has alarmed scientists • Last summer, Arctic sea ice was at its second lowest extent on record. This year may surpass records, and recent research suggests Arctic sea ice is on track to disappear in summer by 2035 • Antarctica hit a record high of 20.75C in February, recorded on Seymour Island by Brazilian scientists, at the close of its summer • The last decade was the earth’s hottest on record The government’s statutory advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, called for new regulations to protect people from rising temperatures. “The recent heatwave shows how ill-suited the current UK building stock is to hot weather, and the risk that overheating poses to us all,” said Kathryn Brown, head of adaptation at the committee. “Yet there is still no legal requirement to ensure homes, hospitals, schools or care homes are designed for the current or future climate. This urgently needs to change and be part of a wider programme of retrofitting and designing buildings within a green economic recovery package.” The National Infrastructure Commission, whose recommendations the government has postponed replying to until the autumn, also raised concerns. “We absolutely can’t afford to stick our head in the sand,” said Sir John Armitt, chair of the NIC. “The impact of extreme weather cycles can be catastrophic, particularly on structures built over a century ago for a very different age. Given the scientific consensus on the future likelihood of such events, nobody can pretend these are unknown unknowns.” He cited the NIC’s recent report on UK infrastructure, which called on the government to publish resilience standards every five years, and for stress tests for utilities and other infrastructure such as transport. Geoff French, former president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, pointed to the Stonehaven derailment as an example of what can happen when deluges strike. “Cuttings, slopes and so on need to be checked more frequently,” he said. “The challenge is to identify the most critical infrastructure and deal with that. You need to reduce the knock-on impact, when one piece of infrastructure fails.” Much of the UK’s infrastructure dates from the Victorian age, when the climate was less prone to such high temperatures and the risk of flash flooding. Roger Kemp, professorial fellow at Lancaster University and fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said building new houses, streets and transport networks to those old specifications and templates no longer made sense. “If you look at other countries, their drains are deep and wide but we are still building as the Victorians did.” Since the privatisation of utilities in the 1980s and 1990s, the emphasis has been on keeping down costs to billpayers, rather than investing in better infrastructure. “That was a mistake,” said Kemp. “The cultural shift has not happened: people haven’t woken up to the need to invest yet.” Centralised government was another problem, he added. “This stuff is not very sexy, and governments like big prestige projects. There is a place for unspectacular improvements to be carried out by local authorities.” Adapting the UK’s buildings, transport and energy and water networks, and protecting against future flooding and storms, would create much-needed jobs and could form a leading part of an economic stimulus to revive the economy battered by the coronavirus crisis, according to Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics.  While the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced £2bn for refurbishing homes to be more energy efficient, the question of protecting them against excessive heat was not mentioned. The wrong type of insulation can reduce ventilation and turn homes into heat traps in summer. Brown said: “Deep retrofits are needed to improve shading and ventilation for buildings alongside improving carbon and water efficiency. This will improve the comfort of our homes, create jobs and reduce household bills.” A government spokesperson said: “Bolstering our resilience to climate change is a national priority but we know there’s more to do to protect vital infrastructure in the short term. We’re already working to protect the nation from extreme weather by doubling our investment in flood defences to better protect and prepare properties and vital infrastructure, and ensuring energy, communications and transport networks are more resilient.” Britain is likely to experience further extremes of weather in future as climate breakdown takes a stronger hold, the Met Office said. “Winters will be wetter and warmer, and summers hotter,” said Aidan McGivern, meteorologist at the Met Office. Convective storms, such as those being seen across the country at present, will become more frequent. “The season of thunderstorms will lengthen, to begin in late spring and go on into early autumn.” Even when we can predict rising temperatures and higher rainfall, one certainty about the future weather is that it will still take us by surprise – just as last week’s heatwave prompted outrage and shock on social media, despite 2020 following a decade of exceptional heat. Mark McCarthy, head of the National Climate Information Centre at the Met Office, has studied centuries of the UK’s weather records, and found an enduring pattern. “We are always being taken by surprise by our weather, and what it can throw at us” he said. “That just doesn’t seem to change.”"
"Any traveller on the London Underground during the summer will know how hot and stifling it can get. That the Tube can be hotter than Bali or Barcelona is a fact of life for commuters. Running trains in small, deep tunnels means temperatures are well above those on the surface, [even in the winter](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2003.10.017](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2003.10.01). Lighter trains, improved brakes that generate less heat and ventilation systems can help cut areas where heat builds up, but there will always be some waste heat generated, especially in deeper routes such as the Northern and Central lines. While Transport for London has maintained a programme of works to try to cool the tube for years, at the same time there has been a growing realisation, most recently in a report for the Mayor of London, that waste heat could be harnessed as a form of energy to heat buildings. There’s an opportunity here: TfL needs to get rid of the Tube’s underground heat, and there are many people above ground who could use it. With the rising costs of household energy bills, recovering and putting the heat to good use looks like a sensible, feasible prospect. However, there are several challenges in implementing such a system – not least how to extract the heat, how to get it to where it could be useful, how much it would cost, and who pays. Within the Underground there are two possible locations where heat recovery has been considered: stations and air shafts. Recovering heat directly from the train tunnels is difficult because of gaining access to install and maintain equipment, and the potential to disrupt services. This could probably only be considered during the construction of new tunnels, or total renovation of old tunnels. Station heat recovery is attractive as a large amount of heat is generated and given off from trains’ brakes when stopping at the platform. Heat could be removed using exchanging devices such as an air handling unit, which London Underground has developed for cooling, or heat transfer panels on walls.  Both function by using water to transfer the heat to where it usefully required. At Green Park station, for example, cold water is passed through the warm air, taking the heat away from the station and into the ground. Instead, the warmed water could be pumped elsewhere for heating before being returned. These are significant financial and logistical undertakings. Certainly any widespread deployment of such systems would be costly and require significant political support. A more pragmatic example exists on the Paris Métro where heat exchangers were installed into station passages to transfer heat to a district heating system in a housing development which, being adjacent, didn’t require significant construction. London Underground, like all underground railways, has ventilation shafts to supply fresh, cool air or remove stale, warm air. Shafts that extract air have the potential to recover heat. One way would be to take the air directly to the potential user, which would mean the recipient would need to be close to the shaft and, given the shaft size, their building designed with this in mind. An alternative is to install a heat exchanger in the airshaft to remove heat from the air, for example through water, which then could be piped to a user. This second option is more flexible and allows for more control, and is similar to the system to be used in the recently announced project to supply heat from the Underground to the Bunhill Estate heat and power network in Islington, London. Using ventilation shaft heat recovery won’t benefit the Tube network, as it only uses heat that was on its way out of the system already. This would suggest it would be the energy user who took on most of the costs from using heat from the Tube. If and when London Underground considers installing station cooling, they should consider the potential for heat recovery, but this type of project could not be initiated on the basis of heat recovery alone. Constructed over more than a century, the variability in design and configuration of the Underground network means any adoption of heat recovery needs to be judged case by case. The proximity of a station or shaft to potential users, the users’ energy costs, their heating demand and London Underground’s plans for station cooling will be important in determining where a project could take place and whether it will be viable. The widespread adoption of heat recovery from the London Underground faces many challenges. But if both building owners and developers along with London Underground consider heat recovery as a normal part of project design then there is a greater possibility for future adoption, when potential benefits exist."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNDR German public television recently broadcast a critical report on the health effects of wind turbines.

According to state physician Thomas Carl Stiller, infrasound from wind turbines causes an array of ailments among a segment of the population, such as dizziness, tinnitus, headaches, fatigue, sleeplessness and difficulty concentrating.
Nationally, protest groups are banding together in numbers never seen before to fight off wind projects, demanding that issues surrounding infrasound and environmental impact be addressed and clarified more thoroughly before wind parks are permitted.
According to the video report, German Constitutional lawyer Rudolf Wendt says the norms for permitting wind parks need to be updated as “they originate from the 1990s, the last century!”
As wind turbines have grown to huge dimensions, wind park protest group spokeswoman Jutta Reinhardt says that human health “is now in conflict with Germany’s Energiewende” and so there should be nothing to negotiate.

German doctors like Stiller say turbines less than 3 kilometers away from occupied buildings should be turned off.
Wind parks destroying biodiversity
Meanwhile the German Wildlife Foundation issued a press release earlier this month warning that wind turbines have killed and currently endanger cranes in the German state of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania. According to Foundation sole chairman Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt:
The rapid species die-off and disappearance of biodiversity is being played down, ignored due to a questionable climate policy, and against the will of the citizens.”
Vahrenholt also blasts the plans for further wind parks in the region, claiming that the power grid infrastructure to transport the power to markets on windy days does not even exist, and so the parks are routinely idled. Yet, the wind park operators are still paid (by the power consumer) for the power that would have otherwise been produced.
Vahrenholt adds that it’s only the wind park project developers and the wind park operators who benefit. “The bill gets picked up by the private household consumers while nature gets thrown overboard.”

"**The fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray state may not only have drastic implications for the future of the country but could also seriously affect its neighbours.**
Seeking to calm tensions a day after fighting started, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that ""the stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region"".
With a population of more than 110 million and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, what happens in Ethiopia inevitably has a wider impact.
Despite this, the federal government has so far resisted calls for diplomatic intervention to end the hostilities with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which runs the state.
Instead it has launched a charm offensive aiming to persuade the world that this is an internal matter. The government has described the conflict as a ""law-enforcement operation"" against a ""clique"" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order.
This fighting may have been the result of long-standing tensions between the TPLF and the federal authorities, but the thousands of refugees crossing into Sudan indicates how this has spread beyond Ethiopia's borders, whether the government likes it or not.
""The war is already regional,"" says Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst.
""The Sudanese are involved and at some point it will involve other countries in the region, and also beyond, because it is a strategic region. The impact is huge.""
He also believes that the conflict has drawn in Eritrea, which shares a long border with Tigray.
Eritrea has a history of poor relations with the TPLF, with its own scores to settle, and its President, Isaias Afwerki, is an ally of Ethiopian Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed.
There is no doubt that attacking across Tigray's northern border would open up a new flank in the fighting, but so far the Eritrean authorities have denied involvement in the crisis.
There is also a danger that the federal government's focus on Tigray could weaken its involvement in backing the government in Somalia against al-Shabab militants.
Ethiopia has already withdrawn about 600 soldiers from Somalia's western border, though they were not tied to the African Union's mission in Somalia (Amisom), which Ethiopia also supports.
""If the situation deteriorates further and Mr Abiy is forced to pull out of Amisom, that would be catastrophic... it will create an opportunity for al-Shabab to regrow and regroup again,"" says regional analyst Mr Abdi.
The International Crisis Group agrees, saying that unless the conflict is urgently stopped, it ""will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa"".
Regardless of the current involvement of Ethiopia's neighbours, some argue that the conflict could weaken the Ethiopian state, which could have damaging regional consequences in itself, with other groups in the multi-ethnic country emboldened to take on the central government.
Mr Abdi told the BBC that ""what you will see essentially is the regions drifting away from the centre and the centre becoming weaker, unable to assert itself"".
But the director of Nairobi-based think-tank the Horn Institute, Hassan Khannenje, understands that Prime Minister Abiy needed to bring Tigray back in line with the federal government to avoid a situation where others could follow its example.
""Mr Abiy sees this as setting a bad precedent for the other regions... a unilateral movement towards a potential secession will mean the balkanisation of Ethiopia, which could mean the end of Ethiopia as a nation-state,"" he told the BBC.
""His endgame is to bring the state back into the fold and hopefully move into elections next year as a united country. Which is going to very hard to do in practice, but it is not impossible.""
In the meantime, the crisis could lead to thousands being forced from their homes either directly because of conflict, or because of the fear of conflict.
Growing numbers have been crossing into Sudan and on Friday the UN's refugee agency said that the speed of new arrivals risked ""overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid"", the Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman as saying.
The Sudanese government has agreed to the establishment of a camp for 20,000 people 80km (50 miles) from the border and more sites are being identified, the UN says.
Added to this is the spectre of food shortages, with the region being one of the worst-affected by a desert locust infestation, with threats of new swarms arriving in the coming weeks, according to a recent UN humanitarian report.
About 600,000 people in Tigray - about 10% of the population - already rely on food aid and across the country around seven million people face food shortages, the UN says.
If the fighting does continue, the numbers of people needing assistance would increase rapidly in a region already under pressure on other fronts.
The UN adds that the threat ""of uncontrolled diseases and desert locust infestation"" reaching other parts of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries ""is high"".
Ethiopia's size and strategic position in the region means that what happens in the country cannot necessarily be isolated, whether that is the fighting itself or the humanitarian fall-out.
The prime minister is confident that this will be a short conflict and insists that it is a purely Ethiopian issue, but if it is prolonged then it could have serious repercussions for many of its neighbours."

"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.  —   Back in his days as a test pilot at   Air Force Base in Ohio, Gus Grissom had a message for his wife, Betty. “If I die, have a party,” he said. Betty Grissom never did have that party. But on Friday, as for the past 25 years, there was a solemn observance at the   memorial for her husband and two crewmates who were killed in the Apollo 1 disaster. Mr. Grissom, Roger Chaffee and Ed White died in a flash fire that engulfed their capsule atop a Saturn 1B rocket during a routine training operation on Jan. 27, 1967. Mr. Grissom was 40. Ms. Grissom, 89, was at the memorial again on Friday, wearing a denim jacket with a large Apollo 1 patch in patriotic colors. She joined old friends, family members, and NASA officials and veterans, among them Charlie Duke, who took part in the Apollo 16 moon landing. With the recent deaths of the astronauts John Glenn and Eugene A. Cernan and the sea changes in Washington, the gathering felt like a memorial for an era as well as for three men. At the ceremony, candles were lit for the dead astronauts by members of their families, including Cody Grissom, 22, a pilot, who is completing his last year at his grandfather’s alma mater, Purdue University. Representatives from the Navy, the Air Force and NASA spoke, and a Navy bugler performed taps after the sun went down. “It is important that Challenger and Columbia are remembered, and that Apollo 1 is remembered,” said the Kennedy Space Center director, Robert D. Cabana. “And that we take those steps that create an environment where everyone has a voice, that we really work to ensure the success and the safety of the crew as we continue to explore and move beyond our planet. ” Ms. Grissom said this year’s ceremony was probably her last. It coincided with a NASA tribute exhibit about Apollo 1 at the Kennedy Space Center, which she, like many, thought was long overdue. “I thought this is probably a good time to call it quits with them finally getting a memorial of some kind,” she said. This year’s event drew around 150 people, one of the largest crowds ever for a memorial that few people knew of unless they were related to an astronaut or were a   space fan. “We need heroes today, and these were heroes,” said one such fan, Robert Pearlman, an American space historian. People from all over the world traveled to the memorial, among them Masato Maruyama, 65, who has come for the past 10 years from Tokyo. He brought a big bottle of sake to share with the family and friends. Mr. Maruyama said Mr. Grissom reminded him of his father, who was in the Japanese Navy. He remembers just where he was when the fire occurred. “It’s not the distance  —   it’s in here,” he said, pointing to his heart. “I’m just one of hundreds of thousands. Apollo counted a lot not just for Americans, but human beings. ” Although the launch platform is crumbling like a concrete Greek ruin, and stenciled with an eerie “Abandon in Place,” the site was decorated with three     floral wreaths brought by the Grissom family. A bagpiper stood ready and Ms. Grissom sat front and center. She was treated as the event’s grande dame as people lined up to speak with her. “I want you to know it is such an honor,” said Shirley Brown, whose shop provided the wreaths. “The first time you walked in my shop and said, ‘I’m Betty Grissom,’ I thought Queen Elizabeth had walked in. You never went down, you fought all the way. ” “I never quit,” Ms. Grissom agreed, in the kind of taciturn response her astronaut husband might have offered. Many years after the accident, two space buffs, Bob Castro and Mark Pinchell, started going out to the site of the fire, which is on Air Force property, in their own private tribute. One year, they bumped into each other, and came up with the idea of doing something bigger. “Just two space geeks who were going to Pad 34 and doing their own separate ceremonies,” said Mark Grissom, 63, who was 13 when his father died. “They met at the pad and decided to invite the families. ” The Grissoms were the first astronaut family to become involved. Early on, car headlights provided the only illumination. While other astronauts and families have been absent over the years, this year Roger Chaffee’s wife, Martha, and her daughter, Sheryl, attended, along with Ed White’s daughter Bonnie. “This is the families’ memorial,” said Sonny Witt, the 45th Space Wing director of operations for Division 1 at Patrick Air Force Base, who helps provide the access. “Not the Air Force and not NASA. They are the ones that lost the husbands and brothers and fathers. Mistakes were made, and they paid the price. ” When the three Apollo 1 astronauts were trapped in their burning capsule on Pad 34, a cry for help, believed to be from Mr. Chaffee, a rookie astronaut, came over the communications system: “Hey, we’re burning up. ” Mr. White tried opening the hatch, but caught within the highly combustible pure oxygen atmosphere, the crew suffocated. “I don’t want any of this forgotten,” Ms. Grissom said. “Gus Grissom was a human being. ” Mr. Grissom, often seen as an underdog, was a favorite astronaut of many Americans. He infamously “screwed the pooch”  —   as Tom Wolfe put it in “The Right Stuff”  —   when the hatch blew on his Mercury capsule, causing it to sink it in the Atlantic upon splashdown. Mr. Grissom was initially blamed, and the sunken capsule cost the astronaut couple a visit to the Kennedy White House. In the end, he was cleared of responsibility. Ms. Grissom, who lives in Houston by herself, and Mr. Grissom were high school sweethearts in Mitchell, Ind. Her life always revolved around him. She worked as a   telephone operator for Indiana Bell, putting her husband through college at Purdue, where he studied mechanical engineering on the G. I. Bill. He was selected as an astronaut after flying an   Sabre on over a hundred combat missions in Korea. Death was always on the horizon for the wives. The program lost seven astronauts on the path to the moon, largely as a result of crashes of the   the supersonic jet trainer airplanes the astronauts flew back and forth from where they lived in Houston and Cape Canaveral. When the news of the Apollo 1 accident came to her, delivered by a NASA doctor when she was at a friend’s home for a weekly poker night, Ms. Grissom told her friend that she had “already died 100, 000 deaths” living with her husband. Martha Chaffee, the youngest space widow, slept with the flag that hung over her husband’s coffin at Arlington. Pat White killed herself years later, a weekend before she and some of the other wives had a reunion planned, her friends said. The space widows felt rejected after their husbands died, while still living in the closely knit community of astronaut families in the “space burbs” by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later the Johnson Space Center) in Houston, nicknamed “Togethersville” because of its exclusivity. In the late ’60s, Ms. Grissom became a black sheep among the astronaut community. She was the first of the widows to sue NASA’s largest contractor, North American Rockwell, over the construction of the capsule, and she inspired Ms. Chaffee and Ms. White to do the same. Ms. Grissom eventually settled for $350, 000. On Friday, as Ms. Grissom was helped off the old launching pad, professional and amateur stargazers pointed out the International Space Station passing in the sky above, along with Venus and a shooting star. Back in the car and about to be driven to a celebratory dinner for friends and family at a hotel in nearby Cocoa Beach, she turned to her son and said, “The stars are out tonight. ” Earlier, she spoke of how her husband’s sacrifice helped pave the way for the missions to come like the Apollo 11 moonwalk her husband never got to see. Still, she said, “I’m pretty sure he got to the moon before they did. ” She added: “Of course he didn’t make it, but in spirit I think he was already there. ”"

Guest Post by Bob Tisdale
UPDATE: Repaired a few typos.
How often do we see this happen—a press release about a scientific study states or suggests that global warming was the cause of a factor being studied, when the paper itself doesn’t come to that conclusion…and/or the data contradict it?
An example crossed my desk yesterday. (Thanks, Anthony.)
The closing paragraph of the press release Why are seabirds abandoning their ancestral nesting grounds in the Gulf of California? from the University of California, Riverside reads(my boldface):
Increased frequencies of abnormally warm waters in the Gulf of California, possibly as a result of globally warming oceans, coupled with extremely high fishing pressure, are delivering a combined blow to the legendary productivity of the Gulf of California, forcing seabirds to fly away in search for more suitable environments, even if that means abandoning their ancestral nesting grounds and moving into highly transformed industrial landscapes such as the San Diego Saltworks or the LA Harbor Container Terminal.
That’s odd.  The paper that’s the subject of the press release doesn’t come to the conclusion that global warming is causing the migratory practices of the studied sea birds.
The press release is about the Velarde et al. (2015) paper Warm oceanographic anomalies and fishing pressure drive seabird nesting north.   The abstract reads:
Parallel studies of nesting colonies in Mexico and the United States show that Elegant Terns (Thalasseus elegans) have expanded from the Gulf of California Midriff Island Region into Southern California, but the expansion fluctuates from year to year. A strong inverse relationship between nesting pairs in three Southern California nesting areas [San Diego saltworks, Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, and Los Angeles Harbor (1991 to 2014)] and Isla Rasa in the Midriff (1980 to 2014) shows that terns migrate northward when confronting warm oceanographic anomalies (>1.0°C), which may decrease fish availability and hamper nesting success. Migration pulses are triggered by sea surface temperature anomalies localized in the Midriff and, secondarily, by reductions in the sardine population as a result of intensive fishing. This behavior is new; before year 2000, the terns stayed in the Midriff even when oceanographic conditions were adverse. Our results show that terns are responding dynamically to rapidly changing oceanographic conditions and fish availability by migrating 600 km northwest in search of more productive waters.
The conclusions of Velarde et al. (2015) are (my boldface):
In conclusion, three factors seem to be playing a role in the range changes of nesting Elegant Terns. (i) The success of conservation measures in the tern’s nesting grounds both in Mexico and California has allowed an increased population growth of the species, and the exponential increase in the Isla Rasa colony in particular seems to be pushing reproductive pairs onto new nesting grounds in California. (ii) Superimposed on this systematic and continuous expansion, there is a pulse-like variation in local SST conditions in the Midriff, which seems to drive nesting pairs to emigrate toward California when surface seawater in the Midriff is too warm, the thermocline is too deep, and fish availability is poor. (iii) The decision by seabirds to abandon their traditional nesting grounds in the Midriff is compounded by the fishing effort during the previous season, which further increases the proportion of Elegant Terns migrating away from the Gulf of California.
Besides an overall growth of nesting Elegant Terns in Isla Rasa and southern California colonies as a result of successful conservation efforts, since year 2000 whenever Elegant Terns have confronted poor oceanographic conditions, indicated by high SST (>1.0°C) anomalies in the Midriff, breeding pairs have abandoned Rasa, a behavior that is further augmented by high sardine fishing effort and landings in the Midriff. This oscillatory migration dynamics between distant nesting sites suggests that Elegant Terns can make fast decisions and dynamically adapt to rapid changes in the global environment. The adequate maintenance of a healthy fish community in both the Gulf of California and the Pacific is an important priority that will help support healthy seabird communities, as well as healthy marine ecosystems in general and sustainable fisheries.
“[P]ulse-like variation in local SST conditions” and “high SST (>1.0°C) anomalies in the Midriff” do not equate to global warming.  In fact, the data provided by Velarde et al. contradict the press release.
The January to April sea surface temperature anomaly data for the years of 1983 to 2014 are provided in the Supplementary Material for Velarde et al. (2015).  See their Table S3 Oceanographic data. I’ve plotted their data for the Midriff of the Gulf of California and Baja California’s Pacific coast at the same latitude.  See Figures 1 and 2.  Both show cooling since 1983, based on the linear trends.

Figure 1
# # #

Figure 2
Note: as far as I can tell from the paper, the data for the Midriff of the Gulf of California is for the 1 deg latitude by 1 deg longitude grid of 29N-30N, 114W-113W.
CLOSING
It’s sad when claims made in a press release are not supported by the conclusions of the paper its advertising, even sadder when data supplied as part of a scientific study contradict that press release.
Shouldn’t truth-in-advertising laws also apply to press releases for scientific studies?
As a result of the false claims made in the press release, it has been picked up by alarmist mainstream media outlets. Examples:
ScienceWorldReport—Climate Change: Seabirds are Abandoning Ancestral Nesting Grounds in California.
The findings reveal that warm waters may be the cause behind these shifts. This, in turn, could be a result of globally warming oceans.
Zee News—Sea-level warming forces seabirds to abandon nesting grounds.
The reason for the migration is to be found in global warming.

Back in 1999, I met a young law student at the Cato University summer session in California. Since then he’s gone on to a successful career, working at two different pro‐​freedom organizations. Recently he talked to Cato president Peter Goettler about the prospects for liberty and stressed the importance of Cato: “If it were not for Cato struggling to move the climate of ideas and debate, all of the victories we win for liberty in legislatures and the courts will be short‐​lived when the political winds inevitably shift. On behalf of the entire movement, please never surrender this mission!” As Peter told him, we won’t.



That was our goal when Cato was founded in 1977: to revive the principles of liberty and limited government that were deeply rooted in the American spirit and to help build a movement devoted to those ideas. Our work since then has built on that foundation.



I’ve always considered myself part of the reasonable, radical libertarian movement — radical by the standards of contemporary politics (though not by the standards of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) and reasonable in presenting policy ideas in a mainstream way. This can also include rescuing sound libertarian ideas from unsavory associations or counterproductive framings.



We have tried to present the principles of liberty in a variety of accessible ways to broaden public understanding and support. The Cato University Home Study Course offers 30 hours of audio on the history of libertarian ideas. Cato University seminars give people a chance to study liberty with great teachers and engaged students for several intense days. Our website Lib​er​tar​i​an​ism​.org presents both classic and original articles on liberty. Books such as _The Libertarian Mind_ ; _The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism_ (now online at Lib​er​tar​i​an​ism​.org); _Realizing Freedom: Libertarian Theory, History, and Practice; Economics and Free Markets_ ; and _Peace, War, and Liberty: Understanding U.S. Foreign Policy_ can be found in libraries and college classrooms.



We have been ahead of the curve in focusing attention on policy problems that politicians and pundits were ignoring:



Of course, we could not carry out our mission without the generous support of our 15,000 Cato Sponsors. We’re especially grateful when Sponsors partner with us to identify special opportunities to celebrate and advance our shared commitment to liberty. A grant from the late B. Kenneth Simon helped to sustain our Center for Constitutional Studies, and Roger Pilon became the B. Kenneth Simon Chair as well as director of the center. A more recent grant grew out of a longtime Sponsor’s desire to help Americans learn and understand the basic principles of economics as they apply to policy choices, and his bequest in 2016 allowed us to hire Ryan Bourne as the R. Evan Scharf Chair for the Public Understanding of Economics.



In 2012, the _New York Times_ called Cato “a venerable libertarian research center unafraid to cross party lines” and reported, “Over the years, Cato has successfully injected libertarian views into Washington policy and political debates, and given them mainstream respectability.” That’s an indication of our accomplishment over the past 43 years in creating a voice for libertarian ideas in Washington and in the national policy debate.



David Boaz is the executive vice president of the Cato Institute and has played a key role in the development of the Cato Institute and the libertarian movement.

"Which is the better option for cars in cities, diesel or petrol-driven engines? As a report reveals the new fleet of green, hybrid electric-diesel buses in London produce less CO2 but more harmful pollutants than their diesel equivalents, what do we mean by “better”?  The two main factors that differentiate diesel and petrol as fuels are their environmental impact, and their fuel economy.  Diesel vehicles have long been associated with better fuel economy than petrol vehicles, and many countries have provided incentives to help drive sales of diesel cars in preference to their petrol equivalents. In 2012, sales of diesel vehicles in the UK amounted to more than half of new car sales. One of the principal reasons for this is that European vehicle manufacturers have made a large investment in producing diesel vehicles and market them strongly. One feature they are sold on is better fuel consumption, which stems largely from EU legislation on fuel economy for new cars. Prompted by climate change concerns and the need to reduce CO2, these limit new vehicles’ emissions to 130g CO2 per kilometre. The European Commission proposed in July 2012 to reduce this to 95g CO2/kilometre by 2020. These emissions are based on the vehicles’ fuel consumption as measured in regulatory tests under relatively benign laboratory driving conditions. There are two problems with this. Fuel consumption under real world driving conditions (as opposed to lab tests) is significantly higher than the “official” data quoted in adverts. A recent International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT) study showed that in European and US cars, the average discrepancy between lab test and real fuel consumption rose from 10% in 2001 to 25% in 2011. This is clear evidence that the regulatory lab test cycle simply doesn’t capture the effects of more aggressive driving in real road conditions, or the effects of the stop-start driving in cities. It also shows that driving more economically could deliver large fuel savings – enough to offset any fuel economy advantage that diesel gives. The second problem is that diesel cars emit significantly higher levels of air pollutants than petrol cars fitted with three-way catalytic converters, which convert carbon monoxide, unburnt fuel hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to harmless water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. The discrepancy between the level of emissions such as (NOx) from diesel and petrol vehicles can be seen in lab tests; in the real world it’s even greater. The fact is that while catalytic converters have reduced petrol engine emissions to extremely low levels, diesel engine emissions of NOx have shown no appreciable reduction over the past 20 years. This demonstrates a remarkable failure of EU regulation: despite the lack of improvement in real world emissions, emissions recorded during the regulatory lab tests have declined in line with the increased stringency of European regulations. This emphasises just how “soft” the lab test cycle is, and that it fails to provide a genuine indication of how air pollutants are emitted in the real world. While the rated maximum power of petrol engines has remained almost constant over the past 20-25 years, the power of diesel engines has dramatically increased, by around 50%. Engines of greater power burn up more nitrogen from the air, producing more harmful nitrogen oxides and a greater impact on health and the environment. Not only have diesel vehicles failed to clean up their act as expected, but the EU’s own approved tests and regulations have failed to pick up on the fact that diesel vehicles have for years largely failed to comply the limits on emissions such as nitrogen dioxide emissions. Last year, diesel exhaust was classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a Class 1 human carcinogen. So what is to be done? The latest rounds of European emissions reductions require particulate filters to be fitted to diesel vehicles which will reduce harmful emissions of particulate matter. They also require reductions in NOx emissions. However, both of these emissions are still likely to be higher than from petrol cars as filters can degrade or fail, and NOx is still likely to be higher than from petrol even from the newest diesels. There are even companies who offer to remove particle filters from diesel cars to allegedly improve vehicle performance, although a recent announcement from the Department for Transport has stated a missing filter would constitute an MOT failure. What does appear to be the case is that even the latest diesel vehicles will emit more NOx and particulates than petrol vehicles, meaning that diesel cars – in the real world – are more polluting overall than their petrol equivalents. Despite decades of industry investment in diesel vehicles, with the right choice of petrol engine and, crucially, with the appropriate economical use of the right foot while driving, any perceived CO2 shortcomings of petrol vehicles can be overcome."
"**Ongoing violence between the national army and forces loyal to the leaders of the northern Tigray region has prompted fears that Ethiopia is on the brink of a civil war.**
Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed since the fighting started on 4 November, and thousands have fled into neighbouring Sudan.
September's election in Tigray, which the federal government had postponed nationwide because of coronavirus, is widely considered to be the cause of the recent rapid deterioration.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced a military offensive after accusing Tigrayan forces of attacking and seizing a military base in the regional capital, Mekelle - a charge they deny.
But the tension has been building for longer.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which was the dominant political party in Ethiopia for decades, has been feuding with Mr Abiy's government since shortly after he came to power in 2018.
Elected as a ""reformist leader"", the prime minister accused officials in previous governments of corruption and human rights abuses, and removed key TPLF figures from the central government.
This included the former intelligence chief and senior TPLF official, Getachew Asefa, who evaded arrest and fled to Tigray, where he remains as a fugitive.
Mr Abiy's decision last year to merge the ethnically based parties that formed the governing EPRDF coalition and set up the Prosperity Party (PP) added fuel to the tensions. The TPLF opposed the decision, saying it would divide the country, and refused to join the PP.
Earlier this year, the rift grew even wider after the federal government postponed nationwide elections.
Tigray's decision to hold its own vote in September was an unprecedented act of defiance against the federal government. The federal parliament termed the process ""illegal"".
Since then, both governments have designated each other as ""illegitimate and unconstitutional"".
The TPLF had previously made veiled threats of secession, citing an article in the federal constitution which allows the ""unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to secession"".
""We will never back down for anyone who is intending to suppress our hard-won right to self-determination and self-rule,"" the region's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael said in August.
Early in October, the federal government decided to cut ties with the Tigray region and the upper house of parliament voted to suspend budget aid to Tigray.
Since the overthrow of Marxist leader Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991 and up until 2018, the TPLF was the main partner in the governing coalition, as well as running Tigray itself.
As a guerrilla army, the TPLF had played a pivotal role in Mengistu's demise and went on to dominate not just the country's politics but the economy as well.
Its disagreement with Mr Abiy represents a deep fracture in the very core of power in the country.
Most of the Tigray's regional leaders, including Mr Debretsion, had served in the central government for long periods of time.
Mr Debretsion, who is a veteran fighter, was at one time the deputy prime minister. His comrades and advisers also held key positions in the country until Mr Abiy came to power.
The Tigray's administration sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to build a unitary system of government destroying the current federal arrangement.
It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with long-standing foe Eritrea. But the TPLF feels that Tigray's interests have been overlooked and it wants to have more say over future relations with Ethiopia's neighbour.
On his part, the prime minister believes the TPLF officials are undermining his authority.
There is a long-standing rift between the TPLF and the government in Eritrea, which shares a long border with the Tigray region.
The 1998-2000 Ethiopia-Eritrea war began over a dispute about territory along that border, particularly the area around the town of Badme.
The status of Badme remains unresolved but Eritrea wants Ethiopia to abide by a UN-backed border commission ruling to hand over the town.
But this cannot be achieved without the cooperation of the government in Tigray, as it administers the area.
Speaking about the attack on the federal army base, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of dressing its soldiers in uniforms resembling those of the army of neighbouring Eritrea to ""implicate the Eritrean government in false claims of aggression against the people of Tigray"".
Tigray's leader, Mr Debretsion, has accused Eritrean forces of joining the fight alongside Ethiopian forces against Tigray. Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied this.
The Tigray regional leader has said his forces are ready to fight to defend the region, which would be ""a burial place for the reactionaries"", calling on Tigrayans to understand the situation and make all the necessary preparations. The TPLF has also issued a bond to raise money for its war effort.
""We have prepared our army, our militia and our special force. Our preparation is aimed at averting war, but if we are to fight, we are ready to win,"" Mr Debretsion said.
In justifying the military confrontation, Mr Abiy's office has accused the TPLF of ""continued provocation and incitement of violence"" and said ""the last red line had been crossed"".
He has issued arrest warrants foe the TPLF leaders, appointed a new leader for the region and predicts that the war will soon be over but the TPLF forces are highly trained and experienced so some fear the conflict could drag on.
There is also a concern that the conflict in Tigray, which accounts for about 6% of Ethiopia's population of over 100 million people, could exacerbate tensions in the rest of this ethnically divided country."

Sen. Bob Casey has a loaded question for Education Secretary‐​designate Betsy DeVos. “Ms. DeVos must fully explain whether she supports the radical view that it should be more difficult for campus sexual‐​assault victims to receive justice,” said the Pennsylvania Democrat, who sits on the committee that begins confirmation hearings for Mrs. DeVos Tuesday.



Mr. Casey was apparently acting under pressure from groups, including the American Association of University Women, that support the Obama administration’s illegal reading of Title IX. The administration has construed Title IX—the federal law barring sex discrimination by federally funded schools—as a mandate to punish students and faculty accused of sexual misconduct using procedures that make it extraordinarily difficult for even an innocent person to defend himself. Campus tribunals routinely abandon many rights for the accused, such as the right to see and present evidence, be represented by a lawyer, confront one’s accuser, or even have a hearing.



According to a top AAUW policy adviser, Mrs. DeVos’s lack of experience as an “education professional” means she can be judged on her charitable contributions—including to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a nonprofit I co‐​founded and on whose board I serve. FIRE vigorously defends the free‐​speech and due‐​process rights of college students and faculty.





Pennsylvania’s Bob Casey attacks her for donating to a civil‐​liberties group.



Philadelphia‐​based FIRE is nonpartisan and has defended students and faculty members on the left and right. FIRE has made common cause with politically diverse organizations ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to the Heritage Foundation, Young Americans for Liberty and the Cato Institute.



Mrs. DeVos has entered the political thicket that civil libertarians often encounter, wherein one is saddled with the actions of the accused rather than credited with advocating for fair procedures. As a criminal‐​defense and civil‐​liberties trial lawyer who has represented defendants ranging from student radicals to alleged child molesters, I can vouch for the virulence of guilt‐​by‐​association.



Higher education is currently embroiled in a contentious battle over campus sexual assault. The Obama administration and certain nonprofits, including the AAUW, want to make it easier for campus disciplinary tribunals to credit the complaints of alleged victims and to punish the accused, frequently by expulsion.



The Education Department has instructed universities to adjudicate claims of sexual misconduct using the low “preponderance of the evidence” standard, in which the mere 50.1% likelihood of guilt is sufficient. FIRE argues that a higher standard may be necessary—particularly given that campus judicial systems typically lack many if not most of the procedural protections available to defendants facing criminal charges, or even civil liability, in a court of law.



Lest anybody doubt the problem caused by the absence of due process, a quick scan of the landscape produces myriad examples. A Brandeis student sued the university after it found him guilty—without a hearing—of sexual misconduct for, among other things, staring at his then-boyfriend’s body while the two shared a bathroom. Judge Dennis Saylor, in a decision allowing the lawsuit to move forward, noted that Brandeis’s “inquisitorial” process “appears to have substantially impaired, if not eliminated, an accused student’s right to a fair and impartial process.”



Civil‐​liberties advocates have long defended free speech and fair procedures. Often that means standing up for the rights of people who hold odious views or have committed grave crimes, including sexual assault. Those whose views are merely unpopular, and the innocent who are wrongly accused, depend on the same protections.



If confirmed, Mrs. DeVos will have the opportunity to improve the climate for fairness and accuracy in campus judiciaries at universities that have obliterated due process for fear of losing millions in federal aid—to make American higher education free and fair again.

"Rarely does an executive order announce a more straightforward and laudable purpose than the one President Trump signed on Friday: “Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States. ” But the president’s directive is unlikely to significantly reduce the terrorist threat in the United States, which has been a minuscule part of the overall toll of violence since 2001. Many experts believe the order’s unintended consequences will make the threat worse. While the order requires the Department of Homeland Security to issue a report within 180 days providing detailed statistics on foreign nationals who commit acts of violence, terrorism researchers have already produced rich and revealing data. For instance, since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, no one has been killed in the United States in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from or whose parents emigrated from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, the seven countries targeted in the order’s   visa ban, according to Charles Kurzman, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina. Of Muslim Americans involved in violent extremism of any kind  —   for instance, charged with plotting terrorism or supporting a terrorist group  —   only 23 percent had family backgrounds in those countries, said Mr. Kurzman, who just published the latest of his annual studies of Muslim Americans and terrorism. The larger point of experts is that jihadist attacks garner news attention that far outstrips their prevalence in the United States, and the president’s order appears to address not a rational calculation of risks but the visceral fears that terrorists set out to inflame. There was a random quality to the list of countries: It excluded Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where the founders of Al Qaeda and many other jihadist groups have originated. Also excluded are Pakistan and Afghanistan, where persistent extremism and decades of war have produced militants who have occasionally reached the United States. Notably, perhaps, the list avoided Muslim countries where Mr. Trump has major business ventures. Nor did the list include the European countries where disenfranchised Muslim communities have become hotbeds of militancy, leading to major attacks in Paris and Brussels in the name of the Islamic State. Because no visas are required for travel by most European citizens to the United States, and because of the volume of tourism and business, restricting travel from Europe would have been far more difficult and consequential than banning it from only the seven countries named. By Mr. Kurzman’s count, 123 people have been killed in the United States by Muslim terrorists since the 2001 attacks  —   out of a total of more than 230, 000 killings, by gang members, drug dealers, angry spouses, white supremacists, psychopaths, drunks and people of every description. So the order addresses, at most, 870th of the problem of lethal violence in America. If the toll of Sept. 11 is included, jihadists still account for just over 1 percent of killings. “My advice to the new administration would be to declare victory,” Mr. Kurzman said. For the average American, he added, “your odds of being victimized by a terrorist attack are infinitesimal. ” But terrorists  —   the root of the word means “to cause to tremble”  —   do not operate in the realm of dry facts and statistics. Their purpose is to terrify, and they use random and spectacular violence to do it, with an invaluable assist from the saturation coverage on cable television and news websites that such outrages inevitably draw. To the rational calculations of Mr. Kurzman, one might simply reply with the list of American cities where horrific jihadist attacks have occurred in recent years: Boston San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla.  —   place names that conjure up images of ghastly wounds,   bodies and frightened people running for cover. In Gallup polls, the number of Americans “very worried” or “somewhat worried” about such attacks generally hovers between 30 and 50 percent, with understandable spikes after new attacks. In the political realm, where emotions and symbols hold sway, Mr. Trump’s order may reassure some Americans that they are safer from terrorism, and more generally, from concerns that Muslim immigrants may bring an alien culture. (While ostensibly addressing terrorism, it also says that the United States should be protected against those with “hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles” or those “who do not support the Constitution. ”) The trouble with such reassurance, even if it is effective, is that it comes at a high cost, in the view of many experts on terrorism. That cost will be counted not just domestically but also abroad, where the United States relies on allies, including Muslim countries, for intelligence and other help against terrorism. “In my opinion, this is just a huge mistake in terms of counterterrorism cooperation,” said Daniel Benjamin, formerly the State Department’s top counterterrorism official and now a scholar at Dartmouth. “For the life of me, I don’t see why we would want to alienate the Iraqis when they are the ground force against ISIS. ” At home as well, Mr. Benjamin said, the president’s order is likely to prove counterproductive. The jihadist threat in the United States has turned out to be largely homegrown, he said, and the order will encourage precisely the resentments and anxieties on the part of Muslims that fuel, in rare cases, support for the ideology of the Islamic State or Al Qaeda. “It sends an unmistakable message to the American Muslim community that they are facing discrimination and isolation,” Mr. Benjamin said. That, he said, will “feed the jihadist narrative” that the United States is at war with Islam, potentially encouraging a few more Muslims to plot violence. For an action aimed at terrorism, the order appeared to garner little or no support among experts and former officials of every political stripe with experience in the field. Jonathan Schanzer, the vice president for research at the conservative Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that if the temporary visa ban was used to review and improve immigration vetting procedures, it might be justified. But he added that he knew of no obvious problems with those procedures, and no specific plans to address such issues during the temporary restrictions on visitors and refugees. “The order appears to be based mainly on a campaign promise,” he said. Mr. Schanzer said he was frustrated that during the Obama administration, there had been inadequate attention to the ultimate driver of refugee flows and jihadist terrorism in the United States and elsewhere. “We have several bloody, complex and interlocking conflicts in the Middle East,” he said. “It’s the job of the new administration to come up with policies that address those conflicts. Admittedly, that is not easy. ” Much easier, clearly, is issuing an executive order with political appeal and a title that seems to smack of common sense. But as the Trump administration is finding out, such pronouncements from an American president have many consequences, not all of them intended, anticipated or desired."
"**Hundreds of people are reported to have been killed in two weeks of clashes between the Ethiopian military and forces loyal to the political leadership in the northern Tigray region.**
As the conflict escalates, we've seen continuing attempts to share false or misleading information about the situation.
Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed appears in uniform talking on a phone in a Facebook post which supports the campaign in Tigray by the Ethiopian army.
There are three photos of the prime minister, and the post has been shared more than 1,000 times.
It was posted in the name of Taye Dendea Aredo, ruling party spokesperson for the Oromia region, but has used a doctored picture.
A reverse image search shows the one of him apparently on the phone is a generic one, which has been used before in stories about the US army.
We traced the original, shown above, to an image database owned by Getty Images.
It was taken in Ukraine in 2017, but has been edited to make the soldier look more like Mr Abiy, with facial hair added in.
We contacted Taye Dendea Aredo about this image. He told us he had not used it, but did not clarify how it got into this particular post.
A video appearing to show an Ethiopian military plane being fired on and then crashing has been widely shared with the claim it was carrying out an attack on the Tigray region.
But this footage is not real, and is from a recording of a military video simulation game called Arma.
There are some clues, such as the unnatural look of the blue background, and that some of the smoke coming from the plane just before it eventually crashes dissipates too quickly in some places.
We traced the original to a war game video on a Japanese YouTube channel.
The versions that have been shared have been edited to remove the start and the ending, where there is a disclaimer in Japanese saying the video is fiction.
Some videos that have been shared also contain an image in the top left of a plane on fire, which is a real image but not from Ethiopia.
We have traced that image to a 2016 report about a Jordanian air force F-16 crash as a result of a technical fault.
There's plenty of sharing of misleading images of attacks or their aftermath.
In some cases they are from other parts of the world and pre-date the current conflict in Ethiopia.
**1.** A Facebook page supporting the federal government's military operation appears to have used an image from Uzbekistan.
It shows a striking photo taken from above of a military plane firing rockets, and has also been used by social media accounts to illustrate what is going on in Tigray.
But a closer inspection of the image shows it has the watermark ""Uz Air Force A. Pecchi"" on it.
Uz stands for Uzbekistan, and A.Pecchi is the photographer Anthony Pecchi. The photographer shared the photo on his own Facebook account in January this year.
**2.** Some online users have used a misleading photo to show the results of an attack by Tigray forces on Bahir Dar in the Amhara region, while others have used it to show an attack by them on Asmara, the capital of neighbouring Eritrea.
The photo being used is actually of an explosion in China's port city of Tianjin in 2015 at a warehouse containing hazardous chemicals.
The BBC covered the story, and one of the images in the piece is exactly the same as that shared in the posts about Ethiopia's conflict.
**3.** A Facebook page has shared a video which the owner says shows missile attacks carried out by Tigray forces against Eritrea's capital Asmara (which they claim is assisting the Ethiopian government in the conflict - a claim it denies).
There were news reports of a Tigrayan rocket attack on Asmara recently, but these images do not show that incident.
The Facebook account put the video on a loop so it kept repeating for two hours, as if it was a live event.
But the video, which has been shared more than 1,000 times, is not from Eritrea at all, and has been taken from video of an Iranian missile attack on a US army base in Iraq in January this year.
The BBC published a story about that incident in Iraq with video, and you can see the same images in that story.

"**The fighting in Ethiopia's northern Tigray state may not only have drastic implications for the future of the country but could also seriously affect its neighbours.**
Seeking to calm tensions a day after fighting started, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that ""the stability of Ethiopia is important for the entire Horn of Africa region"".
With a population of more than 110 million and one of the fastest growing economies on the continent, what happens in Ethiopia inevitably has a wider impact.
Despite this, the federal government has so far resisted calls for diplomatic intervention to end the hostilities with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which runs the state.
Instead it has launched a charm offensive aiming to persuade the world that this is an internal matter. The government has described the conflict as a ""law-enforcement operation"" against a ""clique"" intent on destroying Ethiopia's constitutional order.
This fighting may have been the result of long-standing tensions between the TPLF and the federal authorities, but the thousands of refugees crossing into Sudan indicates how this has spread beyond Ethiopia's borders, whether the government likes it or not.
""The war is already regional,"" says Rashid Abdi, a Horn of Africa analyst.
""The Sudanese are involved and at some point it will involve other countries in the region, and also beyond, because it is a strategic region. The impact is huge.""
He also believes that the conflict has drawn in Eritrea, which shares a long border with Tigray.
Eritrea has a history of poor relations with the TPLF, with its own scores to settle, and its President, Isaias Afwerki, is an ally of Ethiopian Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed.
There is no doubt that attacking across Tigray's northern border would open up a new flank in the fighting, but so far the Eritrean authorities have denied involvement in the crisis.
There is also a danger that the federal government's focus on Tigray could weaken its involvement in backing the government in Somalia against al-Shabab militants.
Ethiopia has already withdrawn about 600 soldiers from Somalia's western border, though they were not tied to the African Union's mission in Somalia (Amisom), which Ethiopia also supports.
""If the situation deteriorates further and Mr Abiy is forced to pull out of Amisom, that would be catastrophic... it will create an opportunity for al-Shabab to regrow and regroup again,"" says regional analyst Mr Abdi.
The International Crisis Group agrees, saying that unless the conflict is urgently stopped, it ""will be devastating not just for the country but for the entire Horn of Africa"".
Regardless of the current involvement of Ethiopia's neighbours, some argue that the conflict could weaken the Ethiopian state, which could have damaging regional consequences in itself, with other groups in the multi-ethnic country emboldened to take on the central government.
Mr Abdi told the BBC that ""what you will see essentially is the regions drifting away from the centre and the centre becoming weaker, unable to assert itself"".
But the director of Nairobi-based think-tank the Horn Institute, Hassan Khannenje, understands that Prime Minister Abiy needed to bring Tigray back in line with the federal government to avoid a situation where others could follow its example.
""Mr Abiy sees this as setting a bad precedent for the other regions... a unilateral movement towards a potential secession will mean the balkanisation of Ethiopia, which could mean the end of Ethiopia as a nation-state,"" he told the BBC.
""His endgame is to bring the state back into the fold and hopefully move into elections next year as a united country. Which is going to very hard to do in practice, but it is not impossible.""
In the meantime, the crisis could lead to thousands being forced from their homes either directly because of conflict, or because of the fear of conflict.
Growing numbers have been crossing into Sudan and on Friday the UN's refugee agency said that the speed of new arrivals risked ""overwhelming the current capacity to provide aid"", the Reuters news agency quoted a spokesman as saying.
The Sudanese government has agreed to the establishment of a camp for 20,000 people 80km (50 miles) from the border and more sites are being identified, the UN says.
Added to this is the spectre of food shortages, with the region being one of the worst-affected by a desert locust infestation, with threats of new swarms arriving in the coming weeks, according to a recent UN humanitarian report.
About 600,000 people in Tigray - about 10% of the population - already rely on food aid and across the country around seven million people face food shortages, the UN says.
If the fighting does continue, the numbers of people needing assistance would increase rapidly in a region already under pressure on other fronts.
The UN adds that the threat ""of uncontrolled diseases and desert locust infestation"" reaching other parts of Ethiopia and neighbouring countries ""is high"".
Ethiopia's size and strategic position in the region means that what happens in the country cannot necessarily be isolated, whether that is the fighting itself or the humanitarian fall-out.
The prime minister is confident that this will be a short conflict and insists that it is a purely Ethiopian issue, but if it is prolonged then it could have serious repercussions for many of its neighbours."
"Following typhoon Haiyan, the Philippines’ Department for Environment and Natural Resources has earmarked around US$8m to fund efforts to replant much of the affected coastal zone with mangrove forests. Reforesting these coasts with 19m trees, particularly the extensively damaged islands of Leyte and Samar, is a key part of bolstering the first line of defence against future storms. Reports suggest up to 80% of the money is likely to be channelled to residents to engage them in tree planting activities as part of the country’s cash-for-work programme. Why trees and not, say, concrete? Mangrove forests grow along the coast in fine, salty sediments across the tropics and sub-tropics. Recent research has revealed that mangroves, along with salt marshes and other wetlands, can sequester carbon much more permanently and effectively than terrestrial forests, offering an important means to mitigate global climate change. But more importantly in this case is their role in coastal protection – something that will grow in importance if storms the magnitude of Haiyan become more frequent with the effects of climate change. The extent to which mangroves reduce the damage caused by typhoons (as well as tsunami) is still debated, but the evidence suggests that mangroves provide an effective natural buffer against storms, flooding, coastal erosion and strong waves. The global economic value that can be extracted from mangrove forests is estimated by the UNEP at US$1.6 billion per year. Many millions of dollars have been invested in replanting efforts in several of the more than 100 countries with mangroves – as this value has become more widely recognised, and with the effects of storms such as Haiyan. These multi-million dollar investments haven’t always been successful though – it’s not as straightforward as just planting trees. Replanting damaged areas will depend on the nature of damage caused, the geography, and extent of infrastructure development in the area. It will also depend on how the financial and practical aspects of planting and replanting are addressed, and how local communities are involved. Similar considerations apply in devising ways to protect the remaining mangrove areas, already drastically reduced by more than a third of their global extent. This is largely due to land clearance for agriculture and fish farming, major coastal development, rapid urbanisation, and pollution. Having just returned from a study of mangrove forests in Vietnam, we found those living alongside the mangroves use them as a source of food (fish, crabs, clams, worms, octopus, shrimps, jellyfish), either subsisting from them or using their natural resources as a safety net when other food supplies fail. The communities use various formal and informal rules and practices to govern and manage the mangroves. The formal institutions and governance structures that many of the current restoration and replanting efforts operate through ignore these. They frequently reinforce existing power relations and inequalities, and fail to take into account the importance of community buy-in that can make or break ecological rehabilitation initiatives. Some groups (often the poor and those with limited livelihood options) are more dependent on certain areas of the mangrove forests, and planting replacement mangroves elsewhere could change or remove how they can access those essential forest benefits. It’s important to develop a clear picture of who, what for, and how the mangroves are used and governed, as a pre-requisite to large-scale planting. Efforts to plant and replant more mangroves, such as those planned in the Philippines, are laudable. But a clear understanding is needed of the mangrove forests’ role in underpinning the livelihoods of some of the poorest people living along the coast. If the long-term sustainability of any replanting investment is to be assured, then it is vital to understand how the mangroves will be used once the short-term cash to communities for assisting replanting is gone, so that the new forests are not exploited unsustainably. Finally, detailed consideration needs to be given to the scale and distribution of costs and benefits linked to mangrove restoration and rehabilitation, not just in the Philippines, but globally. Mangroves certainly offer a means to mitigate climate change, conserve biodiversity, and provide a wide range of goods and services as well as protecting coasts against erosion and storm surges. But unless planted and managed carefully, those who depend most upon the mangroves for their survival could lose out."

Parents will be required to give explicit permission in writing for their children to receive religious instruction at state schools under a planned law change.



It may be the beginning of the end of primary schools offering religious instruction.



Education Minister Chris Hikpkins told the _Herald_ he believes in secular education and does not believe schools should be offering religious instruction.



“But we need a bit more of a national conversation about that before we get into that,” he said.

The Balkans has regained its reputation as a geopolitical black hole. Kosovo recently deployed armored vehicles to arrest ethnic Serbs in the north for alleged smuggling. Ethnic Albanian police, meanwhile, have clashed with ethnic Serb civilians, which Serbian government official Marko Djuric called a threat to stability and peace. Belgrade has put army units on alert. Russia, Serbia’s ally, has criticized Kosovo’s “provocation.”



Germany’s famed Otto von Bismarck once warned that war in Europe would be triggered by “some damn foolish thing in the Balkans.” He was proven right when three decades later, the continent plunged into the abyss of World War I. Out of that conflict emerged what the Germans called Saisonstaaten, or “states for a season”: small, undemocratic, and mostly ethnically based nations that proved vulnerable to rising totalitarian powers. Most were in or near the Balkans.



The Cold War largely froze these national disputes. But once the Soviet Union dissolved, multiethnic Yugoslavia joined it in history’s trash can, and the Balkans again became a fount of conflict.





Geopolitical meddling has failed in that part of the world before. Why should we try again?



However, the extended combat and outside intervention that followed were not inevitable. In 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Alija Izetbegovic accepted the Lisbon Agreement, which would have granted Croats and Serbs the same right of secession as his dominant Muslim community claimed from Yugoslavia. Then at the urging of the U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmerman, Izetbegovic reversed himself and decided on war. Three years of brutal conflict ensued, killing tens of thousands. Ethnic Serbs committed noteworthy atrocities, but so did Bosnian Muslims and Croats.



Washington took a reflexive anti‐​Serb position, supporting anyone who sought to leave a Serb‐​dominated government while denying ethnic Serbs the same right to secede from other regimes. The Clinton administration would not even call the expulsion of 150,000 to 200,000 ethnic Serbs from their ancestral homes in Croatia’s Krajina region ethnic cleansing. Moreover, the U.S. counted as a great achievement bombing the Bosnian Serbs into the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, which preserved a multi‐​ethnic Bosnia against the wishes of most Serbs and Croats.



What of Washington’s handiwork today? Bosniak journalist Aleksandar Brezar complained that “this multicultural, multi‐​ethnic project is under serious attack.” But why hold it together with international baling wire and duct tape if so many of its people reject it? (Ironically, Bosnia has not recognized Kosovo, presumably fearful of encouraging secession by the Serb‐​dominated Republika Srpska, which, along with the Muslim‐​Croat Federation, makes up Bosnia.)



Bosnia is no model of nation‐​building. Freedom House rates it as only “partly free,” and notes, “Politics are characterized by severe partisan gridlock among nationalist leaders from the country’s Boniak, Serb, and Croat communities. Corruption remains a serious problem.” Freedom of expression is “limited in practice.” So is religious liberty. The judiciary is weak and “guarantees of due process are inconsistently upheld.”



The State Department’s latest human rights report cites “harsh prison conditions; restrictions of freedom of assembly and expression, and the press; widespread government corruption; [and] crimes involving violence against minorities” and LGBT persons. Human Rights Watch reports similar problems.



American officials took a similarly biased approach to Kosovo, an integral part of Serbia rather than a separate state. The population there had shifted over the years, aided by the anti‐​Serb policy of Yugoslavia’s post‐​World War II dictator, Josip Broz Tito, and the growing ethnic Albanian majority discriminated against Serbs. Then Milosevic played the ethnic card to vault to the top of the Belgrade leadership after Tito’s death.



As the central government took control, the Kosovo Liberation Army arose, kidnapping and executing Serb officials and ethnic Albanian “collaborators,” and bombing police stations and cafés. The group financed itself through drug smuggling and other criminal activities, as well as contributions from the ethnic Albanian diaspora, including in America. The Clinton administration’s special Balkans envoy, Robert Gelbard, described the KLA as “without any questions, a terrorist group.”



The Yugoslav government responded in kind, inflaming resistance. At the Rambouillet conference, Washington attempted to force Belgrade to sign away its independence, granting NATO free transit throughout the entire country to occupy Kosovo. When Milosevic refused, the U.S. initiated a bombing campaign, after which Serbian troops forced hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians from their homes and committed other atrocities.



Yugoslavia finally agreed to withdraw from Albania, which then was occupied by NATO forces. Led by the victorious KLA, ethnic Albanians kicked out 200,000 or more ethnic Serbs, Roma, and other minorities while allied forces stood by.



Reported Human Rights Watch: “The KLA was responsible for serious abuses…including abductions and murders of Serbs and ethnic Albanians considered collaborators with the state. Elements of the KLA are also responsible for post‐​conflict attacks on Serbs, Roma, and other non‐​Albanians, as well as ethnic Albanian political rivals.” HRW also noted that “widespread and systematic burning and looting of homes belonging to Serbs, Roma, and other minorities and the destruction of Orthodox churches and monasteries…combined with harassment and intimidation designed to force people from their homes and communities…elements of the KLA are clearly responsible for many of these crimes.”



Amnesty International’s Sian Jones reported on the allies’ failure to investigate the abduction and murder of Serbs at the conflict’s end. These acts “constituted a widespread, as well as a systematic, attack on a civilian population and, potentially, crimes against humanity” and “contributed to the climate of impunity prevailing in Kosovo.” A second round of ethnic and religious cleansing occurred in 2004, also on the allies’ watch. Dozens of people were killed; thousands of houses and stores were wrecked; dozens of churches and monasteries were destroyed. Thousands of ethnic Serbs were injured and thousands more were forced from their homes.



Freedom House only rates Kosovo “partly free.” Notes FH, the entity’s “institutions remain weak, and rampant corruption has given rise to deep public distrust in the government. Journalists face serious pressure, and risk being attacked in connection with their reporting. The rule of law is inhibited by executive interference in the judiciary.” Moreover, travel is “difficult for many Serbs.” Property rights “are inadequately enforced in practice.”



The State Department points to human rights problems including “refoulement; endemic government corruption; crimes involving violence or threats of violence against journalists; and attacks against members of ethnic minorities or other marginalized communities, including by security forces.” Other issues include a lack of legal due process and poor prison conditions. Moreover, “many in the government, the opposition, civil society, and the media believed that senior officials engaged in corruption with impunity.”



Yet the Americans and Europeans have insisted on independence for Kosovo while barring self‐​determination for ethnic Serbs, concentrated in the city of Mitrovica, north of the Ibar River. In 2008, Kosovo declared its independence over Serbia’s opposition. Only Russia’s veto blocked Pristina’s membership in the United Nations.



Serbia and Kosovo have since maintained a cold war, with the Serbs in Kosovo’s north resisting Pristina’s rule. The European Union has sought to induce recognition on Belgrade’s part by promising EU membership if they comply, but the Serbs have refused to trade territory for euros and various rounds of talks have failed to make progress. Last November, Kosovars imposed a 100 percent tariff on Serbian goods.



Last month, in an attempt to enforce its legal boundary with Serbia, Pristina arrested alleged smugglers operating in Kosovo’s north. The Serbian government responded with the implicit threat of force. If there are hostilities, it will invite NATO and Russian intervention.



Serbia has its own human rights issues, and no one imagines that it will reestablish its authority over Kosovo. Indeed, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic recently acknowledged that his country had to accept that it had lost control of Kosovo. Still, he predicted that a compromise settlement could take years to reach.



There are alternatives to deadlock. Last year, the Kosovo and Serb governments considered land swaps, allowing ethnic Serbs to remain with Serbia while shifting the majority ethnic Albanian Presevo Valley to Kosovo. A similar border adjustment in Bosnia— breaking apart the unloved state— could normalize relations in the face of intractable hostility.



Brussels and Washington appeared supportive of the Kosovo initiative, but Germany did its best to block any territorial shift. Berlin’s malign role goes back to 1991, when it accelerated Yugoslavia’s break‐​up, encouraging the tsunami of violence. After wrecking and creating states with wild abandon, Germans now complain about the precedent of “changing borders.”



The U.S. should remain aloof from the latest Balkan follies. Edward P. Joseph of SAIS recently proposed that the Trump administration “demand” that Kosovo and Serbia “end the cycle of provocation,” “produce a detailed framework” for war crimes prosecutions, “seek the long‐​term basing of U.S. troops” in Serbia, “offer Belgrade a vast upgrade in the military and civil relationship, potentially to the level of strategic partnership,” and provide “both Serbia and Kosovo a generous development package.”



These ideas are frankly mad. The U.S. has nothing at stake that warrants further meddling in this graveyard of good intentions. Nor does Washington have any idea how to fix the region.



Geopolitical social engineering has consistently failed in the Balkans. Forcing antagonistic peoples to live together generated disorder, chaos, violence, and slaughter. If the Europeans have a better idea, let them try it. The Balkans should be their responsibility.

"It is ironic that it is the Labour frontbench leading the charge against what it calls the UK’s “broken energy market”, because practically every controversial aspect of the energy market was the creation of the last Labour governments. For example, concerns over household energy bills stem from the creation of energy regulator Ofgem in 2000, which  abolished retail energy price controls shortly after it was formed. The lack of transparency in energy companies’ costs and profits has been exacerbated by the introduction of the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) in 2001, and the growing vertical integration of energy companies: by operating as both generators, consumers and suppliers of energy, the firms can sell electricity to themselves at below market cost. The Labour government at the time failed repeatedly to refer this to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Labour also introduced the Renewables Obligation in 2002, Feed-in Tariffs in 2010, and amplified the practice of obliging energy suppliers to improve the energy efficiency of their customers’ homes, through the Energy Efficiency Commitment in 2002, and then the greatly expanded Carbon Emissions Reduction Target, the latest manifestation of which is  the Energy Company Obligation (ECO). These “green taxes” and obligations are perhaps more widely known as, after David Cameron’s reported outburst, “the green crap”. But times move on – maybe the energy market does need fixing by the party largely responsible for the way it currently functions. The question is whether Labour’s proposed “Ten-Point Plan” will make matters better or worse. Any answer to that question must consider the objectives of energy policy as the means to regulate, or guide, the energy market. These are generally accepted to be: keeping energy affordable, reducing carbon emissions and securing supply – inevitably referred to as “keeping the lights on”. These three objectives rarely pull in the same direction and generate significant pressure on political priorities at different times. The effect is generally to cause politicians to flip-flop between them as the politics of the moment demand. For example, green levies such as ECO and its forerunners were introduced when green issues had a high profile. Before energy prices started rising it was politically easier to add the costs to consumer bills – partly because they were less obvious there – rather than introduce more transparent taxes, even though academics like me pointed out at the time that this was regressive. Today, there are conflicts between energy policy objectives that any reform needs to resolve. Low-carbon energy sources are still more expensive than the fossil fuels they replace, which puts pressure on consumers whether paid for by household bills or taxation.  Power companies need to invest in new infrastructure, to be paid for by company profits that will, again, ultimately be paid for by consumers. Energy efficiency improvements to homes will reduce bills for those that get them, but the costs are recouped only slowly. Not all homes can be made more energy efficient immediately or cheaply, so bills or taxes will still need to go up in the short term before the benefits will be felt. The first three of Labour’s ten points reverse some of the decisions made, or developments tolerated, when they were last in government. They propose, rightly, to end vertical integration, re-establish a wholesale electricity pool to improve price transparency and clarify the trading arrangements that were muddied by NETA. Three more seek to generate the confidence the energy companies need to take forward low-carbon investment, by allowing the Green Investment Bank to borrow and back low-carbon projects. The plan endorses the government’s Feed-in Tariff that would replace the Renewables Obligation, and also the 2030 decarbonisation target recommended by the Committee on Climate Change, which the government has rejected for the time being. While welcome, it remains to be seen whether these proposals will undo the damage done by Labour’s reckless, albeit politically successful, promise of an energy price freeze. This has cast a shadow over the energy sector, making it more difficult and more expensive for energy companies to borrow money for new projects. But all these proposals are small beer compared to the two major proposals for institutional reform. The most substantial of Labour’s proposals are the abolition of Ofgem, its own creation, replacing it with a “a tough new energy watchdog”, and the creation of a new Energy Security Board “to plan for and deliver on our energy needs”. When politicians propose new institutions to solve perceived problems, the first question to ask is: are they necessary? In this case, definitely not. Ofgem behaves according to the “guidance” and legal powers given it by the government – if the government wants Ofgem to regulate energy prices or show any new teeth it considers necessary, it can simply give Ofgem the power to do so. The proposed Energy Security Board is still a black hole, its powers and scope of operation unknown or poorly defined. But there’s no evidence such a body would make any improvement to the UK’s energy needs over current arrangements – especially if these were subjected to the targeted, well-specified reforms, some of which are among Labour’s other proposals. Worse still, presenting new, yet-to-be-defined institutions alongside reform of the trading arrangements and industry structure will only serve to introduce a further lengthy period of uncertainty into the energy market. This will almost guarantee that the private companies currently being relied on to build the new power stations the UK needs will not build them by the time the UK needs them. If Labour really wants to keep the lights on, perhaps it should have just declared that the government will build the power stations itself – and then we really would be back to the pre-Thatcher days of the Central Electricity Generating Board."
