"Donald Trump’s latest Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh accepts that humans are causing global warming and we need to take action to stop it. The problem is that he doesn’t trust the experts at EPA to do so and wants to erode their authority to regulate carbon pollution.  When discussing Chevron and climate change, we usually focus on the company’s legal liability. However, in Kavanaugh’s context, ‘Chevron deference’ is even more important. The term refers to the fact that courts will generally defer to government agency interpretations of laws as long as Congress hasn’t spoken directly to the issue at hand. David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council noted that Kavanaugh doesn’t believe Chevron deference applies on issues of major importance. In a recent net neutrality case, Kavanaugh argued, “While the Chevron doctrine allows an agency to rely on statutory ambiguity to issue ordinary rules, the major rules doctrine prevents an agency from relying on statutory ambiguity to issue major rules.” That’s Kavanaugh’s position on climate change. In oral arguments before his DC Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2016 Clean Power Plan case, Kavanaugh said: This is huge case … it has huge economic and political significance … it’s fundamentally transforming an industry by telling existing units you in essence have to pay a penalty, a huge financial penalty in order to continue to exist, in order to shift from coal plants to solar and wind plants, at the same time the coal mining industry is in essence greatly harmed, as well. But while regulating carbon pollution would have a major impact on the fossil fuel industry, the same is true of most pollutant regulations. It’s nevertheless EPA’s job to regulate pollutants, and the agency has been doing exactly that since its inception. In the 2016 oral arguments, Kavanaugh said that the Clean Air Act is “a thin statute, it wasn’t designed with [greenhouse gases and climate change] specifically in mind.” But EPA was created to address various types of pollution, and the Clean Air Act gave it that legal authority. As the Act’s text notes: the growth in the amount and complexity of air pollution brought about by urbanization, industrial development, and the increasing use of motor vehicles, has resulted in mounting dangers to the public health and welfare The Clean Air act also defined the term “air pollutant” very broadly to allow EPA the flexibility to regulate any new sources of pollution that the agency might identify in the future: The term “air pollutant” means any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical, biological, radioactive (including source material, special nuclear material, and byproduct material) substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air. And it gave the EPA Administrator the authority to regulate any pollutants that threaten public health and welfare: For the purpose of establishing national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, the Administrator shall within 30 days after December 31, 1970, publish, and shall from time to time thereafter revise, a list which includes each air pollutant … emissions of which, in his judgment, cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare The Clean Air Act even envisioned EPA’s regulatory authority extending to impacts on the climate: All language referring to effects on welfare includes, but is not limited to, effects on soils, water, crops, vegetation, manmade materials, animals, wildlife, weather, visibility, and climate… In the landmark 2007 case Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court affirmed that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants, and EPA therefore has authority to regulate them if the agency determines that they may endanger public health or welfare. In its 2009 Endangerment Finding, that was indeed EPA’s conclusion: greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare .... The major assessments by the U.S. Global Climate Research Program (USGCRP), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the National Research Council (NRC) serve as the primary scientific basis supporting the Administrator’s endangerment finding. In a key 2014 case Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled 7 to 2 that EPA can continue to treat greenhouse gases as pollutants subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act and can apply those regulations to power plants. Justices Scalia, Roberts, and Kennedy joined the majority decision. The good news is that Scalia’s position in this case was modeled after a prior Kavanaugh opinion. But generally speaking, Kavanaugh doesn’t trust the EPA experts to regulate carbon pollution. In the 2016 oral arguments before his court, Kavanaugh laid out his case for why Congress, not the EPA should tackle climate change: Earth is warming, and humans are contributing, and I understand the international collective action problem here, I understand that very well, and I understand the frustration with Congress, I live that, too, everyone understands that. But under our system of separation of powers, and this is why it’s so important that we maintain that, Congress is supposed to make the decision. You might say, you know, this Congress is not going to, they’re not going to do anything, but that’s not how we get to make decisions … for a big question like this Congress can do things like job training programs, and community college assistance, and welfare assistance, and drug programs for the people who are out of work, and that becomes more of a problem, that’s why the separation of powers principle matters, because Congress can look at something like this in a well-rounded approach, and that was the difficulty obviously that happened in the Senate. But for us to do it, for you to do it, all the people who are left behind are just left behind. Kavanaugh is right that Congress could and should do a better job tackling carbon pollution than EPA. For example, Hillary Clinton developed plans to both tackle climate change and help coal communities adapt. But Republicans in the White House and Congress are owned by the fossil fuel industry, and thus unwilling to advance serious climate legislation. However, the fact that Congress won’t act as long as Republicans are in charge doesn’t lessen EPA’s authority to regulate carbon pollution. Kavanaugh’s unwillingness to defer to EPA’s legal authority is wrong. The Clean Air Act is very clear that EPA should regulate pollutants that may endanger public health and welfare, and greenhouse gases certainly qualify. If Kavanaugh is seated on the Supreme Court, he’ll join the other conservative justices in eroding EPA’s ability to regulate carbon pollution. EPA won’t take serious action until there’s a Democrat in the White House anyway; nor will Congress act unless Democrats are in charge of that branch of government. Kavanaugh just represents one more Republican obstruction to climate action."
"As a third-generation farmer from Harden in New South Wales, I’ve weathered climate extremes my whole life. It’s simply part of doing business in one of the most variable climates in the world. The truth is, Australian farmers are good at what they do, and we know when things are changing.  NSW last year was 2 degrees above the baseline average, without an El Niño in sight. This year we’ve already seen 100% of the state drought-declared. The minimal amount of winter crop that has sprouted is sizzling on the stalks or bitten hard by severe -5C frosts. To the north the dams are parched and farmers across the state are close to walking off the land. It’s not just the farmers, either. In the past five years, my local town, amalgamated against the wishes of the local population, has struggled to keep council staff. We have seen a local bank and a favourite watering hole close. We are about to lose our Landcare facilitator who has been a critical element in natural resource management, sustainable farming and drought support. We can and must do better. This is not a “hard-done-by farmer” narrative. We’re tough and we manage our resources carefully, making decisions based upon the best available evidence and always keeping one eye to the future. This is an area with a long history of working with scientists and advisers to be prepared for future agricultural, environmental and economic shocks. But, the first step to managing for the future is to grapple with reality. And the reality is that our climate is on a devastating trajectory. Much as our politicians like to deny reality, out here – beyond the air-conditioned hallways of parliament – we’re already dealing with increasingly extreme weather as a result of global warming. So, a message to our elected representatives. Get your heads out of the coalpit and back into the real world. We need meaningful action now; including support for regional communities and funding for Landcare facilitators to be driving up driveways and checking on those whose lives are being destroyed by your failure to take action. We need a good heavy dose of reality injected into Australian politics. On Monday, my fellow farmers and I will stand outside parliament and rally for our future. A future in which our kids have a chance to farm and our government no longer hides from the truth. The alternative is simply unthinkable. • Peter Holding is a mixed cropping and sheep producer with 40 years’ experience on his family farm"
"When webbing first appeared on the cotoneaster that scrambles up the side of my neighbours’ garage wall it was easy to mistake it for the work of spiders, but there were no orb weavers in residence. During the past six weeks, sheets of grey silk have spun out to veil two-thirds of the shrub. The creators of this premature Halloween decor are tiny brown ochre-coloured caterpillars, the larval stage of the hawthorn moth (Scythropia crataegella). They are predominantly associated with their namesake, but can be found on other members of the rose family and are considered a minor fruit crop pest as they occasionally attack damsons and blackthorns. The young larvae are leaf miners. Where they have burrowed into fresh tissue, the glossy green leaves are marked with pale beige meandering trails. As they mature, they graze the surface, leaving the foliage shrivelled and brown. Some sprays have been completely defoliated, clusters of scarlet berries clinging to the naked branches. The plant should recover, though the damage inflicted may affect the development of new shoots.  I was surprised when, at the end of August, adults began appearing among the crisscrossed threads. At first glance the slender-winged, 15mm-long insects appeared relatively nondescript, but closer inspection revealed that their silvery-white forewings were beautifully marked with two broad, irregular, reddish-brown crossbands, interspersed with blotches and pinprick spots. The trailing edges of both the fore- and hindwings were delicately fringed, like the trim on a 1920s flapper dress. The hawthorn moth is widespread in central and southern Europe, but in Great Britain it is rarely found north of Yorkshire. Across much of its range the species is bivoltine, producing two broods in a season. In Great Britain there is typically only one flight per year, with adults on the wing from mid-June to late July. The life cycle takes around 12 months, so infestations are usually noticed in the spring when the overwintered larvae emerge and begin feeding communally beneath their protective homespun shroud. Climate change is altering the reproductive phenology of many organisms; it seems likely that the unusually warm temperatures we experienced this summer have resulted in this unexpected second generation."
"Building walls on the seafloor may become the next frontier of climate science, as engineers seek novel ways to hold back the sea level rises predicted to result from global warming. By erecting barriers of rock and sand, researchers believe they could halt the slide of undersea glaciers as they disintegrate into the deep. It would be a drastic endeavour but could buy some time if climate change takes hold, according to a new paper published on Thursday in the Cryosphere journal, from the European Geosciences Union. Though the notion may sound far-fetched, the design would be relatively straightforward. “We are imagining very simple structures, simply piles of gravel or sand on the ocean floor,” said Michael Wolovick, a researcher at the department of geosciences at Princeton University in the US who described the plans as “within the order of magnitude of plausible human achievements”. The structures would not just be aimed at holding back the melting glaciers, but at preventing warmer water from reaching the bases of the glaciers under the sea. New research is now being undertaken by scientists showing how the effects of the warmer water around the world, as the oceans warm, may be the leading cause of underwater melting of the glaciers. Wolovick and his fellow researchers ran computer models to check on the likely impacts of the structures they believe would be needed, taking as their starting point the Thwaites glacier in Antarctica, which at 80-100km is one of the widest glaciers in the world. They found that creating a structure of isolated columns or mounds on the sea floor, each about 300 metres high, would require between 0.1 and 1.5 cubic km of aggregate material. This would make such a project similar to the amount of material excavated to form Dubai’s Palm Islands, which took 0.3 cubic km of sand and rock, or the Suez canal, which required the excavation of roughly one cubic km. Building a structure of this kind would have about a 30% probability of preventing a runaway collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet, according to the models. Using more complex designs that would be harder to accomplish in the harsh conditions on the sea bottom in the south polar regions, a small underwater wall could be built, which they calculate would have a 70% chance of succeeding in blocking half the warm water from reaching the ice shelf. Glaciers melting under rising temperatures at the poles have the potential to discharge vast amounts of fresh water into the oceans, sending sea levels rising faster than they have for millennia. The Thwaites glacier alone, an ice stream the size of Britain and likely to be the biggest single source of future sea level rises, could trigger the melting of enough water to raise global sea levels by three metres. Many of these glaciers extend far under the sea, and scientists have begun to explore their subsea melting as well as the easier-to-measure reductions in the or visible parts. The undersea research vessel now known as Boaty McBoatface after its much larger relative was named the Sir David Attenborough is to be deployed at the Thwaites glacier for just this purpose. Building undersea walls could be accomplished by similar vessels but would have to be precisely positioned and strong enough to withstand the immense pressure of the ice. The authors hope that by creating their experimental models they can foster future research into the engineering needed to bring about such projects, which would take many years or decades to be worked out and implemented. Geo-engineering solutions such as this one should not deter the world from reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Wolovick said. “The more carbon we emit, the less likely it becomes that the ice sheets will survive in the long term at anything close to their present volume,” he said. The forthcoming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is expected to warn afresh of the potential for sea level rises to inundate low-lying areas if warming is not held to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels."
"An international meeting in Bangkok fell short of its aim of completing fruitful preparations to help an agreement be reached in December on guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris climate change agreement. The six-day meeting, which ended on Sunday, was scheduled to step up progress in the battle against rising global carbon emissions by adopting a completed text that could be presented at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, three months from now.  A primary objective of the 2015 Paris agreement, to which 190 nations subscribe, is to limit the global temperature increase by 2100 to less than 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C, which is vital to the survival of island nations threatened by rising seas. But the absence of guidelines for meeting that goal has led to fears that not enough action is being taken. There have been notable disagreements over fair financing for implementation of the rules by developing countries, and the technical details of their reporting on progress. Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said on Sunday at the closing press briefing for the Bangkok meeting that progress was made on most issues but nothing was finalised. The meeting was attended by representatives of most of the countries party to the Paris agreement, as well as the United States, which has announced that it is pulling out of the pact. Espinosa said there was “limited progress” on the issue of contributions from developed nations to developing countries, adding that she is “hopeful” that future discussions will be productive because of the importance of the issue. “On the core issues of forward-looking climate finance and the degree of flexibility developing countries should be given on the information and reporting requirements for national commitments under the Paris Agreement, negotiators were stalemated in Bangkok,” said a statement from Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a US-based activist group. “It’s now up to the incoming Polish presidency and officials leading negotiations to find ways to bridge the deep differences on these issues and to secure agreement in Katowice on a robust, comprehensive package of rules to implement the Paris Agreement,” he said. Harjeet Singh, climate policy manager for ActionAid International, said that a vital component of the Paris agreement is for wealthy nations to provide financial assistance to developing countries as they fight natural disasters brought by climate change. But he said wealthy and developed countries “led by the United States and including countries such as Australia, Japan and even the European Union” refused to clearly show “how much money they are going to provide and how that is going to be counted.” Advocacy for the developing countries was led at the meeting by China, said Meyer, but was also supported by others, including India, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. Activists were critical of Washington’s lobbying at the meeting, especially because president Donald Trump has announced plans to have the US withdraw from the Paris pact, which had been heavily promoted by his predecessor, Barack Obama. “The US has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement but still negotiates as if it is a party, weakening international cooperation by not contributing to finance and technology transfer to developing countries,” Meena Raman, legal adviser at Third World Network, said in an emailed statement. Climate change is a polarising issue in the United States, and some states and local communities have announced policies supporting the Paris agreement. Thousands of governors, mayors, company CEOs and civil society leaders are expected to gather this week in San Francisco for the Global Climate Action Summit."
"Last week, California Governor Jerry Brown signed State Senator and US Senate candidate Kevin de León’s SB 100, which mandates that the state obtain all of its electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2045. That in itself was a big deal, but Brown didn’t stop there; he also issued an executive order calling for the entire California economy to become carbon-neutral by 2045. That’s a huge deal. In order to stay below the Paris climate threshold of 2°C global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, humanity must become carbon-neutral by around 2060 or 2070. If California can meet Brown’s target, it will be providing the rest of the world a blueprint for meeting the Paris target. As the world’s fifth-largest economy, California can provide a powerful roadmap for others to follow.  Brown’s executive order directs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to work with relevant state agencies to develop a framework for implementation and accounting of progress toward statewide carbon neutrality. While state agencies can figure out a plan to achieve carbon neutrality, the state legislature will have to pass laws to implement that plan. California has been all-in on tackling climate change, as its carbon cap and trade system and SB 100 illustrate, but Californians will have to keep electing climate realists to state office in order to make the dream of carbon neutrality a reality. SB 100 tackles the electricity sector, but because California has long been transitioning toward clean energy, electricity now only accounts for 16% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for the biggest chunk at 41%. Brown has been pushing for a transition to electric cars, signing another executive order earlier this year setting a goal of 5m EVs on the road by 2030, and several bills last week to help expand their use. While California has the most EVs on the road today (both total and per capita) of any state, they still only account for 5% of new car sales, with 380,000 sold so far. Accelerating that transition toward EVs is crucial for meeting the carbon neutrality goal, and it’s the main reason why California is fighting the Trump administration’s efforts to freeze fuel efficiency standards and take away the state’s ability to set its own. The industrial sector accounts for another 23% of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. About half of that comes from the petroleum industry – predominantly from drilling for oil and natural gas, as well as oil refining. California is the fourth-largest oil producing state. The Trump administration wants to increase that number and is contemplating opening 1.6 million acres in California held by the Bureau of Land Management to fracking and oil drilling. But a wiser future president could revoke those drilling leases on federal lands, and California could ban drilling and fracking on state lands. That’s a bridge too far for Jerry Brown, and protesters have been criticizing him for it, but it’s easy to imagine a future governor taking this step. Agriculture and forestry account for another 8% of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. The state is already launching a Healthy Soils Initiative to increase carbon sequestration via farming. For example, one pilot project is monitoring how much carbon will be stored by clover planted between trees at an almond orchard. The University of California at Davis is also conducting experiments to evaluate how changing livestock feed can reduce methane emissions from cattle. Another 7% comes from the residential sector, most of which is due to burning natural gas for heating and cooking. But stoves, hot water heaters, and heating units can be replaced by electric appliances powered by California’s increasingly carbon-free energy. Last week, Brown also signed a bill directing CARB to study ways of cutting carbon pollution from residential and commercial buildings. In short, there are a lot of feasible ways that California can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and approach carbon neutrality. The plan will may also include some degree of carbon offsetting and carbon capture and sequestration to get the state’s emissions down to (or below) zero by 2045. It’s a daunting but achievable goal. In contrast, the Trump administration has been doing everything in its power to increase carbon pollution for the sake of industry profits. In its latest polluting move, the Trump EPA plans to scrap two regulations aimed at reducing methane pollution from oil and gas wells. According to EPA’s own analysis, repealing a regulation requiring that oil and gas wells be monitored for methane leaks every six months will add 8.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent to the atmosphere over a six-year period. It will save the oil and gas industry, whose annual profits exceed $100bn, $75m per year. That’s the equivalent carbon pollution of adding more than 300,000 cars on the road in order to give the oil & gas industry a 0.07% revenue boost. Levels of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, are already rising. The Trump EPA wants to further loosen rules on leaks and releases by the oil and gas industry.https://t.co/O2kfhELrA3 pic.twitter.com/wmXqDyzgjg It’s hard to imagine a starker contrast. The Trump administration is making America the stupidest country in the world on climate change, while the Democrats running California are creating a roadmap to show the world how to meet the Paris climate target. And the GOP is running away from California and toward Trump. We’re launching our own damn satellite! https://t.co/3NQhPKYtmv #GCAS2018 🌎🛰️ pic.twitter.com/I5616pJODy"
"Climate change activism has always had the stubbornly tough task of mobilizing the public to confront a slow-moving, largely invisible problem while being stymied by a fantastically wealthy fossil fuel industry and an array of sceptics in politics and the media. Climate campaigners would, therefore, be forgiven a few moments of despair in the era of Donald Trump. Trump's election elicited two large public howls from those concerned about climate change – the People's Climate March and the Science March, held within days of each other in April last year – but any hopes of persuasion have now given way to attritional confrontation and attempts to bypass the administration altogether. Now a series of marches and other events across 70 countries on Saturday called Rise for Climate Action, is framed as a grassroots movement aimed squarely at spurring local mayors, businesses and state leaders to slash emissions regardless of Trump, with the hope a future president will find the momentum impossible to ignore. “I'd hesitate to say we are giving up on the federal government at the moment but we have to be realistic,” said May Boeve, the executive director of 350.org, a climate change campaign group that is a lead organizer for Saturday. “Quite a lot can be done at the city level and we have an opportunity to highlight that. We are up against huge obstacles and Donald Trump is a massive one. This is about being clear what we are asking for when the opportunity presents itself.” The message being honed for the Rise for Climate Action is one of a swift transition to 100% renewable energy, with the image of fossil fuel companies painted as being little different from their tobacco counterparts. Many of those taking part in the various marches and other events in the US will be highlighting the aspects of society worsened by climate change, such as inequality and racial prejudice. Miya Yoshitani, of the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, will be taking part in the main climate march, which expects to attract tens of thousands of people in San Francisco, to decry the air pollution suffered largely by black and Asian American communities in the Bay Area. “There are refineries and freeways so air quality is a big issue for everyone, but race is a bigger factor than income as to how bad you get it,” she said. “The Bay Area is known to be a very progressive place, with its technology and innovation, but it's also a place of extreme inequality. There is massive gentrification and displacement of people and climate change is a huge threat multiplier for those things. “Here, climate change is things like sea level rise, wildfires and drought but it's also housing affordability and energy costs. The effects are going to be borne by low-income communities that already miss out on school and work days because of air pollution. It's not a distant threat, it's here right now. “I grew up in Chicago but moved here in the 1990s and have seen these huge changes with the growth of the dotcom companies. We feel [California governor] Jerry Brown has failed some of these communities and we have to let him know we will hold him accountable.” The San Francisco march, timed as an unofficial curtain raiser for the Global Climate Action Summit that starts in the city next week, will demand that Brown end fossil fuel extraction and begin the complete shift to renewable energy recently backed by California lawmakers. Activists fear that even states purportedly progressive on climate change, such as California, are leaving behind certain communities. “California is on fire at the moment and we have flooding and heatwaves caused by a fossil fuel industry that is being allowed to continue when everything needed for a just transition is available,” said Pennie Opal Plant, an environmental campaigner of Yaqui, Mexican, Choctaw, Cherokee and European descent. “Native people are going to be at the very front of the march because we are on the frontlines of fossil fuel extraction and processing. In the Bakken oil fields [an area in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota] there are high rates of cancer, in the tar fields of Canada they've destroyed and poisoned huge areas of boreal forests where people hunt and find medicines. “My family has lived in the Bay Area since the 1930s and Chevron and the other refineries have just got bigger and bigger. It's been a constant struggle and the rates of cancer and asthma are very high. In our tribal traditions we understand we are responsible for the wellbeing for the coming seven generations. As a grandmother I'm concerned we are not handing a healthy environment on to my grandson and his generation.” Opal Plant said it was “devastating” to see the Trump administration throw open large tracts of land for oil drilling and coalmining, including areas in the Arctic and Utah considered crucially important both spiritually and for hunting. “It's an horrendous nightmare to think they'd drill in the Grand Canyon or Bears Ears [national monument in Utah],” she said. “We've got to rise up because that's how slavery was abolished, that's how women got the vote and how civil rights came about. There's nothing more important right now than to rise up to ensure a livable environment for the future.” Protesters in Puerto Rico will demand that the US territory rebuild its electricity grid, which was shattered by Hurricane Maria last year, with renewable sources such as solar and wind, while people will gather in Miami to call for greater urgency to confront the threat of sea level rise. Others will target specific projects, such as a planned electricity substation in Boston, located in a flood-prone area of a diverse neighbourhood, and a new oil pipeline near New Orleans that acts as an extension of the controversial Dakota Access endeavour. “This pipeline starts on indigenous land and it ends in St James, an African American area that is already surrounded by a dozen petrol-chemical facilities,” said Anne Rolfes, who grew up near the heart of the oil industry in Lafayette, Louisiana. “We will be demanding that people in St James get an evacuation route for when one of these plants explodes, because there isn't one at the moment. It's a pretty pathetic request really, to be frank. “Stopping the pipeline is an urgent issue too but we need a damn evacuation route. If you're rolling over the top of these communities you've at least got to let them have a way out. “Elected officials pretend to care about flooding but they've never met a petrol-chemical project they didn't like. These areas in Louisiana are going underwater but it's just one big anti-climate science parade. “It's not as if we have any level of government that is responsive at the moment but acting now is better than if we just did nothing. To some degree you need blind faith in some sort of miracle down here. I think we will have around 200 people for the protest, which is quite good for Louisiana.” Some of those taking part dismiss any focus on Trump as merely a distraction from decades of decisions in the US that have placed minority communities directly in harm's way from power plants, landfills and other sources of insidious pollution. “I'm tired of doing marches in Minnesota. People do them and go home and say 'I've done my bit now,' which isn't how it works. We need a strong, lasting movement,” said Sophia Benrud, a chef who is helping set up an event explaining the dangers of climate change in a district of east Minneapolis historically blighted by industrial pollution. “The Trump administration isn't what is motivating me. I hate politics. This is about my life, my family. We have had white people setting our agenda for a long time. Look at Flint and the problems there. Would you ever see that in a wealthy white neighbourhood? Obviously not. “I've always cared about the planet. I'm the woodland creature out of all of my friends; I would happily never live in the city again. Climate change is a symptom of people not being taken care of. If we don't take care of people and of inequality, we will never solve this problem.”"
"California is set to launch a satellite to track greenhouse gases, as former US Secretary of State John Kerry and island nation leaders warned that the world is far off course to avoid the worst effects of rising temperatures. Gov. Jerry Brown announced plans for the satellite on the last day of a climate change summit hosted by San Francisco, in a final rebuke to President Donald Trump’s denial of man-made warming. “With science still under attack,” Brown said “we’re going to launch our own satellite, our own damn satellite, to figure out where the pollution is.” Brown said the satellite will help pinpoint the source of planet-warming emissions. California will team up with Planet Labs, a company run by ex-Nasa scientists. The data collected, including on carbon dioxide emissions and methane leaks from oil and gas operations, could be made public as part of a partnership with the advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund. The new project comes as Trump has proposed slashing Nasa climate research mission budgets. It is one of dozens of commitments of mixed significance unveiled by states, cities and businesses at the event. Despite the optimism on show at the summit, Kerry said climate efforts must ramp up. “I am going to tell the truth, and the truth is we are not anywhere near where we need to be with respect to the overall challenge of climate change,” said Kerry, who worked to secure the 2015 global Paris climate agreement under former president Barack Obama. Kerry blasted Donald Trump for deciding to leave that deal, calling it “one of the single greatest acts of irresponsibility by a president of the United States anywhere at any time.” Leaders of the countries already suffering most from sea-level rise and ocean acidification echoed Kerry’s concerns, saying that international action is slowing. “The world has lost, all of us have lost, momentum since Paris in 2015. Although the rate of increase has slowed, we’ve not yet peaked our global emissions. But we must do so by 2020. We really cannot afford to wait any longer,” said Mia Mottley, prime minister of the Caribbean island nation of Barbados. Mottley’s country is in the direct path of hurricanes that are growing in strength and may narrowly avoid a more direct hit from tropical storm Isaac this week. The world is set to watch temperatures rise 3C above pre-industrial levels by the time a child born today is old, Mottley said, even if countries adhere to the goals they said. Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji, said countries need to speed their work. “We all know that the levels of ambition in our national plans need to be ramped up because we are not on track to meet the targets of the Paris agreement,” Bainimarama said. Former US vice-president Al Gore struck a more positive tone. “We must do it. We can do it. I’m convinced ever more because of the success of this summit here in San Francisco that we will do it,” he said, reminding that the US has not technically left the Paris deal yet and that a new president could re-enter. The warnings were at odds with the overall atmosphere of the summit. On the eve of the gathering, California governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that would make the state’s electricity supply carbon-free by 2045. A separate executive order by Brown is more sweeping, committing to net zero emissions across the entire California economy, also by 2045. Other cities and regions from around the world have followed this with various pledges, with New York City promising $4bn to renewable energy and clean water and cities including Los Angeles, Tokyo, Honolulu, Oslo and Greater Manchester pledging to build energy efficient buildings or deploy fleets of electric buses. A group of 29 philanthropists committed $4bn over five years to combat climate change, the largest such investment of its kind, while companies such as Ikea, Walmart and Unilever promised to reduce emissions through measures such as electrified trucks for deliveries and action to prevent deforestation in the tropics. Jonathan Pershing, the State Department’s climate negotiator under Obama, said the summit brings hope to the climate cause. “The story here is optimistic. The question here is does the optimism translate, and can this message get out globally,” Pershing said. “There is a good broad cross-section of people from around the world, but it’s just a few thousand people, and it’s a problem that’s going to require engagement by millions.”"
"Italian farmers are in crisis as low prices of wheat, desiccated land and big companies importing grain take their toll. But some have found a solution: growing cannabis. Hemp cultivation has been legal in Italy since 2016, and over the last few years the amount of land dedicated to the plant has increased from 400 hectares (1,000 acres) in 2013 to 4,000 hectares today. The law – which allows cultivation for non-pharmaceutical use of plants with up to 0.2% of the psychoactive compound THC – was introduced with the intention of increasing the development of industrial hemp production. Italians have taken advantage of the legal change to produce not only hemp ricotta and environmentally friendly bricks, but also hemp pasta and biscuits. “The boom in the production of hemp is an excellent example of the ability of agricultural firms to discover new frontiers,” said Roberto Moncalvo, the president of Coldiretti, Italy’s largest farmers’ association. “We are in the middle of an opportunity for economic and employment growth.” Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com This solution to the crisis affecting Italian farmers can be seen in a small green oasis set in the arid interior of Sicily. Among the clay fields and sheaves of abandoned grain, a sign depicting a seven-point leaf hangs from a gate. Beyond it is Salvo Scuderi, the president of the agricultural cooperative Colli Erei. The 41-year-old has just finished reaping part of his hemp harvest, which will be used to make pasta, oil and flour. This year, Scuderi and 20 other producers of Rete Canapa Sicilia, an association whose goal is to promote and market the use of hemp in the region, have together produced almost 150 tonnes. “Hemp saved our business,” he said. “This year we earned 10 times more than what we used to earn with wheat and it has enabled us to hire four workers.” Wheat yields a profit of €250 (£220) per hectare in today’s market, while hemp can generate net earnings in excess of €2,500 per hectare, according t Rete Canapa Sicilia. And there are many Sicilian farmers who, in order to breathe new life into the dry land and to improve their financial situation have substituted wheat with hemp. In the countryside around Catenanuova, temperatures can reach the mid-40s in the summer. It is where the Italian car manufacturer Fiat used to test its prototypes under high temperatures, scorching weather would force trains to stopbecause of expanding rails. But it is not the heat alone that has caused the desiccation of the land. “Years of monocultural wheat cultivation are the problem,” said Dario Giambalvo, professor of agricultural sciences at the University of Palermo. “It has caused soil erosion, and is at risk of soon making the land infertile.” According to data from Italy’s Council for Agricultural Research and Analysis of Agricultural Economics, land planted with durum wheat decreased by 7.4% in southern Italy last year, and by more than 9% in the north of the country. Overall production decreased by more than 4% during the last year. This is why the move towards to hemp farming could help, say experts. “The cultivation of hemp is a valid opportunity for a diversified farming which can be a good solution for the rebirth of abandoned and less fertile land,” said Giambalvo, “The ancient Romans taught us that diversifying crops can help make the land more fertile. I do not know if this will lead to the growth of the agricultural sector, certainly for Italy is a return to the origins.” Up to the 1940s, Italy was the world’s largest producer of hemp after the Soviet Union. Back then in Italy, more 100,000 hectares were planted with hemp. After the war andthe move towards synthetic fibres, the cultivation of hemp plummeted. The downward trend continued as the campaign against illegal drug use was strengthened. In 1961 the Italian government signed the single convention on narcotic drugs. Despite the international treaty specifically excluding non-pharmaceutical hemp production from the regulations controlling cannabis, it led to further to decline in hemp cultivation in Italy. This could open the way for the legalisation of plant species with levels of psychoactive substances over 0.2% “Hemp has been waiting 60 years to reclaim its rightful place,” said Scuderi. “And this could open the way for the legalisation of plant species with levels of psychoactive substances over 0.2% and to develop pharmaceutical experimentation.” The 2016 law does not prohibit the commercialisation of hemp flowers, a gap that allowed market for the sale of light cannabis to blossom, with more than 500 stores in Italy. The flowers, sealed in bags or jars with names such as Gorilla Blue, Amnesia and Raging Bull, can be collected and used for tisanes or as scents for wardrobes. But the majority of customers simply crumble them, roll them and smoke them. The effects are not as pronounced as most cultivated strains of cannabis, which typically have THC levels of 15-25%, but do offer an immediate sense of relaxation. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Italy ranks third in Europe for consumption of cannabis. On his company’s jars of hemp flowers, Scuderi has placed a label: “pizzo-free”. “It means the product is made without giving a cent to the mafia,” he said. “We launched a clear message: producing cannabis doesn’t mean just regenerating the land; it is also a way to weaken the mafia, which for decades has continued uninhibited in its quest to control the criminal business of drugs trafficking, and to give back to the farmers what the bosses had taken away from them.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

"Senior climate scientists say that the world’s carbon sinks could be facing a grave threat from a wholly unexpected source: the EU’s renewable energy directive. The climate law could suck in as much imported wood as Europe harvests each year because it will count energy created from the burning of whole trees as “carbon neutral”, according to several academics including a former vice-chair of the UN IPCC.  Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, who is now a climate sciences professor at Université Catholique de Louvain, said the risk of the directive encouraging tree clearances and the destruction of global carbon sinks was now “extremely high”. “This amounts to sawing off the branch on which humanity sits,” he told the Guardian. Indonesia and Brazil were among 27 countries which pledged “to increase the use of wood … to generate energy as part of efforts to counter climate change” at the Bonn climate summit last year. Without additional conservation measures, “the directive in its present form will create a large demand for wood that will contribute to destroying those forests,” van Ypersele said. “It is a catastrophe in the making.” The EU’s thinking has been that carbon neutrality can be achieved by planting new saplings that eventually compensate for the carbon released by the burning of trees for energy. But the saplings’ growth can takes decades or centuries. By 2050, replacing fossil fuels with wood will likely result in two- to three times more carbon in the atmosphere per gigajoule of final energy, the paper says. Nino Aveni, a spokesman for the Bioenergy Europe trade association, argued that new saplings could reabsorb the CO2 emitted by fully grown burned trees within “years to decades”. “Sustainability criteria are a guarantee that existing forest protection measures are applied to wood used for bioenergy production,” he said. “EU member states have already strong forest policies in place.” An EU official confirmed that the new analysis was accurate – and said that if anything, it underestimated the scale of the problem. The directive “really will [spark] a race to the bottom because there is no inherent limit to the potential over-harvesting,” the source said. “There is a high risk that it will involve the possibility of increasing emissions with no possibility of any greenhouse gas savings at all.” The magnitude of the problem – which eminent academics last year described as “a critical flaw” in EU climate policy – was not understood within the EU, the source claimed. “Partly that is because of wishful thinking,” the official said. “Partly it is so fundamentally wrong that most people would not believe it could be as wrong as it is.”"
"America’s governors, mayors and CEOs are forging ahead with climate change initiatives despite the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and commitment to reviving the coal industry. But a report published today sets out a roadmap that could quicken that pace and cut carbon emissions to 24% below 2005 levels by 2025 in the absence of federal leadership.  Many US states, cities and businesses have rallied around the Paris commitments since Donald Trump pulled out from the agreement in June 2017. The America’s Pledge on Climate initiative was set up the same year by the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and the California governor, Jerry Brown, to map “bottom up” US climate action. The US is already almost halfway to meeting its 2025 Paris Agreement emissions goal of 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. The report claims existing commitments and policies will drive US emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2025 – around two-thirds of the original Paris goal. It also sets out 10 climate action strategies – across most major economic sectors including electricity, transportation and buildings – that, if implemented broadly, could lower emissions to 21% . Broader engagement and collaboration could bring this figure to 24%, the report suggests. Strategies include setting and implementing more stringent renewable energy procurement policies, accelerating the phase-out of super-polluting refrigerant gases, and mapping and repairing methane leaks from natural gas pipelines. Researchers at the University of Maryland and the Rocky Mountain Institute, an independent thinktank, surveyed all 50 states, the largest 285 cities (100,000-plus population) and a cross section of businesses to map climate actions nationwide. Those committed to the Paris Agreement represent over half the US population (173 million people), over half the US economy ($11.4tn) and over 35% of nationwide greenhouse gas emissions. Paul Bodnar, managing director at the Rocky Mountain Institute and a co-author of the report, told the Guardian: “There have been growing coalitions in the US – cities working together, states working together, businesses working together. What’s changed in the last year and what’s new is this cross-cutting perspective. When states pass laws that help cities’ [emissions] strategies, or when states’ renewable portfolio standards are designed to help businesses – that’s really where we’re seeing really interesting, high-impact results.” The report, launched on the eve of Governor Brown’s Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco this week, showcases examples of states, cities and businesses pioneering climate change initiatives. Arkansas is the only state in the south-east with energy efficiency resource standards (EERS), which require electric and natural gas utilities to propose and administer energy efficiency programs. Since 2009, strategies ranging from customer outreach to new technology have supported these programs, resulting in megawatt-hour savings enough to power 28,000 homes for a year. Los Angeles’s mayor, Eric Garcetti, was the driving force behind BlueLA, the city’s first all-electric car share program designed to serve low-income residents. Stations are located in LA’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods and the program is expected to take 1,000 vehicles off the road by 2020. BlueLA also employs community members to lead on education and outreach. New Jersey’s largest utility, Public Service Electric & Gas used methane leak data collected by EDF and Google Street View vehicles equipped with leak detection sensors, leading to a 83% reduction in leakages. Brown signed a bill this week pledging that the state will obtain 100% of its power from clean sources by 2045. California is the second US state to do so, following Hawaii’s pledge in 2015. The report comes in the same week that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released proposals to ease monitoring of methane gas leaks. These would unpick the raft of rules introduced under the Obama administration in 2016 to monitor methane leaks because of their negative contribution to climate change. Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board and vice-chair of America’s Pledge, acknowledged that the bottom up approach “has no sanctions or penalties” but that it represented “a coalition of entities that have the capacity to make a difference”.

"With the appointment of Angus Taylor as minister for energy, Scott Morrison has clearly signalled that he has no care about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. So utterly bereft of reason on the issue and so completely consumed by climate change denial the government is now at the point where even the pretence of doing something to reduce emissions is viewed with distrust. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly I have a degree of sympathy for members of the public who are climate change deniers. I have this sympathy because I was once one of them.  I don’t mean I was a climate change denier in the sense of believing it all was some gigantic hoax perpetrated by the deep state and the UN. I mean denying in the sense of doing my level best to deny it was happening.  Because it scared the bejeezus out of me.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s when I was finishing high school and studying at university I was of course well aware of climate change. As a politically engaged, super-serious youth who listened to Midnight Oil and U2 and read every newspaper and news magazine I could afford, I was across all the news about the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions.  And it didn’t sound good.  So subconsciously I wanted to ignore it. I would read articles spelling out the dire future ahead and would spend the rest of the day in a depressed funk, because the problem with facing up to the reality of climate change is to face up to the fact that your life thus far has played a role. Your preference for driving a car, the aerosol sprays you used, the food you consumed, or heck, the generation of the electricity you depend upon had all contributed to producing greenhouse gases.  It is real, it is happening, it is getting worse and we need to act It brought with it a level of guilt my 18-year-old self could do without, and even worse, a fear of having to change my lifestyle that I didn’t want to face. And so I would hold on to anything that would suggest it was not so bad. I would cling to those who suggested that each individual couldn’t really make much of a difference (so I can keep those lights switched on). I would inwardly cheer when a friend would (wrongly) suggest he’d read that it was all due to natural factors and things would balance out; or when another would (wrongly) say he’d heard that ironically the hole in the ozone layer apparently cancelled out the impact of global warming, or yet another who would (also wrongly) assert that the changes would in reality be so small that we wouldn’t notice it. And if all else failed I just sighed and thought, well, the impact was likely to happen only by around 2050 or so, and in 1990 to an 18-year-old that meant there was ample time and opportunity for something to get done. Surely a fix would occur – we always end up finding a fix.  And yet ... and yet. I knew I was burying my head in the sand. I was not so much denying the science as wanting to deny reality. The more I read the less able I was to do so. But even now I still get a faint glimmer of hope when I read some dumb article suggesting some research has found evidence that it’s all fine.  Because I don’t want climate change to be a real thing. I would love it to all be a hoax.  But it is not.  And so I understand why people choose to believe those who say climate change is not the issue, that the issue is power prices and thus we need to fire up the coal furnaces.  Denial is a very easy way out of guilt that your lifestyle is leaving your children and grandchildren an awful legacy. Denial is a good way to throw away concerns that you might have to actually wear a cost – either through lifestyle changes or monetary loss.  It is a scary thing to hear talk of the impacts of climate change and the suggestions that it might be too late to do anything. It is so much easier to live in denial, especially when you have charlatans in the media and politics who have seen this fear and have sought to profit from it.  So I have some sympathy for those who feel overwhelmed by it all.  But I have none for those in the media and politics who seek to profit from this fear.  There is no excuse for those trying to lull people into believing it is all a great scam, that there is nothing to worry about, or no need for concern, or that little can or should be done.  According to Nasa, of the 1,663 months since January 1880, the top 100 for temperature anomaly have all occurred since 1990, and every month since December 2014 is in the top 100.  2018 is on track to be the third-hottest year behind 2016 and 2017; fourth is 2015.  It is real, it is happening, it is getting worse and we need to act. And yet this week Taylor gave a speech that made zero mention of wind power – the main renewable energy in Australia – and in which he declared he wasn’t sceptical of climate change, just of subsidies for renewable energy, the Gillard government’s emissions trading scheme and of “excessive renewable energy targets.” This is despite that fact that renewable energy not only reduces our emissions, it also provides cheaper electricity. It’s a bit like the health minister saying she is not an anti-vaxxer, she is just sceptical of the merits of the National Immunisation Program. But don’t worry, it’s unlikely the Morrison government will withdraw from the Paris agreement, because, why bother? It just won’t do anything to actually ensure our emissions targets are achieved. Rather than risk offending those lunatics in his party who would rather destroy a prime ministership than have a policy with even a slight reference to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Morrison appears to have decided to do nothing.  The costs of responding to climate change increase, the longer it is put off by those whose wilful ignorance sees them continue to proffer policy based on the premise that climate change is fake. We have gone from a government under Malcolm Turnbull that at least tried to look like it was aiming to reduce emissions (even if it wasn’t) to one under Scott Morrison that is making no pretence about the fact it is beholden to the charlatans in the party who want to scam votes by lying about the facts of climate change. And a political party that refuses to act on climate change is not fit to govern. • Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"Companies including Facebook, Google and Microsoft have failed to distance themselves from a lobby group’s proposal to fight any effort by the EU to set more ambitious climate change goals. A leaked document shows that BusinessEurope, Europe’s biggest business lobbying group, will urge members to oppose any moves by the European Commission to ratchet up the bloc’s 2030 targets for clean energy, carbon cuts and energy efficiency. The commission is considering whether to set more ambitious goals in November after a key international science panel report on meeting tougher global warming targets is published in October, and before a UN climate summit in December. But, at meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, BusinessEurope will ask big companies to agree a “line to take” on the prospect of steeper carbon cuts. If the commission’s measures have teeth, the group’s “advocacy and communication strategy” recommends companies agree to fight them. “To oppose the new increase of ambition, using the usual arguments of global playing field, we cannot compensate for others, etc,” the document said. If the commission opts for warm words and a political statement rather than a material ratcheting up of the targets, the group suggests it should react by being “rather positive”. BusinessEurope’s members include household names in the energy and technology sectors, many of which have spoken of the need for strong action on climate change. When contacted by the Guardian to ask if they agreed or disagreed with the lobby group’s suggested opposition, UK business trade body the CBI, German conglomerate Siemens, French energy firms Engie and EDF Energy, and Japanese multinational Hitachi all failed to distance themselves from the proposal. Tech giants Facebook, Google and Microsoft, all of which source renewable energy and have stressed the importance of cutting emissions, also failed to comment on where they stood on the proposal. A CBI spokesperson said the group “has always been supportive of the ambitious and challenging climate targets set by the EU and the UK”. BusinessEurope said the meeting was a starting point to discuss what its position should be. Kate Blagojevic, head of climate and energy at Greenpeace, which obtained the leaked document, said: “This powerful industry lobby is busy plotting behind the scenes to derail further action from the EU ahead of a major climate summit.” Blagojevic said she was surprised companies appeared willing to go along with the proposal and urged them to “reject this cynical plan and use Wednesday’s meeting to stop it in its tracks”. EU energy chief, Miguel Arias Cañete, said in August that the commission was weighing up whether or not to increase the goal of cutting carbon emissions by 2030 from 40% to 45%. The plan has the support of the commission’s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who has said that he shared Cañete’s conclusions on the carbon target. “This summer’s droughts are a stark reminder – not only for farmers – of just how important that work is to safeguard the future for generations of Europeans. We cannot turn a blind eye to the challenge in front of our noses,” Juncker said this month."
"Australia remains on track to miss its Paris climate targets as carbon emissions continue to soar, according to new data. The figures from NDEVR Environmental for the year up to the end of June 2018 show the country’s emissions were again the highest on record when unreliable data from the land use and forestry sectors was excluded. It is the third consecutive year for record-breaking emissions. NDEVR replicates the federal government’s national greenhouse gas inventory (NGGI) quarterly reports but releases them months ahead of the official data. Previous NDEVR figures have been within 1% of the official figures when eventually released. The government has yet to publish any emissions data for 2018. Its last update was for the year to December 2017, which it published in May and showed Australia’s emissions continue to soar. NDEVR’s report projects Australia will miss its Paris targets by about a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide if emissions continue on their current trajectory. It projects that emissions, excluding land use, will be 558m tonnes, the highest since records began in 2002. It finds that transport emissions were the highest on record in the final quarter of the 2018 financial year and continue to rise. NDEVR said this was due to the rapid increase in the use of diesel fuel in both passenger cars and heavy transport. Emissions from stationary energy and fugitive emissions continue to trend upwards. The rise in stationary emissions is mostly attributable to energy industries excluding electricity generation NDEVR’s report projects a drop in emissions from the electricity sector for the final quarter of the 2018 financial year because of a reduction in total electricity generation in the national electricity market states and an increase in generation from renewables. But Matt Drum, the managing director of NDEVR Environmental, said Australia was still not on track to meet its Paris targets. “Tracking the Paris trend line, they’re still heading north and missing Paris by a long way and our 2050 two-degree target by an even greater margin,” he said. “The data’s telling us clearly again that we’re not on a trajectory to meet our targets, there’s no effective policy to meet our targets, but we’re still hearing commentary from the government that we’re on track to meet our targets.”"
"Individual cities, regions and businesses across the globe are banding together determinedly to confront climate change - but their emissions reductions are relatively small and don’t fully compensate for a recalcitrant US under the Trump administration, a new study has found. A cavalcade of city mayors, regional government representatives and business executives from around the world will convene in San Francisco next month for a major summit touting the role of action beyond national governments to stave off the worst impacts of climate change.  But the greenhouse gas cuts offered up by these entities are relatively modest, according to new research, placing the onus on nations to raise their ambitions even as the US, the world’s second largest emitter, looks to exit the landmark Paris climate agreement. An evaluation of climate change pledges by nearly 6,000 cities, states and regions, representing 7% of the global population, and more than 2,000 companies that have a combined revenue comparable to the size of the US economy, found a total projected reduction of between 1.5bn to 2.2bn tons of greenhouse gases by 2030. In some places this action will be significant, such as in the US, where shifts to cleaner energy and energy efficiency by cities and states are on track to contribute half of the emissions reductions promised by the country in the Paris agreement. But globally these emissions cuts fall short of enabling countries to avoid breaching agreed thresholds for dangerous warming that will trigger increased heatwaves, mightier storms, rising seas and displacement of people. “When we look at the individual pledges [by cities, regions and businesses] the impact isn’t that large so we absolutely need national governments to pull through and do a lot of the heavy lifting,” said Dr Angel Hsu, the director of Data-Driven Yale, which led the study. “The actions of cities, companies and states aren’t insignificant but they can’t do it by themselves. This shows everyone can be doing more. The current reductions are woefully inadequate and hopefully the actions of other entities will give national governments the confidence to be more ambitious.” The analyzed reductions, taken from nine high-emitting countries such as the US, China, India and Brazil, as well as the European Union, overlap with some national efforts that increase the total contribution of emissions cuts. But this action isn’t sufficient to bridge a gap between the Paris agreement’s goal to avoid 2C (3.6F) of global warming, with an aspiration of avoiding a 1.5C increase, and the insufficient emissions reductions put forward by the deal’s nearly 200 national signatories. The agenda of the Trump administration risks making this goal even more challenging. Trump has promised to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement and has unveiled a plan to weaken vehicle emissions standards that could result in more than 1bn tons of extra carbon dioxide over the next 15 years. Last week, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency announced a watered-down climate policy for the energy sector that might even result in emissions rising from coal plants. Even if every Paris commitment is fully implemented, the world is on track to warm by around 3.3C by the end of the century. Pledges by the likes of Berlin, the Coca-Cola company or even an economic powerhouse like California “while welcome, are not sufficient”, said John Sterman, the director of the MIT system dynamics group. “The world is in a desperate race between accelerating climate change and the innovation needed to cut emissions before it’s too late,” said Sterman. “Cities, states, and business are in the lead, but they face stiff headwinds from weak national policies and the continued efforts of fossil fuel interests to undermine the innovation we need.” Global greenhouse gas emissions rose slightly last year, after a short period of stasis, highlighting the looming scenario whereby as-yet unproven technology will be need to be deployed at a mass scale to suck CO2 directly from the air or capture and bury it after burning vegetation, known as biomass, for energy. “We are already in an overshoot situation and it’s likely we are already going to have to need to remove carbon from the air,” said Klaus Lackner, the director of center for negative carbon emissions at Arizona State University. “The idea we just tighten our belt a bit isn’t going to solve the problem. We need to stop using the atmosphere as a dumping ground, abandon fossil fuels, find other sources of energy and deal with the carbon debt we already have. “Cities getting involved is good and important but we haven’t really acknowledged how big and serious the challenge is. We are whistling in the dark.”"
"Australia’s regional authority and influence is being eroded by its refusal to address the threat climate change poses to many of its Pacific neighbours, according to a pre-eminent climate scientist. As part of the Pacific Islands Forum, Australia was a signatory to the Boe declaration in Nauru on Wednesday which said climate change represented “the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific”.  But Australia attempted to water down the language of the declaration, other Pacific countries have said, resisting language around urgent action to cut emissions, and issued qualifications to part of the Pacific Islands Forum communique over the Paris climate agreement. The prime minister of Tuvalu, Enele Sopoaga, said the name of the country seeking qualifications “[started] with capital A”. Australia is the only country in the PIF beginning with A. Several sources from the PIF forum have corroborated Australia’s efforts to weaken the Boe Declaration. Vanuatu’s minister for foreign affairs Ralph Regenvanu said: “I was there, and can confirm this is true. And unfortunate.” Asked specifically by Guardian Australia whether Australia had sought to weaken the language of the declaration, Australia’s foreign minister Marise Payne neither rejected nor confirmed the allegation. “The communique is an agreed document of the Leaders’ Retreat. It is not appropriate to discuss the internal talks of the private Leaders’ Retreat. Pacific Island Forum leaders’ discussions are typically robust and frank and canvas a broad range of issues, including regional security, economic growth, climate change, fisheries and disaster response.” Payne said Australia understood the centrality of the climate threat to many Pacific Islands, and “the importance that Pacific countries place on effective global action to combat climate change”. Australia has pledged $300 million for climate change action in the Pacific between 2016 and 2020, and has also contributed $200 million to the Green Climate Fund. Dr Bill Hare, managing director of Climate Analytics and a lead author on the IPCC fourth assessment report, told Guardian Australia that Pacific leaders were growing increasingly disenchanted with Australia’s refusal to commit to cutting carbon emissions, even as their nations faced massive economic, physical and social disruption, even existential threat. “The leaders are not fools, and they are increasingly confronted by the problems of climate change, in all its different dimensions,” Hare said. “The problem for Australia is it doesn’t have credibility on climate. Australia is an important player for many of the Pacific Island countries, well-respected and well-liked by the populations and the political leaders, but on climate change there is a chasm opening up. “I hear it from Pacific leaders all the time: they are fighting to save their countries and their people and they cannot understand why the Australian government leadership can’t see the problems they’ve got.” Hare said while the language in the Boe declaration was strong, the real test for Australia would be in its actions to address its own emissions, and in helping the Pacific with adaptation. “The actions will not match the gravity of the declaration or the gravity of the need. There is a credibility gap: Australia is not acting on reducing its own emissions. All the leaders know that whenever the prime minister or energy minister says Australia will meet its Paris targets ‘in a canter’, that that it is wrong, it is factually incorrect – it is bullshit. “They know Australia is working to slow down action on meeting Paris targets, they know Australia is promoting coal, and they know it’s going to cause a climate catastrophe. Australia has dedicated and able diplomats across the region, but the political leadership of the government is so far removed from reality, it opens up major problems for the country.” Pacific leaders were confronting losing large proportions of their territory, and the forcible displacement of their populations, Hare said. He said leaders did not want their next generations to grow up dislocated, living in foreign cities like Sydney and Auckland, with the attendant loss of identity, culture and self-esteem. Support for Australia could ebb away, with Pacific Islands looking to other benefactors – in particular China – which has made massive in its aid spending and diplomatic engagement in the region. China is set to overtake Australia as the largest donor to the Pacific, after pledging US$4bn in aid to the region last year. But climate action is acutely politically sensitive for the Australian government, having just abandoned the National Energy Guarantee - which would have mandated emissions cuts - and new prime minister Scott Morrison facing pressure from some members within his own party to abandon Australia’s Paris agreement targets. Morrison said specific emissions reductions targets were not necessary to meet Australia’s Paris goals: “the business-as-usual model gets us there in a canter”. That directly contradicts advice from the government’s own Energy Security Board that says business as usual will mean the electricity sector will “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”. The Australian Conservation Foundation chief executive officer, Kelly O’Shanassy, said Australia’s Boe declaration commitment was welcomed but must be matched by domestic action. “It’s not surprising that Pacific leaders have been unhappy with Australia on climate change with the Morrison government turning up at the Pacific Islands Forum with no real plan to cut our domestic pollution and without a clear indication that it intends to develop one.” Ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum, Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, said Australia’s relationship with the Pacific was “dysfunctional” and akin to an abusive spouse, saying Australia was also responsible for diluting the strength of previous regional declarations on climate change. “Australia is a bit of an anomaly, because on the floor [of climate summits] they’re basically sometimes as far right as Trump in some of their views on climate change … but then on a regional basis they’ve actually given a lot of support to our region.” Hare said Matsutaro spoke the “real and growing truth” about Pacific sentiment towards Australia. “It reflects a major political and diplomatic crisis in the Pacific. If Pacific leaders lose faith in Australia, then they will turn to others, and this is already becoming a major source of discussion. Pacific leaders are not naive about the strings that will come with development from China, but they are beginning to feel abandoned.”"

"The world will soon have a much clearer picture of how quickly humans are melting Earth’s ice and expanding the seas, with data collected by a sophisticated satellite launched by Nasa. Every 91 days, the $1bn, decade-in-the-making creation will orbit over more than 1,000 paths. The satellite, about the size of a Smart car, will point six lasers at ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctica. It will then calculate how long the beams take to bounce back. Nasa will be able to more accurately measure the heights of ice sheets and the thickness of remaining sea ice. “With sea ice, we’ve been able to measure the extent (or area) really well since about 1980 … but what we haven’t been able to measure is the thickness,” said Tom Neumann, Nasa’s deputy project scientist for the mission. “Thickness is a key piece of the puzzle because thinner sea ice is broken up more easily by storms. It melts faster. So it gives you some insight into why the area is changing the way it is.” Melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica has increased the global sea level more than a millimeter per year, a third of the overall increase, according to Nasa. Sea-level rise is getting faster, and seas could be several feet higher by the end of the century. The IceSat-2, launched Saturday, replaces an original satellite that has been out of commission since 2009. Between 2003 and 2009, the measured sea ice lost 40% of its thickness, Neumann said. Since then, Nasa has used a plane to take more rudimentary measurements of ice melt for about a month per year in the Arctic and Antarctic. That covered less ground but allowed Nasa to monitor the fastest changing parts of the ice sheets and sea ice. Neumann said it’s possible the satellite will find ice loss beyond what Nasa has measured so far. Gaps in data, including in east Antarctica, could show ice shrinking or growing. The new satellite will provide more complete coverage and measure to within a centimeter. “In the time it takes someone to blink, sort of half a second, IceSat-2 is going to collect 5,000 measurements in each of its six beams, and it’s going to do that every hour, every day … it’s a tremendous amount of data,” Neumann said. While Donald Trump doubts the scientific consensus around man-made climate change and his administration is rescinding standards to stall warming, Neumann said multiple federal agencies want to see the satellite data when it starts coming back in October. The US Geological Survey is interested in the elevation data, and the navy would like to look at how changes will affect shipping channels, he said. With ice melt, new routes are expected to open through the Arctic, significantly reducing shipping times. Nasa has an entire fleet of satellites observing Earth, including for signs of climate change. Trump this year proposed cutting the budget that funds many of the others. Private companies and public interest groups and even the state of California have announced their own plans for climate-related satellites. A collaboration between the Environmental Defense Fund and Harvard University is expected to launch in 2021 and as will pinpoint methane leaks from oil and gas operations. Steven Hamburg, chief scientist for EDF, said researchers realized they could build the satellite faster and cheaper than the government. EDF research suggests oil and gas companies in the US leak 60% more methane than environmental regulators estimate. Methane traps far more heat than the more common carbon dioxide. Because it is short-lived, cutting emissions would have a rapid impact on temperatures, Hamburg said. The European Space Agency has a satellite that measures greenhouse gases, but it doesn’t specify in detail where leaks are happening. GHGSat, a private company, expects to launch a second greenhouse-gas-monitoring satellite soon."
"The existential threat of climate change is being spelled out to New Yorkers via a selection of flashing highway signs that have been placed around the city. The 10 large solar-powered signs have been placed in locations in each of New York’s five boroughs, including areas deemed particularly vulnerable to the sea level rise and powerful storms associated with climate change, including the Rockaways in Queens and the west side of Manhattan.  Messages such as “Climate change at work” and “Climate denial kills” will be displayed in English, as well as in languages commonly spoken in the areas they will be deployed, such as Spanish, Russian and French. The signs are part of a project by the Climate Museum and a host of partners, including the New York City’s mayor’s office. The installation, called Climate Signals, has been done by Justin Brice Guariglia, an artist who regularly focuses on environmental themes in his work. “These signs sound a warning about the climate crisis and they call us to think and act on the issue,” said Miranda Massie, director of the Climate Museum. “When you see a flashing traffic signal your initial response is that there are uncertain conditions ahead, and that is exactly what climate change is. This is the perfect medium for bringing up this alert.” Some of the sites will include elements such as voter registration and appearances by climate scientists. Massie said the work is not overtly activist in nature, despite the unfolding agenda of Donald Trump, a native of Queens, to dismiss the science of climate change and dismantle policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “Anyone who is aware of the climate crisis is appalled and alarmed by the disgraceful assault by the administration on climate progress,” she said. “But this project isn’t political in a narrow sense, it’s about social and cultural action. We need a social shift to deal with climate change. It shouldn’t be a political lightning rod.” Daniel Zarrilli, New York City’s chief resilience officer, said: “Climate change is one of New York City’s greatest challenges and requires creative approaches to educate and engage all of us about its risks and solutions. Art can play a valuable role in this effort.” Climate Signals will be visible across New York City until 6 November"
"Australia attempted to water down a resolution on climate change agreed by country representatives at the Pacific Islands Forum, a leader attending the event has claimed.Pacific leaders issued the Boe declaration on Wednesday night, calling climate change “the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific” at the conclusion of the Pacific Islands Forum, which has been held in Nauru this week. However the forum communique – which focused heavily on climate change and the need for emissions reductions – was endorsed by leaders “with qualification”.  When asked at a press conference if those qualifications came from a country “beginning with A”, Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister of Tuvalu, confirmed that “the name of the qualifier, seeking qualifications [started] with capital A”. Australia is the only nation in the Pacific to fit this description.It appears Australia also did not support a section of agreement calling on the United States to return to the Paris agreement on climate change. The communique made it clear that it was only “leaders of forum island countries” – a term that a forum spokesperson confirmed denoted all forum member countries other than Australia and New Zealand – who called on the US to return to the Paris agreement on climate change. A spokesperson from the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said: “I can confirm that NZ absolutely supports the reference in the communique calling for the US to return to the Paris agreement.” Guardian Australia has sought comment from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Sopoaga said it was essential the US return to the agreement and commit to reducing emissions.“We cannot have comprehensive robust emissions reductions unless the biggest emitter is there in the process, we cannot leave the US out, they are responsible for 25% of global emissions,” he said. The Boe declaration committed all forum countries to meeting their Paris agreement targets – a question of fierce domestic political debate in Australia. “Leaders reaffirmed the importance of immediate urgent action to combat climate change and … called on countries, particularly large emitters, to fully implement their … mitigation targets,” the declaration said. The president of host nation Nauru, Baron Waqa, said despite the fact the declaration included a qualification from Australia “that doesn’t make it any weaker”. But the Australian government’s apparent ambivalence towards a low-emissions climate policy has disquieted its Pacific neighbours. Low-lying island Pacific countries including Kiribati are forecast to be among the first on the planet to disappear underwater if rising sea levels are not arrested.Australia’s attempts to resist the strong language in the Boe declaration fits with its past behaviour at international meetings, according to a Pacific climate change representative who has represented his nation at COP summits for the last five years.Speaking to Guardian Australia ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum, Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, in the north-west Pacific, said Australia was “responsible for making our declarations weaker sometimes in the region”.“So there’s been forums that were formulated so [Australia] won’t be involved in it, they’re not members, so that whatever language that really reflects our views and our circumstances is actually reflected in the declaration,” he said. He also likened Australia to an ""abusive spouse"", saying Australia provided aid to the region to deal with the effects of global warming but undermining attempts to halt its progress.

"Jerry Brown, California’s governor, has accused Donald Trump of “gross ignorance” over climate change as he made his most sweeping actions yet to rid the world’s fifth largest economy of fossil fuels.  Brown not only signed a bill that calls for 100% of the state’s electricity to come from carbon-free sources by 2045 but also penned an executive order demanding that California completely eliminate net emissions across its economy, including transport and agriculture, by the same year. The order, which cites “historic droughts, devastating storms, torrential storms, extreme heat … and threats to human health”, requires California pull more greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere than it puts in by 2046, using vegetation and new technologies. Brown told the Guardian that California was taking the lead globally in confronting an issue that’s an “existential challenge” to the planet and claimed that Trump was the main obstacle to further progress. “I don’t believe Trump represents the present but he has the power, he has the Republicans hook, line and sinker,” he said. “His unabashed acolytes will follow him over the cliff. Gross ignorance is dangerous. The battle is with Trump – that’s the number one fight. But once he’s out of there, dealing with climate change will still be a fight.” The Trump administration has sought to dismantle emissions rules for coal-fired power plants and loosen fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, targeting California’s ability to set stricter vehicle regulations than the rest of the country. Brown has set a target of 5m electric cars on California’s roads but said “at the rate we’re going they will be made by Chinese companies and that will principally be the fault of Donald Trump. The American auto industry is on the chopping block at at the moment he is chopping it into oblivion.” The vision of carbon neutrality and the banishment of fossil fuels set out by Brown has taken aback even some environmentalists in a state that is a major oil and gas producer, as well as the nation’s agricultural heavyweight. California will look to soak up carbon through expanded forests, at a time when enormous wildfires are a growing blight on the state, or inject carbon underground or in algal blooms – a technological challenge that has yet to be proven at scale. “Places like Sweden and Costa Rica have had those kind of pledges but California is the fifth largest economy in the world,” said Nigel Purvis, who oversaw environmental diplomacy at the state department under the Clinton and George W Bush administrations. “This is historic. It’s a really major step. Jerry Brown has been one of America’s great climate leaders.” Now entering the twilight of his second spell as governor, Brown has forged a reputation for environmentalism, bringing in one of the first ever tax incentives for rooftop solar during his first period as the state’s chief executive, which ran from 1975 to 1983. His second stint as governor, which began in 2011, has seen Brown throw himself at the issue of climate change, overseeing a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels during a period of strong economic growth by implementing a carbon-trading scheme that recently expanded in scope to help prevent deforestation overseas. Latterly, his tenure has brought him into diametric opposition to Trump. Brown has compared the president’s climate policies to falling off the top of the Empire State Building and said California will “launch its own damn satellite” if Trump hobbles Nasa’s climate research. “He has pushed back the shallow narrative that you can’t grow the economy while cutting carbon pollution,” said Benjamin Houlton, director of the University of California Davis John Muir Institute of the Environment. “He’s shown that’s false. He’s set a model that can transform other countries.” Brown has been assailed on the right by Republicans, who have claimed his targets are unfeasible and will raise the cost of electricity in the state, as well as some on the left who complain that he has been too willing to appease around oil and gas companies and has failed to phase out drilling in California. Last week, Brown’s move to stop the Trump administration attempts to allow drilling off California’s coast was dismissed as “pure theater” by May Boeve, executive director of climate campaign group 350.org. “The governor says ‘not here, not now’, but he’s permitted more than 20,000 new oil and gas wells up and down California during his tenure,” she added. Further concerns have been raised over the stubbornly poor air quality in parts of the state, a problem that’s a particular burden for communities of colour that live near highways and industrial facilities such as oil refineries. “The critical question now is whether the transition to 100% renewable energy will be a just transition that benefits everyone, especially workers and communities most impacted by pollution and climate change,” said Miya Yoshitani, executive director of the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, which is based in the Bay Area. Brown himself has echoed the desire for a quickening of pace given the threats California faces – a recent report found the state is set for a major increase in temperatures and sea level, thousands of extra deaths and the loss of two-thirds of its beaches by the end of this century. This urgency will be spelled out in a major climate summit held in San Francisco this week, as mayors, business leaders and activists from around the world assemble in what will be the largest, and last, gathering on the issue hosted by Brown before he retires to the family ranch. “Transformation is not for wimps,” he said. “Yes it’s difficult but we are moving at a pace greater than any country. Is it too slow? Yes, but we’re doing everything we can. “My legacy is restoring my great-grandfather’s ranch. In 10 years there will be a whole new grid, a whole new political class. The whole idea of a legacy is a canard.”"
"Australian companies should be doing more to disclose risks to their business from climate change, according to a report by the corporate regulator Asic. The review, published on Thursday, examined climate risk disclosures by 60 companies in the ASX 300, in 25 recent initial public offering (IPO) prospectuses, and across 15,000 annual reports.  Of the 60 companies, Asic found 17% identified climate change as a material risk to their business. The regulator said that while most ASX 100 companies had considered the potential risks posed to them by climate change at least to some extent, the practice of disclosing these risks to investors was “considerably fragmented, with information provided to the market in differing forms across a wide range of means of disclosure”. “In some cases, the review found climate risk disclosures to be far too general, and of limited use to investors,” Asic said in a statement. The review found few listed companies outside of the ASX 200 were disclosing climate risks to their investors. Discussion of climate change in annual reports had also gone backwards, particularly for companies outside the ASX 100. It found the percentage of annual reports of all listed companies that contained climate change-related content had fallen from 22% in 2011 to 14% in 2017. “Climate change is a foreseeable risk facing many listed companies in the Australian market in a range of different industries,” the Asic commissioner John Price said. “Directors and officers of listed companies need to understand and continually reassess existing and emerging risks (including climate risk) that may affect the company’s business – for better or for worse.” He said climate change disclosure practices were still evolving and Asic would “monitor market practice as it continues to evolve and develop in this area”. But financial analysts said the report highlights problems with Australia’s generic risk disclosure laws for companies and the understanding of how they apply to climate change. “It shows there’s a difference between what Asic says the laws say and what companies are doing,” said Will van de Pol, a campaigner at Market Forces. “It’s clear from this report and our financial research that many Australian companies are not meeting their legal requirements. “It means that investors are being left in the dark about the risk to the companies that they own from climate change.” He said it was up to investors to demand detailed risk disclosure from companies and for the regulator to take action against companies that failed to meet disclosure requirements. Dan Gocher, director of climate and environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the results in the review suggested mandatory reporting of climate risks might need to be considered. “In the absence of that, this is the result,” he said. “It points to a systemic issue. Without mandatory reporting from Asic it will require a cultural change.” He said investors should be taking action against companies that weren’t making progress. “We’re suggesting they used the tools that they’ve got and the only ones are voting against directors and voting against remuneration,” he said."
"“It all starts as a bit of a fairytale,” the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, told a room full of renewable energy types in Canberra this week. “Once upon a time there was an independent review into the national energy market.” Finkel did conduct that review at the behest of Malcolm Turnbull and the states when the objective was to fix the problems that have cascaded through the energy market since Tony Abbott opposed Labor’s carbon price to win an election.  The chief scientist proposed a clean energy target as the fix. Abbott and the deep feelings brigade inside the Coalition didn’t like it. It wouldn’t fly, so Turnbull and the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, retreated and regrouped. They then got officials to produce the national energy guarantee, hoping that would work, given the Neg mechanism dealt with both reliability and emissions reduction, and that might subdue some of the conservative opposition. But the deep feelings brigade didn’t like that either, and we all saw what happened next. Now let’s make our way back to Finkel, talking to mildly punch-drunk renewable energy types, in a small function room in the parliament this week. Once Finkel moves on from being chief scientist, someone should give him a diplomatic posting, because he has been stoic in the face of a rolling cluster cuss, fronting up with a placid expression and some polite words of encouragement at every stage of the derangement in an effort to endorse the government’s underlying objective, which is to fix a serious problem. Finkel was polite again this week, given the absurdity of being in a room with a new federal energy minister lacking any riding instructions to say anything apart from exchanging pleasantries; still no solution to an important problem; and the prime minister who asked him to help fix the mess now in exile in New York, out of office, and messing with the minds of the people who deposed him. The chief scientist was talking about hydrogen at an annual showcase organised by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. He’s put together a strategy for energy ministers on hydrogen in the event that our elected representatives are still capable of serving the national interest. Dare to dream, Alan. Go, you good thing. Finkel spoke about the excitement that was building in energy circles about the potential for hydrogen to be “the last piece of the jigsaw” in the inexorable energy transition. He spoke about Japan, a country that was “determined to decarbonise, unlike some other countries …” – a droll little aside that returned a sardonic laugh in the room – “and meet its 2030 commitments”. Japan, like Australia, was a fossil-fuel heavy economy, but lacked some of the natural advantages of a country like Australia, with its abundant sunshine, and thin population. Japan, Finkel said, “was crying out for a zero-emissions alternative” and Australia had an opportunity to “capture the export market” and develop domestic opportunities as well. A moment had arrived, in other words, in Australia’s national story. But to make this all happen, government would need to step up to the plate. Finkel told the room he’d given a presentation to energy ministers at the last Coag energy council meeting – the one that kept the Neg alive but put it on life support. They were enthusiastic, he said. “Ministers, asking for a strategy,” Finkel said, deadpan, again, to a ripple of sardonic laughter in the room. “Think about this, a great thing.” Finkel’s gentle homily gives you some insight into the resting disposition around Australia’s energy sector, which you might describe as gallows humour. The Coalition has plunged the country into an almighty mess, and there is no obvious way the mess can be fixed. It really is dire. Because of the civil war inside the Coalition that has delivered three party leaders in two terms, the Morrison government has parked the medium-term approach to solving the problems, which a sector such as energy, with generation assets with 30-year operating lives, requires. Morrison and the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, are currently fixated on conjuring up a short-term fix they can offer voters before the election – a noticeable reduction in power prices – never mind the obvious point that having a medium term roadmap would help deliver your short-term objective. Then there’s the climate imperative. The government can’t talk about emissions reduction except to offer a talking point that Australia will meet its Paris climate commitments “in a canter”. This is nonsense, because there are no policies to deliver the commitment. As the conservative MP Craig Kelly asked in a meeting of the backbench energy committee this week – what am I supposed to say when people ask me how we’ll meet the Paris target? Good question Craig. Very acute. The government is being hit with precisely that question, because it’s the obvious question to ask, and the answer appears to be “technology” (not clear what technology or why anyone would invest in it, given the cluster cuss); “the emissions reduction fund” (which is a creaking vestige of Abbott-era pretend climate action policies that the government chose not to top up in last year’s budget, and Josh Frydenberg, the new treasurer, is giving no commitment to funding in the future); and the vibe. Right at the moment, the Morrison government has nothing to say to voters on emissions reduction. Unless this changes, this will be the first time in my reporting lifetime where a party of government goes to an election minus a concrete emissions reduction policy. Even Abbott, who campaigned on revoking Labor’s policy, coughed up a fig leaf called Direct Action. Perhaps the new environment minister, Melissa Price, will have the wit to conjure up an emissions reduction policy that doesn’t actually reduce emissions, to give Morrison something to say when he has to face the voters, but I’m not hopeful, because the Neg was a policy that in practice would have reduced emissions in the electricity sector by 2% between 2012 and 2030, and the feelings brigade couldn’t even stomach that. So where does this leave us? Of course voters care about lower prices, and many would rank lowering their power bills well ahead of emissions reduction. But the omission on cutting pollution, if it persists, won’t be cost-free for the Coalition. The country is in the grip of a crippling drought. When the country was last in the grip of a crippling drought, and the Coalition was in a weak political position, on the brink of losing an election, John Howard (that would be the same prime minister who refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol) supported an emissions trading scheme because it became politically impossible to do anything else. The data tells us emissions are rising, and basic logic tells you they will go on rising as long as there’s no plan to curb them. Some long-term survey research released this week also suggests two things: Australians are more worried about climate change than they were 12 months ago, and regional voters – the ones the Morrison government is currently most worried about leaking to populist political disrupters or community-minded independents – are less inclined than they once were to consider climate science a hoax. Call me crazy, but I think the government might need a plan."
"The BBC has accepted it gets coverage of climate change “wrong too often” and told staff: “You do not need a ‘denier’ to balance the debate.” In a briefing note sent to all staff warning them to be aware of false balance, the corporation has offered a training course on how to report on global warming. The move follows a series of apologies and censures for failing to challenge climate sceptics during interviews, including Nigel Lawson.  The briefing note, obtained by the website Carbon Brief, was sent on Thursday by Fran Unsworth, the BBC’s director of news and current affairs. It includes a statement of BBC editorial policy that begins: “Climate change has been a difficult subject for the BBC, and we get coverage of it wrong too often.” It then states: “Manmade climate change exists: If the science proves it we should report it.” In the section warning on false balance it says: “To achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage, in the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken.” The Guardian revealed in October that the BBC had apologised for an interview with Lord Lawson on the Radio 4 Today programme after admitting it had breached its own editorial guidelines for allowing him to claim that global temperatures have not risen in the past decade. The regulator Ofcom subsequently ruled the BBC had breached broadcasting rules. The Today programme was also censured by the BBC complaints unit for an interview with Lawson in February 2014 and has been criticised for failing to implement fully the findings of the BBC Trust’s 2011 review into the “accuracy of the BBC’s coverage of science”. The four-page briefing note sent by Unsworth starts with a blunt statement on the science: “Climate change IS happening.” It also covers the implications of global warming: “There is a general consensus that it could be devastating in many different ways.” It ends with “common misconceptions” used to deny manmade warming, including that “not all scientists think manmade climate change is real” and “climate change has happened before”. The briefing note does not completely rule out including climate sceptics in BBC coverage: “There are occasions where contrarians and sceptics should be included. These may include, for instance, debating the speed and intensity of what will happen in the future, or what policies government should adopt.” But it adds: “Journalists need to be aware of the guest’s viewpoint and how to challenge it effectively. As with all topics, we must make clear to the audience which organisation the speaker represents, potentially how that group is funded and whether they are speaking with authority from a scientific perspective.” Lawson’s Global Warming Policy Foundation does not disclose its source of funding. Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank and a former BBC environment correspondent, said: “The creation of this course is welcome news. The BBC was wrong in my view to scrap the science seminars that it set up in 2011 – very few producers and presenters have a science background. “The course will be criticised by some – words like ‘stifling the debate’ – but those voices are decreasingly important in the country. I think the real takeaway from this is that the BBC has decided it no longer cares about evidence-free allegations of ‘bias’. It’s to be commended for putting its mojo on display.” Prof Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, said: “This set of BBC guidelines is long overdue. There have been too many occasions when the BBC’s audience has been misled over the realities of climate change.” Hawkins analysed the briefing note for Carbon Brief saying: “The ‘editorial policy’ could be more explicit about what would constitute false balance in its coverage. In the past, too many inaccurate statements made about climate science have not been effectively challenged by the interviewer.” In August, 57 prominent environmentalists, including Jonathon Porritt and Caroline Lucas, wrote to the Guardian declaring: “We will no longer debate those who deny that human-caused climate change is real. There are plenty of vital debates to be had around climate chaos and what to do about it; this is simply no longer one of them. We urge broadcasters to move on, as we are doing.” The BBC declined to offer further comment."
"California’s status as a progressive bastion on climate change action has been challenged by activists who attempted to barricade the way to a major summit in San Francisco and decried the oil and gas drilling they say is blighting the health of low-income and minority communities.  The Global Climate Action Summit is acting as a rallying point for cities, businesses and regions from around the world to outline plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The event has been hosted by Jerry Brown, the governor of California who has been lauded as a progressive climate leader and bulwark against the Trump administration. But community representatives claim Brown has largely abandoned certain neighborhoods to pollution from oil and gas drilling operations. California’s Central Valley has some of the worst air quality in the country. Across the US, sicknesses linked to air and water pollution are disproportionately felt by people of color, who are far more likely to live near power plants, landfills and other toxic sites. “Jerry Brown needs to stop oil drilling expansion and if he doesn’t do that, what kind of leader is he?” said Alicia Rivera, a community activist in Wilmington, a district of Los Angeles with six oil refineries, several chemical plants, scrap yards and hundreds of oil wells. “He has failed in a big way.” Several thousand protesters marched through San Francisco on Thursday before attempting to block the entrance to the summit, where mayors, prime ministers, executives from companies such as McDonald’s and celebrities including Alec Baldwin were gathering. Activists chanted “Tell Jerry Brown to keep it in the ground” and held signs reading “Don’t drill” and “We’re drowning”. There were scuffles as police attempted to remove several protesters who chained themselves to the gates of the conference building in downtown San Francisco. Inside the venue, protesters interrupted a speech by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, by chanting: “Our air is not for sale.” Brown’s critics claim California’s cap-and-trade emissions system, which allows major polluters to trade emissions allowances and offsets, is overly generous to fossil fuel interests. They have also attacked the governor for allowing more than 20,000 drilling operations during his tenure, as well as for an alleged conflict of interest in which his sister, Kathleen Brown, sits on the board of Sempra Energy. Sempra owns the Aliso Canyon gas facility near Los Angeles which suffered a major leak in 2015, releasing more than 100,000 metric tons of natural gas before it was finally plugged. “It is appalling that Governor Brown would celebrate himself as a climate leader while he sentences my community to suffer from severe breathing problems, rare cancers, nosebleeds and rashes,” said Jane Fowler, a resident of the Porter Ranch area, near the site of the leak. “There isn’t any reason why he shouldn’t shut Aliso Canyon down now.” The discontent highlights deep-seated inequities in housing and health exposed by climate change even in places considered progressive on the issue. This week, Brown signaled the end of unabated fossil fuel use in California, signing a bill to bring about 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045 and an executive order that would bring emissions to zero across all sectors, including transport and agriculture, by the same year. These commitments, some of the most ambitious in the world, come at a time when the Trump administration is dismantling pollution rules for coal-fired power plants, cars and trucks. “I’m tremendously supportive of leaders today who are moving as fast and far as they think they can,” said Gina McCarthy, who was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Barack Obama. “A leader like Jerry Brown has gone so far so we shouldn’t make it about him, we should make it about the issue.”"
"Australia does not need to quit the Paris climate agreement because our commitments are non-binding, and new coal plants can continue to be constructed, according to the resources minister, Matt Canavan. Canavan told Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones on Friday he had never been to Paris, and was “happy to leave the Champs-Élysées for others”, but people needed to be clear the treaty Tony Abbott committed Australia to in 2015 “doesn’t actually bind us to anything in particular”.  Abbott said in 2015, when he announced Australia would be signing up, that the government was making a “definite commitment” to a 26% reduction in emissions by 2030 and “with the circumstances that we think will apply ... we can go up to 28%”. But Canavan said on Friday the Paris commitment was a three-page document that allowed Australia flexibility to build new coal plants. The resources minister said rather than focusing on the situation in 2030, “what I want to focus on is solving the crisis we have in energy today”. “We have to build power stations. There’s nothing in the [Paris] agreement that would stop us building power stations, including coal-fired power stations,” Canavan said. “We need new ones”. Canavan said Queensland was “propping up” New South Wales with the newest coal fleet in the country. Jones prefaced his interview with Canavan with a long condemnation of the new foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the decision to sign on to a communique at the Pacific Islands Forum this week nominating climate change as the single greatest security threat to the Pacific. The communique said all countries must meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement. Jones declared the prime minister, Scott Morrison, needed to “recall Marise Payne and replace her”. He said the Morrison government would have no hope of winning the next federal election if it wanted to “persist with the global warming rubbish and the Paris agreement”. The 2GB host said Paris needed to be “ripped up”. “Do you want to win an election or don’t you?” Jones said to Canavan on Friday morning. Canavan dead-batted. “Of course I want to win the election, Alan. But, more importantly, what I want to do is have good policies for Australia and make our country strong”. The Queensland Nationals have been campaigning for months for government backing for new coal plants. In his first major speech in the energy portfolio, the new minister, Angus Taylor, signalled he wanted to encourage new investment extending the life of existing coal and gas plants, and upgrading ageing facilities. Taylor said the government was intent on boosting supply, and that meant expanding existing plants, upgrading ageing “legacy” generators, as well as pursuing new “greenfield” projects. Taylor is currently working up options for cabinet. A recent forecast by the Australian Energy Market Operator predicted 30% of Australia’s coal generators will approach the end of their technical life over the next two decades, and it said it was important to avoid premature departures if the looming transition in the national energy market is to be orderly. But it was also clear that the most economical replacement for the ageing coal fleet was not new coal, but “a portfolio of utility-scale renewable generation, storage, distributed energy resources, flexible thermal capacity, and transmission”. Aemo concluded that mix of generation could produce 90 terawatt hours of energy per annum, “more than offsetting the energy lost from retiring coal-fired generation”."
"At last, protest marches against global warming, the most relevant issue of our time (Report, 8 September). I am over 90 years old and cannot join one but wish I could. All other questions fade into second place: Brexit, the gap between rich and poor, even the wars of the Middle East. We are not even reaching the 2% per annum target and even 0.2% would be too high. We are faced with escalating catastophies: rising sea levels, floods, forest fires. I have had a long and happy life but what am I leaving my great-grandchildren? I feel impotent. No one seems to question the effects of jet aircraft, of rockets to outer space or the ever-escalating increase in traffic. As I carefully recycle my rubbish and take pride in my excellent compost heap, I realise how paltry my efforts are.Anthea HardyHigh Wycombe, Buckinghamshire • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"Tens of thousands of people took part in marches and other events across the US on Saturday, calling for a swift transition to renewable energy in order to stave off the various perils of climate change.  The Rise for Climate protests was spearheaded by what organizers called the largest ever climate march on the US west coast. The march, which snaked through the heart of San Francisco, came ahead of a climate change summit in the city next week that will gather mayors and business leaders from around the world. The San Francisco march, which called for California governor Jerry Brown to end fossil fuel extraction in the state, attracted around 30,000 people, organizers said. An array of activities, including rallies, voter registration drives and vigils, were scheduled to take place across the US, in cities such as Boston, Miami and Portland, Oregon. Events were also planned in Puerto Rico. In New Orleans, protesters planned to agitate for the halt of the Bayou Bridge pipeline, an extension of the controversial Dakota Access project that last year spurred a lengthy standoff at the Standing Rock reservation. Hundreds of other actions took place in cities around the world, as part of a coordinated effort to counter what climate activists see as the dangerously regressive policies of Donald Trump’s administration, which has sought to dismantle rules to lower greenhouse gas emissions and has thrown open vast areas of land and water to drilling. “Today, people across the country are rising up for climate, jobs and justice in their communities to fight back against Trump’s toxic agenda and to send a message to every politician that the time for action is now,” said Michael Brune, executive director of environment group the Sierra Club. “Families living in the shadows of coal plants and oil refineries, losing homes and livelihoods to wildfires and extreme weather, and struggling to make a living wage are coming together because we know we don’t have time to waste.” The activists’ ire is largely aimed at governors who though relatively progressive on climate issues, such as Brown and New York governor Andrew Cuomo, are deemed not to be ambitious enough in phasing out fossil fuels. On Thursday, several thousand people took part in a climate march in New York City. Ten activists were arrested after blocking the street in front of Cuomo’s Manhattan office. A week of protests are planned surrounding the summit in San Francisco, with organizers hoping to draw attention to air pollution and social inequity that has tainted California’s economic growth. “Climate change, economic inequality, the housing crisis, increased criminalization, attacks on immigrant communities – all these challenges are driven by systemic devaluation of the lives of people of color and choosing profit over people and the planet,” said Gladys Limon, executive director of the California Environmental Justice Alliance. “We are standing up to life destructive industries, from big oil to natural gas companies, that obstruct progress toward a healthy, sustainable and just society.”"
"California has given fossil fuel-derived energy a hefty shove towards obsolescence after legislators voted to require that 100% of the state’s electricity come from carbon-free sources. The bill, which will need to be approved by the state senate and Governor Jerry Brown, will require a complete shift to clean energy such as solar and wind by 2045. It would also demand that electric utilities source 60% of their power from renewable sources by 2030, up from the current target of 50%. California ridding itself entirely of carbon-intensive energy has been a politically vexed proposition for the past two years, with state Republicans arguing it was unfeasible and would drive up electricity prices. But the state has emerged as a bastion of defiance to the Trump administration on climate change, among other issues, as it has been scorched by record wildfires and a prolonged drought. A report released this week warned that the state is on course for punishing heatwaves, thousands of additional deaths and the erosion of two thirds of its coastline due to rising temperatures, wildfires and sea level rise.  Brown has already set out ambitious goals to expand renewables and the use of electric cars. The state legislature has already passed a law that requires newly built homes to be equipped for solar power. In July, the state announced its greenhouse gas emissions were lower than in 1990, despite a growing economy. The bill to go 100% renewable energy was authored by state senator Kevin de Leon, who called it a “victory for clean air. It’s a victory to tackle climate change and the devastation that it’s leaving in its wake.” Brown has yet to confirm he will sign the bill his predecessor as governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, wrote to lawmakers to back the legislation and urge them to be “undeterred by those who wish to stop our progress and move backwards”. California becomes the second US state, after Hawaii, to call for carbon-free electricity by 2045. The clout of the Californian economy could help spur some other states, such as Massachusetts and New Jersey, to do the same. Environmentalists hailed the vote as a landmark moment. “This is a pivotal moment for California, for the country, and the world,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club.  “California is showing the world that moving to 100% clean energy is within our reach and what bold climate leadership looks like in the face of a Trump administration.” California currently sources around a third of its electricity from clean sources. Opponents of the 100% renewable bill warned that electricity prices would go up if the state relied too heavily upon intermittent solar and wind before energy storage improves."
"Climate change is making people hungry – with nearly 100 million people across the world needing humanitarian food aid because of climate shocks last year – and a growing number of people are malnourished across the Pacific, a new United Nations report says. Last week, the Pacific Islands Forum stated formally that climate change represented the “single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific” – a declaration Australia ultimately signed but had spent much of the forum attempting to undermine.  Worldwide, the number of undernourished people has been rising since 2014, reaching 821 million last year – or one in nine people across the globe – the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report found. The number of hungry people globally has returned to levels of nearly a decade ago, and nearly one in four (22.2%) children aged under five are stunted through malnutrition. Low- and middle-income countries were especially acutely affected by more frequent climate extremes and natural disasters. Africa remains the region where malnourishment is most common at 20.4% of the population. But “Oceania” – broadly synonymous with the Pacific region but excluding Australia and New Zealand – is the only region in the world where the rate of undernourishment has increased over the past 12 years, to 7%. Nutrition in Pacific countries is very sensitive to climate extremes. Worldwide, five of the 15 countries considered the most vulnerable to natural hazards are Pacific small island developing states. Vanuatu is ranked as the world’s most vulnerable. Recurring climate shocks such as drought, delayed monsoons, tropical cyclones and floods – and with insufficient recovery time between disasters – have undermined food security across the Pacific, increased dependence on food aid, and weakened the nutrition of those who live there. “In some Pacific small island developing states (Sids), the recurrence of climate shocks that impact on national/local food production, coupled with insufficient recovery time, undermines food security and nutrition in the longer term,” the FAO report said. “This is seen in reduced agricultural and fisheries productivity, increased reliance on short-term humanitarian food assistance, gradual erosion of traditional food systems and intensified permanent shifts away from diversified, healthy traditional diets to greater exposure to imported processed foods often high in salt, sugar and fat.” In 2015 Vanuatu was devastated by the category 5 Cyclone Pam, which destroyed reefs, fishing boats and food crops. This was followed by a severe El-Niño-induced drought that further exacerbated food insecurity and led to widespread water scarcity. A teacher on Emae Island, in Vanuatu’s Shepherd Islands, said the cyclone harmed food availability, water security and education for months afterwards. “After Cyclone Pam, the water that belongs to you and me was not very good,” the teacher said. “I had to stop class sometimes – half days – and then we’d eat all together. Sometimes we tell the children not to come to school tomorrow because we don’t have enough food.” In Timor-Leste households affected by drought limit the amount of food they eat, by limiting their portions, reducing the number of meals they eat each day, or selling household assets for food. And in Papua New Guinea, 45% of children are stunted by malnutrition, and more than 15% are wasted, one of the highest rates in the world. Oxfam Australia’s food, climate and humanitarian spokesman, Dr Simon Bradshaw, said the UN report found climate extremes “left 94.9 million people having to rely on humanitarian aid to feed themselves”. “A hot world is a hungry world,” he said. “The cost of failing to act on climate change is being measured in devastating food crises, and more and more people going undernourished.” Bradshaw said Australia’s failure to curb its climate pollution was contributing to increasing global hunger “and inflicting pain and hardship on the world’s most vulnerable communities”. “Resolving conflict and war, tackling the drivers of inequality and poverty, and fighting the causes of climate change are crucial in the global effort to reduce hunger – and Australia has a role to play in each of these areas.”"
"Hurricane Florence is set to bring 50% more rainfall to the US east coast due to human-induced climate change, according to a landmark forecast that has outlined the influence of warming temperatures upon the looming storm. An attribution study by scientists ahead of Florence’s landfall, expected in North Carolina on Thursday, found that the storm will be about 50 miles (80km) larger in diameter than it would be if human activity had not warmed the planet. The hurricane is expected to bring about 50% more precipitation, delivering as much as 20in (51cm) of rainfall in coastal areas, due to climate change. The forecast was completed by researchers at Stony Brook University and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “Dangerous climate change is here, it’s not a problem for future generations,” said Michael Wehner, staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. “These risks have been permanently increased and we have to accept that fact.” Previous attribution studies have looked at the impact of climate change on hurricanes after the storms occur, such as Hurricane Harvey, which researchers said had three times more rainfall than it would have done without global warming when it crunched into Texas last year. But this is the first such attribution made before a storm actually reaches the shoreline. “We are now confident enough to make forecasts rather than hindcasts,” said Wehner. Scientists were previously reluctant to link individual storms, wildfires or heatwaves to the background trend of climate change. However, the field of attribution science has advanced rapidly, to the point where researchers now feel able to ascertain a level of influence before a disaster even unfolds. “The idea we can’t attribute individual events to climate change is out of date, it’s just no longer true,” said Wehner. “We’ve reached the point where we can say this confidently.” Climate change fuels hurricanes by increasing the amount of moisture in the atmosphere and heightening the warmth of the oceans. Several storms that form in the Atlantic have intensified to unusual strength in recent years, as part of a trend that scientists say is consistent with a warming world. Hurricane Florence peaked as a category four hurricane, threatening winds of 130mph, although it has since weakened slightly. It is still expected to bring a storm surge of up to 13ft (4 metres), plus waves, at the North Carolina coast on Thursday before slowing down and dumping a huge amount of rain, triggering damaging flooding further inland. More than a million people have been told to flee coastal areas, with states of emergency declared in North and South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Maryland and Washington DC. The National Hurricane Center has called Florence a “storm of a lifetime”. The tempest is expected to have a wide impact, reaching deep into North Carolina. Elvia Walkingstick, a teacher, said even her community in Cherokee, near the Tennessee border, was making preparations for the storm. “There’s a very real possibility it could be that bad, so we will wait to see what happens,” she said. “We are bracing for climate change because we are on the front lines, we are living it. “It’s ignorant and suicidal not to think of climate change as a reality . We’d be dumb to think it isn’t true. Ignorance isn’t an excuse any more.”"
"Global warming means truly global warming. The atmosphere, the oceans, and the ground are all warming. As a result, ice is melting, seas are rising, storms are getting more severe, and droughts are getting worse. But these things are not happening in isolation. The tricky thing about the climate is that things are connected all across the globe. And those connections are revealing changes that may not be obvious at first glance. One such change was exposed in a recent paper published in the journal Environmental Research Letters by a team of top scientists from China and Brazil, an instructive video is available here. The scientists focused their study on the Amazon rainforest. There, the year is broken into “wet” and “dry” seasons. The researchers wanted to know how rainfall has changed during the wet seasons over the past few decades.  What they found was astonishing – the rain in this tropical rainforest has increased 180–600 mm (7–24 inches). They learned about the increase in wet-season rainfall by reviewing old weather data – information from rain gauges for example. They also used satellite measurements to complement the rain gauge readings. The trend they found was clear – the rains are increasing. So, any good scientist wants to know why. Why are the rains increasing? What is the main cause? By using the results of state-of-the-art climate calculations, the authors showed that the temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean are primarily responsible. The Pacific Ocean water temperature plays a smaller role. This study is really important for a few reasons. First, the Amazon is important for the entire globe’s climate. The rainforest provides about 20% of the Earth’s freshwater. There is a tremendous amount of evaporation from the rainforest into the air. This evaporated water is carried to other parts of the planet where it falls as rain. We call the evaporation/precipitation process a “hydrologic cycle.” This cycle refers to the movement of water throughout the planet; the Amazon is an important engine for the cycle. But the importance of the Amazon is broader than just water. The growth and decay of wood and plant growth there means the Amazon absorbs and emits large amounts of carbon dioxide. Think of the rainforest like the lungs of the planet. They help the planet breathe. The Amazon rainforest also helps transfer heat throughout the Earth’s climate. Energy moves from one location to another with help of processes (such as evaporation and condensation) that originate in the Amazon. In these ways, the Amazon connects far-flung parts of the planet together. What happens in one region like the Pacific Ocean affects the climate elsewhere like the Atlantic Ocean. The way the climate interacts between to distant locations is called “teleconnections.” And the Amazon is a great teleconnector for the planet. Previous researchers who have looked at the Amazon and its changing precipitation have found that the southern part of the rainforest has experienced a long-term increase in rainfall. Researchers have also found changes to the monsoon cycles that affect the rainforest. But with most of these studies looking at the southern Amazon, very little was known about the northern region. What was happening there? Also, most of the early studies looked at changes to rain during the dry season. The authors of this new study wanted to focus on the wet seasons. The authors used six different methods to look at the data. Three methods were based on actual rainfall measurements. Three additional methods were based on a technique called climate reanalysis – essentially combining measurements and climate calculations. The image below, which is from the paper, shows results for the six methods. The blue regions indicate places where the rainfall is increasing. Areas in orange/red correspond to decreasing rainfall. The results correspond to December through May and the trends are based on 1979–2015. The general results are the same, regardless of which of the six methods are used. In particular, in the black box (upper left image), the six methods give very similar results. It doesn’t matter whose inputs are used; the rainfall there is increasing. Only one of the methods (MERRA2) results in some portions of the region with a reversed trend. Next, the authors used their computer calculations to determine what was causing these blue and red patterns. They found that the culprit is the Atlantic Ocean. There has been a very strong warming in the Atlantic, especially off the coast of South America. The warming oceans supercharge the evaporation of ocean water into the atmosphere and change both the amount of water and the amount of energy in the atmosphere. This warming in the Atlantic is responsible for about half of the wet-season precipitation changes in the Amazonian rainforest. What I liked about this study is that the authors have identified another trend in how we feel climate change. We humans are generally interested in things that affect us. An abstract warming world may not lead us to think about consequences to climate change (other than temperature). But in reality, the whole world is connected. What happens to the temperature in one location can affect other aspects of the climate on the other side of the globe. These teleconnections and their changes resulting from human-caused warming are fascinating."
"Political and business leaders gathering in San Francisco for a major climate change summit have committed to moving towards what was once a fantastical thought – the demise of the internal combustion engine in cars, trucks and other vehicles. A group of 26 city, business and regional or state leaders, representing 122 million people around the world, have used the Global Climate Action Summit to call for carmakers to quicken the pace of electric vehicle rollout. Twelve cities, including Santa Monica, Tokyo and Greater Manchester, have pledged to deploy only zero emission buses from 2025.  This follows a move by 19 US cities and counties to increase the number of electric vehicles in their own fleets and promises by businesses such as Ikea, which plans to make its home deliveries emissions-free, to shift away from gasoline-powered cars and trucks. “This demand added together really gives auto companies the message that they need to signal the endgame for the internal combustion engine,” said Helen Clarkson, chief executive of the Climate Group, which is behind the zero-emission vehicle challenge. “When you see cities making these sort of commitments, it creates a new normal in the market. Transport is a bit behind on the curve of the energy transformation but we are really seeing things move now.” The electrification of transport is particularly challenging in the US, where transport is now the largest contributor of greenhouse gases, eclipsing energy, and drivers have opted for larger cars amid low fuel prices. The Trump administration is also in the process of weakening fuel efficiency standards that would push carmakers to expanding their electric vehicle fleets. But mayors at the climate summit - convened by California’s governor, Jerry Brown, who has himself set a target of 5m electric vehicles on the state’s roads – have said they can look to bypass the federal government and help the US catch up to the likes of India, China and the Netherlands, which have all committed to phasing out carbon-polluting cars at some stage. “The clean transportation revolution is now staring us in the face,” said Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles. Garcetti was one of 35 mayors of California cities to write to state regulators last month to demand 100% zero-emission buses by 2040. “Cities are where it is at. It’s more important who is in this house [in reference to San Francisco city hall, where he was speaking] than the White House. We need more zero-emissions cars, trash trucks, buses, whatever.” Nearly 200,000 electric vehicles were sold in the US last year, although relative sales lag behind many other countries, with analysts blaming lack of marketing by large auto firms, cultural attachment to large cars and anxiety over driving range. It is expected that several US cities and states will use the climate summit to pledge an expansion of electric recharge points. Erik Solheim, the UN’s environment chief, said that half of vehicles bought in his native Norway are now electric or hybrid due to a change to tax incentives and allowing electric vehicles to drive in dedicated bus lanes. “With political leadership, it can change a lot faster than people think,” he said. “In Norway you see Nissan Leafs everywhere now. Every city and state should look to see what they can do on this.” Elected officials in the US are not going as far as naming an end date for carbon-emitting vehicles, but advocates for electric vehicles hope even the more modest commitments will provide the momentum to radically change the face of car fleets, thereby helping avoid dangerous climate change and lessen the health impacts of air pollution near roads. “Transportation for a long time has been the lost stepchild because everyone has focused on electricity,” said Sue Reid, vice-president of climate and energy at Ceres. “But we are now seeing electric vehicles becoming cost competitive right at the point of sale due to improvements in battery technology. “There is a gap in awareness and education in the US but once that is bridged, things will change. This is the beginning of the end for the internal combustion engine. Soon, it won’t make sense for automakers to be producing cars on different platforms.”"
"Tree-planting, restoring wetlands and using chemicals to take carbon dioxide from the air will all be needed to reduce the UK’s greenhouse gases in line with government plans, scientists have said. If these measures are taken urgently, they could make enough of a contribution to make the UK “net zero” in terms of carbon emissions by 2050. However, a major programme to bring them into effect would be needed as a matter of urgency.  “We will need to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere as well as work on ways to stop emitting so much in the first place,” said Nilay Shah, head of chemical engineering at Imperial College London, and a member of the working group on the report. “The very first thing we need to do is go to a very low number on emissions by 2050. If we work very hard on decarbonising energy and emissions from building and transport and industry, we can bring down emissions to 130m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) by 2050 compared with 450 MtCO2e today.” That remaining 130m tonnes “is very difficult to get rid of”, said Shah, partly as it comes from activities such as agriculture and aviation, which are hard to decarbonise. This left a gap which could only be filled by removing greenhouse gases from the air. In a joint report on greenhouse gas removal, the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering found that increasing the amount of forested land in the UK to 5% of land area could play a major role as trees act as a carbon sink. At the same time, farmers could be encouraged through incentives or subsidies to use their land to store carbon through better farming methods. Restoring natural features such as wetlands and marshes would also store more carbon. Construction companies should also be given incentives to use wood, which is a natural store of carbon, and cement can be manufactured with waste carbon dioxide to offset the emissions from its production. However, while these measures together would account for about a quarter of the carbon reductions needed, technology to remove carbon from the air would also be required, the scientists said. Some of this could be done by capturing carbon emissions at source, such as at power plants. Using bioenergy, such as wood, plants and waste, while capturing the resulting carbon dioxide is technically possible and should be pursued, the scientists urged. But they said other methods, such as direct air capture, would also be needed. Direct air capture usually involves chemical processes called “scrubbing”, which means using compounds that react with carbon dioxide in the air to form new chemicals that can be safely disposed of, locking in the carbon. While scrubbing is commonly used to clean up other emissions, such as coal-plant emissions containing sulphur, using it to remove carbon from the air is difficult and can be costly. The report found that economically encouraging the use of direct air capture would require a price to be put on carbon dioxide, probably of as much as $100 a tonne. Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, called the report “crucially important” for the UK’s low-carbon future. “It shows the UK can take its carbon emissions down to net zero by around mid-century and can do so affordably,” he said. “If anything, it has over-estimated the amount of negative emissions the UK will need, and yet still concludes that we can deliver.” He pointed ahead to a major report coming from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change next month, which is expected to find that the world must achieve net zero emissions by 2050 to meet the Paris agreement targets. After that report, the UK’s statutory government advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, will issue formal advice on how the UK can meet such a target. Black said: “This report, showing it is possible [to achieve net zero emissions], could not have come at a more opportune time.” Direct air capture of carbon dioxide is different from the forms of carbon capture and storage (CCS) attached to power plants, which have been targeted in the past. For most of the past decade, the UK was pursuing carbon capture and storage technologies focused on taking carbon emissions from fossil fuel power plants and storing them under the North Sea, with several companies working on the technology. However, the previous government pulled the plug on those plans and the UK no longer has any pilot projects for CCS from power plants, though other countries have moved ahead with pioneering projects. Shah said CCS for power plants would also be needed, in addition to direct air capture, if the UK is to continue to use fossil fuels. Such plants could all share the same transport and storage infrastructure, bringing down costs."
"The real question that should mark the 10th anniversary of the financial crash is a moral one: what was finance for, what was investment for, what was corporate activity for, in 2008, and what is it for now? So far, analyses have focused on two dimensions of the crisis. First, whether enough was subsequently done, in terms of new regulation and technical fixes such as ringfencing the banks, to prevent a repeat meltdown. And second, a focus on the consequences – the global political upheaval that came in its wake, or more precisely, the decade of immiseration that the briefly thrilling, phosphorous destruction unleashed. Both approaches risk being a distraction. The next crisis most likely won’t come from improperly supervised instruments of speculative finance. The Economist, for example, suggests the risks lie in the level of household borrowing and the euro. And while it is impossible to avoid asking whether the super-rich simply walked away from the wreckage, laughing as they left societies trying to hold themselves together through painful austerity, the answer generates resentment and a lust for revenge. To know that a disproportionate concentration of wealth is destabilising as well as unjust does not give us a meaningful or creative blueprint for the future we want to build. That post-crash principle should be this: in a century in which the sustainability of the planet is at stake, markets cannot survive without morality. Ten years ago, “ethical” investing meant not buying shares in arms and alcohol, as if morality were so unfamiliar to financial decision-making that you had to go back to the 19th century and borrow it from the Quakers. The growth of banks with a moral mission – like Triodos (“quality of life, human dignity, sustainability”) – or investments with a social purpose – like Abundance, which finances renewable energy – has been impressive on its own terms, but remained niche, for baby boomers with a conscience. The idea that all market activity should have a purpose other than profit is roughly where it always was on the spectrum, somewhere between Marx and Jesus – one for the rioters, the subversives, the people with beards, unsuited to mainstream discourse. But there is nothing more pragmatic and less idealistic than to insist on the social purpose of the market; banking cannot survive without it – not as a corporate bolt-on but as its driving and decisive motivation. The derivatives trade cannot weather the consequences of infinite self-interest, because there really will be consequences – extreme global ones. The planet cannot survive an endless cost-benefit analysis in which nature is pitted against profit. Nature will always lose and so will humanity as a result. Whatever the immediate cause of the next crash, if and when it comes its roots will be environmental. The Financial Times talks about “the insidious danger that pension funds deflate, leaving a generation without enough money to retire”. The most likely cause for that devaluation of pensions – leaving aside the generation that cannot afford to save for the future – will be stranded assets, pension funds having invested in fossil fuels that cannot be excavated. Even under the terms of the Paris climate accord, which most agree is under-ambitious, 80% of known coal reserves, one-third of oil and half of gas will have to be left in the ground if we are to meet our targets on climate change. The writedowns will be staggering. For a period after the crash, institutions that thought themselves ethical – universities, churches, pension funds with “ethical” in the name – practised divestment, ridding their portfolios of fossil fuels and its attendant industries. The stance never became the norm; funds that would call themselves reputable still have the farm bet on investments whose realisation would mean the end of the habitable world. The Lehman Brothers debacle may have had a million misjudgments feeding into it, corruption and carelessness commingling, but the toxicity of the subprime mortgage was laid bare by Hurricane Katrina. In New Orleans, about one-third of mortgages affected by Katrina were sub-prime. Whether it’s a refugee crisis or a tsunami, a heatwave or a flood, the effects of climate change refuse to stick to their own category: they throw up political schisms, social discord, radical departures from the old order of stability from which the financial system cannot remain aloof. There is no MBA module with a solution, and no regulatory lever to mitigate this: all financial endeavour has to be reimagined with the future of humanity as its explicit purpose. Profit was the answer to another century’s problems; if we don’t learn this from 2008, the lessons of 2028 will be far harsher. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"
"There is no such thing as a category 6 hurricane or tropical storm – yet. The highest level – the top of the scale for the most powerful, most devastating hurricane or tropical storm capable of destroying entire cities like New Orleans or New York – is a category 5 storm. Meteorologists and scientists never imagined that there would be a need for a category 6 storm, with winds that exceed 200 miles per hour on a sustained basis, sweeping away everything in its path. Until now, such a storm wasn’t possible, so there was no need for a new category above category 5. Right now, however, there is anywhere from 5 to 8% more water vapor circulating throughout the atmosphere than there was a generation ago. This, combined with warmer temperatures that are driving water up from the deep ocean in places where hurricanes typically form, has created the potential for superstorms that we haven’t seen before – and aren’t really prepared for. This combination of warmer oceans and more water in the earth’s atmosphere – whipsawed by sustained periods of drier and wetter conditions in regions of the world that create superstorms – is now starting to create storms with conditions that look precisely what a category 6 hurricane would look like. No one in America has ever experienced the wrath and fury of a category 6 hurricane, which now genuinely seems possible and realistic. We’ve been lucky. Unofficial category 6 hurricanes have appeared in other parts of the world, and we’re seeing much stronger storms on a regular basis. It’s only a matter of time before one hits the US. When it does, it will come as quite a shock. The devastation we saw in 2017 in Houston, several Caribbean islands, and Puerto Rico may actually pale in comparison. Jeff Masters, one of the most respected meteorologists in America, has begun to wonder publicly about the potential for a category 6 hurricane. He launched a lively debate among his colleagues with a provocative post in July of 2016 on the Weather Underground – a thought-provoking piece that prompted the Weather Channel and others to weigh in with their thoughts and theories as well. “A ‘black swan’ hurricane – a storm so extreme and wholly unprecedented that no one could have expected it – hit the Lesser Antilles Islands in October 1780,” Masters wrote to open the post. “Deservedly called The Great Hurricane of 1780, no Atlantic hurricane in history has matched its death toll of 22,000. So intense were the winds of the Great Hurricane that it peeled the bark off of trees – something only EF5 tornadoes with winds in excess of 200mph have been known to do.” Masters then made the startling claim that such a “black swan” hurricane was not only possible now but almost certain to occur more than once. He said that such storms should more properly be called “grey swan” hurricanes because the emerging science clearly showed that such “bark-stripping” mega-storms are nearly certain to start appearing. “Hurricanes even more extreme than the Great Hurricane of 1780 can occur in a warming climate, and can be anticipated by combining physical knowledge with historical data,” wrote Masters, who once flew into the strongest hurricane at the time as one of Noaa’s “Hurricane Hunters” in the 1980s. “Such storms, which have never occurred in the historical record, can be referred to as ‘grey swan’ hurricanes.” Masters based his bold prediction on research by two of the best hurricane scientists in the world – Kerry Emanuel of MIT and Ning Lin of Princeton – who published the most detailed hurricane model in history in August 2015. Emanuel and Lin’s hurricane model was embedded within six different worldwide climate models routinely run by supercomputers. “The term ‘black swan’ is a metaphor for a high-consequence event that comes as a surprise. Some high-consequence events that are unobserved and unanticipated may nevertheless be predictable,” they wrote in Nature Climate Change. “Such events may be referred to as ‘grey swans’ (or, sometimes, ‘perfect storms’). Unlike truly unpredicted and unavoidable black swans, which can be dealt with only by fast reaction and recovery, grey swans – although also novel and outside experience – can be better foreseen and systematically prepared for.” Lin and Emanuel said their research showed that not only were grey swan hurricanes now likely to occur, one such devastating hurricane would almost certainly hit the Persian Gulf region – a place where tropical cyclones have never even been seen in history. They identified a “potentially large risk in the Persian Gulf, where tropical cyclones have never been recorded, and larger-than-expected threats in Cairns, Australia, and Tampa, Florida”. Emanuel and Lin showed that the risk of such extreme grey swan hurricanes in Tampa, Cairns, and the Persian Gulf increased by up to a factor of 14 over time as Earth’s climate changed. In the event of such a storm, city officials may have no idea what they truly face. At least one city planning document (from 2010) anticipated that a category 5 hurricane could cause 2,000 deaths and $250bn in damage. But it could be far worse. “A storm surge of 5 meters is about 17 feet, which would put most of Tampa underwater, even before the sea level rises there,” Emanuel told reporters. “Tampa needs to have a good evacuation plan, and I don’t know if they’re really that aware of the risks they actually face.” A city like Dubai is even more unprepared, Emanuel said. Dubai, and the rest of the Persian Gulf, has never seen a hurricane in recorded history. Any hurricane, of any magnitude, would be an unprecedented event. But his models say that one is likely to occur there at some point. “Dubai is a city that’s undergone a really rapid expansion in recent years, and people who have been building it up have been completely unaware that that city might someday have a severe hurricane,” Emanuel said. “Now they may want to think about elevating buildings or houses, or building a seawall to somehow protect them, just in case.” Following Masters’s provocative post, many of his meteorologist colleagues weighed in. The Weather Channel predicted that a category 6 hurricane, and a change in the scale to accommodate it, may be on its way. “Jeff Masters got the entire weather community thinking: could there be a Category Six hurricane?” Brian Donegan wrote on the network’s site. “Last year, Hurricane Patricia reached maximum sustained winds of 215mph in the eastern Pacific Ocean. It was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.” A fellow meteorologist, Paul Huttner, said Patricia makes it all but certain that we’ll see category 6 hurricanes. “Many meteorological observers [were] stunned at how rapidly Patricia blew up from tropical storm to one of the strongest category 5 hurricanes on earth in just 24 hours,” Huttner wrote for Minnesota Public Radio. Whether we call them category 6 hurricanes – or simply category 5 hurricanes with really fast, violent winds that are up to 60mph above the upper end of the current scale that can appear literally overnight over warm oceans – we need to be ready for these superstorms capable of taking out cities like Dubai or Tampa. They are here, right now. The devastation we saw in Houston, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean in the fall of 2017 is a clear warning. We ignore the implications at our peril.

"Global hunger has reverted to levels last seen a decade ago, wiping out progress on improving people’s access to food and leaving one in nine people undernourished last year, with extreme weather a leading cause, the UN has warned. Hunger afflicted 821 million people last year, the third annual rise since 2015, with most regions of Africa and much of South America showing worsening signs of food shortages and malnutrition. More than half a billion of the world’s hungry live in Asia.  The reversal of progress made in slowing malnutrition in the first half of this decade has caused serious concern among international agencies. Climate shocks, such as droughts and floods, were identified by the UN as “among the key drivers” for the rise in 2017, along with conflict and economic slowdowns. Nearly 100 million people were left dependent on humanitarian aid during the year. The UN report covers last year, and does not take account of 2018’s extreme weather which has brought heatwaves and high temperatures to much of the northern hemisphere, accompanied by droughts in some parts of the globe and floods in others. However, the changing climatic trends are likely to spell trouble for years ahead. Robin Willoughby, head of food and climate policy at Oxfam GB, said the last few months were likely to have made the situation even worse, and called on governments to commit funds to help poor countries adapt to the effects of global warming. “The extreme weather we have seen this year is likely to have exacerbated the crisis,” he said. “A hotter world is proving to be a hungrier world.” According to the report, there are more undernourished people in areas of the world that are highly exposed to extremes of climate. The authors note that there have been more frequent spells of extreme heat in the last five years, and that the nature of rainfall is changing in some areas, with rainy seasons starting earlier or later. Staple crops such as wheat, rice and maize are particularly at risk from climate extremes. “It is shocking that, after a prolonged decline, this is the third consecutive year of rising hunger,” said Willoughby. “The inescapable fact is that climate change is now leaving people around the world without enough to eat.” Adapting to climate change can be a matter of switching to less thirsty crops in some areas, and selectively breeding varieties for drought-resistance, or diversifying crops and using natural methods to make the best use of rainfall. Giving farmers access to transport to take their produce to market, and modern technology, such as weather forecasting communications, can also help. The UN’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018 report, released on Tuesday, is the joint work of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Unicef, the World Food Programme and the World Health Organisation. The heads of the agencies combined to warn of a worsening future, if action is not taken to help people adapt to climate change. “If we are to achieve a world without hunger and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030 [as the sustainable development goals state] it is imperative that we accelerate and scale up actions to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of food systems and people’s livelihoods in response to climate variability and extremes,” they wrote in the foreword to the report. Cindy Holleman, a senior economist at the FAO and editor of the report, said: “What is alarming about this analysis is that climate variability and climate extremes now are contributing to the rise in hunger. Not just emergency levels of hunger, but chronic hunger. “We see this report as an early warning call that we need to accelerate and scale up climate resilience especially in countries in Africa and Latin America that are most vulnerable.”  She added: “This is the beginning of a very serious situation. We have a target to end hunger by 2030, and we are not going to do that unless we are going to tackle new challenges and the new challenges are climate extremes and variability.”  The analysis also showed that one in eight of the world’s adults – 672 million people – are now obese. This is increasingly regarded as a form of malnutrition associated with poverty, as poor people often lack access to good quality food. Other effects of malnutrition noted include 151 million children under five too short for their age owing to malnutrition, a fall from the 165 million recorded in 2012, with Asia accounting for 55% of the total. One in three women of reproductive age around the world have anaemia, which can also affect the development of their children, and only 40% of babies are breastfed exclusively to six months."
"Climate change is the single greatest security threat to the Pacific, and all countries must meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement, the 18 countries of the Pacific Islands Forum said on Wednesday. The first assertion of the strongly worded Boe Declaration says all Pacific nations, including Australia, “reaffirm that climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific, and our commitment to progress the implementation of the Paris agreement. “Leaders reaffirmed the importance of immediate urgent action to combat climate change and … called on countries, particularly large emitters, to fully implement their … mitigation targets, including through the development and transfer of renewable energy, in line with committed timeframes.” Leaders of the Forum Islands countries also called for the US to return to the Paris agreement and the commitments it made under President Barack Obama. The Boe Declaration said the security challenges being faced by Pacific nations were broader and more complex than in previous generations. The forum committed its members to addressing humanitarian assistance, environmental and resource security, transnational crime and cybersecurity. Australia will work with regional security agencies to establish a Pacific Fusion Centre to better share intelligence and target threats including illegal fishing, drug trafficking and other cross-border crimes. But the forthright declaration on climate is awkward politically for Australia, with its new prime minister, Scott Morrison, apparently at odds with his own government’s Energy Security Board over whether Australia will meet its Paris targets of a 26% reduction in emissions from 2005 levels. The government does not have any emissions reductions policies in place to achieve the target. Morrison told a radio program on Wednesday that “the business-as-usual model gets us there [meeting the Paris targets] in a canter”. But the Energy Security Board said business as usual – and a failure to implement the now-discarded national energy guarantee – would mean the electricity sector would “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”. The Australian government’s apparent ambivalence towards a low-emissions climate policy has disquieted its Pacific neighbours. As a region, the Pacific has produced the least carbon of any areaon Earth but its citizens have felt the impacts of climate change first, and most acutely, through rising seas, increased salinity, and more frequent and severe natural disasters. Low-lying island Pacific countries including Kiribati are forecast to be among the first on the plant to disappear underwater if rising sea levels are not arrested. Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, a small nation in the north-west Pacific, told the Guardian Australia’s relationship with the Pacific was “dysfunctional”, adding that Australia was also responsible for diluting the strength of previous regional declarations on climate change. “Australia is a bit of an anomaly, because on the floor [of climate summits] they’re basically sometimes as far right as Trump in some of their views on climate change, at one point they even denied that it existed … But then on a regional basis they’ve actually given a lot of support to our region,” Matsutaro said. “Sometimes the way I think about it ... it’s like you’re in a relationship and you get abused by your spouse but at the same time they feed you and clothe you and things like that,” he said. “You could say it’s a bit of a dysfunctional relationship.” In a blistering speech in Sydney last month, Samoa’s prime minister, Tuilaepa Sailele, called climate change an “existential threat ... for all our Pacific family” and said any world leader who denied climate change’s existence was “utterly stupid”."
"The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, has claimed Australia will honour its Paris climate agreement commitments but failed to name a mechanism for emissions reduction in government policy. In the wake of the Coalition government removing the emissions reduction component from its signature national energy guarantee before Scott Morrison replaced Malcolm Turnbull, the issue is shaping up as a major test before the Wentworth byelection. Turnbull’s son Alex has spruiked for donations on behalf of Labor’s candidate Tim Murray, citing energy policy as a key consideration when the progressive Liberal inner-city electorate goes to the polls. On Sunday Birmingham said that Morrison “has made very clear we will continue to honour our commitments” including the Paris climate agreement, as Australia had done for the first and second round of Kyoto targets. “We continually see, in terms of that abatement target required to meet the 2030 targets, that gap is closing with each update and we’ll continue to work on the policy settings to make sure that is achieved,” he told Sky News. Asked if this would include emissions reduction in the electricity, agriculture or transport industry, Birmingham said the government would “encourage adoption of new technologies and new practices, all of which have played a big role meeting targets to date”. “We will continue to watch closely in terms of the projections around the abatement task and work hard to make sure Australia meets and fulfils our obligations.” On Saturday Scott Morrison said that Australia’s commitments to its Paris targets “haven’t changed”. “Australia stands on its record. I mean, we hit our first target, exceeded it by 128m tonnes,” he told reporters in Indonesia. “We’re on track to meet our second Kyoto target and exceed it by 294m tonnes.” Alex Turnbull has intervened in the Wentworth campaign over the issue of energy policy, calling for donations Labor’s candidate for Wentworth on Twitter. He cited the need for a federal integrity commission, donations reform and a “sane energy policy”. Best bang for the buck you'll get in political donations in your life. Tight race, tight margin for government, big incremental effect whatever happens. If you want a federal election now this is the means by which to achieve it. https://t.co/YgTQGhQwBa At a press conference in Sydney, Morrison played down Turnbull’s intervention, suggesting that “I’m sure Alex’s only message today is happy father’s day to Malcolm”. Asked if it was odd that Turnbull’s son was seeking donations for the Labor candidate, Morrison said it “strikes [him] as a democracy”. Far from staying silent on Sunday, Turnbull doubled down on his earlier comments, arguing that “the market disagrees” with the proposition that the Liberal Party’s energy policy will reduce wholesale prices. “Paris agreement had zero impact on prices [by the way],” he said. Turnbull argued that energy market participants had an incentive to correctly predict the trajectory of prices. “It is crystal clear what those with the right incentives think about what scrapping the Neg means – prices will rise.” On Sunday the former member for Wentworth – Liberal Peter King – signalled his intention to seek preselection.  Appearing on Sky New’s Outsiders, King suggested the ideal candidate for Wentworth would be someone with experience, “not associated with big business”, with resources and “campaign muscle” who has shown “through his public record he has the long-term interests of the community at heart”. King did not articulate a vision for emissions reduction, instead focusing on the need to lower power prices. “We’re exporting our coal and our gas to India and China, they’re then using it to produce cheap power and selling back products to us at a higher rate – so we lose out twice,” he said. King argued that renewable energy is given $2.8bn a year in subsidies – a figure generated by the Minerals Council most of which is accounted for by solar feed-in tariffs provided by state governments. King suggested that blockchain technology could be used so that “if you want to pay more for green power, fine, but if you’re doing it tough or want to pay less you ought to have that opportunity too”."
"Scott Morrison says the South Australian Liberal senator Lucy Gichuhi has told him she was not bullied by anyone in Canberra during the government’s leadership crisis, and he says no names of any perpetrators have been provided to him. While Gichuhi suggested clearly last week that she had been bullied – a suggestion that was validated implicitly by the minister for women, Kelly O’Dwyer, who said government MPs had been intimidated – Morrison told the ABC on Tuesday night the South Australian senator “told me very plainly that she was not bullied by anybody here in Canberra” during the leadership contest.  The prime minister met Gichuhi privately after she signalled she was prepared to name names with the protection of parliamentary privilege. Gichuhi confirmed the conversation earlier on Tuesday, and said Morrison had “taken up the issue”. Regarding bullying in my political career: Yesterday I had a discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Prime Minister has taken up the issue. #auspol We must live and work in a way that respects and enhances ALL freedoms of ALL Australians. Australia says NO to bullying and intimidation. #auspol Morrison said politics was a very “torrid” business and his inquiries to date had not yielded evidence of “gender-specific actions” in relation to what some people would characterise as “very intense lobbying which is fairly normal in the political process, albeit not edifying”. He acknowledged there were some issues relating “to the party divisions and how things are dealt with there” but gave no detail. The prime minister also said he would not support quotas being adopted in the Liberal party to boost female representation in parliament – an idea that has been floated by the Liberals Sussan Ley and Craig Laundy. He said that determination was “a matter for the organisational wing of the Liberal party but [quotas are] never something I have supported”. Even though there is ample evidence that quotas boost the level of female representation both in public and corporate life, Morrison said: “I don’t believe quotas are the way you remove obstacles.” He said he was focused on removing obstacles to women getting preselected. “It’s a matter of supporting women throughout the preselection process, to identify, encourage, support and recruit and then to support them through that process, and then when they get into parliament ensure they’re getting the support they need to do the job,” he said. Morrison was also pressed again to explain why Malcolm Turnbull was no longer the prime minister, given that he was a strong defender of the government’s record, and argued that he didn’t actively seek the top job. The prime minister has tried to move the questioning on from the leadership implosion and on Tuesday night said the government was focused on the future. He said the government had been preoccupied with managing things but further explanation was now required. “What’s important in politics is that people also understand the why’s behind the what.” Even though opinion polls suggest Australian voters are disconcerted by yet another leadership coup, and the Coalition would lose any election held today, the prime minister suggested voters were “disappointed” but used to the turbulence. “I think, sadly, over the last 10 years there have been too many of these changes, on both sides of politics and, I don’t think Australians are as shocked by these things as they used to be,” Morrison said. “They are disappointed.” He struggled to explain the government’s position on climate and energy policy. Asked what the government’s climate policy was, Morrison replied: “Reducing emissions by 26%.” Asked to nominate a policy to drive the emissions reduction, Morrison identified the emissions reduction fund, which was not given any additional funding in the last budget. He suggested further measures would be forthcoming but gave no detail. Morrison declared the government had not changed its emissions reduction policy but the government on Monday took a decision to dump the national energy guarantee, a policy that would have imposed an emissions reduction target for the electricity sector of 26% by 2030. The prime minister has said since taking the top job that Australia will not dump the Paris climate commitment to reduce emissions across the economy by 26%. But in ditching the Neg the government has removed a concrete policy roadmap to drive the emissions reduction. The government does not have policies to drive emissions reduction in sectors of the economy where emissions are now rising. The Energy Security Board has predicted that emissions in the electricity sector will be 24% lower by 2021 courtesy of a big build of renewable energy pulled through by the renewable energy target, which is also contributing to lower wholesale prices. But the ESB has said electricity will not reach a 26% reduction in the absence of the Neg. Even if the the ESB projections are wrong, and the electricity sector managed to reduce emissions by 26% with no policy to drive that result, the Paris target Australia has signed up to applies across the economy, not just to the electricity sector, and the government’s own data shows emissions in other sectors of the economy are rising."
"More voters in the electorate of the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, support an emissions reduction target for electricity and a higher national target than the Paris commitment than oppose those positions. A ReachTel poll of 690 residents across the federal electorate of Hume, which reaches from Boorowa in the southern tablelands of New South Wales to Camden on Sydney’s southern fringe, was commissioned by the Australia Institute. It found the sample was divided over a range of climate and energy questions, but more people supported stronger action on emissions reduction than opposed it.  Asked whether the government’s Paris target of 26% to 28% should be increased “so Australia reduces emissions faster, decreased so Australia does less, or kept the same” – 42.3% said increased, 29.4% said kept the same, and 22.5% said reduced. Asked whether the now dumped national energy guarantee should include an emissions reduction target, 47.8% said yes, and 39.3% said no. There was also local opposition to coal, with 63.7% of the sample either supporting or strongly supporting a moratorium on building new coal mines, while 67.4% supported the Morrison government reviewing the Adani coal mine’s environmental approval. Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said the poll results suggested voters in rural electorates, “just like the population overall, are not enamoured with coal and they want more action on climate change, not less”. Taylor confirmed in question time on Tuesday that the Morrison government would not replace the renewable energy target with an alternative policy after it wound down in 2020. Taylor confirmed there would be no policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector during an answer to the Greens MP Adam Bandt in question time on Tuesday. Bandt asked whether the RET could be extended beyond 2020 given there was currently no policy mechanism to replace it, and the lack of settled policy could threaten investment in low-emissions technology. The energy minister flatly rejected the idea. “The truth of the matter is the renewable energy target is going to wind down from 2020, it reaches its peak in 2020, and we won’t be replacing that with anything.” Taylor said there was no need to focus on emissions reduction, because emissions in electricity would fall by 26% “without additional intervention” – a declaration that contradicts advice from the Energy Security Board. The Coalition’s plan to 2030 was to replace the RET with the national energy guarantee, which imposed an emissions reduction target for electricity. But Malcolm Turnbull abandoned the Neg as one of his last acts in the prime ministership, and the policy has now been junked officially by the cabinet under Scott Morrison’s leadership. Bandt later declared the Liberals were “openly boasting that they have no renewable energy policy”. He said the RET needed to be extended beyond 2020 “to avoid a valley of death for renewable energy”. “Over 2018 and 2019, new renewables are going up in Australia at record rates. This is in large part due to the RET, which even the Energy Security Board and Reserve Bank have said is a big driver of future power bill cuts,” Bandt said. “But the RET runs out in 2020 and now the minister has confirmed that there’s no renewables policy to take its place. If the RET isn’t extended, there’s a real risk that the next government will not be able to implement a new policy in time to avoid an investment drought.” Labor also jumped on Taylor’s declaration. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, branded Taylor the minister “for higher power prices and anti-renewables”. .@AngusTaylorMP in #qt ""the (RET) target reaches a peak in 2020 and we will not be replacing that with anything."" Extraordinarily confirmation the Liberals will have no energy policy! He's the Minister for higher power prices and anti-renewables #auspol"
"Britain has thousands fewer electric car charging points than required because councils are frustrating their rollout, according to one of the country’s biggest energy companies. Big six energy firm SSE said that when it started work three years ago, it had hoped to install 6,000 charging points in London by now, but had fitted just 762 because of delays by local authorities.  The company is the contractor putting in the chargers for the Source London network, run by French firm Bolloré. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed electric vehicle infrastructure to help clean up the capital’s dirty air, but his rhetoric has reportedly not filtered down to the local level. Slow decision-making and bureaucracy in councils, coupled with different approaches to charge points across the capital’s boroughs, are understood to have hamstrung the rollout. Kevin Welstead, the sector director for electric vehicles at SSE Enterprise, said: “Progress has not been rapid. The issue is that we have to effectively negotiate with each of the 33 individual London boroughs so we can install charge points alongside their parking bays and some are more progressive on the electric vehicle agenda than others.” The Guardian understands that 130 charging points are in limbo in Southwark, a borough which is otherwise seen as good on electric cars. While the points were given planning approval in 2016, permission has not been given by highways management, meaning they cannot be installed. Planning permission expires next year. Welstead said ministers and Khan had rightly supported electric vehicles, but added: “Our experience as an infrastructure provider on the ground is that this message has not seeped all the way through.” One possible reason for holdups could be the financial problems that austerity has imposed. Cuts to central government grants have led local authorities to shed staff, including those on transport teams, and remaining staff are understood to be stretched to capacity.

There has also reportedly been a growth in very localised opposition, including in conservation areas. However, there are hotspots of demand for charging points, including Camden, Islington, Kensington & Chelsea, Hammersmith & Fulham and Southwark. The mayor of London launched an electric vehicle infrastructure taskforce in May, focused on “rapid chargers”, not the slower chargers that comprise most of the Source London network. There are nearly 4,000 charging points in London, according to Zap Map. London Councils, which represents the city’s 33 boroughs, denied holding back the switch to electric cars. Councillor Julian Bell, who chairs the group’s transport and environment committee, said: “London boroughs are committed to supporting environmentally friendly transport and are leading the way in delivering an effective network of electric vehicle charging points across the capital.” He added that boroughs also had “a duty to consider the needs of pedestrians and other road users and to make sure these services are delivered to high standards”. Southwark council did not deny that 130 chargers were in limbo, but said it had 100-150 lamp-post electric car charging points planned for the next 12 months."
"Australia’s relationship with the Pacific region on the issue of climate change has been described as “dysfunctional” and “abusive” – providing aid to the region to deal with the effects of global warming but undermining attempts to halt its progress, according to a climate change representative for the Pacific nation of Palau. Xavier Matsutaro, the national climate change coordinator for Palau, a small nation in the north-west Pacific, said Australia’s relationship with the Pacific was “dysfunctional”, adding that Australia was also responsible for diluting the strength of previous regional declarations on climate change.  “Australia is a bit of an anomaly, because on the floor [of climate summits] they’re basically sometimes as far right as Trump in some of their views on climate change, at one point they even denied that it existed … But then on a regional basis they’ve actually given a lot of support to our region,” said Matsutaro. “Sometimes the way I think about it ... it’s like you’re in a relationship and you get abused by your spouse but at the same time they feed you and clothe you and things like that,” he said. “You could say it’s a bit of a dysfunctional relationship.” Matsutaro spoke to the Guardian in Palau a week before leaders, including Palau’s minister of state Faustina Rehuher-Marugg, met in Nauru at the Pacific Islands Forum, where climate change was a key issue discussed by the group.  Leaders are set to sign a new security agreement that labels climate change as the “greatest threat” to the Pacific region. Citizens of the region have been among the first to feel the effects of climate change, with rising sea levels and increased natural disasters in the region. The summit comes at an awkward time for Australia, as the new prime minister, Scott Morrison, faces pressure from some members of his party to abandon Australia’s commitment to reducing emissions under the Paris agreement. Matsutaro said Australia, which has historically been the key aid partner for the Pacific region, had supported projects in Palau related to climate change, including a coastal erosion project and research on coral bleaching. Australia even provided research on the impact of climate change on Palau which formed the basis for a section of Palau’s climate change policy. But when it came time to make commitments on climate change, Matsutaro, who has attended COP meetings on Palau’s behalf for the last five years, said Australia was regularly out of sync with the rest of the region, and was responsible for diluting the strength of resolutions on the environment. “They’re responsible for making our declarations weaker sometimes in the region. So there’s been forums that were formulated so [Australia] won’t be involved in it, they’re not members, so that whatever language that really reflects our views and our circumstances is actually reflected in the declaration,” he said. Pacific leaders have called for Australia to do more to reduce emissions and act to curb the effects of climate change. Last week in a blistering speech in Sydney, the Samoan prime minister called climate change an “existential threat ... for all our Pacific family” and said that any world leader who denied climate change’s existence should be taken to a mental hospital. The prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, who has opted to travel to Bangkok for an extra session of the COP23 climate change negotiations instead of attending the Pacific Islands Forum, excoriated global leaders for their inaction on climate change, saying leaders had promised much but delivered little. “If all the noble intentions of all the good people who have built this process since 1992 could be converted to clean energy, we could resolve the crisis now. But intentions are not actions.” He said history would condemn leaders who failed to properly address the impacts of climate change. “Would any of us like to return to our people and tell them that we had the chance to do something truly great and truly necessary for the world we will pass to our children, but we lacked the will to get it done?”"
"One day in 1961, an American economist named Daniel Ellsberg stumbled across a piece of paper with apocalyptic implications. Ellsberg, who was advising the US government on its secret nuclear war plans, had discovered a document that contained an official estimate of the death toll in a preemptive “first strike” on China and the Soviet Union: 300 million in those countries, and double that globally. Ellsberg was troubled that such a plan existed; years later, he tried to leak the details of nuclear annihilation to the public. Although his attempt failed, Ellsberg would become famous instead for leaking what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers – the US government’s secret history of its military intervention in Vietnam.  America’s amoral military planning during the Cold War echoes the hubris exhibited by another cast of characters gambling with the fate of humanity. Recently, secret documents have been unearthed detailing what the energy industry knew about the links between their products and global warming. But, unlike the government’s nuclear plans, what the industry detailed was put into action. In the 1980s, oil companies like Exxon and Shell carried out internal assessments of the carbon dioxide released by fossil fuels, and forecast the planetary consequences of these emissions. In 1982, for example, Exxon predicted that by about 2060, CO2 levels would reach around 560 parts per million – double the preindustrial level – and that this would push the planet’s average temperatures up by about 2°C over then-current levels (and even more compared to pre-industrial levels). Later that decade, in 1988, an internal report by Shell projected similar effects but also found that CO2 could double even earlier, by 2030. Privately, these companies did not dispute the links between their products, global warming, and ecological calamity. On the contrary, their research confirmed the connections. Shell’s assessment foresaw a one-meter sea-level rise, and noted that warming could also fuel disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, resulting in a worldwide rise in sea level of “five to six meters.” That would be enough to inundate entire low-lying countries. Shell’s analysts also warned of the “disappearance of specific ecosystems or habitat destruction,” predicted an increase in “runoff, destructive floods, and inundation of low-lying farmland,” and said that “new sources of freshwater would be required” to compensate for changes in precipitation. Global changes in air temperature would also “drastically change the way people live and work.” All told, Shell concluded, “the changes may be the greatest in recorded history.” For its part, Exxon warned of “potentially catastrophic events that must be considered.” Like Shell’s experts, Exxon’s scientists predicted devastating sea-level rise, and warned that the American Midwest and other parts of the world could become desert-like. Looking on the bright side, the company expressed its confidence that “this problem is not as significant to mankind as a nuclear holocaust or world famine.” The documents make for frightening reading. And the effect is all the more chilling in view of the oil giants’ refusal to warn the public about the damage that their own researchers predicted. Shell’s report, marked “confidential,” was first disclosed by a Dutch news organization earlier this year. Exxon’s study was not intended for external distribution, either; it was leaked in 2015. Nor did the companies ever take responsibility for their products. In Shell’s study, the firm argued that the “main burden” of addressing climate change rests not with the energy industry, but with governments and consumers. That argument might have made sense if oil executives, including those from Exxon and Shell, had not later lied about climate change and actively prevented governments from enacting clean-energy policies. Although the details of global warming were foreign to most people in the 1980s, among the few who had a better idea than most were the companies contributing the most to it. Despite scientific uncertainties, the bottom line was this: oil firms recognized that their products added CO2 to the atmosphere, understood that this would lead to warming, and calculated the likely consequences. And then they chose to accept those risks on our behalf, at our expense, and without our knowledge. The catastrophic nuclear war plans that Ellsberg saw in the 1960s were a Sword of Damocles that fortunately never fell. But the oil industry’s secret climate change predictions are becoming reality, and not by accident. Fossil-fuel producers willfully drove us toward the grim future they feared by promoting their products, lying about the effects, and aggressively defending their share of the energy market. As the world warms, the building blocks of our planet – its ice sheets, forests, and atmospheric and ocean currents – are being altered beyond repair. Who has the right to foresee such damage and then choose to fulfill the prophecy? Although war planners and fossil-fuel companies had the arrogance to decide what level of devastation was appropriate for humanity, only Big Oil had the temerity to follow through. That, of course, is one time too many. Benjamin Franta, a former research fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, is a doctoral candidate at Stanford University, where his research focuses on the history of climate science and politics.

"High up on a melting Greenland glacier, at the end of this summer from climate hell, two young women shout a poem above the roar of the wind. Aka Niviana, grew up on the northern coast of Greenland; as its ice inexorably thaws, her traditional way of life disappears. And the water that melts off that ice sheet is drowning the home of Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner and everyone else in her home nation, the Marshall Islands of the Pacific. One poet watches her heritage turn to water; the other watches that same water sweep up the beaches of her country and into the houses of her friends. The destruction of one’s homeland is the inevitable destruction of the other’s. I’ve spent 30 years thinking about climate change – talking with scientists, economists and politicians about emission rates and carbon taxes and treaties. But the hardest idea to get across is also the simplest: we live on a planet, and that planet is breaking. Poets, it turns out, can deliver that message. But they don’t watch impassively. Both are climate activists, and both have raised their voices in service of their homelands. Jetnil-Kijiner, 30, has been at it for years – she’s performed her work before the United Nations General Assembly and the Vatican. Niviana is newer to activism – just 23, she recited a poem at a recent Copenhagen climate protest, where she met a well-known glaciologist, Jason Box, and he, in turn, organised the complicated logistics of this glacier expedition. We’ve come with a video crew to the remote fjords of southern Greenland. After two days travelling by boat, we’ve unloaded our gear on the rocks at the foot of the rapidly dwindling glacier, and hauled it up to a base camp nestled on red granite bedrock next to a cascade fed by thundering meltwater. Now, in a cold wind next to a gaping crevasse, the two women are performing the words they’ve spent weeks writing. Jason Box says there’s no doubt they’re both correct: all told, Greenland has enough water frozen on its rocky mantle to raise the sea by seven metres. After 25 years of field work on the great ice sheet, he understands its significance like few others: right now, there’s no place on earth contributing more to the rise of the oceans. Eventually the even-vaster Antarctic will produce more water, but for now the Arctic is melting much faster (while we were camped on the glacier news reports said that sea ice north of the island – “the oldest, solidest ice in the Arctic” – had melted in this year’s freakish heat). “We called this ‘Eagle Glacier’ because of its shape when we first came here five years ago,” Box said, “but now the head and the wings of the bird have melted away. I don’t know what we should call it now, but the eagle is dead.” It’s not, of course, as if global warming is some mysterious, uncontrollable force: it comes from a particular way of life, a way of life which has left some people rich and an increasing number in desperate straits. These poets can’t avoid the politics: their stanzas indict the civilisations which – long before we worried about climate change – blew up Bikini Atoll in the Marshalls and polluted Greenland’s ice sheet with nuclear waste. Hearing the roll call of giant cities in the poem seems odd at first, on this remote glacier thousands of miles from the nearest traffic jam. But that’s the point. There is no distance any more: the isolation that once protected places like Greenland or Micronesia no longer offers any buffer. The carbon that the rich pour into the air traps heat in the atmosphere we all share. That heat comes north and south, where it melts the world’s great storehouses of ice; in turn the oceans that lap at every continent rise. Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner literally stands with two feet planted on the ice that will submerge her country. This science is uncontroversial. But science alone can’t make change, because it appeals only to the hemisphere of the brain that values logic and reason. We’re also creatures of emotion, intuition, spark – which is perhaps why we should mount more poetry expeditions, put more musicians on dying reefs, make sure that novelists can feel the licking heat of wildfire. Alun Hubbard, a Welsh glaciologist who was carrying huge loads of supplies up the glacier to build base camp, remembered his first visits to thawing Greenland. “It’s just gobsmacking looking at the trauma of the landscape. I just couldn’t register the scale of how the icesheet had changed in my head.” But artists can register those thoughts, and turn them into images that potentially unite us. And that unity is precisely what’s required, because otherwise inertia – and the political power of the fossil fuel companies – seems destined to slow our transition to renewable energy. Slow it enough that the ancient ways of life that gave rise to these young women will warp and then disappear. Slow it enough that everyone everywhere will feel the pain their communities are already feeling. These poets are up on the ice hoping that they can somehow rouse more of the world to action.  The very same beasts That now decide Who should live And who should die … We demand that the world see beyond SUVs, ACs, their pre-package convenience Their oil-slicked dreams, beyond the belief That tomorrow will never happen And yet there’s a generosity to their witness – a recognition that whoever started the trouble, we’re now in it together. Let me bring my home to yours Let’s watch as Miami, New York, Shanghai, Amsterdam, London Rio de Janeiro and Osaka Try to breathe underwater … None of us is immune. Life in all forms demands The same respect we all give to money … So each and every one of us Has to decide If we Will Rise • Bill McKibben wrote the first book about climate change, The End of Nature, in 1989, and co-founded 350.org, which has become the planet’s largest grassroots climate campaign. His forthcoming book is Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?"
"Why bother to learn anything in school if politicians won’t pay attention to the facts? This simple realisation prompted Greta Thunberg, 15, to protest in the most effective way she knew. She is on strike, refusing to go to school until Sweden’s general election on 9 September to draw attention to the climate crisis.  Her protest has captured the imagination of a country that has been struck by heatwaves and wildfires in its hottest summer since records began 262 years ago. Every day for two weeks, Thunberg has been sitting quietly on the cobblestones outside parliament in central Stockholm, handing out leaflets that declare: “I am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future.” Thunberg herself is a diminutive girl with pigtails and a fleeting smile – not the stereotypical leader of a climate revolution. “I am doing this because nobody else is doing anything. It is my moral responsibility to do what I can,” she says. “I want the politicians to prioritise the climate question, focus on the climate and treat it like a crisis.” When people tell her she should be at school, she points to the textbooks in her satchel. “I have my books here,” she says in flawless English. “But also I am thinking: what am I missing? What am I going to learn in school? Facts don’t matter any more, politicians aren’t listening to the scientists, so why should I learn?” Thunberg’s protest might come as a surprise to anyone seduced by Sweden’s reputation as a climate pioneer and champion of the environment. This year the country enacted “the most ambitious climate law in the world”, aiming to become carbon neutral by 2045 and comfortably beating the 2015 Paris climate targets along the way. “This is too little too late, it needs to come much faster,” Thunberg says. “Sweden is not a green paradise, it has one of the biggest carbon footprints.” Her parents want her to give up her protest and go back to school. “My teachers are divided,” Thunberg says. “As people they think what I am doing is good, but as teachers they say I should stop.” One teacher to have downed tools to join her protest is Benjamin Wagner, 26. He expects to lose three weeks’ wages – and his job – as a result of his strike. “Our inability to stop climate change is like the efforts to stop world war one – we knew for years it was coming, they arranged all sorts of conferences, but still they didn’t prevent it,” Wagner says. “Greta is a troublemaker, she is not listening to adults. But we are heading full speed for a catastrophe, and in this situation the only reasonable thing is to be unreasonable.” There are signs that more Swedes are listening. The Green party, a partner in the centre-left coalition government, was languishing in the polls before the country was hit by more than 60 forest fires, which raged for weeks through a rural tinderbox created by the unprecedented drought. Now the party’s support is up by half to about 6%. “I am very impressed by Greta’s courage and determination,” says Janine Alm Ericson, a Green member of parliament. “But I am also sad that she feels she has to be there – the political parties in Sweden have not done enough. Thanks to the hot summer it has become easier for people to imagine what climate change can mean for us and others in Europe if we continue to ignore what is happening.” Outside parliament, Stella d’Ailly, 45, an art director, has come to join Thunberg’s protest. “I feel like I am dying inside if I don’t protest,” she says. “Sweden may be well organised to recycle our trash, for example, but we do nothing to cut the amount of plastic bottles and packaging in the first place. We need drastic change.” Thunberg’s own awakening to the climate crisis a few years ago caused upheaval in her family. Her mother, the well known opera singer Malena Ernman, has given up her international career because of the climate effects of aviation. “Greta forced us to change our lives,” says her father Svante. “I didn’t have a clue about the climate. We started looking into it, reading all the books – she has read them too.” Her teachers were telling her to turn off the lights and save paper, then flying off to New York for a holiday. For Greta, this was just not good enough: “Everyone believes that we can solve the crisis without effort, without sacrifice,” she wrote in an article widely circulated on social media and translated into English. While on strike, she has done a lot of homework and read three books, her father says. “She is supposed to be in school, we cannot support her action. But we respect that she wants to make a stand. She can either sit at home and be really unhappy, or protest and be happy.” Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. “The best thing about my protest has been to see how more and more people have been coming and getting involved,” Greta says. “I don’t care if I get into trouble at school. I believe that one person can make a difference.”"
"What a year it’s been. While the months of soaring temperatures provided an initially welcome ray of sunshine after a long, cold, wet winter, the two extremes have damaged our gardens – and highlighted how vulnerable labour-intensive, primped-and-pruned plots can be. Mature trees and shrubs (with deeper root structures), perennial crops and wildflower-laden areas suffered less from the heat; but potted plants, which dry out quickly, became a time-consuming burden, requiring endless watering, while salad leaves stopped growing or wilted and died. Mediterranean, sun-loving produce such as tomatoes, aubergines, grapes, cucumbers, thyme, rosemary and oregano thrived; but leeks, broccoli, onions, carrots and potatoes were hit hard, a fact mirrored in farmers’ worrying crop yields this year. Soil erosion and heat stress left plants more vulnerable to pests and diseases, while the wet winter threatenedsoil fertility and increased the risk of nutrients being washed away. Cyclical natural phenomena, predicted to amplify the effects of global warming over the next four years, could result in greater extremes. The RHS recently partnered with Cranfield University to recruit the UK’s first garden water scientist, to research how gardeners can better deal with drought and flood; but in the meantime, what can we do to repair the damage and increase our gardens’ resilience? Here’s how to get started.   Pulling out, clearing plants and digging over the soil is the worst thing you can do, opening up your loam to the elements. A plant with roots in the ground helps to hold together the soil (and its goodness); allowing flowers and crops to rot down naturally provides greater protection. Even non-invasive weeds are better than nothing at all. Good old-fashioned, slow-release compost contains everything plants need and promotes deep-down resilience. It’s easy to make: in a basic cold composting system, add a roughly 50/50 mix of green waste (fruit and veg, grass cuttings, plant trimmings) with brown (newspaper, cardboard, garden pruning, fallen leaves). During a heatwave, it can also be used as a mulch around thirstier plants, helping to hold moisture in. Ground that has been well composted throughout the year will be better able to deal with winter rain, as it has an enhanced structure and can absorb more water.  Climate change could result in an increase in pests, and weather-stressed plants are more vulnerable to attack. Predators provide a more balanced ecosystem where it’s harder for one type of creature to dominate. Allow a small area of your garden to be entirely wild, to encourage frogs, toads, ground beetles, ladybirds and their ilk. Attractive habitats over winter include leaf litter, a wood pile, compost heap, stinging nettles, old plant stems and pots under which insects can hide. Their deeper root structure enables them to seek out moisture and thrive in harsher conditions than many flightier annuals, making them lower-maintenance and hardier. Easy additions include rhubarb, asparagus, cardoon, daubenton kale, winter herbs and the likes of jerusalem artichoke and oca, which will grow back if you leave a few tubers in the ground. Lavender, hardy geraniums and coneflowers also stand their ground well. As well as completing the gardening circle in a way that is very rewarding, this will give you seeds adapted to the conditions in your garden or allotment, making them more resilient. Some of the best plants for this are parsley, coriander, calendula, nasturtium, poppies, camomile and aquilegia. Autumn is the time to collect rainwater. This means upsizing or increasing the number of butts you have, so you are better prepared for the next drought. A pump can be used in butts, baths or paddling pools to help access every available drop. Trees and shrubs near the top of your garden will make a protective barrier, helping to absorb excess winter rainwater and provide a defence against wind. Allowing grass to grow long also helps.  Rather than growing crops in blocks, take a more cottage garden approach,mixing produce in with flowers, herbs and small shrubs. This provides greater biodiversity, encourages pollinators, makes it easier to create ground cover and provides resilience against pest attack.

"From time to time the BBC gets itself into an awful mess over climate change. Unnecessarily so, given that it has visited and revisited principles of good coverage, repeatedly arriving at more or less the same conclusions. Back in 2007, a report for the BBC Trust, then the corporation’s regulator, concluded that the old bipolar world of “the climate change debate” had gone. The working model had to change, as the title put it, From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel : “the weight of evidence no longer justifies equal space being given to the opponents of the consensus. But these dissenters (or even sceptics) will still be heard, as they should.” Four years later, the Trust’s review of accuracy and impartiality in science coverage , commissioned from geneticist Professor Steve Jones, reached very similar conclusions.  Both reports were accepted by BBC managers. Both contain much that is common sense. And then there are the editorial guidelines, which are very clear that the guiding principle is “due impartiality”, rather than equal weight. So how have we reached a situation in which the BBC has to apologise  for not challenging incorrect statements made by Lord Lawson on the Today programme, where an entire Radio 4 feature, What’s the Point of the Met Office?, turns into a polemic about “dodgy” climate science, and where Radio Cambridgeshire finds it appropriate to stage a traditional seesaw-style debate between “warmist” and “sceptic”? One answer is that the BBC has failed to promulgate its “big thinking” on editorial matters to producers and presenters, very few of whom have a science background. After the Jones Review it set up seminars on science coverage; but it failed to make them mandatory, and scrapped them after a year. Staff come and staff go; it seems extremely unlikely that Sarah Sands, editor of Today, had read either the Jones Review or From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel when she decided to call Nigel Lawson for “that” interview. I recently argued for the seminars’ reinstatement and for making them mandatory. Not that I’m claiming credit, but as the CarbonBrief website has reported, the BBC has now done something similar – setting up a new one-hour course on reporting climate change “… covering the latest science, policy, research, and misconceptions to challenge, giving you confidence to cover the topic accurately and knowledgeably”. The basic briefing document for the course is short, but it’s a good start. “Climate change is happening”; there is a range of possible temperature rises for any given level of carbon emissions; one cold winter does not challenge the overall picture; and so on. Unchallengeable, really. If the courses are implemented well, they should improve matters still further. I say “still further” because the lapses to which I referred earlier are conspicuous by their rarity. There’s been a lot of climate change coverage this summer, and the vast majority that I’ve seen has been exemplary. But if this initiative can, for example, make sure that Today presenters know that individual extreme weather events are now routinely being linked to climate change, as Nick Robinson appeared not to know when talking about the heatwave recently, that will be a step forward. Climate science, though, is just part of the picture. The corporation’s coverage of energy could do with an infusion of new thinking on issues linked to climate change. Mercifully the stream of claims that “the lights will go out” as Britain adopts more and more renewable energy appears to have stopped. But which of the BBC’s correspondents knows that energy bills have gone down over the past decade? Not those who last year covered the government-commissioned Helm Review of energy prices, which led to Radio 4 claiming that “bills have doubled over the past decade”. Where is coverage, also, of the existential risk posed to oil companies – and therefore our pension funds – by the tumbling prices of renewable energy and electric cars? This is now standard fare for the FT, Economist, Telegraph, Reuters, Bloomberg … But the BBC has yet to catch on that a transformation of the entire global energy system is a big story. The other major factor behind the BBC’s occasional troubles on climate change is lobbying. The newspaper commentariat is amply stocked with columnists who routinely lambast the corporation for bias; and the weight of rhetoric has had an impact. This, I think, is the real takeaway from the CarbonBrief news: the BBC has decided that it no longer cares about groundless criticism. I assume that the first fulmination against this new course will be in print this weekend or early next week, doubtless full of words such as “indoctrination”. The BBC will be accused of “stifling debate”, even though the course material is clear that it is not. Probably the identity of the “shadowy” figures behind this initiative will be sought. The reality is, though, that climate and energy contrarians are exerting less and less influence on media or politics. As the BBC’s online briefing notes, the government is now taking advice on whether to set a net-zero emissions target in law, not debating whether climate change matters. If BBC bosses have decided that from now on they are going to free output from the occasional grip of the UK’s climate contrarian elite and stand up for evidence – good on them. • Richard Black is director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, and a former BBC science and environment correspondent"
"No one knew Nicolas Hulot, the French environment minister, was about to resign when he went on a radio breakfast show yesterday morning – not even himself. But as the live discussion unfolded, focusing on his government’s failures on climate change, it became clear that Hulot had reached a decision. “I can’t lie to myself any more,” he said. “I don’t want my presence in the government to give the illusion that we’re facing up to such stakes,” he said on public radio France Inter. Explaining how he had felt “alone” in a cabinet that only took insufficient, “tiny steps” to tackle environmental challenges, he announced that he would resign. In a moment of striking self-awareness, Hulot, a celebrity environmentalist, continued: “Have we started to reduce our CO2 emissions? No. Have we started to reduce our use of pesticides? No. To prevent the erosion of our biodiversity? No.” Neither the president, Emmanuel Macron, nor the hprime minister, Édouard Philippe, had been made aware of Hulot’s decision before it happened. The French government was taken entirely by surprise: Marlène Schiappa, Macron’s secretary of state for equality, was being interviewed on another radio station when she heard the news, and asked the presenter if he was joking. Hulot had been one of Macron’s most popular ministers, even after he was accused of sexual assault last February, which he denied. For the French president, it is a heavy blow. On a state visit to Denmark, Macron said he respected Hulot’s “personal decision”, and hoped to still be able to “count on his free and confident engagement” in the future. Yet the surprise resignation complicates things further for the government, who after the mess of this summer’s Benalla scandal was already preparing for a challenging autumn with a much-condemned pensions reform on the agenda. It was only a year ago that Macron rebuked the US president, Donald Trump, for pulling out of the Paris climate agreement by calling to “make our planet great again” – a slogan he proudly turned into a hashtag to underline his campaign pledge to fully address the impacts of climate change. As his ratings keep falling – dropping to 39%, the lowest of his presidency so far – the former poster boy for global environmental action has now lost his cabinet’s signature green advocate. And Macron has got only himself to blame: according to Hulot, what drove him over the edge was the presence of a hunting lobbyist at a meeting earlier this week. “It is symptomatic of the presence of lobbyists in circles of power. Who holds the power? Who rules?” Hulot wondered on the radio. (A few months ago, Macron also announced the reintroduction of the traditional presidential hunt). When Hulot asked the president why the lobbyist was there, Macron apparently responded that he “didn’t know how he had got in.” Understandably, Hulot did not appreciate the impudent humour. Political opposition vocally supported his condemnation of lobbyists’ influence. Macron “sucks up” to lobbyists, ecologist Yannick Jadot told Le Monde. For all the debate around Hulot’s resignation, his wake-up call remains unanswered. “I don’t understand that we are witnessing the gestation of a tragedy with indifference,” Hulot said. “The planet is becoming a sauna, our natural resources are draining, biodiversity is vanishing. And we stubbornly try to revive an economic model that is the cause of all this mess.” Macron may still save face – but that will take real political courage by living up to his promises on cutting emissions, pesticides bans and wildlife protection. Sucking up to lobbyists won’t make the planet great again, Manu. • Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in Britain. She writes for the New Statesman"
"The globe-trotting travels of the UN’s environment chief have been sharply criticised in a draft internal audit as “contrary to the ethos of carbon emission reduction”. Erik Solheim, executive director of UN Environment, was travelling for 529 out of the 668 days audited, spending $488,518 (£370,380), according to the report. The audit also said he had “no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules” and claimed unjustified expenses.  The development comes amid growing concern among some UN Environment officials, with sources claiming his “haphazard and dictatorial management style” has “already made us dysfunctional in many respects”. Solheim told the Guardian he had already paid back money for instances of oversight and made changes where other rules had been broken. He said he could not comment in detail on the audit until it was completed and published: “If any other mistakes are found, we will immediately correct them.” Responding to staff concern over his leadership of the UN Environment Programme (Unep), he said: “To secure unprecedented environmental action, we need to change, as individuals, as society, indeed as the UN. No one is immune to the difficulty that type of systemic change often brings.” The draft audit, leaked to the Guardian, was compiled by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) and will be finalised after responses from the individuals named. It is particularly critical of Solheim’s frequent flying, which included a weekend trip from the US to France and back. “The extensive travel patterns of [Solheim] did not set an example for the rest of the staff to follow,” it said. “In 2011 … the secretary general stated that ‘What we demand of others, we must do ourselves’. Such extensive travel therefore presents a reputation risk to the organization, especially [given] that Unep is supposed to be the lead on sustainable environment matters.” It also said Unep, unlike several other UN organisations, did not have policies and incentives for staff to reduce their carbon emissions. In August, Solheim told a Norwegian aviation magazine, people should not have a “guilty conscience” about flying and said he held gold frequent flyer cards at all three major airline alliances. “This is simply embarrassing,” said Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace in Norway. “Solheim has made Unep much more visible, which is a good thing, partly through travels and discussions with so many people. But this report puts him in an extremely bad light and weakens the credibility of UN’s entire environmental organisation.”  Solheim said: “Making good on our global agenda demands engagement with the world and indeed an expanded approach to our work. I am therefore determined to continue to focus on our mandate to create real results for real people, with real impact on the ground.” The draft OIOS audit also criticises Solheim’s management style as “having no regard for abiding by the set regulations and rules, and correspondence seen showed management willingness to circumvent regulations and rules which were termed as ‘bureaucratic’.” The audit said Solheim’s travel had been approved by a manager who reported directly to him, not someone more senior. “We have immediately put new procedures in place whereby my travel is approved by the office of the secretary general,” Solheim told the Guardian. The audit also said Solheim had not provided justification for 76 days spent in Oslo and Paris on official travel. After a request from a UN official to account for days spent in his home country, Norway, Solheim, emailed: “We cannot accept this question on holiday vs job … we are not any longer living in the industrial age and they must stop treating me as if I am a 07 to 16 factory worker … the other side of this coin is that they must stop asking this stupid question.” Solheim told the Guardian: “It’s true that I have vented frustration with what I perceive as excessive bureaucracy in the UN system. I believe fully in reforming the UN so we’re better able to confront the urgent challenges facing our planet.” But he added: “If administrative rules are found to have been overlooked, I accept personal responsibility and offer my unflinching commitment to refining a process that prevents them from ever occurring again.” The OIOS report also criticises Solheim for allowing two senior managers to work unofficially from Paris, rather than Unep headquarters in Nairobi. A source said staff saw this arrangement as the managers “getting away with murder”. In one case, the unofficial teleworking resulted in additional travel costs of $23,750, according to the draft audit. Questioned by officials over the unofficial arrangement in emails seen by the Guardian, Solheim said: “Please blame it on the erratic executive director.” On another occasion, discussing management reform, Solheim emailed colleagues to say: “There is no need to be the most legalistic implementer of nonsense. Very often it is easier to get forgiveness for non compliance than to get permission for change.” Numerous Unep staff have contacted the Guardian, on condition of anonymity, criticising Solheim’s leadership of the organisation, which is governed and funded by UN member states. “He thinks he is a CEO when he is actually an international civil servant,” said one source. “A lot of us were very excited when he came. He’s Norwegian and an ex-environment minister. It was the dream CV that turned into a nightmare.” The Guardian can be contacted securely here or by email at damian.carrington@theguardian.com."
"We want Guardian supporters to help us better understand the changes taking place in the natural world, and how we might combat the demise of some of the plants and creatures with whom we share the planet. Which local species of fauna and flora are disappearing from your local area? What is being done to preserve and protect them – and with how much success? Perhaps you work in conservation and would like to tell us about the work you’re doing, or are simply a nature enthusiast who cares about protecting a particular species. In this month’s episode, our panel will be responding to your questions on this subject, so we’d love you to get in touch, wherever you are in the world. Guardian columnist George Monbiot recently wrote about the demise of many aspects of the natural world, citing a UN report that our use of natural resources has tripled in 40 years. The great expansion of mining, logging, meat production and industrial fishing is cleansing the planet of its wild places and natural wonders. What economists proclaim as progress, ecologists recognise as ruin. “Walking in the countryside or snorkelling in the sea”, he says, “is now as painful to me as an art lover would find visits to a gallery, if on every occasion another old master had been cut from its frame.”  The reaction to this piece and others by Monbiot demonstrates that this is a subject close to our readers’ hearts. But then, it always has been: the Guardian’s century-old column Country Diary, which looks at natural history and the countryside, has been a readers’ favourite since it began. We have also looked at the uncertain fate of the much-loved puffin in places such as Scotland, Norway and Iceland. And even the impact of Brexit on seabirds and dolphins. We are committed to quality environment coverage, but with each generation, another aspect of our environment is lost, and preserving what came before becomes even more difficult. In Trump’s America, a commitment to protecting endangered animals has been caught in the crosshairs of a drive by the president to increase industry – a move which many have described as short-term thinking at its worst. In his opinion piece on the topic, Andrew Rosenberg says: “Wolves, bears, sage grouse: these are animals of incredible beauty that enrich our ecological landscape. But other, less charismatic species, like burying beetles and freshwater mussels, are at risk too – all because their presence is inconvenient for some economic activities. Unfortunately, species are not just ‘nice to have’. They are part of living, breathing ecosystems.” There is a slowly increasing awareness of the impact of human behaviour on the natural world. For some species, it sadly is too late to take action, and for others – endangered or at risk of becoming so – there is a lot of work to be done. Please do get in touch, wherever you are in the world: we would like to hear your questions, views and experiences. To get involved, send an email to weneedtotalkabout@theguardian.com, including your question or comment, your name, and a phone number so we can call you to make a recording. If you’d like to catch up with the podcast and previous discussions, you can do so at gu.com/talk-about."
"The Greens leader Richard Di Natale will promise to work with a new Labor government to get action on climate change back on track. Di Natale makes the pledge in a landmark speech to be delivered on Monday in Melbourne, kicking off a national speaking tour that anticipates the major policy battles of the next federal election. In a copy of the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Di Natale promises more progressive policy on the environment, increasing Newstart and creating a publicly owned bank and energy company. But while the bulk of the speech distinguishes the Greens’ offering from the two major parties, on climate change Di Natale says he wants to “make it clear – we’ll work with a new government to get climate action back on track”. Let’s not be diverted by allowing race-baiting and hate to be weaponised to turn neighbours against each other The comment suggests the Greens are keen to avoid a repeat of Labor’s last term in government, when its opposition to Kevin Rudd’s emission trading scheme led to the minority Gillard government legislating an interim carbon price only to see it repealed by the Abbott government. With the Morrison government committing to the Paris agreement’s emissions reduction targets but with no mechanism to achieve them, Labor faces a policy test of its own in choosing whether to pursue its 45% renewable energy target through the Turnbull government’s national energy guarantee or through other means. Di Natale says although the Greens will work with Labor on climate “we know that’s not enough” because the major parties “won’t stand up to their corporate donors at the big end of town”. “They’ll let the Adani mine go ahead and destroy the Great Barrier Reef and oil companies contaminate our Great Australian Bight,” he says. Di Natale says the “first priority” is to turf out the Coalition who “don’t deserve to govern”. He says the decision to replace Malcolm Turnbull with Scott Morrison had brought to power “a man who brutally enforced inhumane policies towards asylum seekers and said to grieving families we aren’t going to let you attend the funerals of your dead children”. The Greens leader also targets the new prime minister for bringing a lump of coal into parliament and making drought a priority of his government without acknowledging the link to climate change. Di Natale predicts political discourse at the next election “will be driven by fear and greed”. He warns of “fear in the form of an attack on migrants and multiculturalism, which by any definition has been an outstanding success”. “Let’s not be diverted by allowing race-baiting and hate to be normalised and weaponised to turn neighbours against each other.” The comments echo warnings from outgoing race commissioner Tim Soutphommasane that race politics are back in Australia. Di Natale predicts parties will display “greed in the form of tax bribes that won’t solve the real economic issues Australians face and will leave corporate power untouched”. He warns the Greens’ political opponents will “keep Newstart and Youth Allowance too low and the price of housing too high”.  “And they won’t close those offshore detention camps.” Labor has promised to improve housing affordability through its plans to restrict negative gearing to new homes and reduce the capital gains concessions from 50% to 25%.  But it has only promised to review the level of Newstart, despite the fact the $38.98 a day payment for a single person hasn’t kept up with national living standards for more than a quarter of a century. Bill Shorten has pledged not to change the Coalition’s immigration policies including turnbacks of asylum seeker boats and offshore detention for people seeking asylum. Di Natale reiterates Greens pledges to reform donations, create a federal independent commission against corruption, and a publicly-owned bank and publicly-owned energy company. He also argues that Australia needs to “change the face of our parliament” to reflect diversity with more “people of colour, people with disabilities, single parents, artists, scientists [and] young people”."
"Better management of fisheries and fishing rights around the world could increase profits and leave more fish in the sea as long as measures to meet climate obligations are taken, new research has found. Even if temperatures rise by as much as 4C above pre-industrial levels – in the upper range of current forecasts – the damaging effects on fishing can be reduced through improving how stocks are fished and managed.  Governments are meeting from 4 September in New York for the first round of talks on a new global treaty of the high seas, which would aim to conserve overfished stocks and make access to key fisheries more equitable. Any agreement is likely to take several years to negotiateand longer to come into force, but scientists say there is no time to be lost, given the magnitude of the threat to the world’s marine ecosystems. Climate change is already causing the movement of some species as their traditional habitats grow warmer, and overfishing is wreaking heavy damage on stocks. However, by adapting fisheries management to a warming climate, and instituting better systems such as monitoring of fleets, the global catch can be increased despite these factors, according to the paper published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. “This is a positive message amid the doom and gloom,” said Kristin Kleisner, one of the authors of the study and a senior scientist at the US Environmental Defense Fund. “We can control how we manage our fisheries. We will have severe effects [from climate change] but this shows what we can do as humans to control that.” If temperatures were to hit 4C above pre-industrial levels, but good management was put in place, there could still be an increase of 17% of the amount of fish in oceans, compared with a decline of 5% of fish biomass if current practices continue and the world warmed by only 1C. She noted that new technologies, such as monitoring of fishing vessels from satellites and through the internet, could make a big difference in enabling closer management. These techniques can also make fisheries management more responsive to the changing dynamics of ocean ecosystems, so that fishing can be redirected if stocks appear to be declining, for instance. Under 2C of warming, improved management could yield even better returns, resulting in a 16% increase in the catch, amounting to 25bn servings of seafood a year, and nearly a third more fish in the sea than there are today. The finding is crucial because more than 1 billion people globally rely on fish, particularly key species such as tuna and mackerel, as their main source of protein. Governments agreed in 2015 to take action to limit warming to no more than 2C, regarded as the threshold of safety beyond which the effects of climate change are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Kleisner said the results of the study showed that governments should take prompt action to bring in modern fisheries management. Global Fishing Watch, an international NGO, has used technological improvements to open up vast amounts of new data on fishing around the world. These include data made public earlier this year on tens of thousands of global vessels, which would have been impossible even five years ago. Sarah Bladen, of Global Fishing Watch, said even newer techniques were being brought to bear, with results that could be “game-changing” for fisheries management and preventing illegal fishing. “Technological innovation is putting us within reach of a ‘real-time’ digital ocean. The open ocean has long been characterised as the wild west: lawless, remote and plagued by a paucity of data. However, our ability to directly detect and track fishing vessel activity globally is undergoing an extraordinary transformation.” She called on the fishing industry to take note: “This really is, or needs to be, a wake-up call: the era of ‘secret’ fishing spots is over. To maintain the social licence to operate, fishing industries worldwide need to step up and accept, indeed embrace, levels of transparency in fishing activities that were unimaginable a decade ago.” Prof Alex Rogers of Oxford University told the Guardian that international action and a global treaty must be brought in as soon as possible, before the current damage turns into a catastrophe. “The situation is very urgent. We need to bring our activities at sea to a sustainable level,” he said. “The status quo cannot be allowed to continue, if we want to preserve ocean health and have fish for tomorrow.” The threats to ocean life include not only climate change, acidification and overfishing, but the pollution, including plastics and agricultural chemicals that we pour into the sea, and our industrial exploitation of the seabed, for instance for oil and gas exploration and mining. These activities have been enabled by new technology, which is not taken into account in current sea governance, which dates back to the 16th century, according to Rogers. The governance of the high seas, which cover most of the oceans beyond national jurisdictions, had failed to keep up with this pace of change, he added: “These new activities can ramp up very quickly, and do tremendous damage in a very short time.”"
"A growing number of Australians are concerned about the impact of climate change, and more than half of a survey of 1,756 voters believe the Morrison government needs to stay in the Paris agreement, despite Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the US. A study tracking voter sentiment for more than a decade, funded first by the Climate Institute and now by the Australia Institute, finds 73% (up from 66% in 2017) of respondents concerned about climate change, and a clear majority, 68%, believes the government should set domestic targets to comply with our Paris commitments.  An increased 67% want coal-fired power to be phased out within 20 years, up from 61% in 2017. The findings suggest the Morrison government is politically vulnerable on climate change at the next federal election. The prime minister has declared Australia will not pull out of Paris but also abandoned the national energy guarantee that imposed an emissions reduction target on the electricity sector. The former prime minister Tony Abbott on Tuesday reignited his push to scrap subsidies for renewable energy, taking on the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, at his first meeting of the government’s backbench energy and environment committee. Another outspoken conservative, Craig Kelly, also asked how he was meant to respond to questions about the government’s commitment to staying in the Paris climate agreement when it was completely unclear how the Paris commitments would be met. With a drought crippling swathes of regional Australia, a majority of voters (67%) in the bush believe the government is not doing enough to prepare for or adapt to the impacts of global warming. This compares to 56% of capital city residents. There has also been a shift in the attitudes of people voting for the National party and for One Nation. While those voters are still more likely than others to think the impact of climate change is being exaggerated, the number of people agreeing with that statement has dropped to 20%, down from 32% in 2017, for Nationals voters, and to 22%, down from 28%, for One Nation voters. With the Bureau of Meteorology predicting that southern and south-eastern parts of the country could face an early summer heatwave after experiencing the 12th driest winter on record, public concern is escalating about heatwaves and water shortages. When asked about the specific impacts of climate change, the top three issues Australians expressed concern about were droughts (78%, up four points in a year), the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef (77%, up four points) and bushfires (76%, up five points). More than half the sample, 53%, think governments are not doing enough to deal with climate change threats – a perception reinforced by a decade of partisan warfare on the issue. On energy, 55% of the sample blame power companies for high electricity prices, with 52% pointing the finger at privatisation, 41% identifying poor policy making and 29% renewable energy sources. More than half the sample feels the government should invest in renewable energy generation and storage, with only 7% favouring government investment in coal, oil and gas. The sample is divided over who should pay the costs of climate action, with 38% saying big polluters, 21% saying taxpayers and 10% saying the people facing climate change impacts. Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said: “The public want lower power prices and action on climate change. “The good news is the economics of renewables means they can have both. The results of the research make clear any party that fails to address both price and emissions will be punished at the ballot box.” The former Liberal party leader and Australian National University professor John Hewson said the research indicated Australians were prepared to support “far more ambitious climate and energy policies than governments of either persuasion have delivered”."
"This summer it seemed as if our two cities had changed places. London was hot and dry while New York had days and days of rain. According to leading scientists, the heatwave in Europe over recent months was made twice as likely by climate change resulting from human activity. There is also growing evidence of the link between climate change and the frequency of major floods, as well as the severity of hurricanes.  It’s clear that what we think of now as freak weather in our cities is likely to become the new normal, and that climate change poses a huge threat to the futures of our children, and many generations to come. As mayors, we are not only committed to taking bold action to tackle climate change and to improve the lives of those we represent, but also to showing others the way. That’s why, ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit in California, we are calling on other cities to stand with us to divest their assets from fossil fuel companies. Today we are announcing a new global initiative for cities on divestment and sustainable investment. Working through the C40 Climate Leadership Group, London and New York will co-chair the Cities Divest/Invest forum, a global network for cities that will not only enable us to share tools, knowledge and experiences, but also to advocate for action on divestment and green investment. London and New York are two of the world’s most dynamic, innovative and forward-thinking cities, and we are determined to push ahead with the goals of the Paris agreement – stealing a march on many national governments. We know that tackling climate change requires action across the board – from how we run our transport networks to using cleaner energy and making our buildings more energy-efficient. But we must also use our economic might to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. We believe that ending institutional investment in companies that extract fossil fuels and contribute directly to climate change can help send a very powerful message that renewables and low-carbon options are the future. If we want to fund the scale of transformation the world needs, we must foster sustainable investment and use the power of institutional investors, such as pension funds. That’s why – in both London and New York – we are taking all possible steps to divest our city pension funds from fossil fuels. Already, less than 2% of the London Pension Fund Authority’s investments of £5.5bn ($7.1bn) are in extractive fossil fuels – this year, the authority has rid itself of a further £700,000 of fossil fuel investments, including stakes in Shell and BP, and has plans in place to divest its remaining investments. In New York, divestment is under way, with the goal of total divestment within five years. This will mean removing some $5bn (£3.8bn) in investment from the industry. Both our cities are also investing in a sustainable future. London recently launched the £500m Mayor’s Energy Efficiency Fund, working with the European Regional Development Fund and private sector investors to help hospitals, museums, offices, libraries, social housing and universities to become greener and more energy efficient. New York City has increased its solar-energy capacity six-fold since 2013 and is investing $2.7bn in energy-efficiency projects that save New Yorkers money and cut emissions. City government now has more than 1,200 electric vehicles and 500 charging stations. Of course, we acknowledge that divestment and accelerating green investment is not always straightforward. The major portfolios held by public entities are typically pension funds, which aren’t generally under the control of mayors. But we can make progress if we work together with a range of partners – including pension funds, local authorities, campaign groups and the private sector. We believe we can demonstrate to the world that divestment is a powerful tool and a prudent use of resources. And that, together, our cities – New York, London and many others around the world – can send a clear message to the fossil fuel industry: change your ways now and join us in tackling climate change. Climate change knows no borders, and taking this kind of action now could help us make a crucial difference to the people we represent and the future of our planet. • Bill de Blasio is mayor of New York City and Sadiq Khan is mayor of London"
"French environment campaigners have warned Emmanuel Macron is doing too little to combat climate change and must radically rethink his environment policy if he is to honour his promise to “make this planet great again”. Renewed criticism of the centrist French president’s approach to green issues came as Macron replaced his former environment minister, the TV personality Nicolas Hulot, who quit last week saying the government was in thrall to powerful lobby groups and taking only “mini-steps” that were insufficient to deal with climate change. Macron replaced Hulot with the parliament speaker, François de Rugy, a former Green party figure who jumped ship to Macron’s party, La République En Marche, last year.  De Rugy was active in environmental politics for 25 years before opposing what he called a shift further left by the French Green party. He is described as a pragmatist and reformist who is loyal to Macron. But environmental groups immediately questioned whether De Rugy would be able to have an effect on the government’s approach to climate change, saying Macron must better defend biodiversity and address environmental threats.  Macron insists he has gone further on green issues than any other French government, but Jean-François Julliard, the director general of Greenpeace France, said it was clear “the environment is not a priority for Emmanuel Macron and [the prime minister] Édouard Philippe who just use it as window dressing without any real will to engage on environmental transition”. He said he feared De Rugy would simply be “his master’s voice” and added: “Macron must at last take measure of the huge responsibility on his shoulders.” Karima Delli, a Green member of the European parliament, said people wanted “a new pact for ecology”. Pascal Canfin, the head of the World Wildlife Fund in France, who was a development minister in the last leftwing government, said a 21st-century shift was needed on clean energy “but the state is still set up as if it’s the 20th – or even 19th – century”.  Although Macron did not make environmental issues a major part of his election manifesto last year, he later attempted to push them to the forefront as a symbol of progressive politics and to counter Donald Trump’s decision to take the US out of the Paris climate accord. Addressing the US Congress in April, Macron told American lawmakers: “There is no Planet B.” The first challenge for De Rugy will be addressing future energy plans for France, a country overwhelmingly dependent on nuclear energy. The government announced in November that France’s long-held goal of bringing its reliance on nuclear energy down to 50% by 2025 was not feasible and was likely to take a decade longer. Taking office, De Rugy said there was an “urgent” need to act on the environment. “I’m here to take action,” he said. In recent weeks, Macron’s approval ratings have dropped to the lowest since he came to power, as he faces slower economic growth, and struggles to shake off the label “president of the rich”. Over the summer, he faced the first major political scandal of his presidency when a senior security aide was filmed violently assaulting a young man and woman at the edge of a Paris demonstration. Also, it was reported on Tuesday that the surprise resignation of the popular sports minister and Olympic medallist, Laura Flessel, was linked to her tax situation. The French investigative website Mediapart reported that tax investigators had recently notified France’s tax infraction commission over suspicions she had under-reported her earnings."
"Emissions reduction targets, even relatively ambitious ones, will not drive up power prices for Australian consumers, according to new research from the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and the Brotherhood of St Laurence. While the Morrison government has abandoned the national energy guarantee because conservatives complain that emissions reduction policies drive up power prices, the new research finds that critique is misguided. Power prices for households would fall by 2030 under four different scenarios modelled by Frontier Economics – business as usual and emissions reduction targets of 26%, 45% and 65%. The research says the price reductions would vary state-by-state, but business as usual would result in an average saving of 18.5%. Under the 26% scenario – which is the government’s now abandoned electricity target – the average saving would be 20.8%; under the 45% scenario, which is Labor’s target, the average saving would be 18.3%; and under the 65% scenario, the average saving would be 15.0%. The savings are forecast by taking the residential retail price for 2030 for Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia, and creating an average. The modelling shows the benefits for households would increase if the government allowed emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries to be part of the emissions reduction effort, rather than excluding them, as was proposed under the now defunct Neg. The chief executive of Acoss, Cassandra Goldie, told Guardian Australia the Frontier modelling made it clear that a variety of emissions reduction policies – the Neg, a clean energy target or an emissions intensity scheme “with the right settings” – could drive more rapid emissions reductions in the electricity sector and contribute to lower power bills. “The idea that we need to choose between cheaper energy prices and limiting global warming is misleading and short-sighted, and does a huge disservice to our community, especially to people on low incomes,” Goldie said. “People on low incomes are the most vulnerable to both escalating electricity prices and the effects of global warming. We must tackle both. Both are a social justice issue.” The Neg, which would have imposed a 26% emissions reduction target on the electricity sector by 2030, has been shelved because the Coalition’s internal fight over emissions reduction got tangled up in the leadership war that resulted in Malcolm Turnbull being deposed and Scott Morrison taking over as leader. Since junking the Neg, the new energy minister, Angus Taylor, has recommitted the government to pursuing heavy-handed interventions in the energy market worked up in the last days of the Turnbull government, including “last resort” divestiture powers to break up power companies if they engage in price gouging, and default pricing for consumers. Taylor, who Morrison has dubbed the minister for lowering power prices, is also working up fresh options to take to cabinet. The Greens are calling on the Coalition and Labor to allow the existing renewable energy target to be extended for the life of the next parliament. The Greens climate change and energy spokesman, Adam Bandt, said rolling over the RET would allow “the renewables boom to continue while the climate and energy policy impasse is resolved after the next election”. Bandt said the big build of renewable energy coming into the national electricity market courtesy of the RET was playing a significant role in driving down power prices, but the scheme wound down from 2020, and there was no clear sense of how the current energy policy deadlock would be resolved. The latest renewable energy index compiled by Green Energy Markets has confirmed analysis by the Energy Security Board that wholesale electricity prices are on the way down because of an addition of 7,200 megawatts of extra large-scale supply from renewable energy. “Our preference is to increase and extend the RET until 2030, but an interim measure to 2022 is needed to avoid an investment freeze in renewable energy,” Bandt said. “If the RET isn’t extended, there’s a real risk that the next government will not be able to implement a new policy in time to avoid an investment drought.”"
"When the coastal town of Wrightsville Beach, which buffers nearby Wilmington from the open ocean, began to come back to life on Wednesday after Hurricane Florence hit North Carolina, many people returning home were surprisingly relieved. Despite Florence roaring ashore in this exact spot last Friday and now causing catastrophic flooding inland, the hurricane had not destroyed the beach, as many had expected.   That could be because the US army corps of engineers and the state and local government this winter spent more than $9m dumping sand onto the beach to build it up, in a precarious and controversial effort to hold back nature. The corps has done this every four years for more than 30 years – and is now approaching a spending cap for the project. Maintaining beaches this way, through what is called “renourishment”, will soon be more complicated than just finding funding, however. Sea levels will rise up to several feet by 2100, and tougher hurricanes are likely to form in a warmer ocean, whirling in and repeatedly beating against the coast. With Wrightsville Beach, the city of Wilmington and the wider Carolinas suffering one of the region’s worst storms of all time, expensive, human-bolstered beaches like this one won’t work, ultimately. That will be a problem, not just on the eastern seaboard, but everywhere with a beach. Rising oceans could also destroy two-thirds of southern California’s beaches by the end of the century, experts predict. Some scientists have begun to argue for a retreat from the shore, after relentless development, but are emphatically shot down, particularly after a disaster. On Wednesday, visiting the storm zone, Donald Trump was upbeat about recovery from the hurricane. But scientists are alarmed. “Within a decade or two or three, it depends on where you are, we’re looking for a time when beach nourishment doesn’t work, so what do we do next?” asked Orrin Pilkey, an emeritus geology professor and coastal expert at Duke University. “Nobody, I don’t think, is thinking about how, when sea level rises, beach nourishment will be out of the question, will be economically impossible.” The corps remakes beaches that are eroding from waves in an attempt to brace against major storms. It is hard to immediately determine how much sand survived after a storm. A beach can flatten out and look normal but have lost significant mass. The corps is assessing the damages, but the Wrightsville Beach town manager, Tim Owens, said the area was lucky the storm landed where it did and wasn’t more intense and that renourishment “did what it was supposed to do, kept the water from overwashing and taking over property and infrastructure”. While the replenished beach seemed to help, Owens said “all bets are off when you have a category 4 storm or 5 storm.” Florence landed as a category 1 but easily could have slammed into North Carolina with higher winds. Asked about Pilkey’s retreat proposal, however, Owens quickly interjected. “It won’t happen. It just won’t happen until it’s absolutely necessary … I won’t have to worry about it. It will be after my lifetime,” he said. Typically, the US government pays for 65% of storm protection projects on public beaches. In Wrightsville Beach, the state and the town together pay the other 35%, with the town using revenues from a tax on room rentals. Sometimes after a disaster, the federal government pays to make a beach whole again. Owens said Wrightsville Beach may inquire about a touch-up following the hurricane. Natalie English, the president of the Wilmington chamber of commerce, said the projects are a way of life on the coast, where tourism is a significant part of the economy. “I think there’s been a lot of claims that beaches have been obliterated in North Carolina, English said. “I think it’s best that people understand that’s not the case. We will have a strong robust tourism economy again. We will be right back where we were.” Erin Carey, the coastal coordinator for the North Carolina chapter of the environmental group the Sierra Club, lives about a mile and a half from Wrightsville Beach and was at headquarters in Raleigh earlier this week after evacuating. Carey said: “When people fall in love with a place like they do with Wrightsville Beach, it will take an act of God or nature – maybe not even that – to pull them away.” Because North Carolina has a law prohibiting more invasive seawalls, renourishment is seen as the main option for protecting development along the ocean. State lawmakers in 2012 also barred state agencies from considering long-term predictions of sea level rise.  North Carolina has about 320 miles of shoreline, with around half owned publicly and half privately, said Andrew Coburn, the associate director of the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina. Most developed coastline has been supplemented with extra sand in many states, he said. Coburn said the effectiveness is unproven.  “The bottom line is we just do not have any evidence that spending that much money nourishing shorelines is even close to worth it,” Coburn said.   If the government is always willing to step in and recreate a beach, people will keep buying and building in vulnerable places, he warned. “We are artificially changing shorelines and trying to make shorelines do what we want them to do,” Coburn said. “The problem is they’re going to do what they’re going to do.” David Cignotti, who was mayor of Wrightsville Beach until the end of 2013, said beach towns are stashing away money in case the federal government ever stops paying for restoration. “These beaches are used by people from all over the country … To me it’s worth it, ” he said. Cignotti, who acknowledges climate change, favors stronger federal restrictions on development. “It would be good to see our government not be one of only a couple in world that’s in denial this is happening,” Cignotti said."
"Scientists warn that human-induced climate change is responsible for an increase in the number and severity of storms – such as Hurricane Florence, which has engulfed the Carolinas in the last week. But many who weathered the tempest, deep in Trump country, don’t believe global warming fueled it and don’t think humans are the problem – or the solution.  As the world’s oceans warm at a faster rate, hurricanes become more likely, and there has been an increase in storms since the start of the 20th century. Experts warn more numerous and even more ferocious hurricanes are on the way, and the US government is not addressing the central issue even as America’s coasts get battered and inland areas inundated. But based on the evidence in North Carolina on Wednesday, the random man and woman in the street is still not convinced about the science – even those who have faced two major storms in two years. “We live on the coast. It’s cyclical,” said Bob Slattery. “We may get two or three in a year, then go four or five years with nothing,” he added. Slattery, 74, and his wife Gerda, 73, were sitting in the pretty downtown area of Fayetteville on Wednesday. The couple live six miles south-west of Fayetteville and weren’t hit too badly by the storm, but much of the city was, as the Cape Fear river reached record flood levels, spilling over its banks into neighborhoods and roads. While miles of North Carolina is inundated, downtown Fayettevillehad been fortunate enough to avoid flooding this week, although locals said a wine bar roof had partly caved in. “There’s a group of people that want to control things, and they’re using climate change to control things, and they want to put a tax on things,” Bob Slattery said. There is scant evidence for a shady group using the concept of climate change to control and tax society – but it appears there is wider support for the theory in these parts. “That’s our opinion,” Gerda Slattery said. “And many other people I speak to think that, too,” Bob Slattery said. Florence hit North Carolina just two years after Hurricane Matthew blew through the state. Matthew set a slew of unwanted flooding records in October 2016 and at the time was described as a “once in a 500 year event”. But just 23 months later, Florence has shattered that prediction, surpassing Matthew’s flooding totals and in many places having a worse impact. Despite the proximity of the storms, and expert views, some believe the science is overblown and it’s no more than natural global rhythms. “It comes down to cyclical climate change,” said Matthew Coe. “I don’t think we play as big a factor in climate change as people say we do – when you think of the fact that the sea level rises naturally anyways.” Coe 37, originally from Florida, is studying for an associate’s degree, alongside working at a downtown Fayetteville cafe. He lost power for three days after Florence roared in. “Mother Nature is its own entity,” he said. “Whatever happens, it’ll fix itself eventually.” He pointed out that there had been fluctuations in the Earth’s temperature before, and predicted there could be another “ice age” which would correct the current trajectory of the climate. “I think everything is hyped up a bit,” he said. In his opinion, there are “scientists on both sides” of the climate change argument. There is actually a 97% expert consensus among climate scientists that humans are responsible for global warming, although Coe and the Slatterys are far from alone in their beliefs: a 2016 Pew Research Center study found that 51% of Americans do not believe global climate change is due to human activity. Donald Trump is among the 51% – or at least was in 2015. That year he wrote in his book Crippled America that climate change was not human-caused, although he did not explain the reasoning behind his belief. During the 2016 presidential election, he called it a Chinese hoax. On Wednesday he was in North Carolina and South Carolina, promising “100% support” to displaced residents and those with flooded neighborhoods and power outages, but not mentioning measures to deal with climate change, different impacts on rich and poor, or coastal over-development. Further along Hay Street, the thoroughfare through downtown Fayetteville, the retired air force member Andre Altman was sitting in the Huske Hardware House bar. “Ask Mother Nature,” said Altman, 57. He echoed Coe’s belief that Earth’s capricious matriarch could be responsible for climate change and the ensuing increase in the number and force of storms. “Really the Earth goes through cycles. So it’s just we’re on that particular cycle where we’re grabbing more storms,” Altman said. “Back in the industrial age we were burning coal and it didn’t get hotter then.” Despite his belief that climate change was mostly a natural phenomenon, Altman accepted some of the science that said man was also to blame. He recycles, he said, but believes his own actions are likely to have little impact. “I try to worry about what I can affect. If I could actually do something about it, I would,” Altman said. “But I’m not in politics.”"

"Scott Morrison is continuing to insist that Australia will meet its Paris climate commitments “in a canter” despite the government having no emissions reduction policies to achieve that result. The prime minister used a radio interview on Wednesday afternoon to declare “the business-as-usual model gets us there in a canter” – which contradicts advice from the Energy Security Board that says business as usual will mean the electricity sector will “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”.  Even if the the ESB projections are wrong, and the electricity sector managed to reduce emissions by 26% with no policy to drive that result, the Paris target applies across the economy, not just to the electricity sector, and the government’s own data shows emissions in other sectors of the economy are rising. Morrison told 2GB on Wednesday that business as usual “and technology and the amount of renewable technologies that are already in the system and not being subsidised off into the future means these [Paris] targets are hit”. A summary of modelling undertaken by the ESB and released only a month ago said if no policy was put in place in the electricity sector – which is the business-as-usual case the prime minister refers to – emissions would fall initially, then flatten out and rise towards the end of the decade to 2030 as forecast demand increased, then dip again in 2029-30. The ESB said if the national energy guarantee wasn’t implemented, the national electricity market would “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”. On Wednesday the prime minister initially said that the renewable energy target was driving up power prices “and that’s why we are stripping [subsidies] out of the system”, then said later in the same interview that the biggest driver of higher power prices was gold-plating of the electricity networks. Asked by his host on 2GB what was ultimately more important, complying with Australia’s international climate obligations, or lowering power prices, Morrison said: “Power prices.” He counselled against being “distracted by ideological debate”. The ESB has warned that if governments fail to implement the national energy guarantee – the policy Malcolm Turnbull shelved to try and stave off the civil war that ultimately cost him the prime ministership – that will “prolong the current investment uncertainty, and deny customers more affordable energy”. The Neg appears dead, but the government signalled it was interested in trying to implement one component of the policy, the reliability obligation, with the states and territories. The commonwealth was due to meet with the states and territories in late September to drive the process forward, but the states have yet to be summoned to a meeting to consider what, if any, progress can be made. The new energy minister, Angus Taylor, is working up a package to take to cabinet for consideration. With internal sensitivities still raw after the implosion of the last parliamentary fortnight, Morrison has been trying to send a signal that the immediate focus is price relief, while resisting calls from conservatives to withdraw from the Paris agreement. In attempt to defuse the push, Morrison has been arguing that meeting the Paris commitments will have no tangible impact on power prices."

"The president of the National Farmers’ Federation, Fiona Simson, has declared that climate change is making drought worse in Australia and says tiptoeing around the subject does not do regional communities any good. “It is the effect of climate change we need to be aware of that makes the impacts of a drought even worse,” she told the National Press Club. “As a community, we want to talk about it and the more discussions we have about and the more open people are in talking about it, then the less uncomfortable it becomes. “But we absolutely have to talk about it and some of the issues that people tiptoe around because they’re worried about offending people or having a discussion about it, then it doesn’t do us any good as a community.” Simson, a farmer on the Liverpool Plains, described agriculture as a diverse industry and she was highly critical of much of the current media drought coverage of the broken farmer dependent on handouts. “I use those words “managing drought” deliberately because managing the drought is exactly what we are doing,” she said. “Many farmers, including me, take offence to the betrayals of the broken-down, handout dependent farmer profile peddled by many members of the media. That simply is not us.” She was critical of the government for allowing regional communities to cope with drought in the absence of a “comprehensive national framework to deal with drought”. “Successive governments have had a go, but we are still without certainty that a national strategy would actually provide. In fact, agriculture in its entirety is to date without a whole-of-government national strategy for plan at all.” In another significant shift in the NFF, Simson also described Indigenous Australians as Australia’s “first farmers” in both her opening acknowledgement of country and her address. “May I acknowledge Australia’s first farmers, in particular the Ngunnawal people on whose land we meet today,” she said. “I pay my respects to elders past and and acknowledge their historic and continuing role in what is a great story of Australian agriculture.” “Drought is not a new phenomenon for farmers. Since farming first started under the auspices of our First Australians, drought has been a part of the landscape and a regular part of the farm business cycle.” Climate change has been a vexed topic for the farm lobby for the past two decades. In 2007, when then prime minister John Howard and Labor opposition leader Kevin Rudd both agreed on action, the NFF said climate change might be the “greatest threat” confronting farmers and their ability to put food on Australian table and the lobby group backed an emissions trading scheme. After Malcolm Turnbull’s first leadership spill in 2009 over emissions policies which saw Tony Abbott win the Liberal leadership, bipartisanship on climate change ended and the NFF went quiet until Simson took the presidency. In 2017, she recognised that climate change posed a significant challenge for Australian farmers and called for cost-efficient emissions reductions. As parts of Australia slide into their seventh year of drought and media coverage places increasing pressure on politicians, Simson’s address was the NFF’s most forthright message on climate change yet to government. It comes less than two weeks after Coalition’s latest energy policy, the National Energy Guarantee, preceded the leadership coup against Malcolm Turnbull. Simson said while every drought was different, this season was the worst on her farm since 1965 and had “taken many experienced and savvy farmers by surprise”. “We are at the front line of climate change, increasingly erratic seasons, out-of-season rainfall or no rainfall at all and longer, hotter summers.” But Simson also pushed back against the suggestion that reducing emissions required culling huge livestock numbers – a suggestion covered in major newspapers that she described as “totally histrionic”. “I’m sure there are those out there reading that thinking it’s true when you have the peak red meat body (Meat and Livestock Australia) forecasting zero [emissions] by 2030 and a huge drop between 2005 and 15 on current modelling, so I think for me it is about having a conversation as a community,” she said"
"Australia’s commitment to global development has improved over the past year, driven by strong trade, education and finance outreach to the developing world, but it has been criticised for its poor action on the environment and climate change. The Centre for Global Development annually ranks 27 wealthy countries on their commitment to development across the policy areas of aid, finance, technology, environment, trade, security and migration.  The Commitment to Development Index is dominated by Scandinavian countries – which fill the top three spots – and European countries, which complete the top 12. The world’s biggest economy, the US, is at number 23 on the list: it has the worst aid and finance ranking of the assessed countries. Australia trails New Zealand (13th), in 14th position overall, with a jump of four spots on last year. Australia and New Zealand are the highest ranked non-European nations on the index. Report author, Ian Mitchell, said: “Australia’s trade policies are among the most development-friendly and the foreign aid it gives is high quality. But if Australia wants to become a development leader, it needs to increase the quantity of aid, and tackle environmental issues and focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” The report said that, on the environment, Australia was a laggard. “Its low rank is largely due to its poor performance curbing climate change. It has very low gasoline taxes (only the United States and Canada have lower), high fossil fuel production and the highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita of all [index] countries, although it has also had among the steepest emissions reductions over the past 10 years. “Australia is also the third-largest tropical timber importer.” Australia has a strong trade rating in the index, ranking third of all countries on that policy, with low tariffs and agricultural subsidies. “It’s a leader in providing equal access to goods from development countries … its barriers to trade in services are also low,” the report said. It also ranks well on migration “in part because of its exceptionally open borders for students from developing countries”. “Its integration policies are also above average. But Australia could improve the number of refugees and asylum seekers it accepts. The proportion of positive asylum decisions is below average and has fallen for the past three years. The number of refugees in Australia is below average relative to population and relative to land area.” The report also said Australia’s treatment of migrants would be improved by ratifying the convention on the treatment of migrant workers and the migration for employment convention. Australia has dedicated just 0.23% of its gross national income towards development assistance, a decrease on 2016, and its smallest contribution in 15 years. Australia’s aid contribution has been falling for half a decade. The UN set out the 0.7% commitment to development spending in 1970, and it has been consistently reaffirmed as a benchmark since. But few countries meet it. “[Australia’s] foreign aid is of good quality, however,” the report found. “Australia spends 70% of its aid bilaterally and 30% multilaterally.” Mitchell told Guardian Australia that the dominance of Scandinavian and European countries was a product of historical commitment, community expectation and conscious government policy. “When you talk to the officials in these countries, they take it competitively, it’s something that has a profile in the public arena, it’s a matter of pride in their public policy.” He said the 0.7% of GNI target for aid spending – when compared with Nato’s declared 2% goal for defence budgets – was a sensible and achievable target. “I think if all the countries got there, the acceleration of development would be substantial, and we’d live in a much more prosperous world, and that would be to the benefit of everybody and every country’s national interest.” But Mitchell said the current global uncertainty – the retreat to economic isolationism through tariffs and trade wars, and the rise of populist nationalism – was a threat to the progress and prosperity of developing countries. “I think the move against migation, against open trade, will damage development. We’ve had a remarkable period of development over the last half a century, with open trade, rising aid levels. And I think that’s in real danger.” The president of the Centre for Global Development, Masood Ahmed, said: “Good development policy is about much more than foreign aid. “While aid is important, policymakers in rich countries need to assess all the ways their choices, from the environment to trade to migration, help or hinder developing countries.”"
"The funds committed to fossil fuel divestment now total more than $6tn (£4.6tn), with almost 1,000 institutional investors having made the pledge, according to a new report. The sell-off of coal, oil and gas investments is led by the insurance industry, with $3tn of funds. But it also now includes the first nation to divest, Ireland, major cities including New York and key medical organisations. Major oil companies such as Shell have this year cited divestment as a material risk to its business.  Fossil fuel divestment began on US university campuses in 2011 but now spans 37 nations around the world. Supporters of divestment say existing fossil fuel resources are already far greater than can be burned without causing catastrophic climate change and that exploring for and producing more fossil fuels is therefore morally wrong. They also say fossil fuel companies are risky investments as global action on emissions gets tougher. Some investors argue that remaining as shareholders and persuading fossil fuel companies to change can be more effective. However, another new report finds this approach has not delivered any significant change to date. The new divestment report, by Arabella Advisors, calculates that investors with $6.2tn in assets under management have committed to divest from fossil fuels, up from $5.2tn in the previous report in 2016. “I commend the divestment movement for its incredible progress,” said Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner on human rights and former president of Ireland. Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, and Sadiq Khan, mayor of London, which is in the process of divesting, said in a joint article for the Guardian: “We must use our economic might to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Taking this kind of action now could help us make a crucial difference to the people we represent and the future of our planet. Jeremy Grantham, co-founder of GMO, one of the world’s most influential asset management companies, said the financial case for divestment was compelling. “Investors with long-term horizons should avoid oil stocks on investment grounds. They face a sustained headwind. Ethical arguments for divestments are simply not necessary. They are a pure bonus,” he said. Another new report, from Genus Capital Management in Canada, said its fossil free fund had outperformed a benchmark of standard stock market indices by almost 2% per year over the last five years. The company’s Fossil Free CanGlobe Equity Fund is a mix of Canadian and global stocks. “At the five-year mark, we can conclusively say: divesting from fossil fuels pays,” said CEO Wayne Wachell. The Arabella Advisors report noted that the American Medical Association (AMA) and the UK’s Royal College of General Practitioners had both divested. “It is unwise to own fossil fuels companies long-term and the products of these companies are harmful to human health by producing dangerous air pollution and contributing to global climate change,” said Dr Todd Sack at the AMA. Divestment appears to be concerning oil and gas majors. In Shell’s last annual report it states: “It could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access equity capital markets.” Furthermore, the World Bank Group has committed to stopping funding oil and gas development and major insurers including Swiss Re have decided to stop underwriting coal projects. The report on investor engagement on with fossil fuel companies, from shareholder advocacy group As You Sow, found that 160 climate change shareholder resolutions were filed at 24 US oil and gas companies between 2012 and 2018. However, none of the companies have adopted plans or targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and most are investing to maintain or expand production. “The oil and gas sector has not stepped up to address the growing risks to their companies, the broader economy, and our planet,” said Andrew Behar, As You Sow CEO. The call for ethical investment was backed by Pope Francis in June 2018, when he addressed the heads of oil companies. He said “disturbing and a cause for real concern” that carbon emissions were still rising and added: “Even more worrying is the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves, whereas the Paris agreement clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground.” Ellen Dorsey, at the philanthropic Wallace Global Fund, said the pressure to divest would continue. “Today, our movement pledges to increase divested global assets to $10tn by 2020.” She said investing in clean energy was as important as pulling funds from polluting firms: “Investors should also commit at least 5% of their portfolio to climate solutions to help rapidly scale to 100% renewable energy and universal energy access.” Robinson backed the clean investment call: “This is what climate justice requires.”"
"Senior figures representing US states, cities and businesses rebelling against Donald Trump’s denial of climate change are swarming San Francisco this week to proclaim their own efforts to meet US commitments to cut greenhouse gases. The two-day Global Climate Action Summit beginning Thursday will also feature diplomats and mayors from around the world. As well, chief executives of Fortune 500 companies and celebrities ranging from actor Harrison Ford to primatologist Jane Goodall all plan to be there.  Local governments and corporations will announce new goals to boost renewable energy and run more sustainably. America’s Pledge – a group led by California Governor Jerry Brown and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg – will unveil how close the US could come to the climate pollution reductions the Obama administration promised the world in Paris in 2015. Trump pulled out of that accord shortly after he became president in 2017. International climate policy negotiators and environmental advocates will be watching for measurable commitments and for climate-friendly political leaders, especially Brown, to do more than they have in the past, said Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International. In a little over a year, the US has seen an uptick in devastating hurricanes, record-breaking wildfires and summer heat waves that are likely to become the new normal. “The goal posts have changed. What used to be seen as leadership and was good enough then is just not adequate now,” Morgan said. “What was seen as radical should be common sense. The bar has been lifted.” The world is not on track to prevent catastrophic warming, to keep temperatures from increasing more than 2C (3.6F), Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the United Nations framework convention on climate change, said earlier this month. The US vowed to cut its own greenhouse gas levels by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 – but is not on a trajectory to fulfill that promise. At best, the country could make it to 23%, according to an analysis by the economic data firm Rhodium Group. At worst, it might curb emissions only 11%. Those numbers are based on current policies, depending on how much carbon dioxide forests can absorb and on energy prices and the state of the economy. The Trump administration’s rollbacks, including of plans to limit pollution from coal plants and cars, are equal to forfeiting about 1% of reductions, said John Larsen, a director at Rhodium. The reversals could have a bigger stalling effect over time. Most US progress is happening in electricity, which makes up less than one-third of the country’s climate pollution. And that progress could halt in 2030 if nuclear plants shut down and are replaced with natural gas power, according to Rhodium. With the White House absent on climate change, activists say the work of states and cities becomes more critical than ever. “We’re starting to reach a point where there’s widespread realization that the non-federal actors can take us a good part of the way,” said Andrew Light, a climate negotiator under Obama who is now with the World Resources Institute. But, “they can only take us so far unless they’re able to scale up action.” Light said the summit could offer an opportunity for international experts and investors to offer help to US climate advocates. Amir Jina, a post-doctoral scholar at the Climate Impact Lab collaborative group and professor at the University of Chicago, said the last year and a half in the US has been a harbinger for the future of climate change. Hurricanes are likely to become more intense, rapid sea-level rise will exacerbate dangerous storm surge, some regions will see record rainfall, and others will struggle with drought. The world can pay far less now to limit those effects or far more later to adapt to them, Jina said. As temperatures rise, impacts will become more severe, and they will be uneven across the US, Jina and his colleagues’ research shows. Climate change on its current path will be a drag on the economy, slowing gross domestic product 4% or 5% annually, Jina said. If the world limited warming to 2C , as the Paris agreement intends, that number would be closer to 0.5% or 1.5%. “It might seem like a small amount, this is 4% of your income, but because we see this unequal impact, it’s important to think of not what the overall effect is but who is being affected,” Jina said. In some parts of the US, climate change could decrease GDP 20% to 25% below where it would be without the effects of climate change, Jina warned. California, on the front lines of climate change with wildfires, mudslides and a warming, rising ocean, has been a leader in the US environmental movement, but activists are pressuring Brown to do more, such as phase out oil and gas drilling. “The progress that we’ve made in California on renewables is exciting and it’s also nowhere close to enough,” said Miya Yoshitani, executive director at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.  At the same time, even if the Paris agreement is successful, many countries will suffer. The Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles, for example, which is reliant on tourism, is already facing drought, changes in fisheries, dying coral reefs and eroding beaches. “It’s possible island states become economically unviable before they are covered by the ocean,” Ronald Jumeau, ambassador to the UN for the Seychelles, said."
"Rising global temperatures mean pests will devour far more of the world’s crops, according to the first global analysis of the subject, even if climate change is restricted to the international target of 2C. Increasing heat boosts both the number and appetite of insects, and researchers project they will destroy almost 50% more wheat than they do today with a 2C rise, and 30% more maize. Rice, the third key staple, is less affected as it is grown in the tropics, which are already near the optimal temperature for insects – although bugs will still eat 20% more. Rising heat stress on crops is already expected to cut cereal yields by about 10% for 2C of warming, but the new research indicates rising pest damage will cause at least another 4-8% to be lost. With 800 million people chronically hungry today and the global population rising towards 10bn, increasing pest destruction will worsen food security. “For many, many people in the world there is already a shortage of food, so it is not like we can afford to spare [more],” said Prof Curtis Deutsch at the University of Washington, US, who led the work. “A lot of people in the world, the most vulnerable, can’t afford to give up anything.” The UK is the worst affected of significant wheat producers, with pest losses expected to more than double from 5% to 11%, and Canada will suffer the biggest increase in maize losses, from 6% to 10%. The world’s biggest growers will also see a major impact, with China’s wheat losses rising 50% and and US corn losses going up by a third. The losses are likely to be underestimates as the scientists did not consider factors such as increased transmission of crop diseases carried by insects, or losses after harvest when the grain is stored. The research also did not assess the risk of population explosions of insects that can wipe out crops, due to the complexity of such events. Action by farmers to try to avoid new pest losses is unlikely to be successful, said Prof Rosamond Naylor at Stanford University, US, and one of the research team. “Increased pesticide applications, the use of [resistant] genetically modified crops and practices such as crop rotations will help control losses from insects. But it still appears that under virtually all climate change scenarios, pest populations will be the winners.” The research, published in the journal Science, started with well-established knowledge about how rising temperature affects insects. “Warmer temperatures increase insect metabolic rates exponentially [and] increase the reproductive rates,” said Deutsch. “You have more insects, and they’re eating more.” The team then added data on today’s pest losses and used a range of climate change models to estimate future losses – all showed significant damage. Overall, losses were found to increase by 20-50% for 2C of warming above pre-industrial levels and 40%-100% for 4C. The latter will be reached this century if carbon emissions are not cut soon. “The overall picture is, if you’re growing a lot of food in a temperate region, you’re going to be hit hardest,” said Scott Merrill at the University of Vermont, another member of the team. Europe’s breadbasket is among the hardest hit, with 11 nations predicted to see a rise in pest losses of 75% or more. “France will get a double whammy,” said Merrill, as it is a top five producer of both wheat and maize. Another big wheat producer, Russia, will see losses rise from 10% to 16% with 2C of warming. Across the globe, an extra 200m tonnes of grain are expected to be eaten by insects in a 2C warmer world. The research was deliberately conservative and so did not allow population explosions of pests to take place in the computer simulations, as it’s difficult to model how these develop, but such explosions cannot be ruled out. Deutsch noted that warmer winters have led the pine bark beetle to kill off forests across North America: “They just come out gangbusters in the spring. You can see the damage to space.” “It is an example of what can happen when you have huge tracts of land that are essentially single crops species with one major pest,” he said. “That is similar in many respects to what agriculture has produced – miles and miles of a single plant.” He also said insect population explosions are seen in fossils from warming periods in the Earth’s past. Markus Riegler, at Western Sydney University in Australia and not part of the research team, said the new work was the first global analysis. “The results show that insects will cause significantly increased grain loss across many regions of a warmer world,” he said. The work used data on 38 insect species but Riegler said the results should be verified for more pests in future. “The substantial increases in pest damage forecast call for action on climate change [emissions] and adaptation,” he said. “Everyone must be involved in change: farmers, industries, policymakers and wider society.”"
"With record-breaking wildfires carving up the American west this summer, firefighters have become the rarest of civil servants: the kind almost universally lauded as heroes. Reinforcements dropped into California’s firefight from as far away as Australia and American Samoa to bolster strained state and federal crews, reaching a high point of 14,000 firefighters on the ground. Yet other crews have pulled into the fires’ path with a less grandiose purpose: to save only select addresses. These are the private firefighters of the rich or otherwise well-insured: private crews hired by insurance companies to minimize damages and keep policyholders’ homes from going up in smoke.  “This year to date has been busier than any prior years to date,” David Torgerson, the president of the firefighting company Wildfire Defense Systems in Bozeman, Montana, told the Guardian in an email, “and we are expecting to respond to [more] wildfires this year than any prior year.” This year’s wildfire season has produced the largest burn in California’s history and, in the northern part of the state, an awe-inspiring “firenado”. As scientists say that “megafires” are the new normal, climate change capitalism is finding an increasing number of customers. This echoes a global trend: cottage industries have sprung up to serve those who can afford to be a bit more protected and comfortable while the weather grows more cataclysmic. The uber-wealthy have bought estates in New Zealand (to the point that the country is in the midst of passing legislation to stymie foreign buyers) and luxe underground bunkers in Kansas and elsewhere to escape civic or natural collapse. In western states, the wildfire-evacuated masses have huddled in Best Westerns or on gymnasium floors and are often locked in insurance-claim limbo, while the affluent check into five-star luxury hotels – usually reimbursable by their insurance – confident that their homes are being looked after. Ronald DeKoven is a New York attorney, English barrister, and a tech entrepreneur, regularly flying to London or Singapore, where his startup MyLawyer is headquartered. In 2011, he and his wife, Linda, bought an estate with three guesthouses in the center of a 30-acre Napa Valley vineyard. It was meant as a second home, but after falling in love with wine country, the couple moved in permanently. Last year, one of his workers texted to report that a blaze, which would eventually become the catastrophic wine country fire, had started just down the road. Within minutes of the text, he and Linda sped away to a friend’s. “We put our shoes on and grabbed coats and left,” he says. “We probably were the first to leave this area. Given that I’ve practiced law for 50 years, you might say I’m cautious.” An insurance crew showed up to remove any combustibles around the house and spray fire retardant around the property’s edges. Meanwhile, the DeKovens checked in at the tony Clift Hotel in San Francisco. Their insurance company, Pure, explained over the phone to the couple that the company would prepay the hotel bills. After a night at the Clift, the DeKovens moved to Four Seasons hotels in Silicon Valley and then San Francisco for three weeks. “Needless to say the bills were high,” DeKoven says. “It was just paid through Pure.” While many other evacuees were locked in months of bureaucracy with insurance carriers, the DeKovens sailed through the recovery process. When they returned to their stone-and-stucco estate – which escaped the fire – Pure had already filtered the air to get rid of the heavy smoke smell. Pure sent out a team to test for carcinogenic dust in the house, detecting some in the main house’s attic. DeKoven hired their general contractor to vacuum the dust in hazmat suits and replace the insulation – a nearly $50,000 job that Pure prepaid with a check in the mail. “I found it astonishing they would be so focused on our best interest,” DeKoven said. Insurance is a suddenly sexy conversation topic in California, and DeKoven has been handing out his adjusters’ name like some others pass around the name of their skilled masseuse. AIG, the publicly traded insurance carrier, rolled out pre-emptive wildfire protection in 2005 to their Private Client Group, which the company says serves 40% of the Forbes 400 richest Americans. They were followed by competitors in so-called high net-worth insurance – Chubb, Pure and Nationwide Private Client, the types of companies who also typically offer insurance for such rarefied concerns as yachts and employment claims made by domestic help. Such coverage tends to keep out the hoi polloi, costing from thousands to tens of thousands or even six figures in annual premiums. Pure typically offers insurance to homes valued at more than $1m. Insurance crews don’t battle back flames like the government-contracted ones do. Their services happen before and after a fire passes. Generally, when a policy is purchased, a risk assessor surveys the property for fire risks. Clients of some plans receive texts about evacuations and the paths fires are taking. When fires are encroaching, crews stop by to cart away flammable objects or brush from around the house that could catch fire from an ember, and sometimes install temporary sprinklers. They might spray flame retardant around a property’s perimeter, and seal vents to keep out drifting embers and smoke. In more dangerous spots, they might spray a house down with fire-retardant gel and even extinguish a spot fire. To argue against this two-tiered response is to argue against capitalism itself, suggest industry insiders. “Insurance is a capitalist system, by and large, with for-profit companies,” said Amy Bach, the executive director of United Policyholders, a not-for-profit that educates insurance consumers. “So they’re always going to try to compete with each other and offer enhanced value to their higher-end customers who will pay the higher prices.” Yet Bach added a note of regret, saying she would prefer wildfire fighting “not being a class system, where first class gets a full meal, and in coach you get peanuts”. The high-end insurers market to the exceptionalism of their clients – “families who have more to protect,” as Pure’s website reads. Chubb’s site features a 72-year-old named Gerry in Ventura, California, who escaped the Thomas Fire last year, and contrasts his story with the relative misfortune of his neighbors: “Not only was Gerry treated first class every step of the way, as Chubb clients, he says he and his wife were the only two in their development able to rebuild.” Still, insurance-dispatched crews are now trickling down to companies with more middle-class clientele. For instance, for the past two years, USAA, a kind of insurance exchange for members of the military and their families, has offered the service to 1.4m properties in western states. USAA has no home value requirement; they’ll send firefighters out to your “modest cabin”, said a representative. The head of one privately held firefighting company, Wildfire Defense Systems of Bozeman, Montana, argued against charges of elitism. Its president, David Torgerson, said that 90% of the policyholders’ homes are the average local market price, and that despite the exclusive image of private firefighting, the service is also offered by several mainstream insurers. He also said that private firefighting can redound to the public good, as more resources on the ground “contributes to the overall effort”. Crews could theoretically pitch in when called upon by incident command. Even so, when a fire hits, insurance firefighting crews are “treated like civilians, basically”, said Scott McLean, a spokesman for CalFire, the California firefighting agency. They must get permission from the incident command to proceed into evacuation zones or pass roadblocks, and must leave if ordered to. Private crews do not play a role in the official fire response, he wrote in an email: “It is just another external situation that [incident command] has to deal with.” Eliza Kerr has lived on the edge of Yosemite national park for two decades, rock-climbing and leading yoga and backpacking retreats through her not-for-profit, Balanced Rock, when not treating clients with ayurvedic medicine. She’s aware that her love of California’s natural grandeur puts her squarely in the fire zone. Still, she’s betting on the long term. “Yosemite’s been my home for a long time,” she says. “It’s part of the vision.” In fact, she has decided to increase her ties to the area, and is making good on her dream to build a retreat guest residence and a yoga studio amid the scrubby brush overlooking the Merced river. The buildings were in mid-construction when the Ferguson fire evacuation order hit in mid-July. Kerr was away on a surfing trip in Indonesia at the time, but Chubb’s firefighting crew sprayed retardant around the property’s edge, sealed attic vents, and soaked the all-wood deck with water. They called her husband, who was still in California, with daily updates. Though these measures lent her peace of mind, Kerr ultimately thanks official state crews for saving her property. “I want to give huge credit and kudos to the local firefighters,” she said. As she heard it, they intentionally burned off vegetation up to her property line, stopping the incoming fire in its tracks. Her dream of a yoga retreat in the middle of wildfire country is safe – for now."

"The Trump administration moved closer on Tuesday to rolling back Obama-era rules reducing oil and gas industry leaks of methane gas. Methane is one of the most potent agents of climate change. As the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formally released its proposed substitute for a 2016 Obama administration rule that aimed to step up detection and elimination of methane leaks at well sites and other oil and gas facilities, it conceded the move “may … degrade air quality and adversely affect health and welfare”. The move is part of a broad Trump administration effort to undo former president Barack Obama’s legacy programs to fight climate change by cutting emissions from oil, gas and coal. The EPA conceded that relaxing the Obama-era rule for methane leaks at oil and gas sites would put another 380,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere by 2025. The amount is roughly equivalent to more than 30m tons of carbon dioxide, another fossil-fuel emission that receives far more attention in efforts to slow climate change. Relaxing federal oversight will save $75m in regulatory costs annually, the agency said. Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, a Colorado-based group that represents more than 300 companies, said the proposed changes would make the EPA rule more efficient and workable. The previous rule was “full of red tape”, Sgamma said in an interview. “This rule cleans that up, makes it more practical.” Oil and gas drillers have “a four decade-long trend to reduce emissions”, and the new EPA rules recognize that reality, Sgamma said, adding that she hopes a Department of the Interior rule to be finalized in coming days will show a similar practical streak. The pending rule by the Bureau of Land Management applies to fracking sites on public lands. Environmentalists contend energy companies have already demonstrated they can comply with tougher monitoring and that only poorly operated companies were having trouble with the new requirements. “Once again, the Trump administration is putting the interests of the worst-operated oil and gas companies ahead of the health and welfare of everyday Americans,” said Matt Watson, an associate vice-president at the Environmental Defense Fund. On Tuesday, California governor Jerry Browntold a meeting in San Francisco ahead of a climate conference there that Donald Trump’s proposal to increase methane releases is “insane” and “borders on criminality”. “It perhaps is the most obvious and dangerous and irresponsible action by Mr Trump and that’s saying quite a lot,” Brown said. The EPA under Obama completed the existing rule in May 2016 and it took effect that August. Competing court challenges from the oil and gas industry and environmental groups, and EPA moves to freeze part of the Obama rule, have mired implementation. Tuesday’s action opens a 60-day period for public comment ahead of any final decision by the Trump administration."

"In America today, it’s rare to see political leaders respond to a threat with an appropriate evidence-based policy solution. At the national level, more often we see actions that aggravate existing problems or create new ones. California – the country’s most populous and economically powerful state – has been a welcome exception. California has been battered by extreme weather intensified by climate change. From 2012 to 2016 the state was scorched by its worst drought in over a millennium. Weather whiplash struck in 2017, when much of the state broke precipitation records. This combination led to devastating mudslides and created the conditions for the most destructive and costly wildfire season on record in 2017, followed by the state’s largest-ever wildfire in 2018, which broke the previous record (set in 2017) by more than 60%.  All of these impacts have been exacerbated by global warming. The past five years have been California’s five hottest on record. And so, the state’s leaders decided to do something about it. California had already set a renewable portfolio standard in 2002, strengthened by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 2008 executive order requiring that 33% of electricity be generated by renewable sources by 2020. Governor Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill (SB) 350 in 2015, expanding the requirement to 50% renewables by 2030.  Last week, California state lawmakers passed State Senator (and candidate for US Senate) Kevin de León’s SB 100, which amps up the target to 50% renewables by 2026, 60% by 2030, and 100% from “renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources” by 2045. The more aggressive clean energy targets are justified. Not only does California need to make up some of the climate slack created by the Trump administration, but the state is now ahead of its targets, with 29% of electricity last year generated from renewables and over 50% from zero-carbon sources (including nuclear and hydroelectric power). According to the latest California Climate Change Assessment Report, global warming impacts will continue to batter the state: Kevin de León specifically cited the record-breaking wildfires as a key factor in generating the votes to pass SB 100, which had been under debate for nearly two years.  ""Our state is one big tinderbox,"" says @kdeleon in closing on #SB100. ""Wildfires are not longer seasonal."" @HunterCutting, in case you're still wondering whether #cawildfires affect #SB100 debate. Similarly, with its air badly polluted by smoke from wildfires, the Spokane, Washington City Council approved an ordinance setting a goal to get 100% renewable electricity by 2030. And after being struck by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, an increasing number of Houston-area residents accept human-caused global warming (64%) and are concerned about its impacts (52%). It’s hard to deny the reality and adverse impacts of human-caused climate change when they’re hitting people at home. California has long been a leader in climate solutions. The state is home to nearly half of all electric vehicles in the country (over 350,000), with by far the highest per-capita EV ownership of any state. California uses the least electricity per capita of any state, has a carbon cap and trade system, and a thriving economy. California is also leading the way in fighting the Trump administration’s backwards climate policy rollback. Next week, the state will even host a Global Climate Action Summit.  Unfortunately, a new study found that while local climate action like California’s is important, it’s insufficient to make up for the Trump administration’s inaction. To achieve the needed cuts in carbon pollution, federal policy is needed. That means replacing the current Republican leadership and its platform of climate denial with a Democratic leadership like California’s."
"United Nations secretary general António Guterres has warned that the world is facing “a direct existential threat” and must rapidly shift from dependence on fossil fuels by 2020 to prevent “runaway climate change”. Guterres called the crisis urgent and decried the lack of global leadership to address global warming.  “Climate change is moving faster than we are,” Guterres said on Monday. “We need to put the brake on deadly greenhouse gas emissions and drive climate action.” He said people everywhere are experiencing record-breaking temperatures and extreme heatwaves, wildfires, storms and floods “are leaving a trail of death and devastation”. As examples, Guterres pointed to Kerala, India’s worst monsoon flooding in recent history, almost 3,000 deaths from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, disappearing Arctic sea ice, some wildfires so big that they send ash around the world, oceans becoming more acidic threatening food chains, and high carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere threatening food security for billions of people. Guterres said scientists have been warning about global warming for decades, but “far too many leaders have refused to listen, far too few have acted with the vision the science demands”. When some 190 nations signed the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change they agreed to limit the global temperature increase by 2100 to less than 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C. “These targets were the bare minimum to avoid the worst impacts of climate change,” Guterres said. “But scientists tell us that we are far off track.” “According to a UN study, the commitments made so far by parties to the Paris agreement represent just one-third of what is needed,” the secretary general said. Guterres said the mountain that needs to be climbed is very high but not insurmountable. “We need to rapidly shift away from our dependence on fossil fuels,” he said. “We need to replace them with clean energy from water, wind and sun. We must halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and change the way we farm.” He appealed for leadership “from politicians and leaders, from business and scientists, and from the public everywhere” to break what he called the current “paralysis” and act now. “If we do not change course by 2020, we risk missing the point where we can avoid runaway climate change, with disastrous consequences for people and all the natural systems that sustain us,” Guterres warned. The alternative to moving to green energy, he said, “is a dark and dangerous future”. Guterres said that when he addresses world leaders at their annual general assembly gathering in two weeks, he will tell them “that climate change is the great challenge of our time” and what is missing is leadership and a sense of urgency to respond. He said an international meeting in Bangkok that ended on Sunday made some progress on negotiations to help reach an agreement in December in Poland on guidelines for implementing the 2015 Paris accord “but far from enough”. “Nothing less than our future and the fate of humankind depends on how we rise to the climate challenge,” Guterres said. “Keeping our planet’s warming to well below 2C is essential for global prosperity, people’s wellbeing and the security of nations.” He said that is why he will convoke a climate summit for world leaders in September 2019 “to bring climate action to the top of the international agenda”. Guterres said technology is on the side of those seeking to tackle climate change. He cited the rising use of renewable energy, saying “today, it is competitive with and even cheaper than coal and oil, especially if one factors in the cost of pollution”. And he singled out innovative programs in China, Sweden, Morocco, Scotland and Thailand. Guterres also pointed to other signs of hope including oil-rich Saudi Arabia investing heavily in renewable energy and oil-rich Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, moving away from investments in coal, as well as in palm and pulp paper companies because of the forests they destroy."
"Climate change is putting one of the world’s oldest beer varieties at risk, environmental scientists and one of Belgium’s leading artisan brewers have said. A study into temperatures in Brussels and the Pajottenland region south-west of the Belgian capital has raised doubts over the future of the sour lambic beer produced exclusively in the region.  Lambic is fermented in the open air through exposure to wild yeasts and airborne native bacteria. It relies on night-time temperatures of between -8C and 8C (18F-46F) for cooling and inoculation. The traditional brewing season runs from October to April, with bezomerd – Brussels dialect for a beer that has had “too much summer” – a possibility if it is produced any later. After cooling, the lambic is placed in wooden barrels where it is exposed to microbes living on the wood. The perfect temperature for ageing lambic is below 25C, above which the risk of unwelcome bacteria spoiling the beer rises. A joint project between the climate scientists Mark and Asa Stone, Adam Harbaugh from the beer research site Lambic.info and the Brussels brewery Cantillon found this limited brewing window has shortened from 165 days in the early 1900s to about 140, as temperatures have pushed it later into the autumn and brought the season prematurely to an end in early spring. It is feared the number of brewing days will shrink further, bringing the risk of a similar disaster to 2015, when beer had to be thrown away due to excessive temperatures. Dr Mark Stone, a director at the University of New Mexico’s Resilience Institute, said: “The impacts of climate change are often gradual until a tipping point is crossed. Our results show that Cantillon is experiencing shifting brewing conditions, and that adaptation to avoid crossing a threshold will require changes in brewing operations that are outside of their traditional methods. “The threat of climate change on traditional lambic production at Cantillon is indicative of the broader issue. That is, the impacts are not fully recognised until a threshold has been crossed, and adaptation strategies often exacerbate the problem while delaying the inevitable.” Cantillon, which produces 400,000 bottles of the sour beer a year, has warned its ability to produce the beer could be under threat in the long term. Jean Van Roy, Cantillon’s owner, told the Brussels Beer City blog that he believed if he artificially cooled the wort – a liquid extracted during the mashing process – it would change the taste of the beer. “If tomorrow I would have this problem every season, financially it could be a bit difficult, so we would have to change something,” he said. “[But] I would hate to do that … Or we move the brewery to go up north to begin to brew in Denmark, in Sweden, I don’t know.”"
"When North Carolina got bad news about what its coast could look like thanks to climate change, it chose to ignore it. In 2012, the state now in the path of Hurricane Florence reacted to a prediction by its Coastal Resources Commission that sea levels could rise by 39in over the next century by passing a law that banned policies based on such forecasts. The legislation drew ridicule, including a mocking segment by comedian Stephen Colbert, who said: “If your science gives you a result you don’t like, pass a law saying the result is illegal. Problem solved.” North Carolina has a long, low-lying coastline and is considered one of the US areas most vulnerable to rising sea levels. But dire predictions alarmed coastal developers and their allies, who said they did not believe the rise in sea level would be as bad as the worst models predicted and said such forecasts could unnecessarily hurt property values and drive up insurance costs. As a result, the state’s official policy, rather than adapting to the worst potential effects of climate change, has been to assume it simply won’t be that bad. Instead of forecasts, it has mandated predictions based on historical data on sea level rise. “The science panel used one model, the most extreme in the world,” Pat McElraft, the sponsor of the 2012 bill, said at the time, according to Reuters. “They need to use some science that we can all trust when we start making laws in North Carolina that affect property values on the coast.” The legislation was passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature and allowed to become law by the then governor Bev Perdue, a Democrat who neither signed nor vetoed the bill. The law required the coastal resources commission to put out another study in 2015, looking at expected sea level rise. That report looked only 30 years ahead, rather than a century. It found that the rise in sea level during that time was likely to be roughly 6in to 8in, with higher increases possible in parts of the Outer Banks. Some outside studies have offered more dire warnings. A report last year by the Union of Concerned Scientists said 13 North Carolina communities were likely to be “chronically inundated” with seawater by 2035. The state’s stance has shifted under the current governor, Roy Cooper, a Democrat who took office last year. Cooper announced last September that North Carolina would join the US Climate Alliance, a group of states that have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the goals of the Paris climate accord, even though Donald Trump pulled the US out of the agreement. “We remain committed to reducing pollution and protecting our environment,” Cooper said. “So much of North Carolina’s economy relies on protecting our treasured natural resources.” But Orrin Pilkey, a retired Duke University coastal geologist, wrote in a recent op-ed in the News & Observer that the state has still failed to take the steps that communities in Virginia and New Jersey have taken, to prepare for rising sea levels. “Instead coastal development flourishes as more beachfront buildings, highways and bridges are built to ease access to our beautiful beaches,” he wrote. “Currently the unspoken plan is to wait until the situation is catastrophic and then respond.” "
"ExxonMobil has joined the oil and gas industry’s flagship climate change project, reversing its decision not to join the alliance four years ago. The company was a notable holdout when the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OCGI) was launched, but will now join European peers BP, Shell and Total in contributing $100m (£75m) to curb the impact of global warming.  The move is the clearest sign yet the US company is taking a more progressive stance on global warming. Exxon, which promoted climate denial for years despite knowing about the risks since 1981, had shifted its tone on climate change under the leadership of Rex Tillerson. But while acknowledging global warming was real and linked to fossil fuel use, Tillerson said fears over climate change were overblown. Darren Woods, who became the chief executive in 2017 when Tillerson became US secretary of state, has taken that shift further. “It will take the collective efforts of many in the energy industry and society to develop scalable, affordable solutions that will be needed to address the risks of climate change,” he said of the firm’s decision to join the OCGI. Two other US oil companies, Chevron and Occidental Petroleum, have also joined the initiative, taking its total climate fund to $1.3bn. The project, which has been derided as “greenwash” by campaigners, previously had 10 members, which represented 20% of global oil and gas production. The new additions have taken that figure to 30%. Exxon’s annual contribution, which works out at $10m a year over a decade, represents just 0.04% of its planned capital expenditure of $25bn in 2018. Greg Muttitt, a campaigner at Oil Change International, said: “It is hardly surprising that ExxonMobil, when faced with lawsuits for lying for decades about what it knew about climate change, should want to join an initiative that claims oil companies care about climate.” Patrick Pouyanné, the chief executive of the French oil and gas company Total, said the new members would give more impact to the industry’s response to climate change. 🇺🇸👍 Happy to welcome @ExxonMobil @Chevron & @OXY_Petroleum into the #OGCI! The 13 members now represent 30% of Oil & Gas production and 20% of primary #energy consumption. The addition of 3 #US companies gives us more impact to lead the industry’s response to #ClimateChange. The announcement of the OCGI’s new members comes weeks before a UN science panel publishes a report on whether the world can meet the Paris climate deal’s tougher global warming target of 1.5C. Separately, Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that Opec countries should bring down oil prices, which are hovering at about $80 a barrel. His comment came despite an agreement by the oil cartel to pump more oil in an effort to lower prices. We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!"
"Warnings about the dangers of global warming are being watered down in the final version of a key climate report for a major international meeting next month, according to reviewers who have studied earlier versions of the report and its summary. They say scientists working on the final draft of the summary are censoring their own warnings and “pulling their punches” to make policy recommendations seem more palatable to countries – such as the US, Saudi Arabia and Australia – that are reluctant to cut fossil-fuel emissions, a key cause of global warming. “Downplaying the worst impacts of climate change has led the scientific authors to omit crucial information from the summary for policymakers,” said one reviewer, Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.  “However, if governments do not recognise the full scale and urgency of the risks, they may underestimate how critical it is to meet the goal of the Paris agreement on climate change. And that could have very serious knock-on effects in the battle to limit the impact of global warming.” The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C and its summary for policymakers were commissioned by governments following the UN meeting in Paris in 2015, when it was agreed to act to limit increases in global average temperature to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels and to try keep that increase nearer to 1.5C. The report – to be presented at a meeting in Korea in early October – will make clear that allowing temperatures to rise by 2C will have devastating consequences, including rising sea levels, spreading deserts, loss of natural habitats and species, dwindling ice-caps and increases in the number of devastating storms. However, it is the report’s summary for policymakers that is causing concern. This is the document politicians will use as a key climate guide when making changes to legislation. Reviewers of earlier drafts say it is being altered to make the dangers of climate change seem less alarming. As a result, they say,, policymakers could seriously underestimate the risks of global warming. Cuts made to the final draft of the summary include: • Any mention that temperature rises of above 1.5C could lead to increased migrations and conflict; • All discussion of the danger of the Gulf Stream being disrupted by cold water flowing from the Arctic where more and more sea-ice is melting; • Warnings about the dangers that 1.5–2C temperature rises could trigger irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet and raise sea levels by 1–2 metres over the next two centuries. Other cuts from the summary include the sentence: “Poverty and disadvantage have increased with recent warming (about 1C) and are expected to increase in many populations as average global temperatures increase from 1C to 1.5C and beyond.”  The original summary also stated “at 2C warming, there is a potential for significant population displacement concentrated in the tropics”. Again this is not mentioned in the report for policymakers. “The scientists who produce reports like these try to summarise the latest knowledge, but they have a reputation for being conservative about the worst risks of climate change,” Ward said. “This time they have outdone themselves in pulling their punches, however.” An IPCC spokesman said member governments would work to ensure the summary for policymakers was consistent with the findings in the main report. “They may change the wording of text there to clarify, remove material from the summary for policymakers, or bring material from the main report that was not there at the start of the session. Any text in the summary for policymakers … is based on the assessment in the main report. Even if it is removed from the summary for policymakers, the finding it is based on remains in the main report.”"
"Five years since the Abbott government scrapped the Climate Commission, the environmentalist Tim Flannery says our energy policy remains hostage to lobbyists, political self-interest and “mad ideologues”. But the organisation Flannery helped start from the ashes of Abbott’s climate bonfire, the Climate Council, says that attitudes have shifted substantially since 2013 – at least those outside federal parliament. “We’re being held hostage at a federal level,” Flannery told Guardian Australia. “It has been a disgrace. Our failures are the failures of a small group of politicians who are supposed to be acting in the national interest. Instead, they’re using energy policy as a cudgel, they’re listening to paid lobbyists and doing their bidding.” “I don’t want to say any more because I’ll just get angry.” Flannery was the chief commissioner of the Climate Commission, a government-backed research body whose remit was to communicate reliable and authoritative information about climate change. The commission lasted just two years, and was almost immediately scrapped by the Abbott government after the 2013 election. Flannery and other commissioners decided to subsequently launch the Climate Council as an independent not-for-profit body. “We raised $1.5m in 10 days,” recalls Amanda McKenzie, the council’s chief executive. “At the time we went out, quite on a limb, because we had no funding. We said we will go ahead if the public backs us. It was the largest crowdfunding campaign in Australian history. Thousands of people were contributing.” “I look back on that time as a really hopeful moment, thinking the community is behind us on this. More and more Australians are concerned about the issue. That concern has elevated over time. “We had no idea that we would still be, five years later, battling for any action on an federal government level.”Flannery points out that Australia’s emissions continue to increase “at a time when they need to be going down”. The federal government has abandoned any commitment to meeting the Paris emissions reduction targets. The new prime minister, Scott Morrison, famously used a lump of coal as a prop in parliament. That state of affairs might cause some to question whether any progress had been made during the past five years. But putting federal politics to one side, both Flannery and McKenzie say strides have been made by individuals, local and state governments. “I think [without the Climate Council] we’d be a long way behind in terms of public awareness, we’d be a huge distance behind,” Flannery said. “Those who were seeking to mislead would be [not held to account].” “I’m immensely proud of it and I think we’ve made a huge difference”. Flannery said the Climate Council initially sought to be a research and information body, filling the gap left by the disbanding of the commission. But in recent years it has taken on a broader remit, actively running programs to support action. “We decided we needed to expand our remit, we’re running out of time to deal with this issue and we needed to pull out all stops. “I think we’ve got to use every leverage point we can at the moment because we’re running out of time. We need to find those programs that work, get involved and start leading them.” One of those programs, which Flannery says he is “most proud of”, is a partnership that supports local governments to transition to clean energy. “What we didn’t realise [five years ago] was that state governments would step into the vacuum and that local governments would step into the vacuum,” McKenzie said. In five years, the council has released more than 100 publications. “If we had failed, it would not only have set back the entire climate change discussion in Australia, it would have given the conservatives an opportunity to say how little everyone cares about climate change,” Flannery said. “There will be a need for the Climate Council I think for decades, because the problem isn’t going to be solved for decades. It’s a pretty tough thing to be pushing against this and find you’re constantly going backwards. But I’m nothing if not stubborn.”"
"Sir James Dyson, the billionaire inventor and Brexit backer, has unveiled expansion plans to accommodate more than 2,000 workers at his Wiltshire research facility, more than doubling capacity for electric-vehicle testing. Coming despite severe warnings over lost jobs and investment from no-deal Brexit, his technology company is spending about £200m to expand the testing facility on a former second world war airfield at Hullavington, near Malmesbury in the west of England. The investment comes a year after Dyson announced plans to create an electric vehicle to propel his high-tech household goods company to become a rival to Tesla, the carmaker started by the US billionaire Elon Musk. The British engineering company is developing a car that is due to be ready for road testing in 2020, with the first deliveries coming a year later. Dyson’s expansion plans for the research and development site, which is already home to about 400 workers, include planning applications for more than 10 miles of vehicle-testing tracks with high speed sections, hills and off-road routes to put its new electric cars through their paces. Although only recruiting about 300 more automotive workers at present, planning details show the 45,000-square-metre site will ultimately have space for more than 2,000 people. In addition to the testing track, there will be a cafe, sports centre, recreation space and supporting technical facilities. Dyson has yet to make a decision on whether it will mass-produce its electric vehicles in Britain once testing is complete. Although it designs and develops products in the UK, supporting high-value jobs, it manufactures them in cheaper locations such as Singapore and elsewhere in the far east. The company employs more than 12,000 people around the world with about 4,800 in the UK, centred around Malmesbury. Alongside its vacuum cleaners, hand dryers and car development, the company is working on battery technologies, high-speed electric motors, vision systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Despite difficult trading conditions facing many firms after the Brexit vote amid heightened political uncertainty, Dyson has not changed his view that leaving the EU would be best for the country. Before the referendum he was among the most prominent business supporters of Britain leaving the EU despite fiercely vocal support for remain from many other senior figures in business and industry. “Brexit can supercharge British technology and refocus minds on global trade if only we grab the opportunity with both hands – the government must embrace it and support British businesses,” he told the Guardian. Several major industrial companies and carmakers, including Airbus, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have warned a hard Brexit would trigger a reassessment of jobs and investments in Britain. Economic growth has slowed since the referendum, while households are more than £900 worse off, according to the governor of the Bank of England."
"Ministers are “deliberately weakening” the green watchdog that will hold the government to account after Britain leaves the EU, according to Labour’s shadow Brexit minister. Theresa May pledged last January to create a “world-leading, independent, statutory body” to ensure ministers stick to their commitments – replacing the power of the European commission to take governments to the European court of justice (ECJ) for not fulfilling their obligations. Yet the UK watchdog will not have any powers relating to climate change, an issue of heightened public concern since the summer heatwave that has seen wildfires in the north of England and outbreaks of tropical diseases in parts of Europe. Matthew Pennycook, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, said: “Our EU membership has been key to delivering and enforcing UK emission reductions. In choosing to exclude climate change from the remit of their environmental watchdog, ministers are deliberately weakening the tools we have to hold them to account. The Brexit process cannot be used as a cover to water down the UK’s leadership on climate change.” The public deserves to have a watchdog with teeth that can enforce climate policy and ensure our pledges become reality Greener UK, which represents 13 of the UK’s biggest environmental organisations including Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the RSPB and the National Trust , said it is very concerned about the omission of climate policy from the watchdog’s remit. About 55% of the UK’s planned carbon reductions are tied to regulations derived from the EU and would have been enforced by the European commission. The watchdog should cover issues such as protecting harbour porpoises, ensuring that water quality and air quality remain high, and protecting wildlife habitats – issues that the European commission has taken action against the UK government. Environmentalists believe the ECJ has been effective in getting Whitehall to live up to its pledges. According to research by the Institute for Government, between 2003 and 2016 the commission started 753 actions against the British government, of which about 120 related to the environment. Yet ministers were quick to settle matters before they reached the ECJ, which only passed judgments on 63 cases. However, 29 of those cases related to the environment, indicating that ministers would often not take action unless forced to do so. In announcing its plans for the watchdog, the government argued that climate change was already covered by the Climate Change Act 2008, which created the committee on climate change and international treaties. But the CCC, which said recently that the UK would miss its 2025 and 2030 carbon reduction targets, only has powers to advise and report. Its chairman, Lord Deben, told the environment secretary Michael Gove that excluding climate policy from the watchdog’s remit would be “artificial and potentially create problems”. But Gove is not responsible for government policy on climate change. The issue has now been passed over to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Shane Tomlinson, director at E3G, part of Greener UK, said: “The government says it wants to be a leader in tackling climate change. However, leadership is not just about the promises you make, but being accountable for delivering on them. “The UK public deserves to have a watchdog with teeth that can enforce climate policy and ensure that our pledges become reality.” A spokesman for the BEIS said the government was committed to meeting its climate change targets."
"A remarkable run of observations began 60 years ago at a weather station high on a volcano in Hawaii. Charles Keeling began monitoring carbon dioxide in the clean air at 3,400 metres (11,150ft) on Mauna Loa, far away from vegetation and urban pollution. His first measurements in 1958 showed 315 parts per million (ppm) of CO2 in the atmosphere, and what caught him by surprise was that every year after that the levels of CO2 rose relentlessly in an upward curve, thanks to the carbon pollution pumped into the Earth’s atmosphere.  Now the CO2 has reached more than 400ppm, probably the highest for 800,000 years. It sounds a tiny amount of extra CO2, but it is having a huge impact on the climate by trapping more heat on Earth, driving world temperatures upwards. CO2 in the air is now so plentiful that plants are growing fewer leaf pores to absorb the gas than they did centuries ago, and more CO2 is being absorbed into the world’s seas, making them more acidic. Keeling’s curve of rising CO2 levels is a shocking picture of how much the world’s atmosphere has changed in 60 years, with no end in sight. "
"The slogan “Think global, act local”, popular among environmentalists since the 1970s, is apt when applied to the politics of air. While pollution by greenhouse gases, chiefly CO2, requires international action, some emissions can be tackled much closer to home. Evidence about the health impact of the gases and particles produced by road traffic, industry and open fires has developed rapidly since the 1990s. In cities, many of which have experienced rapid growth in traffic, air quality has become a pressing issue. Across the EU, legal limits are regularly breached, and the UK, France and Germany are among six countries facing large fines. Until Michael Gove publishes his environment bill there remains uncertainty over the teeth the watchdog will have when it comes to enforcing the rules after Brexit. But it is not clear whether the genie of public anxiety about toxic air can be pushed back into the bottle. This week saw reports about new research into the amount of particulate matter breathed by children at London schools, and pollutants found in mothers’ placentas. Last month it was revealed that Chinese researchers have linked high levels of air pollution to reduced intelligence.  New clean air zones in London and Birmingham, including charges for the most polluting vehicles, start their rollout next year (two other cities, Southampton and Derby, have been ticked off by the government for missing a deadline for proposals). Such schemes represent a milestone in efforts to limit nitrogen oxide pollution from diesel vehicles after the still-unfolding emissions-cheating scandal. This weekend will see the closure of 50 roads for the capital’s first “car-free day”, an initiative campaigners hope will soon be scaled up to match more ambitious schemes in cities including Brussels and Paris. What happens next depends on public opinion as well as government. Parents are increasingly worried about the health of their children. Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, who believes air pollution killed her daughter Ella, wants to argue the case in a new inquest. On the other side of the argument are those concerned about the impact of charges. In Birmingham, these include businesses supplying parts to the local automotive industry. In London, Westminster city council has opposed schemes it says penalise its residents, and last week inflicted a defeat on the mayor in the high court. No politician is likely to forget the saga of the London congestion zone’s western extension, which lasted only a year before being scrapped. The situation is complicated because vehicle emissions and air pollution, while closely linked to congestion, are not the same thing. Urban transport is a political question and dirty air is not the only reason many people would like to see traffic reduced. Others include road safety, noise, and the belief that public transport, bicycles and pedestrians should take priority over private cars – even electric ones. On the other side, many people are attached to their cars and see driving as their right and an economic necessity. Were it not for the obstructive policies pursued by Boris Johnson, London would be further ahead than it is. Birmingham and Manchester are catching up. The obesity crisis as well as air pollution and congestion means the direction of travel – towards healthier and more active lifestyles, and less traffic – should be clear. Per-mile road pricing was looked at by Mr Khan last year and remains under review. Whether by this route or another, cities and their leaders must find a way through."
"The energy minister, Angus Taylor, says the Morrison government will not be replacing the renewable energy target “with anything” after it winds down in 2020. Taylor confirmed there would be no policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector during an answer to the Greens MP Adam Bandt in question time on Tuesday.  Bandt asked whether the RET could be extended beyond 2020 given there was currently no policy mechanism to replace it, and the lack of settled policy could threaten investment in low emissions technology. The energy minister flatly rejected the entreaty. “The truth of the matter is the renewable energy target is going to wind down from 2020, it reaches its peak in 2020, and we won’t be replacing that with anything.” Taylor indicated there was no need to have a policy because “we know we will reach the 26% emission reduction target without additional intervention”. In a column for the Australian Financial Review, published on Tuesday, Taylor hedged slightly more, declaring “emissions reductions are the least of our problems, with every prospect we will reach the 26% reduction below 2005 levels ahead of schedule and without interventions”. Those declarations from the minister contradict advice from the Energy Security Board. In August, the ESB told federal and state energy ministers that if the national energy guarantee wasn’t implemented, the national electricity market would “fall short of the emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels”. The Coalition’s plan to 2030 was to replace the RET with the national energy guarantee, which imposed an emissions reduction target for electricity. But Malcolm Turnbull abandoned the Neg as one of his last acts in the prime ministership, and the policy has now been junked officially by the cabinet under Scott Morrison’s leadership. Taylor says the Morrison government is now focused exclusively on lowering power prices and will pursue regulatory interventions to achieve that end. But while some government conservatives routinely equate renewables with higher power prices, there is evidence that a big build of renewable capacity contracted through the RET is currently lowering wholesale prices by increasing supply to the market. Last December, the Australian Energy Market Commission predicted wholesale electricity costs would fall in 2018-19 and 2019-20, with a reduction in the order of 12%, due to approximately 5,300 MW of new committed and expected generation entering the national electricity market – the majority of which is renewable generation (4,900 MW). The energy minister has also criticised a proposal by the ALP to adopt an emissions reduction target for electricity of 45%. Taylor told parliament on Tuesday: “The result will be we will all pay more for our electricity”. But new modelling from Frontier Economics undertaken for the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and the Brotherhood of St Laurence, published by Guardian Australia on Tuesday, indicates otherwise. It predicts power prices for households would fall by 2030 under four different scenarios – business as usual and emissions reduction targets of 26%, 45% and 65%. It says that under the Coalition’s now abandoned 26% target, the average saving to households would be 20.8% while under the 45% scenario, which is Labor’s target, the average saving would be 18.3%. The Morrison government says Australia will remain a signatory to the Paris climate agreement but it is unclear how compliance with an economy-wide emissions target can be achieved in the absence of a policy roadmap. Recent polling suggests voters are more worried about climate change than they were 12 months ago. A study tracking voter sentiment for more than a decade, funded first by the Climate Institute and now by the Australia Institute, finds 73% (up from 66% in 2017) of respondents are concerned about climate change, and a clear majority, 68%, believes the government should set domestic targets to comply with our Paris commitments."
"Sylvia Wilson drove around Australia in an electric car. It cost her $150.90. Wilson, 70, a retired farmer from near Biloela in central Queensland, had planned the trip of a lifetime with her husband, Rod. One impulsive evening in mid-2016 they went online and, sight-unseen, bought a Tesla S75 electric car for the journey.  A few months after Rod died last year, Sylvia announced to her family: “I think I’ll do that trip. “Most of them were really keen. A couple of them said ‘you’re mad, you’ll never do it’,” Wilson told Guardian Australia. It took Sylvia 110 days and 20,396km door to door to navigate the Round Australia Electric Vehicle Superhighway – a loop of charging stations. She is the first woman to drive the route and the second person to loop the country in a Tesla. Her daughters, sisters, friends and a daughter-in law – in total seven different women – flew in and out from various points to keep her company along the way. “I had to stick to a schedule because they had to book their flights, so there was no mucking around. I was flying blind to a certain extent. I booked all my accommodation, and that had to be tied in to what the car could do,” Wilson said. Some of the more remote charging stations had never been used until Wilson rolled into town in Bluey, her affectionate name for the Tesla. In the Kimberley, at Fitzroy Crossing, she arrived late on Friday afternoon and discovered the charging station not working. “They found the only electrician in town and he came and did something and it worked,” she said. At the next town over, Halls Creek, the power socket was at a business that was shut. At the local motel she found a 15amp power supply and was able to plug in overnight. “They call it range anxiety. That’s what everyone talks about. It’s totally valid to have that, to be thinking about the next charge, once you’ve got an [electric vehicle]. “But the reality is that if you can see the lights on, or that the kettle works, then you can charge. Even in the remotest places you can still charge the car. In a way there are more places to charge an EV [electric vehicle] than there are a fossil fuel car.” Sylvia recalls the night in mid-2016 when her husband Rod sat down beside her at the computer. By 9pm, they’d bought the Tesla. Three months later, it turned up at their cattle farm, between Biloela and Gladstone, on the back of a truck. “My husband and I, in the old days, disagreed on a lot of things,” Wilson said. “I was the greenie, he was the brownie. As he got older, I must have won I think. He became very concerned about the mess that we’re making of our little globe. “He just started to take on board things like buying an electric car. I live off the grid here [with solar power] and charge the car off grid too. I couldn’t do those things without him wanting to do those things, too. “He never drove it. He had Parkinson’s and he had a few problems because of that. It kind of amazed him that it was electric. “I think he would have been tickled at how successful the trip was.” Having the experience of driving around Australia – and fulfilling the dream she and Rod had planned – was only part of Sylvia’s motivation. “My other purpose was to prove a point,” she said. “These are good cars and you’re not stuck to just going down to the shops.“The concern about the environment was front and centre. These cars are bloody expensive. But once you’ve paid for the car, your running costs are bugger all.” The same trip would have, conservatively and based on city prices, cost more than $3,000 in petrol in a conventional sedan. Charging the car cost $150.90 in total, partly because people often did not want payment. “Motel people and others who just let me charge and said ‘don’t worry about paying, off you go’. They treat it like a laptop or a phone.” Wilson is recognised by 350.org in a report released on Wednesday as one of the “heroes building Australia’s low-carbon economy”. The report recognises investors, business leaders and everyday Australians whose private efforts to reduce carbon emissions are leading the way as the federal government backs away from the Paris agreement targets.The chief execuitve of 350.org Australia, Blair Palese, said people such as Wilson were filling a climate change “leadership void” that had been vacated by politicians."
"“This drought has really hit our family hard,” says Longreach farmer Jody Brown. “Climate change is making the droughts more severe.” Those two sentences are the opening lines to a new advertisement challenging the federal government’s stance on climate change and the drought in Australia’s eastern states. The 30-second ad will begin airing on commercial channels this week and will be beamed into politically important suburban areas of Australia’s three largest capital cities during the NRL grand final on 30 September. The advertisement has been paid for by the Australian Conservation Foundation and features Brown, a sheep and cattle farmer who runs a 45,000 acre property 65km south of Longreach in central west Queensland. Brown is a fourth-generation grazier whose family property has been affected by drought. In the clip, she calls for “politicians to stop dancing around the issue and help us to do something about this”. “We need to stick to the Paris agreement, we need to stop burning coal and we need to commit to more renewable energy,” she says. The campaign comes after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, described the drought as his highest priority but said the conversation about the connection between drought and climate change should be left “for another day”. Last week hundreds of farmers and their supporters rallied outside Parliament House in Canberra demanding action on climate change. Farmers for Climate Action board member and third-generation NSW farmer Peter Holding told the crowd that praying for rain – referencing comments by Morrison earlier this month – “is not going to cut it”. Brown said she had become increasingly disappointed at Canberra’s unwillingness to discuss the current drought in the context of climate change. “I think no matter where you stand or what your perspective is, droughts are part of a climate and you can’t separate those two issues,” she said. “If you’re going to be serious about supporting farmers through drought and adapting to drought-stricken conditions, you need to be talking about climate change.” She said many farmers were already changing their practices to try to adapt to warmer temperatures. “It’s not going to work for everyone but there are some interesting management solutions out there,” she said. “These are the kinds of things I’d like to see governments working on as well.” Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said Australia could no longer put off talking about how climate change is making extreme weather events worse. “We are launching this TV ad to try prompt the national discussion our prime minister doesn’t seem to want to have,” she said. “Farmers, along with many others in our community, are on the frontline of climate damage. We must have their backs. Inaction on climate change both here and abroad has real-world implications for the safety and productivity of our country.” A poll published last week showed the Morrison government is politically vulnerable on climate policy, with a growing number of Australians saying they are concerned about climate change and want action. The prime minister has declared Australia will not pull out of Paris but also abandoned the national energy guarantee that imposed an emissions reduction target on the electricity sector. New data published by NDEVR Environmental on Friday shows Australia is on track to miss its Paris targets, and the country’s emissions, excluding land use data, were the highest on record for the third year running."

"Northern hemisphere weather is stealing the limelight right now. Hurricane Florence slammed into the eastern US on Friday as the Philippines and Hong Kong braced for Typhoon Mangkhut. Hurricanes and typhoons are no surprise at this time of year, but what is noticeable is that these tropical storms are not barrelling along as fast as they used to.  Research published in Nature earlier this year showed that the average speed at which tropical storms track has slowed down by 10% since 1949. Over land, speeds have decreased even further; around 30% for western North Pacific storms and 20% for North Atlantic ones. Changes in atmospheric circulation, caused by global warming, are thought to be behind the decrease in pace. Hurricanes that proceed at a trot instead of a canter are not good news. “The slower the storm moves, the more rain falls on the area under it. Inland fresh-water flooding increases and this is the No 1 factor, by far, that causes loss of life associated with hurricanes,” says James Kossin, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin. Hurricane Harvey demonstrated this last year when it stalled over Texas, and right now Hurricane Florence appears to be lingering too."
"The prime minister of Samoa has called climate change an “existential threat ... for all our Pacific family” and said that any world leader who denied climate change’s existence should be taken to a mental hospital. In a searing speech delivered on Thursday night during a visit to Sydney, Tuilaepa Sailele berated leaders who fail to take climate change seriously, singling out Australia, as well as India, China and the US, which he said were the “three countries that are responsible for all this disaster”.   “Any leader of those countries who believes that there is no climate change I think he ought to be taken to mental confinement, he is utter[ly] stupid and I say the same thing for any leader here who says there is no climate change.” Speaking at the Lowy Institute, just days before the beginning of the Pacific Islands Forum in Nauru, the Samoan prime minister seemed to take a swipe at Australia’s commitment to minimising the impact of climate change, which he called the “single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and wellbeing peoples of the Pacific”. “While climate change may be considered a slow onset threat by some in our region, its adverse impacts are already felt by our Pacific islands peoples and communities,” said Sailele. “Greater ambition is necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade and Pacific island countries continue to urge faster action by all countries.” Sailele said addressing climate change required “political guts” from leaders. “We all know the problem, we all know the causes, we all know the solutions. All that is left would be some political courage, some political guts to get out and tell the people of your country, ‘Do this, this, this, or there is any certainty of disaster.’” Sailele’s speech comes as leaders of Pacific nations are preparing to meet at the Pacific Islands Forum in Nauru next week, where Australia is expected to face questions about its emissions targets.  Australia’s new prime minister, Scott Morrison, is under pressure from some members of his party to abandon Australia’s commitment to reducing emissions under the Paris agreement. His immediate predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, was due to attend the forum, but Morrison has announced he is sending his new foreign minister, Marisa Payne, a move the opposition Labor party condemned as “an insult to our neighbours” as well as “a serious strategic mistake”. Saliele’s speech also touched on China’s rising influence in the Pacific, saying the region had become “an increasingly contested space”. “The big powers are doggedly pursuing strategies to widen and extend their reach, inculcating a far-reaching sense of insecurity.”  "
"Australia is lagging behind other developed nations in the race to curb greenhouse gas emissions from transport, according to a new report. The report from the Climate Council, due to be released on Thursday, finds that Australia’s transport-related emissions have continued to rise because of policy inaction.  The nation’s move to electric vehicles has been hampered by a lack of incentives and a lack of mandatory pollution standards for vehicles, which have been implemented in almost all other OECD countries. “We’ve been having a big national debate about electricity sector emissions,” said senior climate and energy solutions analyst Petra Stock, “but [we] really wanted to draw attention to the growing problem of greenhouse gas pollution from the transport sector.” Calling for the government to implement a climate and transport policy plan, the report said Australia ranked behind Russia, Mexico and Indonesia on transport efficiency due to high polluting cars, high car use, a low share of trips taken by public transport, and low capital spending on public transport compared to roads. Transport is the nation’s second largest source of greenhouse gas pollution after electricity, the report says. Transport-related greenhouse gas pollution levels increased by 3.4% in the 12 months to December 2017. Since 1990, they have increased by 62.9%, a higher rate than any other sector. “Australia’s transport emissions or transport greenhouse gas pollution levels have been steadily rising and are projected to continue going up,” the report said.“Factors such as population growth have led to a higher number of cars on the road, while increased demand for freight is also driving up truck emissions.” Other findings included that: Nearly 87% of Australian commuters travel to work by car Transport makes up 18% of all greenhouse gas pollution in Australia (electricity is the largest source at 33%) Road-based transport pollution contributes to a greater proportion of emissions in Australian than the global average Domestic air travel alone makes up 9% of Australian transport emissions Energy policy paralysis continues in Canberra, exacerbated by the Morrison government’s decision to ditch the national energy guarantee. Since 2015, the government has been consulting on mandatory fuel emissions standards, which have been in place for at least a decade in the US, Japan and China. The report said if strict standards were introduced, Australia could prevent up to the equivalent of 65m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. “This is equivalent to the annual emissions from seven Liddell power stations. Urgency is key. Mandatory emissions standards have wider benefits, reducing fuel bills for car owners, saving an estimated $8,500 over a vehicle’s lifetime.” The report said Australian cars pollute more per kilometre than other comparable countries. The lack of mandatory emissions standards was a factor, but so was vehicle size and the purchasing decisions made by individuals, business and government fleet buyers. Stock said the government had already done the work required to “put these greenhouse gas emissions standards in place for vehicles and bring Australia in line with 80% of the global car market”. “But we need to do it as soon as possible because these standards work as people replace their cars over time,” she said. “It takes time for these standards to drive down emissions in the transport sector. So the sooner they are in place, the greater effect they will have on transport pollution.” The report said the adoption of electric vehicles in Australia had been held back by “the lack of policy support or incentives, higher upfront cost, limited choice of available electric vehicles for sale in Australia, and the availability of public vehicle charging infrastructure”. In New Zealand, which has a target of 64,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2021, there were 3,659 new electric cars sold in 2017, compared with only 2,284 in Australia, the report said. It also calls on the government to focus on improving public transport, cycling and walking infrastructure, praising initiatives such as Melbourne’s move to a solar power tram network."
"The world’s first plastic bicycle path made of recycled bottles, cups and packaging has opened in the Netherlands, as part of a pilot that could see similar roads open up across the country. The 30-metre path, made of recycled plastic equivalent to more than 218,000 plastic cups, is expected to be three times as durable as an asphalt alternative.  It also contains sensors to monitor the road’s performance, including its temperature, the number of bikes that pass over it and its ability to cope with the traffic. The prefabricated sections of cycle path are light and hollow making them easy to transport and 70% quicker to install. Cables and utility pipes are able to be easily fitted inside, and the path is designed to drain off rainwater. The joint venture between the Dutch engineers KWS, the oil and gas conglomerate Total, and pipe-makers Wavin, was opened this week in Zwolle, in the north-east of the Netherlands. A second path is to be installed in Giethoorn in Overijssel, and Rotterdam is the city most likely to take up the technology. Its is believed that many of the benefits of the paths will apply to plastic roads. The path’s inventors, Anne Koudstaal and Simon Jorritsma, said: “This first pilot is a big step towards a sustainable and future-proof road made of recycled plastic waste. When we invented the concept, we didn’t know how to build a plastic road, now we know.” Asphalt concrete is responsible for 1.5m tonnes of CO2 emissions a year, equivalent to 2% of global road transport emissions. When first announcing the concept in 2015, Jorritsma said: “You see a bottle; we see a road.” Earlier this year the EU launched an urgent plan to clean up Europe’s act on plastic waste and ensure that every piece of packaging on the continent is reusable or recyclable by 2030. Brussels’ strategy, which followed China’s decision to ban imports of foreign recyclable material, was designed to change minds in Europe, potentially tax damaging behaviour, and modernise plastics production and collection by investing €350m (£310m) in research. Each year, 25m tonnes of plastic waste is generated by Europeans, but less than 30% is collected for recycling. Some doubts have been raised about the plastic path. Harmen Spek, from the anti-plastic lobby group Plastic Soup has warned that small particles of the plastic could find their way into the living environment due to heat, wear and run-off."
"Just a year ago we were dealing with an historically devastating Atlantic hurricane season. It was marked by the strongest hurricane – Irma – ever observed in the open Atlantic, the near total devastation of Puerto Rico by a similarly powerful category 5 monster Maria, and Hurricane Harvey – the worst flooding event in US history. At the time, I commented here and elsewhere about the role climate change had played in amplifying the destructive characteristics of these storms. Not to be outdone, the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, initially predicted to be quiet – quelled by an incipient El Niño event and cool, early summer ocean waters – has suddenly erupted. If the current disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico known as “95L” earns the status of tropical storm, the 2018 season will be the second time in recorded history that we’ve seen five tropical storms simultaneously present in the Atlantic basin (the last time was in 1971).  What happened to cause all of this? An early autumn ocean “heat wave” has brought sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic to bathtub-level warmth. Just as summer heat waves on land are greatly increased in frequency and intensity by even modest overall warming, so too are these ocean heat waves becoming more frequent and more extreme as the oceans continue warm. All else being equal, warmer oceans mean more energy to intensify tropical storms and hurricanes. But when it comes to coastal threat, it hardly matters how many tropical storms there are over the course of the season. A single landfalling hurricane can wreak havoc and destruction. Think Katrina in 2005, Irene in 2011, Sandy in 2012, either Harvey or Maria in 2017 and now Florence in 2018. In this sense, the sometimes fractious debate about whether we’ll see more or fewer storms in a warmer world is somewhat misplaced. What matters is that there is a consensus we’ll see stronger and worse flood-producing storms – and, in fact, we’re seeing them already. That brings us to Hurricane Florence: a climatologically-amplified triple threat. First, there is the threat of wind damage. Florence strengthened into a monster category 4 hurricane with 140 mile per hour winds over those very warm western Atlantic waters. Past studies indicate a roughly 7% increase in the peak wind speed of a category 4 storm for each 1C warming of ocean surface temperatures. So the roughly 1.5C warmer-than-normal waters in the subtropical Atlantic where the storm intensified (and keep in mind that “normal” as modernly defined by NOAA as the average during the 1981-2010 period is itself already about 1C warmer than pre-industrial times prior to advent of human-caused greenhouse warming) corresponds to a roughly 11% increase in peak winds. But the destructive potential of a storm goes as the cube of the wind speed. So that 11% increase in wind speed corresponds to a 33% increase in destructive potential. That’s not a subtle effect. Fortunately those winds decreased substantially as the storm approached landfall. But even as a strong, very slowly moving hurricane pounding structures with near 100mph winds for hours on end, Florence is doing considerable damage as it skirts the long Carolina coastline, taking down trees and powerlines and rendering large areas without electricity. That brings us to the second, even greater threat: storm surge. Though the storm weakened as it approached the coast, the storm surge was built up over of a period of several days, including the time during which it existed as a category 4 or strong category 3 storm. That means the catastrophic, roughly-10ft storm surge from Cape Hatteras to Myrtle Beach was baked in well in advance of the landfall of the storm. Don’t forget to add to that the 1ft of sea level rise that has occurred along the south-eastern US coast, mostly due to climate change (there’s a small contribution owing to the geological subsidence of the coast). The wonderful little coastal North Carolina town of New Bern has been particularly hard hit, with the downtown area flooded by the 10ft storm surge and 200 people requiring rescue. It is seemingly prescient that I gave a lecture in New Bern last year, during last year’s storm season, warning about the coastal threat from climate change, in a church that has now been flooded by Florence. Last, but not least, we have the threat of inland flooding. Warmer oceans mean more moisture in the atmosphere. It’s one of the simplest relationships in all of meteorology: for each 1C of warming, there is about 7% more moisture in the air. That means those 1.5C-above-normal ocean temperatures have given the storm about 10% more moisture. All other things being equal, that implies about 10% more rainfall. But that’s not the whole story. What made Harvey a record flooding event last year and makes Florence such a flooding threat now, is the slow-moving nature of the storm. The slower the storm moves, the more rainfall that accumulates in any one location and the more flooding you get. Such was the case with other devastating storms such as Harvey or 2011’s Hurricane Irene that caused historic flooding in my own state of Pennsylvania. Some headlines have reported that Florence is a warning of what is to come. But in reality, it is a warning of what has already arrived. Far worse is to come if we don’t get serious, in a hurry, about acting on climate change. We must transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy even more rapidly, and we must elect politicians who will support such efforts. In the US, there’s an opportunity to do so in less than two months now in the upcoming midterm elections, where we must elect politicians who support enlightened policies on energy and climate, and vote out of office those who don’t.

"After a long summer, children are back at school, the festival season is ending and the World Cup is a distant memory. For us, as the newly elected co-leaders of the Green party, we’re about to enter the most exciting period of our political lifetimes. We’re ready to mobilise a fiercer Green resistance than ever before. In council chambers across the country, brave, independent Greens are already leading a political revolt against the status quo. We want to put the Green party on course to become the third party in Britain, building on this year’s local election success, and get a Green on every council in England and Wales.  But politics isn’t confined to council chambers or the halls of Westminster, and we are not afraid to join protesters taking direct action for what is right. We have just lived through the joint hottest summer on record. Despite environment secretary Michael Gove’s claim to have painted the government green, all he has offered are empty promises, while his government wreaks as much destruction as any Tory government, with fracking, airport expansion and new roads gouging out chunks from our countryside. Yet the scale of the climate crisis calls for a system overhaul. That is why we will always stand with those risking arrest to protest against the environmental destruction of fracking or airport expansion. Meanwhile, the Windrush scandal has exposed just how deep runs the cruelty and incompetence of the Home Office. We believe there needs to be root-and-branch reform of an immigration system that is rotten to its very core. We are proud to support activists and campaigners who are putting their bodies on the line in the fight against the inhumanity of indefinite detention and the forced removals of refugees and migrants. Not only are we proud to say migrants and refugees are welcome here, but we will always celebrate the gift of freedom of movement. Then there’s Brexit. After being laughed at, derided and called delusional, it looks increasingly likely that our calls for a People’s Vote could come to fruition. You’d be forgiven for not immediately thinking of the Greens when it comes to Brexit, because the media has maintained a wall of silence when it comes to our longstanding call for a democratic conclusion to this debate. But we’re not just another party opposing the government’s Brexit fantasies – we’re the only party who can be trusted to oppose Brexit and also offer genuinely bold and radical policies to fix the ailments in this country that led to Brexit. With a government in chaos and a Labour party that’s split down the middle, we could well be on the cusp of another political revolution. But while we will always campaign with others to oppose Brexit, we think it’s time to say loudly and clearly that the Green party will never be part of any vapid centrist blob. Nor will we join the multimillionaires trying to start new parties in an attempt to return Britain to the centrism that so utterly failed people earlier this century. We stand firmly and unequivocally against the forces of racism that whipped up a culture war with so little opposition from the political mainstream in the run-up to the referendum. We want to overhaul the world of work so it is fit to face the challenges of our times, from the role of automation to the rise of insecure working in the gig economy. With the autumn budget fast approaching, we think it’s time to take stock and ask again whether the economy is the master or the servant of the British people. Specifically, we think it’s time for politics to shift away from an obsession with economic growth and a culture of work that sees people slaving away at jobs that offer little material or emotional reward. That’s why our party was the first in Britain to propose a four-day working week, and why we are continuing to think of ideas that will give people more free time to live the lives they choose. While governments must of course focus on the scourge of low pay, precarious work and joblessness that too many people face, they must not do so at the cost of refocusing the economy away from a culture that sees people working themselves to the brink. This country is not broken, but our governments have been for many years. We won’t heal our wounds by facing backwards and grasping for an economic and political settlement that has failed for so long. Instead, we must be fresh in our thinking and bold in our actions if we’re to get the country facing a future that people feel hope about, and where they know that every citizen and their wellbeing will be valued. The Green party will be bold, or we will be nothing, and we will always be up for picking a side in the debates that define this country. Our leadership won’t be shackled by the chains of old-school politics, and we’re starting our leadership as we mean to go on, by putting the big questions at the heart of what we do. • Jonathan Bartley and Sîan Berry are co-leaders of the Green party"
"One of the ways the British media covers climate change is to treat it as a bit of banter in silly-season items on English wine. This summer’s heatwave was the pretext for an awful lot of these “and finally” moments, in which the tone is unfailingly flippant: never mind the melting Arctic, the shires will take over from Champagne! Well, hoorah for that. Except, of course, the impact of climate changeon wine isn’t quite as straightforward as a few nice summers and guaranteed bumper vintages in Sussex. What the larky local-radio questions about Bordeaux-on-Thames tend to gloss over is that itwon’t necessarily make the UK, or anywhere, a better place to grow wine. Erratic weather, floods, hurricanes, extreme, unseasonal frost and drought: none of these are friends of the winemaker.  Winemakers are attuned to the minutest changes in the weather – differences that they can, literally, taste in their wines. A line-up of past vintages offers a sensorial record of climatic patterns, and the message sent by those bottles has been troubling the world’s winemakers for years. On one level, this is purely a question of quality and style. With grapes accumulating high levels of sugar (and therefore potential alcohol when they ferment) much sooner than they used to, as vintages get hotter – and way before the other elements, the tannins and the polyphenols that give wine its complex flavours, are ready – winemakers have a dilemma. They can either harvest much earlier, sacrificing complexity for acceptable alcohol levels, or produce wines with an undrinkable alcoholic force. With each new record-breaking hot summer and earliest-ever vintage, the long-term viability of whole swathes of the wine world is called into question – grape varieties, the location of vineyards, access to dwindling supplies of water,the ability to produce wines in anything like the same style, quantity and quality. As the great Californian wine producer Randall Grahm put it matter of factly to the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik earlier this year: “It’s everywhere. Burgundy may be fucked. The northern Rhône is partly fucked … the southern Rhône is fucked.” Grahm’s ambitious latest project is near Santa Cruz, an attempt to breed a new grape variety that can cope with the current Californian climate, one capable of being dry farmed (without irrigation) and to withstand heat. This is urgent, serious business in a part of the world where wildfires have destroyed thousands of acres of vineyards, and taken many lives and livelihoods, in the past two years – and where nobody is treating climate change as a funny sign-off on the news. From £6, Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s The vast Torres operation was quick to identify the challenges posed by climate change, investing millions in research into carbon capture, water efficiency and relocation of its vineyards to protect the future of wines such as this ever-green, bargain dry white. From £28, leaandsandeman.co.uk; langhamwine.co.uk There’s no doubt that changes in the English climate so far have been helpful to sparkling winemakers, enabling them to ripen pinot noir, chardonnay and pinot meunier consistently and make such outstandingly balanced nuanced, berry-scented wines as this. £11.99, Waitrose Irrigation of vines has been seen as essential in many warm-climate regions, but as the resource has become increasingly precious, many are looking to dry-farm. This racy, crunchy, redcurrant-tangy red from old cinsault vines in southern Chile is proof of the possibilities. From £12.75, farehamwinecellar.co.uk; ampswinemerchants.co.uk; cambridgwine.com In south Australia, many producers are responding to rising temperatures by switching to grapes of southern-European heritage, leading, in this blend of France’s cabernet and Portugal’s touriga, to a deliciously violet-scented, darkly fruited, chunky red. From £10, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Tesco Port producer Paul Symington spoke gloomily of “the existential threat” posed by climate change to wine production in the Douro Valley at a recent conference, making his family’s glossy and sumptuous Graham’s LBV now officially an endangered species. £19.95, tanners-wines.co.uk As in England, changes in the climate have had some positive effects in cool, northerly Germany, with fewer bad (cold, wet) vintages than in the past. Whether the country will still be capable of producing such intricate, lacy, delicate riesling as this in 2050 is a whole other question, however.

"As humans put more and more heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, the Earth warms. And the warming is causing changes that might surprise us. Not only is the warming causing long-term trends in heat, sea level rise, ice loss, etc.; it’s also making our weather more variable. It’s making otherwise natural cycles of weather more powerful. Perhaps the most important natural fluctuation in the Earth’s climate is the El Niño process. El Niño refers to a short-term period of warm ocean surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific, basically stretching from South America towards Australia. When an El Niño happens, that region is warmer than usual. If the counterpart La Niña occurs, the region is colder than usual. Often times, neither an El Niño or La Niña is present and the waters are a normal temperature. This would be called a “neutral” state.  The ocean waters switch back and forth between El Niño and La Niña every few years. Not regularly, like a pendulum, but there is a pattern of oscillation. And regardless of which part of the cycle we are in (El Niño or La Niña), there are consequences for weather around the world. For instance, during an El Niño, we typically see cooler and wetter weather in the southern United States while it is hotter and drier in South America and Australia. It’s really important to be able to predict El Niño/La Niña cycles in advance. It’s also important to be able to understand how these cycles will change in a warming planet. Fortunately, a study just published in Geophysical Research Letters helps answer that question. The authors include Dr. John Fasullo from the National Center for Atmospheric Research and his colleagues. El Niño cycles have been known for a long time. Their influence around the world has also been known for almost 100 years. It was in the 1920s that the impact of El Niño on places as far away as the Indian Ocean were identified. Having observed the effects of El Niño for a century, scientists had the perspective to understand something might be changing.  For example, in 2009–2010, intense drought and heat waves gripped the Amazon region – far greater than expected based on the moderate El Niño at the time. In addition, from 2010 to 2011, severe drought and heat waves hit the southern USA, coinciding with a La Niña event. Other extreme weather in the US, Australia, Central and Southern America, and Asia stronger than would be expected from El Niño’s historical behavior have raised concerns that our El Niño weather may be becoming “supercharged.” To see if something new was happening, the authors of this paper looked at the relationship between regional climate and the El Niño/La Niña status in climate model simulations of the past and future. They found an intensification of El Niño/La Niña impacts in a warmer climate, especially for land regions in North America and Australia. Changes between El Niño/La Niña in other areas, like South America, were less clear. The intensification of weather was more prevalent over land regions.  So, what does this mean? It means if you live in an area that is affected by an El Niño or La Niña, the effect is likely becoming magnified by climate change. For instance, consider California. There, El Niño brings cool temperatures with rains; La Niña brings heat and dry weather. Future El Niños will make flooding more likely while future La Niñas will bring more drought and intensified wildfire seasons. Unsurprisingly, we’re already seeing these effects, with record wildfires in California fueled by hot and dry weather. We are now emerging from a weak La Niña, so we would expect only a modest increase in heat and dryness in California. But the supercharging of the La Niña connection is likely making things worse. We would have California wildfires without human-caused global warming, but they wouldn’t be this bad. Dr. Fasullo nicely summarized the findings of the paper: We can’t say from this study whether more or fewer El Niños will form in the future — or whether the El Niños that do form will be stronger or weaker in terms of ocean temperatures in the Pacific. But we can say that an El Niño of a given magnitude that forms in the future is likely to have more influence over our weather than if the same El Niño formed 50 years ago. And this conclusion can be extended to many other situations around the planet. Human pollution is making our Earth’s natural weather switch more strongly from one extreme to another. It’s a weather whiplash that will continue to get worse as we add pollution to the atmosphere. Fortunately, every other country on the planet (with the exception of the US leadership) understands that climate change is an important issue and those countries are taking action. It isn’t too late to change our trajectory toward a better future for all of us. But the time is running out. The Earth is giving us a little nudge by showing us, via today’s intense weather, what tomorrow will be like if we don’t take action quickly."
"There is a tacky interface between industry and government when it comes to public health or the environment, and it is abundantly clear that Brexit is fatally shifting the balance towards deregulation (“Green watchdog will lack bite after Brexit”, News). It is no coincidence that the most prominent Brexiters are also climate change deniers because they perceive climate change legislation as a major threat to industrial profit. This is the reason that the Department of Energy and Climate Change was dissolved, the reason that climate change has been omitted from the remit of the government’s new green watchdog, and the reason that Brexiters fulminate against the Climate Change Act.  The ruinous aspect of their delusion is that climate change offers huge opportunities to UK businesses that invest in energy efficiency, clean energy or ultra-low emission transport, as these new technologies can then be exported, something that Brexiters are apparently keen to promote. Instead, the government has scrapped zero-carbon buildings, abandoned the tidal barrage in Swansea Bay and frozen the fuel escalator, thus encouraging the rapid growth of diesel vehicles. The chancellor boasted that this had saved motorists £47bn over the past seven years. Unfortunately, air pollution has cost the NHS £140bn over the same period and 280,000 premature deaths. How tragic that Brexit generates politicians of such limited vision who can only look backwards.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue the PlanetMarlow, Bucks In Robin McKie’s article about social drinking (“Why social drinking is an ancient ritual”, Focus), you may be interested to know that the photograph of “drinkers in a hotel bar in 1939” featured my mother, Camille Cowtan (nee Silvera), at the age of 22 years. She is now 101 years old and in good health, residing in a nursing home in Stockport, Greater Manchester. Perhaps this backs up the theory that social drinking can be beneficial.Susan EhrenzweigLondon N12  James Hawes on the far right in Germany reminds me of a guided tour in 1982 in Czechoslovakia (“Germany’s far right never went away, but festered in its eastern stronghold”, Comment). The minibus group was a mix of British and West German tourists. The Czech guide, when we arrived at Lidice, mentioned that her mother had died in Auschwitz. I asked how she felt about dealing with the West Germans. She responded that the West Germans were fine as they had faced up to their past. She feared the East Germans because they had never been “de-Nazified”. Thirty-six years later, reunification hasn’t changed that mindset.Jennifer HenleyLondon W5 Kenan Malik is right to note that some aid is guided less by poverty than by geopolitical and strategic interests (“As a system, foreign aid is a fraud and does nothing for inequality”, Comment). However, the piece doesn’t mention the importance of “quality” in aid. When aid is good quality it makes a real change in the lives of poor and marginalised people. When aid is bad quality, it fails to tackle poverty and work for those it was meant to help. For aid to live up to what’s expected of it – for it to be “real” aid – it must bespent in the areas and on the people most in need. It must prioritise those it is intended for, be properly monitored and offer value for money. And it must be transparent, so spending can be tracked. Almost all UK aid meets this definition. In recent years, UK aid has helped to vaccinate 37.5 million children, and a further 11.4 million children receive a decent education. The public are attuned to this and support aid that is good quality. When a tabloid howls at “wasted aid”, the programme in question is rarely “real” aid addressing poverty. Far from “entrenching inequality”, real UK aid makes a difference to the lives of millions.Romilly GreenhillUK director, the ONE CampaignLondon WC2 I would like to clarify some points about the Press, a newspaper in West Yorkshire that featured in an article last week (“The far-right activist and the editor: how paper is ‘sowing division’ where an MP died”, News). The story appeared to confuse editorial comment with news reporting in respect of opinion columns. Editorial comment is free to be more partisan within certain legal restrictions. I was responsible for newsgathering at the Press from March 2011 to August 2016. The news reporting was factual, impartial and written in a neutral tone. It also had an investigative side, centred on public affairs journalism. Great effort was made to report facts accurately. There was no twisting or spinning to suit an agenda – and any alleged mistakes were certainly not intentional. The responsibilities were taken seriously. Any problems with the factual nature of the reporting were corrected immediately online and then in the next print edition. Issues were also looked at from as many sides as possible. These ranged from trade union officials to environmental campaigners, councillors of all political parties, headteachers and hospital managers among many sources. And, yes, that did mean contacting extremist groups on occasions and recording their views accurately. Also, the newspaper covers not just Batley, where it is based, but other places including Dewsbury, its former home.David MillerBirstall, BatleyWest Yorkshire School authorities, parents and students should be advised that there is an alternative perspective to that peddled by the barbarous defence/war industry (“Who spends millions to push its brand in our schools? The world’s arms industry”, News investigation). The arms trade is an inefficient use of vast resources, manufacturing harmful products. The manufacturer’s balance sheet and the country’s GDP state that it is profitable. Measured in money, the value of adverse production is calculated to be equal to prosperous production: a problem of economics deeming all production to be wealth creation and of positive value, even when contrary to the (international) common good. Arguably, because of the absence of any benefit for the target/human life/civilisation/environment, the manufacturing process is destroying existing wealth and, in so doing, devaluing the money used as the measure. The arms trade is negative value production that adversely affects international currencies as well as life, living standards and the natural world.Geoff NaylorColden CommonWinchester, Hants"
"After a long, hot summer beset by record temperatures, drought and deadly fires, imagine my shock, on returning to the European parliament, to be confronted with a report that denies the reality of climate change. Given it could influence the allocation of the next round of environment funding under the EU’s Life programme, it is deeply disturbing to see such a report, based on wholly discredited science, wending its way down the corridors of Brussels. Some of the claims made by the report’s author, the Ukip MEP Stuart Agnew, are, frankly, pretty hair-raising. For instance, he claims that the effect of CO2 levels on our climate is “negligible”, and that it is “one of agriculture’s greatest friends”. Agnew claims there is a lack of concentration of CO2 and as a result there is no problem for the EU to solve.  So how could it be that someone with a track record of shameful ignorance of the science of climate change ends up being assigned the task of compiling this report? Unbelievably, the decision to appoint Agnew was met with support from Christian Democrat, Conservative and Liberal members of the European parliament’s agriculture committee, while the Socialists and Democrats, supported by the Greens, attempted to challenge the decision to give Agnew the leading role. Quite rightly, in response to this news, climate experts have reacted with disbelief and anger. Bob Ward, from the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and environment at the London School of Economics, said: “There is not a single scientific institution in the world that would agree with this daft assessment. This document demonstrates how Ukip’s climate change denial is putting at risk the lives and livelihoods of people in the UK and across the European Union.” Dave Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, also ridiculed the report: “The hackneyed, pseudo-scientific arguments here would make the dinosaurs blush. This will be a wonderful resource when [my students] discuss the ill-informed ideas that bounce around the echo chamber of climate change denial.” What this fiasco reveals is the huge threat to rational climate action posed by the rise of the far right. It also shows the risks from Brexit, as the links between climate denial and Brexit are well documented. For example,the long-standing supporter of Brexit and arch-neoliberal Nigel Lawson founded the Global Warming Policy Foundation to oppose climate change mitigation policies. He labelled the Kyoto protocol “wrongheaded”, and has called for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to be shut down. Lawson may be considered an irrelevant dinosaur, though he still manages to platform his nonsense at regular intervals on the BBC. But the man who Conservative MP Anna Soubry declared was now running the country, the hardline Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, has blamed high energy prices on “climate alarmism” and has said it was unrealistic for scientists to project future climate changes, just as it was difficult for meteorologists to correctly predict the weather. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage, adding to a litany of ill-informed comments on climate change, earlier this year declared that the “beast from the east” was proof that global warming wasn’t real. And of course, favouring supposed “alternative facts” on climate change is a prejudice shared by other far-right groups, most notably Donald Trump’s circle. Given the dangers posed by the far right and the very real threat of a significant bloc of populist, climate change-denying MEPs after next year’s European elections, it is time for those of us who back the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change to take back control. That is why I joined other politicians, scientists, academics and campaigners in signing a letter pledging we would refuse to debate those who deny that human-caused climate change is real. We can no longer give voice to the pseudo-science of climate change deniers; we must urgently move the debate on to how we address the causes and effects of dangerous climate breakdown. The large right and centre-right groups in the European parliament could and should have blocked Ukip from taking charge of a report on climate change. We can only hope that the mainstream groups in parliament – right, left and centre – that are likely to continue to control the majorities will show a greater degree of responsibility in future. • Molly Scott Cato is the Green MEP for the south-west of England"
"New petrol and diesel car sales in Europe must be phased out before 2030 if the auto sector is to play its part in holding global warming to the Paris agreement’s 1.5C goal, a new analysis has found. Forecourt plug-in hybrids will also have to disappear by 2035 at the latest, according to analysis by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), commissioned by Greenpeace. Vehicle emissions have barely changed over the last decade and the industry will exhaust its carbon budget within five to 10 years unless there is a radical shift, the DLR scientists say. “Auto CO2-emissions need to peak as soon as possible,” Prof Horst Friedrich, DLR’s director, told the Guardian. “Looking at the dwindling carbon budget it is crucial to push low-emitting cars into the market, the earlier the better, to renew the fleet.” The study warns that “stark measures” would be needed to do this with a 66% chance of meeting the 1.5C goal – including a drop in conventional car sales from around 15m this year to 5m in 2022. Under this scenario, the last vehicle with an internal combustion engine would be sold in 2028 and diesel and petrol powered-cars would be banished from the roads by the mid-2040s. Behavioural change towards walking, cycling and public transport would also be necessary. “It would be much easier to keep a 2C target because there is a higher carbon budget and therefore more time to implement the necessary measures,” Friedrich said. “I estimate it could provide us with up to 10 years more time to prepare much better for the fundamental transformations necessary.” A draft report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes clear that 2C of warming would expose around 10 million more people in coastal areas to floods, storm surges and crop damage than 1.5C would. Global sea levels would also rise by an extra 10cm, heatwaves would be longer, extreme weather events stronger, economic growth lower, while crop yields and water availability would substantially decline. So far, the European commission has proposed a 30% cut in vehicle emissions by 2030, although MEPs are pushing to raise that figure to 45%. The UK government has announced that sales of all new petrol and diesel vehicles will be banned by 2040, while some countries including Germany, Ireland, India and the Netherlands have set a more ambitious deadline of 2030. Energy utilities have often led calls for greater ambition and Kristian Ruby, the secretary general of Eurelectric, the power sector trade association, said that the current EU proposal was “not in line with the Paris objectives”. He told the Guardian: “The timeline of a full phase out by 2030 does sound quite ambitious. Car makers are only ramping up now for around 20 new electric models that will come to market next year. But this needs to happen, and faster than currently seen by the European commission. There is no doubt about that.” Some analysts also believe that Europe’s car manufacturers have made no real-world improvement in auto CO2 emissions for five years, because of the “gaming” of emissions tests. A spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said: “It is still hard to predict whether the alternative powertrains will have gained a significantly high market share by 2030. This is dependent on factors that are outside the control of automobile manufacturers, such as the necessary recharging infrastructure being in place as well appropriate incentives.”"
"Hundreds of thousand of people in more than 90 countries are expected to take part in demonstrations this weekend to protest about the failure of politicians to tackle the global environmental crisis. Organisers say more than 800 events – from marches to street theatre, acts of civil disobedience to mini festivals – will take place in towns and cities amid growing frustration at the lack of meaningful political action over the emerging climate breakdown.  Nick Bryer from campaign group 350.org which is organising the event said: “Politicians are failing. They are still protecting the interests of the fossil fuel companies over the interests of people, despite mounting evidence of the devastation these companies and this system is causing the planet.” He said the day of global demonstrations was about people around the world “rising up and demanding a different cause of action, a different future which puts people and a sustainable future before the interests of these huge corporations”. In the UK there are events organised in cities from London to Wigan, Bradford to Durham. Jane Thewlis, from Fossil Free West Yorkshire, is organising an event in Bradford. “We have a brilliant jazz band the Peace Artistes which are well known round here and the focus is divestment and a celebration of what has already been achieved from New York to Ireland.” Thewlis said the group were campaigning to persuade the five West Yorkshire councils to divest their pension funds from fossil fuels and hoped the event would galvanise support – especially among young people. “There will be several young people speaking, many of them associated with a group called Hope Rising which is based on a local council estate.” Thewlis said the same policies that are damaging the lives of poor people in Bradford were driving the destruction of the planet and killing marginalised people around the world.

We hope that these young people will form their own environmental group following the event and build a sustainable movement.” One of the biggest protests is expected in Paris where up to 100,000 people are expected. Events in other European cities including Copenhagen, Brussels and Lisbon are also expected to attract tens of thousands of protesters. The events come ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit that starts in San Fransisco next week and will see politicians and city leaders from around the world gather to discuss the climate crisis."
