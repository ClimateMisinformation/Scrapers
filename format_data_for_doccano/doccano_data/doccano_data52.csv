"To be rich is a thing that many in our society spend their whole lives striving for. Not having to worry about money and indeed, splashing it on designer clothes, chains of diamonds and private planes is seen by some to be the ultimate dream. But life like this comes at more of a cost than we realise. To coincide with the 2017 World Economic Forum, Oxfam published a new report, which claimed that the eight richest people in the world control the same wealth as half of the world’s population. A vital debate certainly – and yet not the only one that needs to be had.  We know that “wealthy” countries in Europe, North America and parts of Asia have higher per-capita environmental burdens than poorer countries, and that the people of the former are living beyond the bio-physical boundaries – the limits of the environment – in order to do so. But those at the top levels of these countries are practising lifestyles with even higher environmental consequences, enabled by their own wealth. In an average mature economy like the UK’s, the ecological footprint is 6.69 global hectares per person. That means if everybody in the world had this lifestyle we would need 3.7 planets to support us all. Yes, there are those who are living with a smaller footprint, but that is not a life the majority are striving for. The wealthy few who embrace luxurious and extravagant lifestyles impose a great burden on the environment because they acquire so many possessions, and then use them in particularly profligate ways. Many have private jets and super-yachts. Of course, those of us who are not in the elite minority could just be envious of those with affluent lifestyles. Or maybe many of those at the top have been deflecting or otherwise containing the debate, side-steppping it as they are so often accused of doing with taxation. It may even be that we all ignore the environmental consequences because modern society sees the “jet-set” lifestyle as one to aspire to, not denigrate. Perhaps all of us have some guilt in the knowledge that we too have recklessly extravagant elements to our lives, and that these may be rather difficult to change.  The luxury consumption and sustainability debate is one that Plato had back in 380 BC. But then, the threats of climate change and other environmental issues were not so pressing.  Now, the future of the planet relies on humans worldwide creating policies to mitigate our own environmental burdens. But by targeting those affluent lifestyles which are doing more ecological damage, we might be able to address the disproportionate cost. However, it is not as easy as saying we need to limit how many mansions one person owns; there are several components to the ecological burdens of wealth. Neither is this something that can be expressed simply by looking at above-average carbon emissions – though that certainly is one important dimension.  Take a look at this example: the annual average personal carbon footprint was 7.3 tonnes in 2010, and yet the estimated sustainable footprint we should all have by 2050 is 1.5 tonnes per annum. A Learjet private plane, flying on one trip from Aspen, Colorado to San Francisco – 1,386.6km (861 miles) – would, according to our calculations, have CO₂ emissions of 4,411.8kg. By contrast, driving the average car 10,000km (6,213 miles) over a year would emit about 1,600kg of CO₂. But to live an affluent lifestyle, one does more than hop on a jet. There are the houses, cars, boats, clothes, jewellery, technology – money is no object so there is no limit to the amount of objects one can possess.  You might be wondering how simply owning a lot of “things” can damage the environment. One way to understand this is through the ecological rucksack concept. This measures the total quantity in kilograms of materials moved from nature to create a product or service, minus the actual weight of the product. Aluminium, for example has a rucksack “factor” of 85:1, so 85kg of material is required to make 1kg of aluminium. Diamonds on the other hand have a factor of 53,000:1.  Though we all know what a standard lifestyle of the rich looks like nowadays, in truth the ecological footprint is largely unknown beyond the individual acts we can analyse. We could be dangerously underestimating the damage that a handful of people are doing to the environment, and not properly mitigating it.  This is not just a call for research into affluent lifestyles, we must name and shame those who are being reckless with the environment for the sake of themselves, and instigate policy action to stop them.  Eight billionaires might not account for half of the world’s environmental problems – and perhaps they do a lot of good, too – but the ecological burdens they create are surely greater than eight subsistence farmers in India. And it is about time we knew just how much more damage they are doing."

Tornado frequency. Source NOAA
To fool the public, German ZDF public television here, Germany’s version of the BBC, sought out “one of Germany’s most renown climate scientists” Prof Mojib Latif of the IFM-GEOMAR, Kiel, the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences. Latif is often a frequent guest on radio and television whenever the climate topic arises in Germany.
The interview actually was quite good, until the 2:25 mark. Latif did a good job explaining why tornadoes occur very often in Tornado Alley, and why early warning systems are difficult.
But any skeptic watching could feel the TV anchorman and Latif were building up to the climate-change moment, which came at the 2:25 mark. At this point the interview turned into the usual state-sponsored climate propaganda circus.
The anchorman asks:
Herr Latif, just briefly on climate change. Do you expect an increase in frequency because of climate change or is there no relationship?”
Latif answers, making another one of his famous laughing stock predictions:

Yeah, at the moment we cannot see it. As I said these are rare events and the data just are not sufficient. But I suspect that when global warming continues over the course of decades, then such weather situations with very severe thunderstorms will occur more frequently, and then the frequency for tornadoes will be higher than what the case is today.”
The anchorman replies:
Thank you very much for that estimation, and this is actually no good news for these people in Tornado Alley.”
Plain as day, complete BS from ZDF and Prof Latif. There’s data out there, but not the kind that the ZDF and Latif want to see, or us to see. Here it is for readers:

Plot of NOAA data.
How Latif comes up with the idea that we should expect more tornadoes as warming and CO2 increases is a mystery to me.
Then again in the year 2000 (April 1st) Latif made the notorious prediction that snow and hard frosts would become rare in Germany in the wintertime. The exact opposite has happened. In fact, snow is the forecast for parts of Germany today, and it’s May 22!
Why can’t these people just be honest for once, and skip the constant BS. These people need to be fired.

"Semi-naked environmental campaigners have been drenched in fake oil at the National Portrait Gallery to protest against its sponsorship by BP. To the surprise of visitors on Sunday afternoon, activists from Extinction Rebellion wearing just underwear suddenly assumed the foetal position while others poured the “oil” on their bodies in the Ondaatje Wing main hall, where a collection of pieces sponsored by BP is on display.  The protest performance piece, titled Crude Truth, was to mark the end of the BP Portrait Award exhibition. After a monologue by clothed protester Eden, 19, calling on arts organisations to sever ties with companies “funding extinction”, one activist led a brief chant of “NPG, drop BP”. “Who will there be left to see, who will there be left to paint, if we have no earth and no people?” recited Eden. “We cannot be artists on a dead planet. Oil means the end, but art means the beginning.” The three activists covered in black liquid lay down for about five minutes on a plastic sheet before standing up again, wiping themselves down with towels, and cleaning up. Gallery workers had appeared to briefly close the doors to the room. However, the action, which was applauded by onlookers, passed uninterrupted. The UK group of Extinction Rebellion has three core demands: 1) Tell the truthThe government must tell the truth about the scale of the ecological crisis by declaring a climate emergency, “working with other groups and institutions to communicate the urgent need for change”. 2) Net zero emissions by 2025The UK must drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions, hitting net zero by 2025. 3) Citizens’ assemblyThe government must create a citizens’ assembly to hear evidence and devise policy to tackle the climate crisis. Citizens’ assemblies bring together ordinary people to investigate, discuss and make recommendations on how to respond, in this case, to the ecological emergency. In the US activists have added a further demand: “A just transition that prioritises the most vulnerable and indigenous sovereignty [and] establishes reparations and remediation led by and for black people, indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice.” Matthew Taylor One of the activists said the government and the cultural establishment were not working fast enough to deal with the climate emergency. “We need everyone to do what they can,” said Samantha, 37. “The Portrait Gallery is very influential and they need to be leading the way on these issues. But instead they’re doing the opposite by being sponsored by a company who is living in the past when we have the technological knowhow to make renewable energies.”Tommy, 18, also among the activists who took part in the performance, said: “It’s atrocious that BP can try to cover themselves up by investing in art. No one should work alongside them. The oil poured into oceans is killing animals.” Other activists handed out literature criticising oil extraction plans and BP’s contribution to climate change. Security guards arrived after about 15 minutes, once the protesters had left. The three decades of support the institution has received from BP is celebrated on display boards in the gallery. The National Portrait Gallery said BP’s support for its portrait award encouraged the work of artists around the world and allowed for free admission to the exhibition, which had drawn more than 300,000 visitors this year. “The ongoing debate around BP’s sponsorship of the arts raises important questions about both the environment and arts funding, and we are listening carefully to voices on all sides,” it said in a statement.  On Friday, Extinction Rebellion protested outside BP’s headquarters with members of the Free West Papua campaign group, while the company reportedly delivered a report on its activities in the Indonesian province. The Royal Shakespeare Company this month announced it would end its sponsorship deal with BP amid growing public discontent with its eight-year relationship with the oil multinational. Tate ended its relationship with BP in 2016. In February, activists occupied the British Museum to protest against BP sponsorship highlight how the company lobbied the British government to help it gain access to Iraq’s oil reserves prior to the war in the country. The institution later rejected calls to sever its ties with BP. Almost 1,800 people were arrested over the past two weeks of Extinction Rebellion demonstrations, with activists blockading the BBC, preventing trains from departing and defacing government buildings."
"Beef from Brazil, avocados from Mexico, lamb from New Zealand, wines from South Africa and green beans from Kenya – food shopping lists have a distinctly international flavour. And with many questioning the sustainability of importing so much food from so far away, we are beginning to ask if switching to a vegetarian diet to cut emissions caused by meat production is as sustainable as one might think. The influence of the global trade of food on local diets and cultural choices has exploded over recent years. Food supply chains operate globally and deliver rural produce to nearly 4 billion people now living in cities and towns. It was this principle that established the world’s first agricultural research station some 150 years ago when the founders of Rothamsted saw the potential of the agricultural land surrounding London to supply a growing urban population. In the 21st century, the whole world can be your bread basket.   Many are conscious of what they eat – both from a health and environmental perspective. But what is the impact of this? We’re increasingly encouraged to eat less meat to tackle climate change. And meat consumption, in the European Union at least, has reduced and stabilised at around 42m tonnes over the last 15 years. There are also now new labels for different types of meat eaters: flexitarians (only eat meat sometimes) or the reducetarian (aim to eat less meat) that reflect the ways different groups are trying to cut down.  But what about all those fruit, vegetable and staples crossing the globe – can we really label them as more sustainable than eating meat? The growth of ethical food purchases now make up close to 10% of grocery purchases in the UK, which is double that of tobacco. But in addition to the impact of air miles, global land and resource use determine the sustainability of the food we eat – food production can destroy or displace natural resources in order to supply growing demand. Changing land use to expand avocado production in Mexico, for example, is displacing the rainforest. Or the devastating impact of non-certificated palm oil, used in food but also a whole host of other products. And then there is the issue of food wastage. However, the first thing we need to be able to do is measure the environmental impact of the food we eat. We can do this for different food supply chains using carbon footprinting methods. The difficulty is that consumers choose foods based on what they like – and this frequently changes but rarely considers the impact of climate change.  From this we can say that a vegetarian diet does deliver a decreased carbon footprint. But it also shows us that food miles and global distribution can be the least of our problems. This is because food wastage can be up to 20% of food purchases and food losses across the supply chain can be far greater than this. Food waste in turn increases the carbon footprint which counters the positive gains. And perishable fresh fruit and vegetables are more likely to be thrown away than fresh meat and fish. Ultimately, we cannot say that eating a vegan or vegetarian or meat diet is any better for the environment. This is because all can be appropriate if production systems are sustainable, there is no waste and positive health outcomes are achieved. There are clearly trade-offs in choosing foods. Air freighting of green beans from Kenya into the UK was seen as unsustainable because of air miles but it also supports up to 1.5m people and livelihoods in some of the poorest regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. It’s not just meat that increase greenhouse gases. Rice – produced on 163m hectares, around 12% of the global arable area – has one of the greatest plant carbon footprints because it produces a lot of methane. But a fall in production of rice is not only unlikely, it could also disrupt greenhouse gases held in the soil. But there are different ways to do things – draining off paddies at particular times in the growing season, for example. Or using different fertilisers or rice varieties that are less susceptible to the heat.    Consumers need to understand trade-offs and to keep up to date on information of what is best to buy. It is important to spot food trends, for example, and project any sustainability impacts. The number of gluten-free products available is doubling year-on-year in Europe and the US. This has resulted in an increase in the consumption of plant proteins from beans and lentils. These kinds of foods are arguably more eco-friendly than meat but – whatever your thoughts about gluten-free eating – it will change how protein crops are distributed globally and may divert pulses or increase the price of them for countries such as India that depend of non-livestock proteins.  Sustainability certifications have changed how we shop, giving us guidance on ethical purchases including sustainable fishing, rainforest produce and so on. This is one way to make sure that what you eat is less damaging and/or helps sustain livelihoods and good agricultural practices.  But it is day-to-day food waste – both at home and in supply chains – that can make any diet unsustainable whether you choose to be vegan, vegetarian, a meat eater or a combination of these. Different preservation formats can reduce food waste to zero. In the case of frozen food we know food waste can be halved compared with fresh foods – less of it is thrown away. Despite what you might think, frozen compares well to fresh and can be just as nutritious. We all choose foods based on what we like, what we can access and what we can afford. But continued surveillance and interest in sustainable production will mean we can buy produce we know has a better supply chain. There isn’t currently a certification that shows food produced with less waste (there should be), but we can aim to cut down our own and keep up with suppliers who show better commitments.  We might have an avocado – but maybe not five in a week. And of course we can source more food locally and seasonally as well as considering preserved options if we want to cut down on air miles. Like eating less meat, there are ways to make your footprint better."

"Andrea Leadsom recently delivered a keynote speech on the future of British agriculture to a farming conference in Oxford – which was exactly what you’d expect the UK environment minister to do amid the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Unfortunately, her agenda-setting address opened with the following mistake: For an industry that’s been around as long as mankind itself, farming has been at the centre of human achievement. While there is no reason to expect our national leadership to be well versed in human prehistory and evolution, it would be good to think that some of the fundamentals of our trajectory on this planet were a little better understood.  Crucially, I’d argue, understanding where agriculture as a basis of human subsistence fits into the narrative of human development might have important implications for how, at both national and international levels, the past and future impacts of farming might be better understood. So first some basics. The term “mankind” is a dated and gendered term that has no place in public discourse. The language of “man the hunter”, “man the toolmaker”, “Neanderthal Man” or “Rhodesian Man” should just be consigned to the history books as part of an anthropological vocabulary which did much to separate our species along ever finer lines of division. We should talk about humans and humanity, and that’s what I am going to do here. Now when we consider how long humans have been around, we get to play a little with definitions. If we want to be generous and welcoming to other closely related – but now extinct – species of relatively large-brained, tool-using, bipedal primates we might extend the definition of humanity to include all species of the genus Homo. On the basis of current fossil evidence this might take us back to 2.7m years ago. If we wish to exclude Homo habilis, Homo erectus, antecessor, heidelbergensis, neanderthalensis, floriensis, and all other non-modern humans, from that definition we might focus on our own species Homo sapiens, which we can trace in the fossil record for around some 200,000 years. Working with either extreme of this definition (or any definition of humanity you might care to use in between), the domestication of plant and animal species – which define farming as mentioned by Leadsom – dates only to around 12,000 years ago.  So, however you choose to look at it, agriculture is a very recent addition to the repertoire of human subsistence, say between 1% and 5% of our time on the planet, depending on our definition of “human”. I’d argue that understanding this fact is really important if we are going to manage our continued existence on the planet. In terms of the UK environment agriculture arrived, quite possibly, with colonising populations from France around 6,000 years ago. The arrival of Neolithic culture in the British Isles brought to the end a landscape which, until that time, had responded only to the rhythms of global climate change, wild herbivore grazing and the activities of the hunting and gathering populations of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods. Agriculture, as it grew, spread and intensified across Britain and brought with it the same transformations in human society and environment which we see with its appearance elsewhere on the planet – big changes in forest cover, soil erosion rates, hydrology, human population levels and social dynamics. The adoption and spread of agriculture therefore underpinned a remarkable and rapid transformation of human society and the natural environment of the planet. Humanity, which evolved alongside quite dramatic cycles of global climate change for 3m years, has emerged in the few millennia since the adoption of farming as a significant force in shaping our planet’s future and have begun its first tentative steps on other planetary bodies.  Understanding quite how rapidly this change has come about in evolutionary time is important. The perspective, which the environment minister appears to share, which sees agriculture and the societies and technology predicated on farming as some immeasurably old and stable human condition does not help us put impact of modern agriculture on the planet in a useful perspective.  Along the human timeline, farming should be seen as a relatively recent innovation – and I have little doubt it will form one of the key defining, planet-changing features of the Anthropocene era we have entered. It is therefore important to recognise how recent, in evolutionary time, the appearance of human agricultural societies are and what a truly transformative process engineering parts of the planet’s surface for crops and livestock has been.  Human societies are reliant on, and have been transformed by, agriculture – and there is no going back. To continue to expand and intensify global agriculture without safeguards to the environment – or without fully understanding our impact on the planet – is to stumble blindly and dangerously into the future.  Similarly, disregarding the trajectory of our prehistoric past, and failing to appreciate just how radical the changes of the past 12,000 years have been for our species, leaves us open to complacency at a time when we can afford to be anything but."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAlarmists take notice!
Hans von Storch’s blogsite Klimazwiebel has a good excellent article written by one of the world’s leading meteorologists, Lennart Bengtsson, who writes that the alarmist hype needs to be toned down, and that the problem of energy be taken more seriously.

Lennart Bengtsson, a warmist, is the former director of Germany’s Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, which unfortunately has recently turned emotional and alarmist on the topic of climate change.
Here are some cherry-picked excerpts that pretty much set the tone of the article:
“Natural processes drive climate and practically all kinds of extreme weather have always been part of the climate and are practically unrelated to the modest warming we so far have had. The effect of increasing greenhouse gases is a slow but relentless process that will have to be dealt with but will require more time and better insight in key processes.”
“Since the end of the 19th century the global warming amounts to about ¾ °C. This is a very modest increase…”
“The lack of any significant warming in the tropical troposphere since the beginning of space observations in 1979 is particularly intriguing in particular as present models show a warming trend over the same time of 0.3-0.4°C in the average, figure 2.”
“…global warming has been taken out of the hands of the meteorologists and traditional climatologists and is now run by professional media experts…”
“…very emotional climate debate today…hardly possible to have a sensible and balanced exchange of views. If you do not support climate catastrophes…you are placed into a deniers box... Some of our colleagues are exposed to a powerful group pressure, …”
For Greenpeace and the WWF, “a threatening climate warming have become a necessity and a source of extra income.”
“…feedbacks of the climate system dominate the outcome but are unfortunately so far not well handled by models…”
“…climate is in fact warming much slower than anticipated.”

UPDATE: QUESTION TO PROF BENGTSSON FROM ED CARYL
Dear Dr. Bengtsson, Why Is it CO2 And Not The Sun?
I have several problems with the assumptions made by Lennart Bengtsson in his article Global climate change and its relevance for a global energy policy, but this one is central to the whole argument, and it is a point I raised last week in my article Global Warming Has Peaked…Set To Switch To Cooling. “If You Look At History, This Is Easy To See”. All the CAGW Climatologists make a first, and nearly only, assumption that CO2 drives the global temperature to the exclusion of anything else. I just wish to point out the similarity between his Figure 1, and my graphs below.

Figure 1 is Lennart Bengtsson’s Figure 1.

Figure 2a and 2b are my Figures 6 and 7.
The ratio of y-axis scale in Bengtsson’s Figure 1 is 0.314 °K per W/m2 for CO2 forcing, and in my figures is 0.2875 °C per W/m2 for solar forcing, a difference of less than 10%.
My question to Prof. Bengtsson: So which do you think is driving temperature? A response would be very much appreciated.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA team of scientists led by HE YuXin of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Hong Kong examined two lake cores extracted from the Tibetan Plateau in order to reconstruct the past temperature development.

Source: East_Asia_topographic_map.png: Ksiom, the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
The two cores coming from two different lakes go back 2600 and 2200 years respectively.
Here’s the paper’s abstract (my emphasis):
Considerable efforts have been made to extend temperature records beyond the instrumental period through proxy reconstructions, in order to further understand the mechanisms of past climate variability. Yet, the global coverage of existing temperature records is still limited, especially for some key regions like the Tibetan Plateau and for earlier times including the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Here we present decadally-resolved, alkenone-based, temperature records from two lakes on the northern Tibetan Plateau. Characterized by marked temperature variability, our records provide evidence that temperatures during the MWP were slightly higher than the modern period in this region. Further, our temperature reconstructions, within age uncertainty, can be well correlated with solar irradiance changes, suggesting a possible link between solar forcing and natural climate variability, at least on the northern Tibetan Plateau.

You can downnload or read the entire paper here.
Here we see that the Medieval Warm Period also very much existed in Asia, and was not just a local European phenomenon, as some scientists tried to suggest in the past. The past 2000 years have been marked by temperature variability  – despite CO2 remaining constant at about 280 ppm – with a strong correlation to solar activity.

The paper’s conclusion also adds:

Our records show that the regional temperatures during the MWP exceeded those in the recent warm period. The estimated warmth during the MWP optimum relative to the recent level could be bracketed by the ~1.9°C estimated from Lake Gahai and ~0.5°C from Lake Qinghai. Therefore, the MWP warmth was probably in a climate state beyond the climate variability captured by the recent warm period, joining a growing body of such evidence elsewhere.

The paper proposes a “possible link between solar forcing and natural variability“. My my, aren’t we surprised!

The CRU apparently is very concerned about personal data ending up in public, which is a legitimate, of course. Yet, we can’t help but think they are really much more concerned about something else, e.g. the exposure of science shenanigans and possible large-scale fraud taking place at the UEA.
Luckily Lord Christopher Monckton is watching out for the bloggers, and has kindly provided some legal advice, which I am taking the privilege of disseminating further. Naturally privacy laws vary from country to country, and so you should check them out.
Here’s Christopher Monckton’s suggested response, in the event it can be of help to anyone else:
Roger: You do not need a lawyer for this one. Reply as follows:
Gentlemen, – I have received an email from you in which you purport to act for the University of East Anglia. I do not require any lectures from this corrupt institution or from its purported lawyers about how to behave. I neither confirm nor deny having received the password to which you refer. If I choose to reproduce any emails that may become available to me, I shall exercise my own discretion and common sense without benefit of your unsolicited instruction.
Inferentially, the Climategate emails were released by a whistleblower at the University who was as horrified as are all true lovers of science at the systematic scientific corruption and fraud that is made evident in the emails. The whistleblower says he wished to warn the world that the scientific basis for the diversion of trillions from the taxpayers’ pockets to various global-warming profiteers was in doubt. I am unable to contact the whistleblower, but he has done a great service to science by releasing the emails.
In the light of your email, I shall now convey all information in my possession to an international investigation team that is scrutinizing the fraudulent aspects of climate science, including without limitation the Climategate emails. I shall be inviting the team – which includes eminent police officers specializing in the investigation of complex international frauds and organized crime – to consider the role that the University, its vice-chancellor, its head of research, its climate research unit and (in the light of your bullying email and of the University’s previous misconduct in sicking anti-terrorist police on to me) its lawyers may have played in conspiring to perpetrate and to perpetuate the fraud, whether as instigators or as accessories during or after the fact of the fraud.
You will no doubt recall the adage about the pot that called the kettle black. – Tallbloke”

"A recent Conversation piece pointed out that the British electricity mix in 2016 was the cleanest in 60 years, with record capacity from renewable energy, mainly from wind and solar power. But one problem with this great expansion in renewables is they are intermittent, meaning they depend on weather conditions such as the wind blowing or sun shining. Unlike conventional power, this means they can’t necessarily meet surges in demand. Hence many press headlines in recent years about the “lights going out”.  National Grid, the UK grid operator, has several ways of ensuring supply can always meet demand. For shorter gaps in generation, it asks electricity suppliers to run their conventional power stations at below maximum potential output and ramp up as needed.  For longer gaps, it ensures power stations, particularly gas-based ones, are kept on standby. Some stations may only be asked to generate power for between several dozen and a few hundred hours a year. Besides contributing to carbon emissions, operating power plants for such short interventions is expensive.  The question is what to do about this problem. We could build less renewable power and make conventional power “greener” instead by removing the CO₂ and burying it underground. Opinion divides on when these carbon capture technologies can be made commercially viable on a large scale. In the UK, unfortunately two government kickstarter projects have floundered due to concerns about costs and departmental disagreements. An alternative is to install very big (“grid scale”) batteries capable of storing renewable power to be released when required. This has generated a lot of interest lately. But given the costs of current battery technology, grid-scale storage requires expensive upfront investments.  While researchers study these problems, the UK is developing an alternative known as demand-side response. One aspect involves rewarding certain electricity consumers for reducing their usage at short notice. This can range from large industrial customers to smaller consumers using power for heating rooms, cooling, lighting or even refrigeration.  The other aspect of demand response involves asking customers who own equipment that can store power to help balance surges in demand. For example, the owners of a house equipped with solar panels and corresponding battery storage might reduce repayment costs on the equipment by making the battery units available to the grid. Other equipment in this category includes electric vehicles and hospital/university uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units.  Both types of demand response are happening already. Some industrial power customers and certain other companies such as hotel operators have contracts for reducing power, while National Grid has been attracting much bidder interest for power storage schemes and has some underway in parts of the country. This storage is an alternative to deploying large-scale batteries, and  promises to be much more economical if we can make it work on a large enough scale.  The problem is that these schemes get more complicated once the pool of customers gets beyond a certain size. Knowing which customers to sign up and what tariffs to offer requires understanding to what extent devices will be available and at what cost, for example.  Once a pool of customers is set up, some devices might not always be available for storage or reducing demand when needed. This needs to be factored into the calculations both to minimise grid disruption and incentivise customers to participate at these times.  There can also be undesired effects, such as large simultaneous rebounds in consumption. For example many refrigerators will draw extra power to get their internal temperature below the required level when a demand response period ends.  Finally there’s a potential major security issue: a central system that collects data about energy usage from many devices may be prone to malicious attacks and information tampering. This could undermine both grid balancing and keeping track of what customers are owed.  Emerging artificial intelligence technologies look like providing answers to these challenges. To select the best participants, for example, grid operators will be able to use sophisticated machine-learning techniques to model the behaviour of individual devices and battery storage units by reviewing data from smart meters and sensors.  Once signed up for grid storage, it should be possible to estimate the useful lifetime of a battery pack or unit by applying prognostic algorithms to its charging/discharging data. Owners will then receive appropriate compensation, plus the added incentive of knowing how long their battery will last.  When it comes to managing devices in the pool, people used to think we could use individual smart meters or control devices to feed a central server in the cloud. But meters are expensive and the short response times require the cloud server to analyse data in milliseconds, which looks unfeasible once many thousands of units are in a pool.  An alternative is to have metering devices which detect demand levels on the grid themselves and reduce power accordingly. These take pressure off the central server and it only requires metering at site level, rather than for every electrical device. But it still leaves you with a complex control problem in coordinating all these individual decisions. We at Heriot-Watt are working on a solution to this using AI-based algorithms.  Another line of AI research draws on insights from algorithmic game theory to develop reward/penalty mechanisms which ensure enough customers in the pool are willing to participate, and actually respond when necessary. Researchers are also optimistic that blockchain protocols, using the same technology as Bitcoin, could underpin a decentralised ledger system that would get round the security risk of having a single storage point for user data.   Numerous AI research groups, both in the UK and elsewhere, have been addressing these challenges, while a number of start-ups have started developing such systems in practice – relatively simple versions of machine learning are now beginning to be used, for instance. The UK has a good chance to be at the forefront of international efforts to make smarter demand response a reality over the next few years."
"In Kaziranga, a national park in north-eastern India, rangers shoot people to protect rhinos. The park’s aggressive policing is, of course, controversial, but the results are clear: despite rising demand for illegal rhino horn, and plummeting numbers throughout Africa and South-East Asia, rhinos in Kaziranga are flourishing.  Yet Kaziranga, which features in a new BBC investigation, highlights some of the conflicts that characterise contemporary conservation, as the need to protect endangered species comes into contact with the lives and rights of people who live in and around the increasingly threatened national parks. India must balance modernisation and development with protections for the rights of local people – all while ensuring its development is ecologically sustainable. To understand what’s at stake in Kaziranga, consider these three crucial issues: The BBC feature shows park rangers who have been given the license to “shoot-on-sight”, a power they have used with deadly effect. In 2015 more than 20 poachers were killed – more than the numbers of rhino poached that year.  The programme accuses the rangers of extra-judicial killings of suspected rhino poachers. This resonates with a wider trend in the use of violence in defence of the world’s protected areas and the growing use of military surveillance technologies to support the efforts of conservation agencies. In India, the Forest Department, which is responsible for the protection of wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, has always been a “uniformed” service. Rangers wear military-style khakis, are allowed to carry arms, and have powers to prosecute offenders. Recently, the government allowed them to use drones as an anti-poaching measure in Kaziranga. To justify such escalation and its talk of a “war” against poaching, the government cites the growing power and sophistication of the crime syndicates involved in the illegal wildlife trade. However, as with all wars, a serious conflict over rhinos risks collateral damage. The worry is that increased militarisation is not conducted within strict legal limits or subject to judicial scrutiny. The BBC alleges that such checks and balances were not in place in Kaziranga. The BBC story also points to the growing conflict in and around Kaziranga between the interests and rights of local and indigenous people and the need to protect threatened species. Groups including Survival International – which features in the BBC story – claim that well-meaning conservation projects have denied and undermined the rights of indigenous groups around the world. The group calls for these rights to be placed at the heart of modern approaches to conservation – and most enlightened environmentalists now agree. It’s increasingly hard to look at conservation without also considering human rights and social issues.  The context for these struggles in India is the colonial legacy of forest settlement, which reserved forests for the imperial state, but failed to take account of the rights of people who already lived there. This injustice was recognised in 2006, in landmark legislation known colloquially as the Forest Rights Act, which restored both individual and community rights based on evidence of historic access and use. Yet there remains significant tension between India’s wildlife conservation lobby, which perceives the Forest Rights Act as the death-knell for nature, and groups such as Survival International which argue that it is only by recognising the rights of local people that the country’s wildlife will be protected. To protect threatened species across the world, conservationists have called for more and more land to be placed under protection. Renowned biologist EO Wilson, for instance, wants us to set aside “half the planet”. In an unconstrained world, dedicating half the earth to the protection of the most threatened species and the world’s important habitats might seem like a sensible way to avoid the risks of what people fear might trigger the next great extinction. In reality, there are few places left where such a proposal might practically be implemented. Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in rapidly developing India. The country already has a population of 1.3 billion – and it aspires to both develop as a global economic powerhouse and lift its poorest people out of poverty. This development requires land and resources, with little space left for nature. Plans to double the size of Kaziranga means villagers are being displaced with little due process and there are documented cases of violence and even death. This is a violent “green grab”, where land is usurped for ostensibly progressive environmental objectives, but which results in the dispossession of some of the most vulnerable people on this planet. Kaziranga illustrates the dilemmas of contemporary conservation. If it is to be successful, environmentalism in India must be seen as part of the changing social and economic context, and not set itself up in opposition to these wider trends. Conservation needs to recognise the need to build bridges, sometimes with its fiercest critics. While Kaziranga is in many ways a remarkable conservation success, its costs are considerable. The forces driving the world to overuse its resources haven’t gone away, and finding sustainable futures for both people and the planet requires coalitions that work together – let’s begin with Kaziranga."

"Ready to get over your post-festive comedown by booking an escape to the sun? For many of you, that will involve flying. And while I’m sorry to put a downer on your holiday plans, there are several problems with this from a climate perspective. The first is that aviation is essentially a fossil fuel industry, one which guzzles an eye-watering 5m barrels of oil every day. Burning that fuel currently contributes around 2.5% to total carbon emissions, a proportion which could rise to 22% by 2050 as other sectors emit less. The second problem is, as Air Asia puts it, “Now everyone can fly”. And in “generation easyJet”, those who already fly, fly more than ever. This increasing demand from new and existing travellers means the number of passenger aircraft in our skies is set to double by 2035. The third problem is that unlike other sectors where there might be a greener alternative (solar not coal, LEDs not lightbulbs etc), there is currently no way to fly 8m people every day without burning lots of dirty kerosene. Aircraft are becoming more fuel-efficient, but not quickly enough to offset the huge demand in growth. Electric planes remain decades away, weighed down by batteries that can’t deliver nearly as much power per kilo as jet fuel.  But here’s the peculiar thing: although no other human activity pushes individual emission levels as fast and as high as air travel, most of us don’t stop to think about its carbon impact.  While in many countries new cars, domestic appliances, and even houses now have mandatory energy efficiency disclosures, air travel’s carbon footprint is largely invisible, despite it being relatively much bigger. For instance, a return trip from Europe to Australia creates about 4.5 tonnes of carbon. You could drive a car for 2,000 kilometres and still emit less than that. And the average per capita emissions globally is around 1 tonne. Several studies have found people to be quite ignorant of how their own flying behaviour contributes to climate change. It’s not hard to see why. Research into airline websites shows little mention of environmental impact. Green NGOs are often quiet on the issue, perhaps being reluctant to “preach” to their members to fly less, and concerned over accusations of hypocrisy as their own staff fly around the world to conferences. Political leaders are also unwilling to point the finger at passenger-voters. Indeed, Tony Blair asked as prime minister in 2005 “how many politicians facing a potential election would vote to end cheap air travel?” His answer: zero. The political strategy seems to be passing the buck to the airline industry, and hoping for the best. Aviation is a golden goose for politicians. In the UK, where sources of future post-Brexit economic growth are hard to identify, the industry looks set to continue its enviable historic growth-rate of 4-5% annually. The main problem for airlines now is finding enough space to accommodate planes at crowded airports such as Heathrow. Airlines’ seductive message to politicians is “If you build it, they will come.” And the primary reason that they will come is because flying is kept artificially cheap, while trains and cars become more expensive. The main reason for this is the so-called “Chicago Convention”, agreed in 1944 by a then much smaller air industry, which prohibits countries from imposing jet fuel tax and VAT on international flights. Taxes on other forms of transport have increased dramatically since 1944 but thanks to the convention aviation has remained almost unscathed. Things have actually moved in the other direction since the 1990s, when an influx of low-cost carriers led to big cost savings and even lower ticket prices. What is to be done? Aviation, along with shipping, was given special status and excluded from the Kyoto and Paris climate change agreements. The industry was tasked to come up with its own solutions instead. After much foot-dragging, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), finally addressed aviation emissions in 2016, proposing a market-based mechanism, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under CORSIA, countries’ airlines are given allowances to emit carbon, and if they exceed their allowances (which they will) then they must buy offsets from other sectors. Yet the plan is not nearly radical enough. It doesn’t even come into power for another decade, and it does nothing to stifle demand – unlike a carbon tax. As we can see, regulating the environmental impact of flying is a complex business. Ignorance and inaction is an appealing reaction to complexity, but we need to act before aviation gobbles up more of the increasingly small wriggle-room for emission cuts. We can try and reduce the number of flights taken, buy carbon offsets for unavoidable flights, and question the broader logic of allowing the industry to grow ad infinitum. Just using a carbon calculator to learn about the carbon impact of our sunny escapades is a good start. If citizens remain blissfully unaware of aviation emissions, then airlines and governments are unlikely to do anything about them. Alternatively, if governments ever wish to place a global carbon tax on flights, then they will need to create political “buy-in” from citizens who increasingly see cheap flights as a right."

The Sun in June 2013 – on the way to a grand minimum? New study on the possible consequences

by Frank Bosse
Solar activity has also been very modest this month. One has been able to observe only 48% of the mean value of the activity of the previous cycles for the current cycle, the sunspot number was only 52,5. Here’s how it looks graphically:

Sunspot number (SSN) versus months after the start of the cycle.
With respect to the previous month, with 78.7 it is a significant decrease. This is clear when compared to Cycle No. 5, which here has long been used as a reference for a weak 11 year Schwabe cycle. In the middle curve it is plain to see that statistically, the maximum is already passed. And in the case of the current SC24? An anyswer may be provided by the polar magnetic field of the sun, the poles reverse at the maximum:
 

Source: leif.org
The difference between the field strength of the northern and southern polar fields has clearly reversed signs, meaning the SC24’s maximum is most likely history. It had already occurred in November 1997 with a SSN of 96.7 . The comparison of the summed sunspot anomaly taking into account the the discontinuity of the counting method about 1945 shows that the current SC 24 is the weakest in almost 200 years:

In our monthly series in consideration of solar activity, a number of authors have been brought up who think it’s probable that the sun is headed for a grand minimum similar to the Maunder- Minimums of 1649-1715. That may already manifest itself in 2020. There have already been studies that attempt to project the impacts on global temperatures. Included here is a study from Meehl et al. 2013. As an input the authors look at an approximately 0.25% reduction in Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) between 2020 and 2070:

Source: Meehl et al. 2013
They fed this into a climate model. Result: global temperatures could drop around 0,2…0,3 degrees Celsius with local peak values of up to 0.8°C, especially in the middle and upper latitudes of the northern hemispheres:

Source: Figure 3c of Meehl et al. 2013. 
The model used by Meehl et al. employs a high climate sensitivity with respect to greenhouse gases, foremost CO2, and it is thus little wonder that the shown cooling with respect to the warming on top of it in the simulation only has a temporary effect and a moderate braking effect. The questions that a critical observer may ask are the following:

Is the magnitude of sensitivity with regards to GHG in the model really assured when we consider the current stagnation of global temperatures since at least 2001 – while CO2 has steadily increased?
Is the TSI in the paper, viewed as the “motor”, solely what one could expect to act or does spectral variation (especially UV) make an additional contribution? The same needs to be asked about the significantly increasing galactic cosmic radiation.

We see: Forecasts are very difficult – especially when they concern the future.”

"Global supplies of renewable electricity are growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, powered by a resurgence in solar energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) found that solar, wind and hydropower projects are rolling out at their fastest rate in four years. Its latest report predicts that by 2024 a new dawn for cheap solar power could see the world’s solar capacity grow by 600GW, almost double the installed total electricity capacity of Japan. Overall, renewable electricity is expected to grow by 1,200GW in the next five years, the equivalent of the total electricity capacity of the US. “This is a pivotal time for renewable energy,” said the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol. “Technologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind are at the heart of transformations taking place across the global energy system. Their increasing deployment is crucial for efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air pollution, and expand energy access.” The Guardian reported earlier this month that a renewable energy revolution could end the world’s rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies. Renewable energy sources make up 26% of the world’s electricity today, but according to the IEA its share is expected to reach 30% by 2024. The resurgence follows a global slowdown last year, due to falling technology costs and rising environmental concerns. However, Birol warned that the role of renewables in the global energy system would need to grow even faster if the world hopes to meet its climate targets. The report said growing climate ambitions in the European Union and the US played the biggest role in driving the IEA’s forecasts higher, but it will be China which leads the way in rolling out wind and solar energy projects. The IEA expects solar energy to play the biggest role in jumpstarting fresh growth in global renewable energy because falling costs are already below retail electricity prices in most countries. The cost of solar power is expected to decline by a further 15% to 35% by 2024, spurring further growth over the second half of the decade. The appetite of energy-hungry businesses and factories is expected to be the biggest driver of the solar power boom as company bosses exploit falling costs to help cut their energy bills. But the number of home solar panels is also expected to more than double to reach around 100m rooftops by 2024, with the strongest per capita growth in Australia, Belgium, California, the Netherlands and Austria. Even after the “spectacular” growth expected for solar over the next five years, panels will cover only 6% of the world’s available rooftops, leaving room for further growth. “Renewables are already the world’s second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,” Birol said. He warned that although the potential for solar power was “breathtaking” the rapid rollout could disrupt electricity markets unless regulators and utilities adapt."
"The sun is out, as usual, in the town of Surfside. Less than 10 miles north of Miami’s world-famous South Beach, just a square mile in size with a population near 6,000, it’s a typically prosperous American seaside community. Kite surfers zip along the azure waves as locals in flip-flops walk their toy-size dogs – just another south Florida day.  The “snowbirds” from up north will soon fly in for the winter. Surfside’s mayor, Daniel Dietch, arrives at the town hall, kicking up his Sector 9 skateboard. A 50-year-old husband and father of two, his day job is in environmental consultancy. “There are few things better to start the day than a jog on the beach, watch the sunrise and let the ocean breeze envelop you,” he said. But not all is rosy. Surfside’s picture-postcard beach is doing a slow-motion disappearing act – increasingly scoured by huge storms and encroached upon by rising sea levels, accelerated by the climate crisis. Gorgeous sandy beaches are fundamental to Florida’s economy. A record 116.5 million tourists visited Florida in 2017, up 3.6% from 2016, generating commerce valued at $67bn. But holding back the effects of hurricanes and high water is a project on an industrial scale – and one that’s only becoming bigger and more fraught. Some are even talking about “sand wars” in the Sunshine state. Since the 1950s Florida authorities have spent $1.3bn “nourishing” the beaches – periodically buying in supplementary sand. Despite a huge effort, nearly half the state’s 825 miles of beaches are now considered “critically eroded”. And complications abound amid not just a local or US but a worldwide shortage of sand. Dredging and mining sand offshore causes environmental damage to the ocean floor, as does repairing the beach itself. In Florida, turtle nesting season has to be worked around, but smaller creatures just suffocate. “You basically kill a beach when you dump a bunch of sand on top of it,” said Matthew Schwartz, an environmentalist and executive director of the South Florida Wildlands Association. “Microscopic animals that live in between sand, that create a kind of ecosystem there, are killed, and it creates all kinds of turbidity in the water, damaging the coral reefs.” Surfside is currently “re-nourishing” its beach after a struggle for cash and supplies.  Like many other beach towns it was applying for Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) cash to repair hurricane damage when Dietch read news reports earlier this year that the Trump administration aimed to divert some of that money to build the president’s promised wall on the US-Mexico border.   As Dietch raced to pin down his beach money, Surfside even hired a sand lobbyist, Fausto Gomez, to navigate hurdles with the state and federal government. “Communities are all looking for dollars for themselves. You have to fend off other communities [and] make sure you’re listed in the priority rankings [to get the money],” said Gomez.  Surfside successfully obtained $17.9m to buy and place 330,000 cubic yards of sand along its one-mile beach. Northern Florida has more sand to spare than the southern coast but Dietch said there’s “tension” because the northern counties “don’t want their sand being excavated and barged to Miami-Dade county”. Places like the Carolinas also guard their sand jealously. So Surfside and many other Florida resorts turn to a sand mine near Lake Okeechobee north of the Everglades wilderness area. As offshore sand becomes more elusive, south Florida beaches are instead replenished by the truck load from inshore mines. Surfside is currently in the process of having 18,000 truckloads of sand delivered 127 miles from Lake Okeechobee in order to extend its shrinking beach 150ft out into the Atlantic.     The US Army Corps of Engineers awarded the Surfside contract to the private sector to add the sand to the beach. Once Surfside is finished there will be a similar repair project undertaken in South Beach. Meanwhile the corps is working on ways to recapture sand that has been washed away and it also searches for dwindling nearshore dredging sites. But that’s controversial, too. “There’s noise in the background about wealthier counties wanting to mine sand off the coast of counties that are less developed,” said Tom Tomasello, a former general counsel for the state environment agency. He added: “That’s going to be a big political issue as time moves on. There is going to be a sand war one day, I can tell you with certainty.”  The US Army Corps of Engineers’ Laurel Reichold said her worries about the resilience of these communities keeps her up at night. “A lot of these beach projects, they’re sort of the first line of defense and that’s ultimately why we’re doing storm damage reduction, but it’s not going to prevent damages when you have those direct hits from a category 5 hurricane,” she said. And the inherent (and market) value of sand is on the rise everywhere.  Reichold said project costs have increased 30% over the past three years. Some want to dig for supplies overseas. The Florida Republican senator Marco Rubio last month reintroduced a bill that’s failed before, calling for a way around federal laws banning the import of sand, so that his state could go shopping with public funds for gorgeous, cheap sand from the Bahamas less than 100 miles east of Florida’s Atlantic coast. He is arguing there’s an especially acute need because early September’s Hurricane Dorian damaged some Florida beaches. The double irony is that, first, the damage happened even though the storm didn’t make landfall in the state, instead wreaking destruction in parts of the Bahamas, and second, climate experts point out that such storms are being exacerbated by global heating, whereas Rubio only recently began softening slightly on his long-held, hardline denials of a human-caused climate emergency. Palm Beach county alone saw 539,695 cubic yards of sand, enough to fill 165 Olympic-size swimming pools, swilled by Dorian from beaches the county owns and manages a pebble’s throw from Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago private oceanside resort. The county has a dredging program, but wants to keep the sand for local needs. “Some of the counties to the south of us are really running low,” said Andy Studt, who manages Palm Beach county’s beaches program. “I wouldn’t say we’re going to share it. We’re not actively advertising that we have excess sand because we know that we have enough to get us through the next couple decades, but that’s it.” Each year, the cycle continues. Hurricane season brings stronger storms and rising sea levels bring higher tides. Beach repair is the first line of defense, leading to an increasingly costly and desperate scramble for sand. But the bigger picture is just too overwhelming for many Floridians to contemplate. The National Academy of Sciences asserts that global sea levels could rise more than 6ft by 2100, twice as much as previously predicted, making much of Florida uninhabitable. “If it turns out the amount of sea level rise corresponds to what scientists are saying, there’s going to be a retreat [from the area],” said Tomasello, the environmental lawyer. “That’s going to be the only option because you’re going to be living in the water 50-100 years down the road.” Dietch said the town is getting ready to unveil a climate crisis action plan and build a “resilience fund” that’s “a euphemism for planned relocation” for people at risk from rising waters. “We’re seeing more intense storms. It’s not the frequency, it’s the intensity and patterns of the storms. So we try to message this but not in a fearmongering sort of way because people will shut down,” he said. Talk that gets too alarming also attracts what Dietch called “pushback” from real estate agents. “They don’t want people to know that they’re buying in … that it’s a high-risk area,” he said. And with thousands of trucks of fresh sand arriving at top dollar to disguise the environmental reality, there’s plenty to stick one’s head in for those who prefer that approach."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is the 2nd part of the Weltwoche interview. Yesterday in Part 1 we read:
1. Stocker said the theory claiming global warming causes cold European winters is not robust.
2. Stocker was caught fibbing in claiming that the projections of IPCC models were “extremely good”.
3. Stocker had ignored inconvenient science from his own institute.
4. Stocker appeared unaware that global warming had not risen in 15 years.
Part 2 of the Stocker/Weltwoche interview
In part 2, Stocker contradicts Ben Santer and claims that 17 years are not enough to establish a climate trend, insists that warming is taking place and that the model projections have been “extremely good”. Part 2 reveals how the IPCC science is hanging from a thread. Stocker obstinately maintains there is no CO2 lag behind temperature, claiming that they moved “simultaneously” in the past. Stocker erroneously believes CO2 is the only explanation for the 20th century warming.
WELTWOCHE: So you would never say that we are observing 17 years of climate warming stagnation?
STOCKER: No, already the association of ‘seventeen years’ and ‘climate warming’ is false. When we talk about a climate warming we mean the long-term trend, the one we see in the second half of the 20th century.
Lüning: That’s a bit mysterious. In a paper appearing in 2011, Stocker’s former IPCC colleague Ben Santer and 16 other co-authors determined that 17 years are enough to detect a climate trend. Now it has been 17 years since the end of warming began and suddenly many more years are required. What doesn’t fit is made to fit. Real science looks completely different.
WELTWOCHE: We don’t see it with the temperatures.
STOCKER: To the contrary we see signals in all components of the climate system: at the ice sheets, which are losing mass; in the oceans, which are measurably warming down to a depth of 4000 m; in the atmosphere, which is warming at the lower levels and cooling above 15 km, and therefore reveal CO2’s fingerprint. The burden of evidence from 130 years of observations and process comprehension is heavy, and it takes more than just a few years of stagnation to destroy this conclusive body of evidence.
Lüning: Once again Stocker gets tangled up in scientifically dubious argumentation. Is he unaware that the Antarctic has gained ice mass as whole over the last years (see our blog article “Neue ICEsat-Satellitendaten sind da: Antarktischer Eisschild hat an Masse zugelegt“)? Even if the Greenland ice sheet is melting (which it did also during the Medieval Warm Period 1000 years ago), IPCC co-chair Stocker here should not resort to cherry-picking with the purpose of reinforcing his personal climate alarmism. Worse is his claim about the CO2 fingerprint in the stratosphere. New studies in the meantime have completely discredited this idea (see our blog articles: “Keine guten Nachrichten für Mojib Latif: Neue Studie im Journal of Geophysical Research hinterfragt den stratosphärischen CO2-Fingeradruck“ and “CO2-Fingerabdruck löst sich in Luft auf: Neue Studie belegt Ozonwirkung auf Temperatur in der mittleren Atmosphäre“). It is a confession of failure when Stocker keeps bringing up “proof” that isn’t proof at all. Again here he seems to hope readers will lack knowledge. The alleged “conclusive body of evidence“ turns out to be nothing more than ruins on the verge of further collapse.
WELTWOCHE: What would it take before you’d admit climate warming has stopped?
STOCKER: You simply want a number of years?
WELTWOCHE: No, just an order of magnitude. Are we talking about 10 years or fifty years?
STOCKER: Galileo once said: ‘And it [the Earth] is indeed turning.’ We can say: ‘And it is indeed warming.’ All indicators that you have mentioned together point to a conclusive explanation: CO2 is responsible for the warming. One topic that we also address in the new report is climate sensitivity.
WELTWOCHE:  That is how much the temperature rises when atmospheric CO2 concentration doubles.
STOCKER: In the last report of 2007 we came to a value of 2 to 4.5°C. Now the question that arises is: Do the last 15 years tell us that the climate sensitivity is closer to the lower range? This discussion is taking place in the science, also with skeptical colleagues – I can assure you.
Lüning: Indeed there is a discussion where the evidence is growing that so-called climate sensitivity is significantly over-estimated. However, one has to know that the climate models for the forthcoming climate report have long since been calculated and there is no longer the possibility of making modifications without starting over from scratch and losing face. The IPCC therefore will hardly be able to back down from its mean of 3°C per doubling of CO2. This means that Stocker’ IPCC is increasingly unable to maneuver and is detached from reality.
Weltwoche expresses a suspicion that many are secretly thinking:
WELTWOCHE: Aren’t you just simply pushing your forecasts so far out into the future that no one will ever know if they come true or not?

STOCKER: Thanks for the question, that’s a really tough one. I can refer you to the table of contents of our report. We said in 2009 that we would like to have a chapter that looks at the near future, one that brings weather forecasts and climate projections together. It is called: ‘Near-term climate change and predictability’. This branch of climate research is still relatively young. For example we cannot say how warm or how wet the year 2025 will be. For the time frame up to about the year 2035, we have to estimate the various factors: What has an impact on the uncertainties and how big are they?
Lüning: This is indeed a dead-sure strategy of avoiding making positive statements for the mid-term future. Every politician who has gotten himself in a jam and found his citizens demanding results knows the tricks. Stocker tells us how he is pleased to get the question, but then goes on telling us about future projects whose quality cannot be assessed at the moment in any way and will no be able to be assessed any time soon.
WELTWOCHE: Then we’ll have to wait until 2035 to check to see if you’re right?
STOCKER: No. As I’ve said, we have been assessing climate projections at the IPCC since 1990 and they have been measurably right up to today. If you ask me, if I’m still in good health in 2035, I’ll be looking back at a short phase of temperature stagnation that resulted from a combination of various effects – that is if a large volcano doesn’t erupt.
Lüning: Professor Stocker, we’ve already been through all that. Die IPCC temperature prognoses since 1990 have not been “measurably right“, rather they have been poor to outright useless. Is this perhaps the IPCC’s last thread that is keeping it from going under? Is this what modern, robust science looks like? To be more specific, ocean cycles specialist Professor Mojib Latif warned not long ago that a warming cannot be expected over the next decade due to cooling Atlantic and Pacific cycles. This is completely plausible and is in agreement with the empirical findings of the last century. Thus it is only a question of a few years before the real temperatures drift below the lower boundaries of the IPCC simulated temperature range, which once was considered an impossibility. When that happens, the last thread breaks and it all goes down. The 54-year old Stocker will likely experience this inconvenience long before he reaches retirement. It remains open whether or not he will have the courage to openly discuss the errors of the IPCC simulations. But why wait until then? Already today it would be high time to take a hard look at reality and to start taking the natural factors of climate change into account.
WELTWOCHE: The IPCC consensus is that man-made greenhouse gas CO2 leads to a warming of the climate. But this relationship is observed only over the last 150 years.
STOCKER: Take a look at the chart of measurements from the Antarctic ice for the last 800,000 years: If that is not a correlation between temperature and CO2! The CO2 concentration that we measured in the ice was high during warm times, and low during cold periods.
Lüning: Al Gore in his film already stepped into that trap. Here cause and effect get reversed. Does it get warmer when CO2 rises? Or is it the other way around, where a warm ocean releases stored CO2 into the atmosphere? Weltwoche knows the real relationship:
WELTWOCHE: To the contrary, CO2 rises after temperature increases, and so CO2 could not have possibly caused the warming.
STOCKER: We’ve reported on the CO2 lag. However in light of new studies I have to gradually reconsider – but not in the sense you’d like: The studies show that CO2 and temperatures rise simultaneously. The sequence of warm and cold periods is driven over 100,000 years by the cycles described by geophysicist Milankovitch in 1920  It gets down to the position and angle of the earth’s rotational axis and the Earth’s orbit around the sun.
Lüning: The CO2 lag has always been a major irritant for the IPCC. That’s why scientists close to the IPCC produced new studies using questionable methodologies that allow the IPCC to get around the problem (see our blog article”Statistik-Trick befördert CO2 vom Beifahrer zum Chauffeur: Fragwürdiger neuer Shakun-Artikel in Nature“). With the assistance of these tailored studies, Stocker is able to use the old Al Gore trick for readers unfamiliar with the science. This is a sad story.
More important today than the long-term Milankovitch orbital cycles concerning our climate, are the fluctuations in solar activity. Weltwoche brings it up:
WELTWOCHE: Couldn’t we better explain the climate cycles with the sun’s influence?
STOCKER: That’s valid for pre-industrial times when CO2 was more or less 30% below today’s levels. We still need the sun as part of the explanation – here we have no differences. But for the last 50 to 70 years, and especially concerning the extent of the warming, it is not possible to conclusively explain it without the man-made factors. Why did the temperature increase 0.8°C during the 20th century? This cannot be explained without CO2.
Lüning: Precisely. Why did the temperature increase 0.8°C during the 20th century? Is CO2 really needed? If so, then how much? Have we seen such temperature increases in the past? Stocker here remains silent as the scientific facts on this point are inconvenient and clear. Over the last 10,000 there have been such warming phases on multiple occasions occurring in 1000 year cycles. And yet another surprise: The main drive behind these changes was solar activity fluctuation, as is impressively confirmed by numerous studies. As one may suspect, the second half of the 20th century was one of the most solar-active over the last 10,000 years. What a huge coincidence! Unfortunately, the IPCC has elected to ignore this massive body of science. This is yet another huge defect in the IPCC house in addition to the PDO lapse.

"Today, the state of New York will face off with ExxonMobil for oral arguments in the trial alleging that the company misled investors by providing false assurances that the company was adequately costing climate-related risks. But win or lose, that doesn’t mean an end to deliberate misinformation campaigns. Here’s what we should all know about how to resist those efforts by Exxon and other big corporate actors. Scientists have known for decades that the burning of fossil fuels is causing climate change. There is so much evidence that at least 97% of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming. It’s as settled as the link between smoking and cancer.  The fossil fuel industry has known about the role of its products in global warming for 60 years. Exxon’s own scientists warned their managers 40 years ago of “potentially catastrophic events”. Yet rather than alerting the public or taking action, these companies have spent the past few decades pouring millions of dollars into disinformation campaigns designed to delay action. All the while, the science is clear that climate-catalyzed damages have worsened, storms have intensified, and droughts and heatwaves have become more frequent and severe, while forests have been damaged and wildfires have burned through the country. By polluting the information landscape, these companies misrepresented the safety of their product and denied the public their right to be accurately informed. Big oil is not the only industry to do so. Big tobacco is a famous case, but asbestos and lead industries have done it too. These days, campaigns by soda companies to contest sugar science and by the NFL to distort the science on concussions use similar tactics. The campaigns all run a similar playbook: they cite fake experts, place impossible demands on the science, cherry-pick data, impugn the integrity of individual scientists and the scientific process, and appeal to conspiracy theories. They leave the public with the perpetual impression that there are lots of unresolved questions, and that scientists are not to be trusted. Research has confirmed that disinformation works, which is, of course, why special interests fund it. So it is crucial to expose disinformation for what it is, so that the public doesn’t fall prey to the next industrial-scale propaganda effort. In our report America Misled: How the Fossil Fuel Industry Deliberately Misled Americans About Climate Change, we document how the fossil fuel industry has misled the American public (and the world). We expose the most common myths about climate change generated by big oil and the misleading techniques used by Exxon. For example, cold weather is often used to argue that global warming isn’t happening. This favorite talking point of President Trump is an extreme form of cherry picking: ignoring what’s happening to our planet by focusing on local weather conditions. Just because the planet is heating up rapidly doesn’t mean cold weather in North Dakota will cease to exist overnight. But if we look at the overall picture, it’s hot and getting hotter. Our planet is accumulating heat at a rate of over four atomic bombs per second, and the four hottest years on record are the last four years. Exxon also misled us through arguments that appear convincing but contain logical fallacies. One is the argument that climate has changed naturally in the past, so today’s climate change must be natural, also. But just because something happened naturally in the past doesn’t mean it has to be natural now; the conclusion doesn’t follow from the premise. It’s like arguing that people have died naturally from cancer in the past, therefore smoking can’t cause cancer today. And then there’s the classic tactic of citing fake experts to cast doubt on the expert consensus on human-caused global warming. The most prominent example is an internet petition of 31,000 dissenting “experts” who think humans aren’t disrupting the climate. However, over 99% of the signatories have no expertise in climate research – it’s populated with graduates of programs in computer science, veterinary science, and mechanical engineering, as well as dead people and pop stars, but very few with climate expertise. In actual fact, 97% or more of domain experts agree on the fundamental fact that greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet. Exposing and explaining the techniques of denial are crucial steps in neutralizing disinformation, not just from the fossil fuel industry but from any source. Once people know the ways they can be deceived, disinformation no longer has power over them. As Edward Everett once said: “Education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army.” But it’s not enough to offer information – we also have to expose disinformation, so that people understand what we have been up against."

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Jeff Glassman of rocketscientistsjournal.com left a comment about Murry Salby, which regrettably got held up in the spam filter. Because he devoted much time to writing it, I’ve upgraded his comment to a post.
============================================
On 4/18/2013, Ferdinand Engelbeen misunderstands Henry’s Law and its dominance over atmospheric CO2 to the exclusion of human emissions.
1. Neither Salby nor the IPCC refers to the solubility of CO2 in water, or to Henry’s Law. In trying to rehabilitate the Revelle Factor for AR4, an IPCC author showed that it was temperature dependent, and as can be seen, resembling Henry’s coefficient for CO2 in water. Expert reviewer Nicolas Gruber explained that this dependence was a “common misconception”. Thereupon the IPCC editor deleted the figure for the final report “in order not to confuse the reader”, supposedly with uncomfortable solubility effects. Cf. Second Order Draft, Fig. 7.3.10(a)) and AR4, Fig. 7.11.
2. While laboratory values for Henry’s coefficients require approximating thermodynamic equilibrium, Henry’s Law does not predict thermodynamic equilibrium, and its coefficients must therefore be used advisedly. Neither climate, the ocean, the surface layer, nor Earth’s primary heat source, the Sun, is ever in thermodynamic equilibrium. IPCC and Salby refer to equilibrium, which is false if they mean thermodynamic equilibrium, and otherwise they supply no definition for their peculiar meaning of equilibrium.
3. Henry’s Coefficient for CO2, g/100g, varies by a factor of over 5 (0.06 to 3.3) with temperature of the solvent, water. This is a constant of proportionality for the dissolution of CO2 caused by its partial pressure. So the ocean uptakes more CO2 as the partial pressure of CO2 increases or as ocean temperature drops. Applying Henry’s Law with respect to air temperature, without more, is an error.
4. In the Vostok record, however, air temperature and CO2 records vary according to Henry’s Law, and certainly with no human contribution. Vostok air temperature deduced from oxygen and deuterium fractions appears to provide a proxy for sea temperature, too. The Law remains as applicable today for forecasting atmospheric CO2.

5. The peak-to-peak variation of CO2 at Vostok is about 120 ppmv, while the similar variation for air temperature there is about 12K, yielding a sensitivity of about 10 ppmv/K.
6. As Salby rediscovered, paleo CO2 lags temperature with a peak at about one millennium. He does not mention having investigated a cause for the lag. Regardless, comparing CO2 and air or sea temperature with data over the industrial era or over any common period is irrelevant. Measured CO2 is a result of ocean temperature changes from centuries past.
7. The dominant observed lag in CO2 with respect to air temperature and possibly water temperature is about the same as the estimate for the period of the Meridional Overturning Circulation. This current, also known as the Great Conveyor Belt, draws nearly freezing water at the poles, saturated in CO2, down to the ocean bottom, around the globe and up to the surface at the Eastern Equatorial Pacific about a millennium later. There old waters, still saturated in CO2, warm to tropical temperatures to outgas. Now depleted, the old waters circulate poleward across the surface, cooling to recharge with CO2 along the way. This submodel accounting for the lag reinforces the model from the curved correlation between CO2 and temperature at Vostok. The conclusion is that atmospheric CO2 follows from Henry’s Law applied to the ocean.
8. Natural CO2 fluxes today are SWAGs, good to maybe one significant figure. The fluxes are about 91 GtC/yr from the ocean, 120 GtC/yr from land (Salby used an obsolete value half as big), and another 270 GtC/yr from leaf water, a parameter that IPCC estimated but never applied. Man’s emission of CO2 is a tiny number lost in the noise of the other fluxes, worse than Salby suggests. IPCC’s models, the GCMs, are small-signal simulations where the natural world is falsely presumed to have a zero net effect.
9. Selby also re-discovered that ice core data underestimate atmospheric CO2, in particularly that from the Keeling Curve. That curve is a heavily filtered, reconstituted record for MLO, the “master time series”, a reference IPCC experts use to calibrate other stations into a false global agreement. This makes MLO data appear global, makes atmospheric CO2 therefore long-lived, and so causes anthropogenic CO2 to accumulate in the atmosphere for maximum effect. CO2 is fixed in the ice core once the firn closes, and this may require between 600 and 2000 years maximum (estimates vary). Also Vostok samples have an average period of about 1500 years. So the Vostok samples are averages over as much as 600 to 2000 years, and the chances of even sampling an event like the 50 year long Keeling Curve is about one in 30. And even if it happened to be sampled, it would be lost in the noise due to the extended aperture time. By contrast, Keeling samples have a window of at most one minute in the manual mode, and normally much less. The long aperture time causes an indelible loss in information.
10. Like IPCC, Salby relies on data from ice cores that blend smoothly into the instrument record in the same chart. See “Evolution during the 20th Century”, 4/18/2013, time 34:08; and AR4, Summary for Policymakers, Figure SPM.1. In these charts, the underestimation by ice cores has vanished, contradicting both Salby’s model and the actual cause: ice core data is a low pass filter with a time constant of about half a millennium. The graph is but another example of IPCC’s chartjunk.
11. Salby’s conclusion is correct that human emissions are insignificant in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. The observed record is natural.

"The speed and size of the Extinction Rebellion (XR) protests over the past year add weight to the idea that people in this decade were in revolt before they had any clear idea what form a revolution might take. Politically it has long looked like a whole generation was up for grabs. In the beginning of the decade this anger veered leftwards with movements like Occupy, but at the end it has moved greenwards, under XR. The question is how much of the country will go with it. Extinction Rebellion succeeded in putting the climate crisis on the political agenda. This is a welcome pivot to an existential issue for a society that has become gummed up by enervating fights over Brexit. There is an urgent need to decouple economic activity from carbon emissions and ecological destruction. For all the fine words global emissions of carbon dioxide are higher than they have ever been, almost three decades after the first global conference aimed at reducing them. The situation is becoming dangerous for human life. The latest figures show there is little more than a decade to save ourselves and the other creatures with whom we share the planet.  To meet this challenge it is heartening that XR has adopted non-violent resistance, in which unarmed people engage in a coordinated set of strikes, rallies and boycotts to confront the authorities over environmental inaction. When the group shut down major parts of central London with a carnival of protest making business as usual impossible in April, the demonstrators ended up meeting with London’s mayor and cabinet ministers before securing their aim of getting parliament to declare a “climate emergency”. Extinction Rebellion’s policy and language have become mainstream in a remarkably short space of time. By comparison it might appear that this latest set of “uprisings” has seen XR go backwards rather than forward. There were no meetings with high-profile politicians. The targetting of London’s public transport network at rush hour would have lost the group significant goodwill among parts of the population. Yet XR has gone global, with 60 cities experiencing protests. XR has become more inventive as the protests against the National Portrait Gallery’s links with BP attest. In Britain the use of arrest as a tactic to draw more support has been particularly effective, with 1,700 peaceful protesters so far hauled away by the police as a record number of people took part in acts of resistance. The police in London will also have helped build opposition by taking measures which amount to an assault on the right to protest. If the authorities adopt a harder line they will boost the power of non-violence, by attracting people to demonstrations because of heavy-handed tactics. Disobedience is at the heart of non-violent struggle. As Martin Luther King Jr wrote: “We know through painful experience that freedom is never given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.” XR’s strategy is influenced by the work of Harvard’s Erica Chenoweth, whose studies revealed that campaigns of non-violent resistance were twice as effective as ones which used violence in achieving their goals, and campaigns that involved more than 3.5% of the population – in the UK that is 2.3m people – invariably succeeded. But numbers alone will not create change; crowds are necessary but not sufficient. There’s also a danger that people show up but nothing changes – that mass action doesn’t work. This is the wrong conclusion to draw. However, people being in the streets isn’t effective without a strategy, and XR needs a clearer one for what could be years of struggle. There is an open question whether tactics that toppled dictators work in a liberal democracy.  This perhaps explains XR’s reluctance to spell out whether it wishes to achieve a revolution to overturn a political order or to create pressure to persuade governments to act. Reform or revolution – XR will have to make this call as it reflects on its own success."
"Even animals from the deepest places on Earth have accumulated pollutants made by humans. That’s the unfortunate finding of a new study by myself with colleagues from the University of Aberdeen and the James Hutton Institute, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution. Up until now I have tended to stick to the nice side of deep sea biology: discovery and exploration. My colleagues and I are quite at ease in ocean trenches as scientists there can usually work without having to wrestle with anthropogenic impacts like litter or noise and chemical pollution. It is Earth at its most pristine.  But in this instance, while investigating the ecology of Pacific trenches, and with such a unique opportunity to collect deep sea specimens, we couldn’t resist having a quick look for man’s mighty footprint. We tested various different species of tiny scavenging crustaceans known as amphipods that we gathered between 7,000 and 10,500 metres in depth in the Mariana and the Kermadec trenches in the western Pacific. We found that regardless of depth, regardless of species, regardless of trench, these animals were loaded with the two types of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) we were looking for.  In creatures that live in shallower waters, exposure to POPs can reduce reproductive success and thus population growth. It’s hard to study deeper animals alive under controlled conditions but can assume the pollutants have a similar effect. There were striking variations between trenches and between the sorts of pollutant, but the salient finding is that humanity’s footprint is thoroughly imprinted on some of the most extreme and remote environments on Earth. In the deep sea these pollutants are particularly concerning as they are inherently hydrophobic, which means they will bind to anything that isn’t water. This includes tiny specs of “marine snow” or larger carcasses that fall through the ocean, which is how the deep sea receives most of its energy. Therefore the primary mechanism of food supply to great depths is also a very efficient way to deliver pollution. But where did it all come from? Take one of the two types of pollutants for example, a category known as polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs. About 1.3m tonnes were produced between the 1930s and 1970s to use in paints, plastics, electronic equipment and more. Of this, 65% is now contained in landfills or still within electrical equipment. But more worryingly, the other 35% was accidentally released into the environment. These pollutants are invulnerable to natural degradation and so persist in the environment for decades, therefore once they find their way into rivers, coast lines and the open ocean there’s plenty of time to sink many kilometres below the waves.  And once a pollutant finds itself in the greatest ocean depth, where else is there to go? The bottom of the Mariana Trench, for example, the deepest point on Earth, was found to host highly-contaminated amphipods. Once these POPs are in the food web there are no mechanisms for dispersal or reversal from such great depths, and hence the bio-accumulation will only continue. The only positive from this story is that, once people realised these chemicals were an awful contribution to the world, POPs were banned by the 2001 Stockholm Convention. At this point one would hope some major lessons were learned. But no, we don’t look have to look far to realise this taught us nothing. Just take a look at the plague of plastic microbeads (and other microplastics) turning up in the ocean following a brief excursion from, say, a cosmetics bottle, across someone’s face or armpit and then sent on the long journey down the plug hole.  It seems that once again, we have a shocking example of our own stupidity, as people gradually realise that plastic microbeads are, funnily enough, made of plastic, and that stuff that goes down the sink doesn’t magically disappear into another dimension. We have all likely heard that “Mount Everest would fit into the Mariana Trench with over a mile to spare” or some other pointless analogy regarding the number of elephants standing on a car illustrating the high pressures in the oceans. These all serve to needlessly distance ourselves from these remote marine frontiers.  Of course, the pressure and depth are immense, which do require incredible physiological adaptations for survival, and equally clever engineering solutions for exploration, but the 11km that so easily swallows Mount Everest is still only 11km. Think of it like this: 11km is only half the length of Manhattan Island, I could legally drive it in less than six minutes, and Mo Farah could run it in less than 30 minutes.  The reality is that the deep sea just isn’t that remote, and the great depth and pressures are only an imaginary defence against the effects of what we do “up here”. The bottom line is that the deep sea – most of planet Earth – is anything but exempt from the consequences of what happens above it, and it’s about time we appreciated that."
"The Victorians introduced many of the traditions we now associate with the festive season. Along with Christmas cards, crackers, mince pies and Santa Claus himself, they are responsible for the modern day Christmas dinner. While British households would once have had goose or beef at the centre of the table, by the end of the 19th century most were eating turkey.  In the intervening years, many of us have taken this festive feast for granted. Nothing lasts forever, though, and growing populations and changing economic conditions could easily make Christmas Future look less rosy than what has gone before.  We still produce enough food for the time being, but it is not well distributed and much is lost at different points in the supply chain. There have already been some unnerving reminders in recent months about how easily food security can be compromised. So read on with trepidation.  We lose around 25% of the food we produce to pests and diseases, and there have been some salient examples lately. Turkeys have been under threat from bird flu. First there were outbreaks in more than 12 countries in mainland Europe, including France and Germany, such that British farmers were ordered by the authorities to keep their birds indoors as a precaution. This meant some turkeys would technically fail the requirements for free-range status by spending too long in barns.   Then came the news a couple of days ago that bird flu had been detected on a turkey farm in Lincolnshire in the east of England. Up to 5,000 birds were culled to prevent the spread of this highly infectious virus.  The UK’s Food Standards Agency is saying bird flu does not pose a food safety risk and it is not believed this year’s turkey supply is under threat. But bird flu is only one infectious pathogen which can affect farm animals: farmers are fighting a constant battle against diseases, with foot and mouth and BSE only the best known other culprits. Turkey farmers at least have the advantage that they can keep their birds indoors. Crop farmers do not have that luxury, as farmers of Brussels sprouts have been finding to their cost. Their crops have been under attack from diamondback moths arriving earlier and in greater numbers than usual. Farmers in Lincolnshire, who supply two-thirds of what the UK consumes, report a drop in output of up to 60%.  These are age-old problems, of course. But in a world of mounting pressure on food supplies, eradicate pests and diseases and we wouldn’t need to increase production so much to feed the growing population.  In addition, climate change and more intensive farming are causing new and emerging diseases. Take prawn and shrimp production, which since the early 1990s has been under attack from white spot syndrome virus, probably due to more intensive farming. Another example is salmon farming, which routinely struggles with sea lice because fish are bred in confined spaces. Worth considering as you tuck into your smoked salmon or prawn cocktail starter on December 25.  Political uncertainty is another risk to people’s food security. Due to the uncertainties of Brexit, one estimate is that Christmas dinner will cost 14% more than last year – and that’s before the UK actually withdraws from the EU. The row over the price of products including Marmite earlier in the year between Unilever and Tesco was a taste of what is to come.  Inflation is expected to rise steeply in 2017, which is a trend that ought to make politicians nervous. Rapid price increases in other countries have been the cause of civil unrest, and it is certainly not unthinkable that the same could happen in the UK. It was already recently estimated that more than 8m people in the UK are struggling to put food on the table, and inflation will only push more to the brink.  Then there is climate change, which threatens food both from long-term change and increased annual variations. We are seeing more and more extreme weather events and these are set to get worse. Since so many plants depend on weather conditions, expect upheaval.  In 2011 in the UK, for example, there was a shortage of holly due to early frosts but a bumper crop of mistletoe due to a mild autumn. Yet in Texas that year, a drought caused a mistletoe shortage.  Clearly mistletoe and holly are not issues of food security but root vegetables are. In January, there were concerns that parts of the UK were losing lots of carrots and parsnips because flooding was causing them to rot in the ground.  Water also needs a mention here. The southern UK has already had summer hosepipe bans for many years to cope with water shortages. This will be as nothing compared to the global water battles that climate change and population growth make increasingly likely.  Christmas dinner is probably safe for this year, but many of the issues we are encountering suggest more serious things to come. This brings into focus the amount we waste each year.  The UK throws away around 7m tonnes of food and drink each year, more than half of which could have been consumed; and at Christmas the country throws out 5m Christmas puddings, 2m turkeys, 74m mince pies and huge amounts of vegetables, fruit and snacks. When you reflect that food security is a global issue, and that many countries have a much harder time feeding themselves than the UK, waste really needs to move up the agenda.  Beyond this we need to start finding solutions to the major threats to food from climate change and population growth. In a civilised world, it’s vital that everyone can have access to decent food – and a feast at Christmas if they want one."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s the last part of the tough Weltwoche interview with IPCC WG1 Co-Chair Thomas Stocker (see Part 1 here and Part 2 here).
INTERVIEW PART 3
Lüning: Next Weltwoche refers Stocker to the natural cycles, which fit well with the 20th century’s overall pattern. The Little Ice Age also was characterized by low solar activity.
Weltwoche: There’s a very simple explanation: A little ice age prevailed until well into the 19th century. Glaciers peaked at around 1860. This is indeed only normal that it has gotten warmer again.
STOCKER: That’s true for the glaciers. But it doesn’t explain the speed at which the melt occurred over the last 30 or 40 years and for how strong the warming has been since the beginning of the 20th century.
Lüning: Over the last 50 years, the sun was stronger than at almost any time, yet supposedly had nothing to do with the temperature and glacier development? And earlier in the past the sun and its cycles indeed did play a role. Now we are being told that this role was suddenly lost over the last decades? That doesn’t make any sense.
Weltwoche: During the Roman Times when Hannibal crossed the Alps with elephants there were even fewer glaciers.
STOCKER: Yes, but we also have to ask ourselves: What else was different 22oo years ago? The sun did play a role because of the inclination of the Earth’s axis. Back then the summers received more sunlight – about 10W per square meter more. It’s obvious that it was warmer back then.
Lüning: 2200 years ago the Earth was in the midst of the Roman Warm Period, one of the warm phases occurring every millennium whenever the sun was active. But instead of discussing this real factor, Stocker prefers to drift off to the very long-term Milankovitch cycles, which do not play any role in today’s climate development. This is an obvious attempt to distract the reader. With Stocker once again bringing up Milankovitch, he could have brought up the mid-Holocene climate optimum of 7000-5000 years before present when it was 1°C warmer than today. The reason back then was indeed a special Milankovitch Earth orbital geometry, But because this long warm period of the past doesn’t fit with the climate-alarmist concept, Stocker avoids it.
Weltwoche: Don’t you feel a little queasy when astrophysicists say the sun is currently weakening as much as it did during the Little Ice Age of the 17th century?
STOCKER: No, today it is impossible to forecast solar activity because unfortunately we are missing precise data and models. But we cannot exclude that such a phase may have already begun. However, it’ll eventually end – and in the meantime the CO2 concentration continues to rise and this will lead to even greater warming.
Lüning: Oh dear, this is not good, Professor Stocker. Today we can almost say there’s a consensus among astrophysicists that the sun will be very inactive over the coming decades. A Swiss paper on this topic by Steinhilber and Beer (see the last paragraph of our blog article”Wer ist Schuld am Kältewinter? MPI-Studie weist eher auf die schwache Sonne anstatt des arktischen Meereises hin. Die Sonne im März 2013“) appeared recently. Currently there is hardly a single paper out there that contradicts this. It’s no use playing dumb on this point and, as is the case with the pauses in warming, to act like nothing is really known and that everything is just chaos. The reconstructions of solar activity of the past thousands of years are very regular in nature and the pattern cannot be ignored. What’s even worse is that Stocker mixes-up the solar internal cycles with the Milankovitch cycles. The two have nothing to do with each other. The solar internal cycles involve changes in the intensity of the sun’s hydrogen reactors. Stocker’s reference to CO2 changes in sync with the Milankovitch cycles that are 20,000 years and more completely misses the barn. Could it be that Stocker is not familiar with the subject and is thus incapable of keeping the mechanisms apart? Or is it just another attempt to mislead the reader?
The closing part of the interview speaks for itself and requires no commentary.
Weltwoche: Let’s get down to the fundamentals. Sociologist Gerhard Schulze says: “Science is organized skepticism.”
STOCKER: I’ve not heard that.
Weltwoche: In climate science, ‘skepticism’ is a dirty word.
STOCKER: The term “climate skeptic” often gets used. That is so. But skepticism is the driving force of science. We also ask: Is it really so? Did we really understand that correctly? Climate science does not differ from the other sciences.
Weltwoche: Your colleague Hans von Storch, however, writes in his current book “Die Klimafalle” that scientists did not think enough about falsification, that is refuting a hypothesis, which alone moves science forward.
STOCKER: That’s his view. When we started researching the last 50 years of climate development, we indeed applied falsification by testing all possible explanations. We could have arrived at the result that the sun was 90% responsible and CO2 10%. But all calculation showed just the opposite.

Weltwoche: Was your result already decided when the IPCC started in 1989?
STOCKER: No, the task was to openly and comprehensively report on the level of knowledge on anthropogenic warming.
Weltwoche: Indeed: that climate change was man-made was certain from the very beginning.
STOCKER: Not at all. Millions of measurements and the physical understanding form the foundation of this claim.
Weltwoche: Hans von Storch also says: “The debate on the subject that we could be wrong is taboo.” Don’t you ever ask yourself that?
STOCKER: The debate over the period of little warming started about three years ago. At the IPCC it is not a taboo. Rather, a group is looking at and assessing the published scientific studies on the question – and not some blog posts or treaties. How often did such similar phases of stagnation occur in the past? How probable will they be in the future? What are the explanations for them? On this important subject we are creating a box of three or four pages -that’s a complete overview.
Weltwoche: What are the main statements of your report?
STOCKER: Today I can’t tell you any more than the New York Times can.
Weltwoche: To put it in another way: What reactions do you expect in policy-making?
STOCKER: That’s difficult to predict.The climate problem, that’s my personal estimation, at the moment is certainly not at the top of their agenda, but it is closely tied to energy and resource policy. We can only hope that climate policy again explicitly returns to the agenda. Many of the decisions we make, like those on energy infrastructure, will have consequences for decades into the future. Therefore the report should make a contribution that these decisions are made with the knowledge of all the facts.
Weltwoche: Numerous times already in the last decades climate scientists have said that if something isn’t done by a certain date, then it’ll be too late. These deadlines have come and gone, without anything happening.
STOCKER: With such statements you have to be extremely careful. To the contrary in climate change there are indeed developments where at a certain time-point they will be irreversible. For this reason last year I wrote an article, “The Closing Door of Climate Targets”. Missing is the knowledge that certain climate targets, for example keeping the warming under 2°C, will soon be no longer achievable. We are racing ahead in a car towards a concrete wall and pressing the accelerator down even though we know that the braking distance hardly suffices.
Weltwoche: That means: Mankind is committing collective suicide.
STOCKER: No, but adapting to climate change and its effects is going to cost a lot of money, take up lots of resources that we could otherwise apply more sensibly. And it is going to lead to conflicts over these resources.
Weltwoche: You’re not making a depressing impression.
STOCKER: No, if I were depressive, it would adversely effect my abilities to disseminate the findings of science. Should I just clam up and not speak about the problem? I’m not going to do that. The problem is there, it is one of the biggest that humanity faces, and we have the choice on how big it’s going to be. I want to inform about that. 
Lüning: We had to wait until the very end for Stocker to out himself as an activist. “The problem is there, it is one of the biggest that humanity faces,” he says. We should all be concerned when a leading IPCC referee, someone who is supposed to view and summarize the scientific literature objectively, has already personally made up his mind for the climate-alarmism side. With this backdrop, what are the chances the IPCC will revise its overblown temperature projections and modify its models when there is so much powerful evidence showing that natural climate factors are playing a role in the warming? How will Stocker suddenly appear when the anthropogenic global warming effect is far less dramatic than what he vehemently projected in the past and projects currently?
One of the most important tasks for the IPCC in the coming years will be to prevent personal interest conflicts and to assure an appropriate amount of skepticism when handling scientific literature. Until then the IPCC reports unfortunately will not be able make any sensible contribution to understanding the complex climate interrelationships.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMajor German dailies today are reporting that Europe is beginning to give up on the big green dream it once so deeply cherished and envisioned a great society powered by clean sunshine and wind. After trying for years to force renewable energies onto consumers, the bill came and eyes popped.
Suddenly we are also seeing studies showing that warming won’t be so bad after all, and that CO2 climate sensitivity is much lower than first thought. The policy-making pressure coming from the threat of climate change is disappearing rapidly.
The German leftist TAZ and center-right Die Welt report today that the EU Commission is preparing to embark on a policy to make energy prices lower, and to push climate protection measures off the stage.
The TAZ writes that the “EU Commission is preparing a fundamental change of course in energy policy. Because of the recession in many countries, state and government leaders are to undertake a paradigm change at their summit in Brussels on Wednesday“.
The overall sentiment is expressed, for example, by statements from EU Commissar Günther Oettinger, who told Die Welt:
Over the last decades Germany has continuously made energy more expensive with taxes, levies, fees, and contributions. That now has to change.”
The high energy prices have taken a toll as companies are finding it more difficult than ever to compete globally. The TAZ writes:

Indeed because of the economic weakness in many EU countries, climate change no longer has any priority for the Commission. The sole target of getting 20% of energy demand from renewable sources has been pushed off further. Commission officials are backed by a paper from the mighty European industrial association: Business Europe. According to the study, energy costs for Europe’s concerns are 1.5 to 3 times higher than the USA.
If 400,000 new jobs in the sector of production are to be created, then the EU ‘has to overhaul its climate protection and energy policy,’ said Europe-Business-President Jürgen Thumann.”
So why is energy so much more expensive in Europe than it is in USA? The TAZ writes that this is primarily due to the fact that USA is “exploiting its shale gas reserves using controversial fracking“. The TAZ adds:
According to the EU Commission, energy prices in the EU have risen 37% since 2005. In the USA that have even dropped slightly.
The EU Commission maintains that the following guideline has to apply: “EU energy policy has to assure uninterrupted supply of households and companies, affordable and competitive prices.”
When it comes to the clash between economics and climate protection, it appears economics is emerging as the most pressing.

"In the run-up to Donald Trump’s inauguration, many climate experts are expressing concern that his views and those of his senior appointees are at odds with mainstream climate science. They’re grimly preparing to re-enter the fray of last-decade’s “climate wars”, which saw scientific knowledge about global warming come under intense and sustained attack. I am as concerned as anyone by politicians’ newfound aversion to evidence – pioneered, embarrassingly, by populists in the UK. Obviously, if politicians say things that are simply false, it is our duty as scientists to point that out.  But we should also point out what they are not saying, which suggests that Trump and his appointees accept much more of the scientific evidence for human-induced climate change than they are prepared to let on – and, crucially, much more than most of their supporters probably think they do: a case of the footsoldiers not realising that their generals have abandoned them. And what those generals accept is already more than enough to justify continuing the relatively modest climate goals of the Obama administration. I appreciate this line is asking a lot of Trump’s opponents: to characterise the president-elect and his appointees as straightforwardly anti-science seems like a political open goal. The problem is, it may also be an own goal.  Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, former ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson, claims “our ability to predict that effect [of greenhouse gas emissions] is very limited”. But he carefully avoids saying whether he means effect on the global energy budget (which is nailed down to within 10% or so), effect on global temperatures (which is predictable, and predicted, within a factor of two), or effect on the weather in Washington DC. So when a helpful journalist adds that 97% of climate scientists disagree with him, all that members of the public hear is that 97% of climate scientists are idiots: of course climate prediction is uncertain. So, what are these facts on which Trump and colleagues are so carefully silent? First, the idea that there is no connection between humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions and rising temperatures seems to have been quietly abandoned. Trump himself acknowledges “some connectivity”. Tillerson has conceded “an effect”, while Scott Pruitt, who Trump is proposing to lead the Environment Protection Agency, has called for a debate about the “degree and extent” of human-induced climate change, not whether it exists at all. This is a long way from Senator James Inhofe and his snowball. Second, no one outside the wilder fringes of the internet is publicly arguing that 3-4℃ of human-induced global warming (far beyond the range of climate fluctuations since the last ice age) is “acceptable”. Perhaps some individuals believe it in private, but Tillerson has certainly been advised not to express this view in public lest Exxon gets landed with the bill for relocating the population of Bangladesh. So there may be more consensus than meets the eye on what constitutes “dangerous interference” in the climate system. Third, everyone also agrees that how the climate responds to global emissions is uncertain, and how policies affect emissions is even more so. So as far as today’s policies are concerned, whether we are aiming to stabilise temperatures at 2.5℃ above pre-industrial levels, or the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of “well below 2℃”, is largely moot: what matters is that we are aiming to stabilise temperatures at some point this century, rather than settling for indefinite warming. And finally, no-one is contesting the other key conclusion of Paris, that stabilising the climate requires net global carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced to zero. This is significant precisely because there are other ways of stabilising global temperatures, such as “solar radiation management” where reflective particles are inserted into the upper atmosphere. I am not aware of anyone in the incoming administration advocating such geo-engineering – unsurprisingly, since to do so would acknowledge that climate change is a present danger requiring a globally coordinated response. Put together, these facts logically imply that net global greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced to zero sometime this century – which is not that far from the UNFCCC position. Temperatures have already risen by about 1℃ since the mid-19th century (and, again, no one seems to be disputing this any more). If we are to stabilise warming below 2℃, every 0.1℃ of additional warming from now on must be matched by emission reductions equal to, on average, 10% of today’s emission rate. At the rate the Earth has been warming since the 1970s, 0.1℃ takes less than a decade, so 10% per 0.1℃ means emission reductions of 1-2% per year: and the longer we put them off, the steeper the required cuts become. Perhaps Pruitt and Tillerson really believe that reductions at the modest end of this uncertainty range are all that’s required. We should all hope they are right (although it would be nice to see the evidence), because that would mean current plans might be just enough to meet the long-term temperature goals agreed in Paris, , rather than woefully inadequate. But it hardly makes a strong case for investing in new coal-fired power plants. The Paris Agreement and the Obama government’s Clean Power Plan were hard-won successes. But, though it may seem disloyal to point this out, both actually had relatively modest goals that are more than justified even by the new administration’s more sanguine attitude to the climate problem. Both scientists and liberal journalists may be reluctant to give the incoming administration credit for being right about anything. Much of what they are saying is indeed demonstrably at odds with scientific evidence. When Tillerson suggested that scientists were equally split on whether it was possible to trace a link between greenhouse gas emissions and some classes of extreme weather event, he was simply out of date. But what they are not prepared to say tells a different story – one that shows how far the debate has moved on even among the most ardent disbelievers. Sometimes, as Sherlock Holmes would say, the most important clue is the dog that doesn’t bark."
"A blue dragon, Aeshna mixta, the migrant hawker, is poised at the wood’s edge. Its two pairs of clear, plasticky wings hold a flash of October sunlight and take a moment’s rest to open like solar panels on a satellite. These wings that brrrrr through the airways of the dragonfly’s hunting territory have carried him far: not just the distance from his natal pond where he spent darkly aquatic years as a larva, but maybe hundreds of miles from continental Europe. Before the second world war, migrant hawkers, as the name implies, travelled here from far away; in more recent years they have bred here and a warming climate has helped expand their range from southern England northwards to Scotland and westwards into Ireland. The population of British-bred migrant hawkers is boosted by actual migrants each year; I don’t know if this dragon is one of those.  The wand of his abdomen is more than 60mm long, with two sky-blue, eye-shaped dots on each dark segment and a yellow triangular mark at the top. His compound, visor-like eyes are also blue and these markings give the dragon the appearance of a creature of alien intelligence from another world. This is true. Dragonflies evolved in the Carboniferous era, 300 million years ago, hunting among giant ferns and cycads aeons before the temperate deciduous forests, and the trees and brambles he perches on, ever existed – a world without autumn. These wings that carry the dragon from deep time, across continents, to hawk the edge of this wood, receive the light on falling ash leaves, the ochre of lime trees, raindrops on scarlet bryony berries, the scents of fungi and rot, the sound of ravens and wrens, skittering squirrels – flash-in-the-pan species compared to dragonflies. It is hard to imagine this place without autumn. However changeable seasonal definitions become, the very existence of deciduousness and the world it characterises is now in question. I wonder about the dragonfly as he navigates this wave of probability through time and space: what does his cryptic blue insignia mean; what can his fabulous eyes see; where can his wings take him?"
"It was Tesla Motors, more than any other company, that triggered the current interest in electric cars. The firm’s namesake, Nikola Tesla, a genius inventor and Thomas Edison’s arch rival, would no doubt be pleased. Yet Tesla would be even more thrilled to realise the next step for electric vehicles involves turning his biggest vision into reality: the wireless transmission of power. Due to their low local emissions, battery-powered electric cars are more in demand than ever, but they still have a reputation for being too expensive and having too short a driving range. So how about recharging them without having to plug in a cable, while parking or even driving on the road?  This isn’t science fiction: we know from our electric tooth brushes that batteries can be recharged without plugging in a wire, and even smart phones can be charged just by being placed on top of a pad. Here’s how it works: an alternating current (AC) flows through a wire coil (the transmitter), which causes a magnetic field to switch between two directions at a high frequency. A second coil (the receiver) exposed to that magnetic fields picks up those oscillations, inducing an AC current in its own circuit, which is then used to power the car (or charges the battery in your toothbrush). Electronic systems able to handle higher frequencies, which allow more power to be transmitted, are becoming more affordable. Energy can now be transferred between coils that are increasingly further apart or aren’t aligned accurately. Thanks to this technology, some electric cars can already be charged by parking them on top of charging pads, which can be as much as 20cm away from the receiving coil at the bottom of the vehicle. The next step is to wire-up the roads themselves with coils so that cars, buses, and even trucks could be charged while they move.  For peace of mind, wireless charging systems are properly shielded so that no animals or humans will be harmed. A coil in the road will only emit power when it is in wireless communication with a receiver coil above it, and the latter will absorb nearly all of it. The bit that is lost is mostly absorbed by the metal body of the car itself. Retrofitting roads with wireless charging coils sounds expensive. But recent studies show that the biggest part of the cost comes from the construction work itself – on a new or renovated road, the extra costs are not that high.  Charging on the move isn’t just a convenient time-saver – it will also bring down the cost of electric vehicles themselves. Batteries that get recharged more frequently during usage will last longer and can be made smaller while retaining the same driving range.  As with all new technologies that rely on not-yet existing infrastructure, wireless vehicle charging will start in a niche market (remember the early and expensive days of mobile phones?). In this case, the niche is electric buses that re-charge at bus stops and on certain segments of their fixed driving route.  The global pioneer is the Online Electric Vehicle (OLEV), a bus developed a few years ago by South Korea’s Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). Continuous charging means OLEV buses cover their routes using small batteries just a third the size of those found in a regular electric car. More recently, Swedish truck and bus-maker Scania trialled a similar system of recharging stations for buses to demonstrate such technology could still work in harsh Nordic winters.  For passenger cars, wireless charging will first come as a convenience feature. People will be able to park in their driveway or garage without having to plug in a cable, and will still have a recharged battery next time they need the car.  We will have to wait longer for a dense network of highways that can charge vehicles on the move. This would be a major infrastructure investment and would involve a substantial quest for more copper wires and semiconductor components.  Experience with the technology and agreement on international compatibility standards will be prerequisites of such investments. Safety must not be ignored: the transmitter coils emit substantial power, which is only considered safe if it is in proper communication with a receiver coil. Communication between transmitter and receiver must also be secured against accidental or even intentional interference – an aspect that even touches on cyber security. So when and where will we see electrified roads being rolled out on larger scale? Korea will try and maintain its leadership in this technology. Places like Singapore, wealthy and with strong ambitions in clean and efficient transport, may follow soon. Standardised electrified roads could become what the railways were to the 19th century: not only a leap in transport efficiency, but the core of a new industry."

Share this...FacebookTwitterDie kalte Sonne site here has a report on how the WWF claims that climate change will likely lead to more ship accidents on the high seas, caused by stormier weather.
Science Speechless Over Embarrassing WWF Claim: Environmental Activists Postulate More Ship Accidents Due To Climate Change
By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
Former East Germany party organ ‘Neues Deutschland‘ (New Germany) brought out a claim from climate activist group WWF on June 10, 2013. In it a surprising relationship had been postulated:
WWF: Climate change increasing the risks of ship accidents. Climate change and the associated extreme weather events increase the dangers of ship accidents on the seas, according to the environmental organization WWF. Increasing frequency of storms heighten the risks, said the WWF Germany on Friday at the World Conference of the Seas on 8 June [2013].’
Neue Deutschland apparently is referring to a press release that had appeared on a WWF website. Unfortunately we are not able to quote from this press release because the hotel in Dublin where this blog post was created unfortunately does not allow access to websites of political activist groups (see screenshot).

Thus it seems that the hotel has correctly rated the affiliation of the WWF. Little wonder, because when you compare the claims made by the WWF to the results from serious science, the overblown construct collpases. According to the WW, climate change will lead to more storms.
First let’s check whether warmer temperatures lead to more storms at middle latitudes in the past. The result: unexpectedly the exact opposite of what the WWF asserted has actually occurred: i.e., the colder it was, the more stormy is was! For example see our blog article: “Storms in the English Channel occurred in sync with the 1500 year cycle: The colder it was, the stormier it was” as well as other papers here).
And what does the situation with hurricanes look like? Over the long-term it appears that hurricane activity has decreased (see “New climate modeling finds long-term reduction in hurricane activityi“). It is indeed baffling how the WWF could be so reckless with the scientific facts. This is especially troubling in light of the fact that the WWF avidly participated in writing the new IPCC climate report. Just a few months ago observers sounded the alarms when a draft of the IPCC report was prematurely released to the public, where in it several papers from the WWF and Greenpeace were quoted.
The link that Lüning and Vahrenholt could not access from the hotel in Dublin is here.

"The seaside and cities of Britain are under siege by wild and ferocious predators. Birds are wreaking havoc on innocent members of the public with indiscriminate attacks. Some fearful citizens have even reportedly taken to carrying firearms for protection – from gulls. For the seagulls’ list of victims seems to grow all the time. Tourists daring to eat ice creams in daylight, fans of fish and chip take-aways, festival goers, school children, cyclists, tortoises, Chihuahuas, supermarket customers, are all seen as fair game from the skies. So serious is the airborne threat that the Conservative MP for one south-west England constituency called for a parliamentary debate after a friend lost his fish and chips to gulls. Even the notoriously tough South Africa rugby team was accused of being unnerved as their British coastal training ground was dive-bombed during the 2015 World Cup. National newspapers have featured photos of the birds swallowing rats, pigeons, and in one case reported the violent eating of a starling, as “the poor starling chicks were forced to look on”. In 2015 the then prime minister, David Cameron, called for a “big conversation” about the challenge and pledged a quarter of a million pounds to fight back, egged on by the then Liberal Democrat MP Don Foster. The gull has Britain rattled, and its enemies appear to crumble. Neither the £250,000 nor Foster survived that year’s general election. The creatures supposedly terrorising towns and capturing the public imagination are two particular species, the herring gull, Larus argentatus, and its very close cousin the lesser black backed gull, Larus fuscus. Both are large, feisty, greedy generalists happy to pull a worm from a wet lawn or dive bomb a jittery tourist into dropping their lunch.  Both attract critics and supporters in equal measure. The birds are either seen as viscous free loaders who pose a genuine threat to children, or an entertaining part of the British seaside tradition. After all, what exactly do you expect to find beside the sea? But the gulls’ recent fortunes are complex, with both species widespread in northern Europe. In the 20th century their range of habitat expanded and overall populations rose, perhaps due to a decline in hunting and egg collecting, combined with their adoption of refuse tips as prime foraging sites.  At the same time they have retreated from their traditional coastal breeding haunts and have been making their homes in big cities since the 1940s. But despite appearing to be common, their overall numbers are not on the increase. In the UK in the late 1900s the population of lesser black backed gulls fell by 48% between 2000 and 2013. With most birds breeding in just four super-colonies which have all shown marked declines, the lesser black back is now officially an “amber listed” endangered species. Inevitably, labelling the birds both as a psychotic murderer and an endangered species causes confusion. Both species are protected by a mix of UK and European law, although nuisance lesser black backs could, until recently, be controlled with a general licence under the UK’s Wildlife and Countryside Act. But this option was withdrawn as the gulls’ numbers fell and did not apply to herring gulls in the first place.  So what do we do about the sometimes ruffled relationship between gulls and humans? Research from a study in the Netherlands indicated that culling of urban populations may be largely ineffective, merely resulting in new birds migrating in to exploit new nesting and feeding opportunities. One response may be to “gull-proof” rubbish and waste bins, reducing the food available and so reducing the major incentive for the birds to share our urban living spaces.  The trouble is, you cannot gull-proof a tourist. The traditional British seaside sights of donkey rides, deck chairs and buckets and spades are now joined by the day tripper holding out a chip to lure in a beady-eyed gull next to a “Do not feed the gulls” sign as other tourists run for shelter. The gulls continue to dive bomb, terrify, and target the unwary.  Meanwhile, the pair of lesser black backs that last year bred on the roof outside my city centre office in northern England are back. As I write this, they are swooping, mewling, and fighting for dominance in the gusts and eddies of campus buildings. Both of their chicks apparently survived and are probably looking forward to their first high season of adolescent rampage at the nearby promenade, where the notorious local gulls have learned to use the automatic doors of fast food outlets."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe print edition of Spiegel today has an interview with Prof Hans von Storch, the outspoken leading climate scientist often aims criticism at both sides of the climate debate.
Not that von Storch is sort of a provocateur, rather he only speaks his mind, which at times for some means a message they’d prefer not to hear. He has something for both sides today, but moreso for the alarmists.
What follows are some excerpts that appear at von Storch’s Klimazwiebel site on the Spiegel interview and from the interview itself.
Less climate hysteria today
On the climate aspects of the flooding that has just occurred in Germany, HvStorch:
In my view the climate hysteria has decreased. There are still people who with every natural catastrophe are ritually calling out: ‘You see, it’s climate change’s fault!’ But indeed many more people are talking about the real causes of the flooding, like covering the ground with asphalt and concrete and the disappearance of natural flood plains. That’s good.”
Models facing a serious problem
On the current temperature stagnation while CO2 is rising, Klimazwiebel quotes HvStorch: “We face a puzzling problem. Only 2% of the models foresaw this, and if nothing changes in the next 5 to 6 years, research will be faced with a serious problem as not a single model projected that.”
SPIEGEL asks:  “That’s pretty dismal for your colleagues when they have to go back to the drawing board to adjust the models to fit reality…”

HvStorch: “Why? That’s how the process of science works. In science, also in climate science, there is no last word. We never deliver the truth. Rather we deliver the closest approximation of reality. It’s just that this often gets forgotten in the public perception and communication.”
HvStorch adds, “the mistake is that science often produces the impression that it is the keeper of the truth.”
Expect more surprises
Later in the Spiegel interview, HvStorch also believes that the global temperature will eventually resume its rise and may even exceed 2°C, depending on how emissions develop. He thinks so because that is what his instincts tell him, he says. He elaborates further:
Other climate scientists probably have another instinct. Our models do make lots of assumptions that are highly subjective. You can calmly expect more surprises.”
Ocean acidification makes HvS nervous
When asked about his fears on the consequences of climate change, HvStorch replies:
The possible acidification of the oceans from CO2 in the atmosphere. For me that is a phenomenon that is really scary – maybe because I understand too little about it. If marine life was no longer able to adequately form shells and skeletons, that would disrupt the marine food chain. That indeed makes me nervous.”

"The United Nations forecasts global population to rise to more than 9 billion people by 2050. Climate change may mean that the crops we depend on now may no longer be suited to the areas where they are currently cultivated and may increasingly be threatened by droughts, floods and the spread of plant diseases due to altered weather patterns. So feeding everyone in the coming decades will be a challenge – can genetically modified crops help us achieve this?  Two groups of genetically modified crops are widely grown. The first are altered so that they are not affected by the herbicide glyphosate, which means that farmers can eliminate weeds without harming their crop. Glyphosate-resistant crops can increase farming efficiency but, while helping to get rid of weeds, herbicide resistance has no direct effect on the quantity of food produced, so their contribution to food security is likely to be limited.  The second type produce a natural insecticide inside the parts of the plant that pests eat. This protects the yields of these crops against insect infestation, which is arguably more environmentally friendly than using sprays that could be toxic to other organisms. Crops of this type are likely to be useful, but we should increase the number of insecticide genes that we employ to prevent evolution of resistant pests.  Farmers have always faced crop diseases – think of the Irish potato famine of the 19th century – and some scientists predict that climate change may allow previously contained infections to spread into new areas and become more damaging. It may already have contributed to the devastating appearance of a fungal infection called wheat blast in Bangladesh, a disease that can cause nearly complete loss of this critical crop in infected fields. Genetic modification can certainly be used in the fight to make crops more disease resistant. Many plants are vulnerable to an infection because they cannot detect the invading organism. However, the proteins that identify an infection and activate a plant’s defences can be moved between varieties or even species using genetic modification. This will enable previously vulnerable crops to turn on resistance mechanisms. It is also becoming possible to rewrite the genes for these gatekeeper proteins so that they work for different diseases. A powerful and rapid method for editing genes called CRISPR-Cas9 has recently been developed and it is already being harnessed to produce genetically modified crops. For example, genes that make wheat vulnerable to powdery mildew have been changed to produce a resistant variety. Nor is gene editing limited to improving disease resistance. Tomatoes have been tweaked to be insensitive to changes in the number of hours of sunlight in a day. This causes them to produce fruit more quickly because they aren’t waiting for the right time of year to start flowering. Fundamentally, agriculture uses photosynthesis to convert light energy, water and carbon dioxide into food – so improving this process would increase how much food we produce. An obvious target is the step that captures carbon dioxide as it sometimes mistakes oxygen for carbon dioxide in a wasteful set of reactions called photorespiration.  As it happens, some plants already have a solution to this problem. They possess a system that pumps carbon dioxide into specialised parts of the leaf where most photosynthesis occurs, concentrating it there so that photorespiration doesn’t happen. These species, known as C4 plants, can make more use of sunlight at higher temperatures and need less water because the pores that let carbon dioxide into their leaves don’t have to open so much and therefore less water vapour escapes through them.  It has been estimated that transferring these mechanisms into other crop species such as rice could increase productivity by 50%. Unfortunately, progress towards this goal has been slow, partly because rice doesn’t have the same leaf structure as C4 plants. A version of rice that can carry out a simple version of C4 photosynthesis has recently been produced but it will take at least ten years to optimise it.  Less ambitious approaches may provide benefits more quickly, such as a new type of wheat in which productivity has been increased by 15% to 20% by speeding up recycling of ribulose bisphosphate which is crucial for carbon dioxide capture. Crops are not just being genetically modified to improve their quantity but also their nutritional quality. The most prominent of these is “golden rice”. Vitamin A deficiency causes 250,000 deaths per year and is common in populations whose diet is heavily dependent on rice. Golden rice is golden because it produces large quantities of yellow dietary carotenoids that our bodies can convert into vitamin A.  Other “biofortified” crops in development include potatoes with more protein and cooking bananas with increased carotenoids and iron. Many people – and countries – are still sceptical about GM food. But people and animals have now been consuming GM crops for more than 20 years without apparent harm to their health. On the other hand, there is no question that starvation kills and that food insecurity is a major global threat. There are challenging times ahead. Can we afford to close the door on these powerful ways to protect our food supply? _This article is part of a series by The Conversation on food security. Read other articles here."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is a critical article written by Jens Meyer-Wellmann appearing in German national daily Die Welt that got by me a couple of weeks ago.
The title: “Scientists should not play priest…Climate scientist von Storch accuses his colleagues of spreading panic – and sees no major consequences coming from a dredging of the Elbe River“.
Sebastian Lüning’s and Fritz Vahrenholt’s blogsite www.kaltesonne.de presented an excerpt of the Die Welt article, which I’ve translated in English:

‘Unfortunately in climate science there is a tendency to proclaim absolute truths and to link these immediately to instructions on actions to take,’ von Storch said. ‘The climate pope tells us what has to be done, and for the people it’s: keep your mouths shut. Scientists have been taking over the roles of medicine men and priests. That’s not the job of scientists. Science is supposed to help understand problems, show the possibilities that exist in dealing with them. The best is to show many possibilities. Then the political process has to decide the path to take.’
But some of his colleagues in science like to use ‘stories that point to a catastrophe,’ said the professor of meteorology. One example was the assumption that our region would see ‘murderous violent storms’. But there was no data showing this. ‘It all has a cultural, anthropological background’ . ‘If you sin, then you will be punished. And the punishment always takes on an environmental dimension which also included storms in the past. In former times it was God’s punishment. Today it’s punishment by Nature. Nature is to keep man in check. And for this we see idiotic films like ‘The Day After Tomorrow.’’

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Reader Chris Frey below comments that it’s only a 43-year record – not 100 years! Either way, it’s lots of snow. 
Today Focus magazine reports that Berlin has set a new record for the amount of snow on the ground in the month of March. The online news magazine writes:
A 16-centimeter blanket of snow covers the capital city on the first day of spring. ‘It’s the highest amount of snow that has been measured here in March in 100 years,“ says meteorologist Dominik Jung of the weather portal wetter.net.”
In Germany it’s getting so that children will soon no longer know what bare ground in the wintertime is.
High-profile German meteorologist turns skeptic
I recall getting a bit agitated a year or so ago because Jung once repeated the usual global warming rubbish we always hear in the media. But now that Germany has recorded its 5th colder than normal winter in a row and Berlin and Hamburg find themselves digging out from record snow, Jung apparently has looked at the science and data for himself and now seems to conclude that the CO2 theory is indeed over-hyped after all.
Hopefully he’ll pick up a copy of Die kalte Sonne to get complete overview of the science, if he hasn’t already.

Jung’s skepticism is now being reported in major media outlets all over Germany. For example Germany’s no. 1 daily by circulation numbers Bild quoted Jung’s wetternet.de website in bold print yesterday:
“Winters clearly have gotten colder,” says meteorologist Dominik Jung of the weather portal wetter.net. Moreover: “In the year 2000 the climate experts prophesied that winters with ice and snow in Germany would no longer exist. That this claim is false is shown by current facts, and in many regions with just a glance out the window!”
German yahoo.de reports here:
March so far in Germany is about 3.4°C colder than the long-term mean over the period 1981 – 2010. Now weather expert Dominik Jung is questioning climate warming: ‘I don’t think that it’s always going to get warmer.’“
Expect Jung to get a harsh lecture from the catastrophe-obsessed PIK on the evils of spreading “climate disinformation”, if he hasn’t already.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAll the talk now is about the Otto et al paper that just has come out, which claims that, well, the warming isn’t going to be like we thought. Oops.

Chart source: www.nature.com/ngeo/journal.pdf
Spiegel provides a first glimpse of the reaction from Germany: New Study On Climate Change: Earth Warming More Slowly Than Feared.
The Spiegel piece starts:
Most extreme scenarios less likely…
An international team of scientists have corrected the prognoses for climate change downwards. In a new study the scientists calculated a smaller global warming for the next 50 to 100 years than previously expected. But they did not turn off the alarm.”

And later writes:

The annual mean temperature would thus be about 0.9°C and 2°C higher than pre-industrial times. Thus they are considerably less than the forecast of the UN climate scientists in the year 2007, who estimated an increase of 1 – 3°C .
Co-author Reto Knutti said the new estimates for the time period are welcome.”
Reasons cited for the slowdown are heat absorption by the oceans, reduced solar activity, and high levels of aerosols in the atmosphere. Spiegel ends the article with:
Lead author Otto says the slowdown is not evidence that climate change is not going to happen. ‘You would need a considerably longer time period to be able to say there is not going to be any warming,’ he told the ‘Guardian’. Such a phase could last up to 40 years.”
You’ve got to be kidding me. Now it’s 40 years?
The recent warming was just 18 years long 1980 – 1998, and that was enough for them to declare a permanent climate state of emergency. And now that it hasn’t warmed in 15 years, they’re telling us that we’ve got to wait another 25 years to say that it’s not man-made. Such BS.
First rats to abandon ship
So what would possibly compel a group of mostly alarmist scientists to produce such results? Answer: It has dawned on them that other factors really are playing a big time role and that it wouldn’t be long before they looked like fools. What we are seeing are the first rats swimming off the sinking ship that is man-made global warming.

"Primates are remarkable. We’re all familiar with chimpanzees, monkeys, and ring-tailed lemurs, but have you heard of tarsiers, with their big eyes? Or Cleese’s woolly lemur, named after John Cleese? Or the fabulous red-shanked douc? What about the scary-looking red-headed bald uakari? Or did you know that primates can be as small as mice? There are 504 species in all, which makes primates one of the largest groups of mammals. Some – those we’re most familiar with – are active during the day, but others come out only at night. Some eat fruit, others eat leaves, still others eat insects, and some hunt for meat. One species mainly eats mushrooms, and some even eat other primates. Primates mostly live in tropical rainforests, and two thirds of all species can be found in Brazil, Madagascar, Indonesia or the Democratic Republic of Congo. But they can also be found in grassland, snowy mountains and deserts, and some even thrive in our cities.  Primates can live in solitude, in huge, complex societies, or anything in between. Some swing through the trees with such grace that they look like they’re flying, others don’t seem to move very much at all. Some sing duets. Many of them are superbly colourful. Some are beautiful; others are ugly. All of them are fascinating. I’ve been studying primates for 20 years, and I’m still surprised and delighted by new discoveries. Like the day I saw female monkeys attack a male three times their size. Or when I learned that some primates bury themselves in the ground to hibernate. And that capuchins crush millipedes and use them as insect repellent.  Primates are also essential to tropical rainforests, pollinating trees and dispersing seeds across these vital carbon stores. They’re our closest biological relatives, and we look to them to understand our own evolution. Over the past couple of years, I’ve been part of a global group of primatologists who have assessed the conservation status of all those 504 species. Our results are now published in the journal Science Advances.  The news is bad – primates are in dire trouble. Around 60% of species are threatened with extinction and 75% are declining in numbers. Without action, these numbers will grow and more species will disappear forever. This dismal situation is our fault. Primates are mainly threatened by losing their habitat when it is logged or converted into farms or ranches. They can also be hunted for meat, or to supply the illegal trade in pets and body parts. Road construction, oil and gas extraction, mining, pollution, disease and climate change all add to the list of threats, often in combination. I have flown over agricultural land that has replaced tropical forests, and stood among the charred remains of what was primate habitat. I have driven along newly constructed roads and seen dead primates for sale, and shopped in markets which sell bushmeat. I have seen newly-caught baby monkeys, destined to die slowly despite the best efforts of their human carers. I have worked with rescued animals and pondered their future. I have travelled on rainforest rivers heavily but invisibly polluted by illegal mining. I have come across hunters’ camps deep in protected areas, and I have walked through silent forests, emptied of animals. People living in these areas don’t set out to exterminate primate species. I have talked with people driven to distraction when their subsistence crops are ravaged by wildlife, including primates; with hunters who hunt to feed their family and to earn money for their children’s schooling and for medical bills; and with fisherpeople who hunt primates to feed their family when there are no fish available. The threat to primates is a result of political uncertainty, socio-economic instability, organised crime, corruption, and policies that favour short-term profit over long-term sustainability. It is hard to be positive when faced with human-driven extinction of our closest relatives. The situation is critical, but we, the 31 authors of the new report, led by Alejandro Estrada of Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and Paul A Garber of the University of Illinois, believe it is still reversible. To prevent primate extinctions, human needs must be addressed in sustainable ways, whether that be locally (finding ways for farmers to coexist with primates who forage on their crops) or globally (halting deforestation). There is no single answer. Conservation policies must be adapted for each country, habitat or species, based on the exact nature of each problem. This is a formidable task. But our hope stems from exceptional projects and extraordinary people around the world, like the Virunga rangers who risk (and lose) their lives to protect gorillas and other primates in DR Congo or Fundacion Pro-Conservation Primates Panamenos, an organisation dedicated to conserving Panama’s monkeys. The solutions lie in global fairness, and taking responsibility for the implications of our actions. We can’t ignore political and human disasters in other countries. We need to accommodate the needs of both primates and people in land-use policies, monitor primate populations, and mitigate illegal trade. Captive populations can be used to rescue species from the brink of extinction, but if their natural habitat has gone, there is no hope.  To reduce the pressure on primates and their habitats we must decrease demand for tropical hardwood, beef, palm oil, soy, rubber, minerals and fossil fuels, and promote sustainable resources. This is not news, but we must make it unacceptable to prioritise excessive and unnecessary consumption over the persistence of other species. Every consumer decision we make has global implications. Moreover, we must understand that wild animals are not suitable pets (the clue is in the word “wild”). Biologically, extinction is a normal phenomenon. Species evolve, and species go extinct. From time-to-time in earth’s history, mass extinctions have wiped out huge numbers of species globally. However, we cannot accept that we, as one primate species, drive others to extinction when are still able to prevent it. Next, read our profile of the most endangered primate of all – the Hainan gibbon."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAfter a foray in a cult, one of the first steps on the path back to reality is the process of deprogramming. Could it be that this step is now being self-administered by the German mainstream media? It appears so.

Harald Martenstein: “…it seems they are allowed to get away with everything.” Photo credit: Lumu, GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
Now that the global mean temperature curve has drifted out of and below the IPCC’s projected range, panic is breaking out.
The mother of German green weeklies, Die Zeit, appears to be taking measurements at the back of the house in preparation for the installation of a back door! Rahmstorf is back there with them, trying to talk them out of it.
Leading lefty journalist Harald Martenstein of Die Zeit, a weekly that recently portrayed Marc Morano as the Don Corleone of the North American climate denial syndicate, has an amusingly satirical essay on the misfortunes of climate science and modeling: On the surprises of climate change. Hat/tip: klimazwiebel. If you can read German, his essay is a jewel in irony and humor to behold. Effective because few things convey a message better than music or humor.
Martenstein, once a devout believer of the global warming religion, apparently has been struggling to reconcile the glaring differences between climate expectations and hard reality.
Martenstein begins by first claiming he is not a climate skeptic, and tells the story of how he bought a house in the Uckermark in northeastern Germany because renowned scientists had been telling us that “the climate in Germany would be warmer. It would become similar to the Mediterranean.”
He then writes that former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, however, seemed to be unconcerned about the ominous hothouse-Europe climate projections, and went on to purchase a vacation home down south in Turkey. Martenstein seemed baffled by Schröder’s decision, writing, “I was ready to open my home to the Schröders as soon as they would no longer be able to take the 60°C heat in the shade. But instead it got colder and colder. In the Uckermark in the wintertime it was -20°C for weeks.”

Martenstein also noticed that Britain had endured its coldest winter in 30 years, Florida got covered by icicles, and the cold seemed to be spreading everywhere. So he pleaded that people should emit more CO2 – so that he could stay warm.
His plea, however, prompted an invitation from a “scientist at a very nice climate institute“:
He showed me tables and graphs that clearly depicted it was getting warmer. He believed that I was just a victim of my own subjective imagination. Memory can fool you. One thinks that during childhood it was warm from May to September, but in reality its was warm only 3 days, and it is those 3 days that one remembers intensively. The tables from climate scientists, on the other hand, do not lie.”
Martenstein then recounts the past winter and how it seemed to him as being the longest and hardest he could remember, but telling himself that it was probably just his warped subjectivity acting up again. He writes:
But suddenly I read in the paper that a number of climate scientists had changed their minds. Now they were saying it is not going to get warmer, but colder, at least in Europe. Whatever happened to the tables, I ask myself.”
This kind of science would never fly in biology or physics, Martenstein writes. “But with climate science it seems they are allowed to get away with everything.”
Today it has dawned on Martenstein that Schröder had been wise to buy a vacation home in Turkey, where at least the summers are warm. He ends his piece:
The polar bears are not dying off, no. They are moving to Uckermark. I’m not a climate skeptic, I’m just disappointed.”
Thanks for the wonderful humor, Herr Martenstein. Overall, however, the climate story is a sad and embarrassing one for the field of science and humanity.

"Coral coverage around some of the most popular tourist islands on the Great Barrier Reef has dropped by almost half in the last 18 years, according to a new study. Scientists said they were “shocked” after analysing data from monitoring dives between 1999 and 2017 at 100 different locations across the Whitsunday Islands, Magnetic Island, Keppel Islands and Palm Islands.  The study looked at the coverage of hard corals – the rock-like structures that are the foundations for building reefs – and found they were being hit by multiple impacts, including heat stress causing bleaching, cyclones, flood plumes and poor water quality. Daniela Ceccarelli, of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University, said: “The loss [of hard corals] was between 40 and 50% at each island group. We were pretty shocked actually.” She said that inshore reefs like the ones studied were more susceptible to impacts from sediments and nutrients running off the land, especially reefs that were less exposed to waves that could wash pollution away more quickly. Published in the Ecological Society of America’s Ecological Applications journal, the study found “persistent shifts from coral to macroalgal dominance” on some reefs in the central and southern parts of the system. The study aimed to tease apart the relative importance of different stressors on inshore island reefs, including the impacts of heat stress, flood plumes and exposure to cyclones. Co-author David Williamson, also from James Cook University, said: “The impacts of individual disturbance events were patchy. Some reefs avoided the worst effects –but the cumulative impacts of multiple, frequent events reduced coral cover and diversity.” On reefs around the Whitsunday Islands, one of the most popular destinations in the Great Barrier Reef marine park, coral cover had been relatively stable until 2016, after coral bleaching and then Cyclone Debbie saw a sharp drop in hard corals. Ceccarelli said that even though the findings were shocking, there were still many stunning areas for tourists and divers to visit around the islands, including the Whitsundays where some individual reefs were in excellent condition. She said some disturbances on reefs were natural and “important for maintaining diversity”, but she added: “We are seeing increased frequency of these disturbance events and we worry [reefs] won’t get enough time to recover between them.” She said that faster-growing corals could recover from major disturbances after about seven to 10 years, but for a whole coral community that included slower-growing corals, recovery times were between 15 and 20 years. Scientists are concerned that major coral bleaching and heat stress events caused by ocean heating will hit the Great Barrier Reef at intervals too short to let corals recover. The reef, the world’s biggest coral reef system, was hit by major bleaching events in 2016 and 2017, with impacts concentrated in the northern parts of the reef. The study also questioned a previous conclusion that corals on inshore reefs were more tolerant of higher temperatures. The study concluded that “although rapidly escalating climate change impacts are the largest threat to coral reefs of the Great Barrier Reef” it was also important that localised impacts, including runoff from the land, was proactively managed. “It’s definitely not too late to save the reef,” she said. “It’s not dead, but it might be on intensive care.” In a major five-yearly report published in August, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority downgraded the reef’s long-term outlook to “very poor” for the first time since 2009 when the report was first published."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel here reports on the results of a new recently published survey on how Germans view climate change.
The cooked study (yes, I think the survey is very dubious) was conducted by Engels et al.  The dressed-up as science survey comes from the cabal of usual warmist suspects.
According to Spiegel, based on a telephone survey of 3000 people conducted in 2011, only 7% of Germans are “climate skeptics”. The survey asked to what extent people agreed to the following 4 statements based on a scale of 1 to 5 (1= totally agree; 5= absolutely do not agree). My own ratings are in parentheses:
1. Climate change is now happening. (1)
2. Climate change is caused by man. (2)
3. Climate change is a serious problem. (1)
4. Climate science is unanimous that there is climate change is taking place. (1)
Gee, I’m not a skeptic! That sure is news to me.
But then again, climate change is always occurring; everyone knows that. And it is a serious problem, especially when it cools. Statement No. 2 is just too vague. Sure man causes climate change, e.g. through landuse.
Clearly the statements are loaded to produce a certain misleading perception. Many skeptics would assign a number of 1 or 2 to every statement above. Such surveys never ask if climate science exaggerates 5 = a lot or 1 = not at all. The results of that of course wouldn’t fit the narrative.
Spiegel writes:
Only two percent said they absolutely did not agree to Statement 1, five percent for “generally do not agree”. A similar result was recorded for the third Statement, i.e. on the perception of possible consequences of climate change. […]
In the USA there are considerably more skeptics – and ‘total deniers’, say the scientists at the University of Hamburg.”

It is true that a vast majority of Germans believe that today’s climate change (though temps haven’t risen in 15 years) is mostly due to man. Yet, the results could be interpreted as an indication that skepticism and the climate discussion are in fact massively suppressed by institutions in Germany. The Engels et al survey just happens to follow the recently released brochure by the German Ministry of Environment, which tried to declare the climate science debate over, went on to issue a blanket dismissal of climate skeptics, even going so far to blacklist prominent Germans skeptics. The dubious Engels et al Survey is just the latest in a series of propoganda attempts to bully, portray and marginalize climate skeptics as fringe operators.
If the survey’s portrayal of skeptics were indeed accurate, then why go through all the trouble of devoting so many resources to marginalize this supposedly tiny gaggle of fringe dissenters? To the contrary, skeptics of a man-made climate catastrophe are far more widespread than what the survey would have us believe.
The paper’s abstract states that the authors “looked for systematic linkages between public climate-change skepticism on one hand, and energy preferences and political participation on the other. Germany is an interesting testbed as it is currently involved in a large-scale restructuring of its system of energy supply toward renewable energy sources (the ‘Energiewende’). Our results indicate that climate-change skepticism has not diffused widely in Germany, but that it correlates with less support of renewable energy sources.”
Firstly I’d be very careful about basing any conclusion on such a sloppy survey. Secondly, alternative energies are unpopular among skeptics because of 1) their high price, 2) their supply instability, 3) they aren’t really doing anything for the climate, and 4) the expensive and unreliable renewable energies were legitimized by a highly dubious science that has been manipulated by special interests and powerful lobby groups. Of course they are going to correlate.
The survey comments on the “political participation” by the skeptics:
However, skepticism correlates negatively with political participation, and there is no strong political outlet for public climate-change skepticism in Germany.
This statement is very vague, perhaps purposely so. Skeptics are very much politically active in Germany. However, they have been severely suppressed and denied a voice. They are often denied the microphone or space in the print media. Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning were dragged through the mud for weeks and months, only because they presented a non-catastrophic view. In the USA, on the other hand, a number of politicians and media outlets have been openly sympathetic to skeptic views and a balanced discussion. This is not the case in dogmatic Germany.
As the recent brochure by the German Ministry of Environment shows, skeptics are not welcome and definitely should not be heard. And now the Engels et al survey falsely suggests that we are too small to be taken seriously.
In the end Germany is going to do what it wants. However, it should ask itself if it is wise to continue down the “Great Transformation” path when the rest of the world focusses on shale gas and adopts a serious CO2 climate sensitivity value for policy making. If not, Germany risks pricing itself out of the global market. Right now very few countries are impressed by Germany’s tattered renewable energy revolution, and are less likely than ever to follow its lead.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe EU in partnership with the WWF has just released a strategy report dubbed: ADOPTING HEALTHY, SUSTAINABLE DIETS: KEY OPPORTUNITIES AND BARRIERS, which is part of LiveWell for LIFE, “a pioneering project which aims to contribute towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the EU food supply chain, and demonstrate what sustainable diets could look like for different European countries.”
Hat-tip DirkH.
The report’s introduction begins by stating that the European super state now needs to control our food diets:
Food consumption patterns in Europe are currently unsustainable: European food consumption is responsible for a large part of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions. It is accepted that there needs to be a reduction in global greenhouse gas emission which are contributing to climate change. […] LiveWell for LIFE is a pioneering project which aims to contribute towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the EU food supply chain, and demonstrate what sustainable diets could look like for different European countries.”
The report writes that it “is a summary of the efforts of LiveWell for LIFE and the Network of European Food Stakeholders to find the most important social and economic barriers and opportunities for sustainable diets in Spain, France and Sweden and in the EU“.
It’s no secret that environmentalist, left-wing, vegetarian, authoritarian wackos have had their eye on dictating human eating habits for a long time, and have had a hard time stomaching our appetite for meat on our plates and barbecue grills. Read here for example.  Before too long we’ll have to content ourselves with celery and carrot sticks.
The report writes on pages 11-12:
The Italian Barilla Centre for Food and Nutrition has identified the rise of the responsible consumer and what it terms consumActors – sustainability-savvy consumers who want to be involved in the food production process. According to its research, people’s dietary habits will have to radically transform in order to meet the dietary and nutritional needs of a growing population in a world that is more affluent and more urbanised. And they’ll have to take responsibility for their choices too – something that may come as a shock to the average post-modern consumer.”
A growing number of consumers are open to the idea of changing their diets. For example in the UK, government research found that 62% of respondents were ‘very or fairly willing’ to give up red meat, while 36% were ‘very or fairly willing’ to give up dairy products. Dutch research has identified a growing interest in flexitarian eating: a vegetarian diet that occasionally includes meat.”

Here we note that the target food staple is meat and dairy products. Getting people to change their eating habits and abstain from consuming certain staples is no easy task. The report has identified motivation factors. Interestingly, environmental factors rank at the very bottom (p. 13):
Health is a motivator for behaviour change – more than any concern about the environment. UK government research into attitudes and behaviour around sustainable food found that health is the most important factor for consumers (81%). Environmental sustainability was the least important (26%). A study of consumers in the 27 EU member states also showed that health was more important than environmental concerns for consumer food choices. Some 32% of people said they would like to buy meat or meat products less often. The main reason given was for health (54%) compared to 16% for environmental reasons.”
It goes without saying that consumers want healthy food. But at the same time many also want to experience eating pleasure. Each has to decide the balance that is right for him/herself.
It quickly becomes obvious in the report’s language that EU bureaucrats think that consumers are just too stupid to make the right decisions. Throughout the report one finds the terms like “unaware” or “confusion“, or “limited knowledge“, or “lack of understanding” to name a few when discussing the consumer.
The report is just one of the first steps in the EU’s scheme to take over the human diet. The report ends:

Going forward, LiveWell for LIFE will explore these opportunities and barriers as we find ways to adopt sustainable diets in the pilot countries, and the policy changes needed for a move towards sustainable diets across the EU.”

I smell massive meat taxes cooking in the EU regulatory kitchen. The food tyranny is coming! Be prepared to be spoon-fed bland, organic baby-food by the EU super-nanny state.

"Back in the 1930s, English planners came up with a novel idea to prevent urban sprawl: a ring of countryside surrounding the city, protected from development by law. This “green belt” would preserve the unique characters of historic towns, safeguard the countryside from development and encourage the regeneration and reuse of urban land. It was adopted nationally in 1955, and around 13% of England is now zoned as green belt land.  But today, the UK is experiencing a housing crisis. The nation requires 220,000 new homes each year to keep up with demand – not to mention making up for the undersupply from previous years. In the year to September 2016, only 141,000 were built. This deficit has sparked renewed debate over the value of the green belt.  Leading housebuilders and think tanks argue that selectively releasing parts of the green belt would help to meet the government’s ambitious housebuilding targets. Meanwhile, other pressure groups claim that the green belt should be sacrosanct, to safeguard the environmental and health benefits it provides for nearby towns and cities.  In theory, the green belt is protected within the government’s planning framework. Alterations to the green belt boundaries can only be made by local governments in exceptional circumstances, and individual planning applications on green belt sites are only approved under very special circumstances.  In practice, though, it seems the criteria aren’t always quite so strict. Increasingly, greenfield sites (undeveloped land, which can include the green belt) are being favoured by developers because they are cheaper to exploit than brownfield sites (previously developed land, such as disused industrial estates), which have much higher transaction costs.  In fact, national planning policy encourages development on greenfield sites through the use of highly questionable “objective” assessments (or rather, estimates) of housing need, based on past trends and dubious population projections. What’s more, measures of economic viability only take stock of profit, and fail to incorporate environmental or social considerations.  The case for development is also propped up by overly simplified claims that much of the green belt is poor-quality, unproductive land, with no clear requirements for good management. This incremental assaults on the green belt overlook the need for vital infrastructure and services to create strong, resilient communities and sustainable places. In fact, the green belt holds significant market and non-market value for urban economies, which pose a challenge conventional economic arguments in favour of more houses on “unproductive” green belt land.  For one thing, releasing the green belt in the wrong place comes with certain costs, such as longer commutes, worse congestion and more dangerous levels of air pollution, as well as increased risk of surface water flooding. These costs are normally exacted after development, and don’t appear in initial assessments. The green belt when seen as part of critical green infrastructure has the potential to deliver multiple benefits for cities: it provides space for agriculture, protection from flooding and drought, it improves air quality and mitigates the urban heat island effect, as well as enabling recreation and enhancing biodiversity.  The challenge, then, is to identify where these benefits of the greenbelt can be optimised, and the costs of development minimised. At a national level, England lacks a strategic plan to to identify the best sites for housing, jobs and key infrastructure. This is needed to drive sustainable growth and address deep-rooted problems, such as the divide between the wealthy but congested south-east, and the less prosperous north.  On a local level, it means planning to put the right developments in the right place. This isn’t limited to houses: city outskirts can be rejuvenated by community food-growing initiatives, or wetlands created for flood protection and biodiversity. Local authorities should think and plan strategically and form long-term visions about the kind of places they want to create – just like the great planners of England’s historic garden cities.   The recent housing white paper requires local authorities to meet housing demand, but crucially fails to move away from fetish on housing numbers and address the current strategic planning void. It does however, propose a standard method for calculating housing need, which is welcome and will prevent delays to local plans over disputed methodologies.  Strategic, cross-boundary planning can help to make the green belt more productive and deliver more houses. Green belt value can be enhanced through positive management of its natural capital. It’s time to leave behind the polarised and siloed green belt debate, and recognise that housing, industry, transport, community, landscape and environment are vital pieces of the planning jigsaw for cities, towns and countryside."
"Children are seeing through the short-termism of politics and the current generation of politicians, according to former Liberal leader John Hewson. On ABC’s Q&A program on Monday night, Hewson said the modus operandi of leaders such as US president Donald Trump and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison was to target nervousness about alternative policies and instead focus on short-term political gain.  “The system has become sort of inward looking and self-absorbed. The sort of people who get preselected these days are not necessarily those who will make good ministers,” he said. “The skills you need to get through the factional process to be preselected in any of the major parties are not skills that will help you run a multibillion-dollar portfolio. “We’re getting the wrong people.” Hewson singled out, in particular, the “tribalism” of Australian politics leading to inaction on climate change for the past decade, and said the next generation would see through the short-termism. “That’s where I think the Greta Thunbergs and my kids see what’s wrong with us. They see we’ve missed the point,” he said. “I know it’s black and white, you’re either doing it or you’re not doing it, but it [will] make a big difference that the next generation as soon as they vote, you’ll have a very different world in this country and I think globally.” In September Morrison responded to Thunberg’s speech to the UN, saying he wanted Australian children to grow up feeling positive about the future, without any anxiety. Chloë Spackman, director of programs at Australian Futures Project, said the debate needed to be reframed. “I think we need to reframe the conversation as it’s urgent and we need to do something but we want to be doing that from a place of possibility,” she said. Science writer Julian Cribb said people shouldn’t be scaring children, but informing them. “They can then apply their minds to solving them … Greta Thunberg and the rest are already into that and they will change the world whether we like it or not.” Veena Sahajwalla, inventor and director at the Centre for Sustainable Materials Research and Technology, said people can be positive about the possibility of innovation in response to the challenges facing the world. “I think the ability to see that there are positive solutions and to be able to think about how we might be able to convert something that might sound like it’s all doom and gloom but when you unpack it and think about what we can do with new technologies as we’re developing new technologies, I think it’s fantastic,” she said."
"The opening in January 2017 of an “eco-hamlet” for council house tenants in West Wales is great news. I have nothing but praise for a development which builds houses with a low carbon footprint, using locally grown wood, to make homes which are well insulated and powered by solar energy. It was also quick to build, with large sections being made in a factory and then assembled on site. And it was relatively cheap – at around £70,000 to £100,000 per building, it is certainly comparable to the costs of more conventional builds.  These houses are an inspiration to the construction industry and an aspiration for the home owner. After all, who wouldn’t like to live in a house that had yearly utility bills of £200, rather than the national average of £1,500? So the problem is not the six wonderful solar houses at Glanrhyd, Pembrokeshire, or the lucky people who will get to live in them (and enjoy shared use of an electric car). The problem is that we’ve seen all of this before – but nothing changes. What we really need is far, far more of them. I’ve been involved in sustainable construction for nearly 25 years and seen many inspirational developments like Glanrhyd. There’s Julian Marsh’s home in Nottingham, Susan Roaf’s Oxford Ecohouse and the Hockerton Housing Project, to name but a few. The list is long. Yet while many individuals continue to build these innovative and inspirational structures, we have a construction industry which still responds to these buildings with disdain. One executive from a large well-known house building company told me in conversation recently: “This is a new, expensive and untested technology. We just can’t risk building something so new with all the risks to the consumer and at a higher cost.” But the situation is even worse than the disdain from the mainstream construction industry. Rather than being welcomed, the latest versions of these sustainable buildings are challenged at every turn. The initial response to the Welsh eco-hamlet plans were concerns about the materials, the technology and the design. The houses at Glanrhyd then had more than 20 planning conditions placed upon them. The CEO of Western Solar, the company behing the hamlet, freely admits that nearly half of their research budget went on solving problems they encountered along the way.   So it seems this kind of development just isn’t celebrated enough. There is a general atmosphere of mistrust from construction professionals. It is seen as too complex, too expensive, too risky. Yet there are positive reactions, too. Welsh politician Lesley Griffiths had this to say about the new houses in Glanrhyd: This scheme ticks so many boxes. We need more houses, we need more energy efficiency, we want to help people with fuel poverty. It’s been really good to hear how they have sourced local products. It’s great they’re using local people to build the houses.  Surely we need to take the eco-technology we have and start rolling it out on a much larger scale. To do so would be a massive step in meeting the significant housing shortage (an estimated 125,000 new houses are needed every year). It would also address the disrepair of our current housing stock, and help refit the millions of houses in good repair but requiring improved performance in order to achieve the government’s 2050 carbon reduction target.  We must not forget that the 2050 Climate Change target is not some arbitrary political policy, but one based on the environmental challenge facing all of us. We need to play our part in slowing down the speed of climate change and adapting to the changing natural, social and economic environment.  The solar houses in Pembrokeshire are wonderful. But until we start building huge numbers of buildings with similar credentials, we are just celebrating a cottage industry rather than restructuring our urban environment for an uncertain future."

"Pension funds and asset managers will have to disclose their shareholder voting records on issues including the climate crisis, as part of UK guidelines that will come into force in January. The revamped stewardship code means firms will have to publish annual reports showing they have taken environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into account when investing and engaging with companies.  Signatories will have to prove they took appropriate action in the preceding 12 months by publishing their full shareholder voting records. They will also have to explain the rationale behind their voting decisions and outline how they are responding to systemic risks such as the climate emergency. Those who fail to comply risk being shamed by ejection from the public list of signatories to the code. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the accounting watchdog that has been in charge of managing the code since its launch in 2010, has also expanded the scope of the guidelines beyond asset managers to include pension funds, insurers, investment consultants and proxy advisers. The FRC said it would help “align the approach of the whole investment community”. The move will also expand its 289-strong list of signatories – although new firms will have to formally apply to be included from its launch. The FRC chair, Simon Dingemans, said: “It is an ambitious revision that strengthens the UK’s standards of governance, transparency and clear reporting. We are looking for widespread adoption by the investment community, reinforcing the attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business and delivering real benefits to the economy, the environment and society more broadly.” The first set of annual reports will cover signatories’ actions in 2020, with the first disclosures due in 2021. It marks the first major overhaul of the stewardship code since 2012 and comes just months after the influential Business Roundtable in the US made waves across the investment community by dropping its long-held shareholder-first policy. Asset managers have recently come under scrutiny for continuing to invest in carbon-heavy industries as climate worries grow. It has led fund management firms including Legal & General Investment Management to start divesting from companies such as oil giant ExxonMobil that have dragged their feet and failed to adapt their business models. The Investment Association, which represents City firms with £7.7tn in assets under management, welcomed the revised code and said it set an “ambitious standard” for UK firms.  Rachel Reeves, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, said the overhaul was a positive step, but that the government should give the new accounting regulator – meant to replace the FRC – full legal powers. “The government needs to play its part too and, at the very least, bring forward the legislation to put the FRC’s replacement on a statutory footing, so that the regulator has the tools it needs to hold auditors, investors and directors to account.”"
"Ocean acidification is an inevitable consequence of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That’s a matter of fact. We don’t know exactly what will happen to complex marine ecosystems when faced with the additional stress of falling pH, but we do know those changes are happening and that they won’t be good news. The journalist James Delingpole disagrees. In an article for The Spectator in April 2016, he took the sceptical position that all concerns over ocean acidification are unjustified “alarmism” and that the scientific study of this non-problem is a waste of money. He concluded that the only reason that the study of ocean acidification was ever funded at all was because there was insufficient (and decreasing) evidence for global warming and it acted as a “fallback position”. Having had the role of science coordinator for the UK Ocean Acidification research programme and being involved in relevant national and international projects for around ten years previously, I know such claims – which Delingpole presented as facts – to be false. I also spotted a range of other errors and inaccuracies in his piece.  Having first gone to The Spectator with my concerns, in late August I submitted a formal complaint to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO). The key issues were whether or not due care had been taken to avoid publication of inaccurate information, and whether comment and conjecture had been clearly distinguished from fact.  At the end of a long and frustrating process IPSO’s final ruling was published on January 5 and it doesn’t seem we are much further forward. My complaint was rejected on the basis that the article was “clearly a comment piece” and that it was not IPSO’s role to resolve conflicting evidence for contentious issues.  Freedom of speech, and of the press, is, of course, extremely precious. Yet that freedom also brings responsibility. The Editors’ Code of Practice – which IPSO claims to uphold – requires the “highest professional standards”. Let’s remind ourselves of what this means when it comes to accuracy: i) The press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text. ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and – where appropriate – an apology published. That would seem clear enough. So let’s look at just one of Delingpole’s paragraphs and judge for ourselves whether these standards were met: Ocean acidification theory appears to have been fatally flawed almost from the start. In 2004, two NOAA scientists, Richard Feely and Christopher Sabine, produced a chart showing a strong correlation between rising atmospheric CO2 levels and falling oceanic pH levels. But then, just over a year ago, Mike Wallace, a hydrologist with 30 years’ experience, noticed while researching his PhD that they had omitted some key information. Their chart only started in 1988 but, as Wallace knew, there were records dating back to at least 100 years before. So why had they ignored the real-world evidence in favour of computer-modelled projections? When Wallace plotted a chart of his own, incorporating all the available data, covering the period from 1910 to the present, his results were surprising: there has been no reduction in oceanic pH levels in the last century. That might look like a plausible argument based on fact. But the Feely/Sabine chart which was of concern to Wallace was published in 2006, not 2004; the chart didn’t start in 1988, but covered the period 1850-2100; and no data had been omitted, since it showed an idealised, theory-based relationship between atmospheric CO2 and ocean pH. Meanwhile the “real-world evidence” was from extremely unreliable early measurements, uncorrected for natural variability, that when combined gave physically impossible year-on-year changes in global pH. And Wallace’s analyses have not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Delingpole did not contact any of the individuals mentioned to obtain first-hand accounts of the issues of concern. To be fair, several of Delingpole’s inaccuracies, such as NERC (the Natural Environment Research Council) rather than Defra being the main funder of the UK Ocean Acidification research programme, were acknowledged by IPSO – but the regulator ruled that they were not “significantly” misleading, neither cumulatively nor individually. It didn’t seem to matter to IPSO that calling science’s approach to acidification “alarmism” – and implying that researchers have said that everything in the sea will die – is rather different from the well-established scientific knowledge that ocean acidification really does affect sensitive species, such as corals, and will therefore disrupt ecosystems.  The Editor’s Code of Practice has this to say about opinion and comment: The press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. So read this statement from Delingpole: Ocean acidification – the evidence increasingly suggests – is a trivial, misleadingly named, and not remotely worrying phenomenon which has been hyped up beyond all measure for political, ideological and financial reasons. Is this just an honest opinion, a statement of fact, or wilfully misleading and clever rhetoric? That depends on what is meant by “evidence”. If it means quality research carried out by scientists with expertise in the field, the statement is factually incorrect. But if evidence includes anything said by non-experts, such as Delingpole, then that’s an increase, right? All these issues may seem technical or unimportant to anyone but scientists or most of the public. But IPSO’s overall message is that ocean acidification is just a matter of opinion – not a hard-won, testable understanding of the likely effects of human-driven changes on the marine environment. This view of science is pernicious and has serious policy consequences. Why support any research if 250 peer-reviewed papers produced by the UK Ocean Acidification research programme can all be summarily dismissed as worthless?   From a back of the envelope analysis of IPSO’s published statistics on its adjudications on complaints it appears that about 18% of those investigated are upheld. I can’t pretend to be an expert on the nature of complaints about the press and don’t know what proportion is vexatious or can be dismissed out of hand, but it’s important to note that the overwhelming majority of complaints received by IPSO – at least 95% by my calculation – are not investigated or taken further, since they come under the heading complaints IPSO could not deal with. This might be good news for publishers, but seems a very depressing statistic for those who feel wronged by the press. Does this really mean that anything goes if it is presented, however tenuously, as “comment” or “opinion”? Doesn’t “care taken” involve basic fact-checking and making a proper effort to contact quoted or maligned individuals before publication? Are political blogs, disputed newspaper coverage and think-tank reports reliable information sources, while properly peer-reviewed scientific literature can be disregarded? There’s a passionate debate going on in journalism at the moment about regulation – and most journalists believe, probably correctly – that the industry should be its own watchdog. But these sorts of decisions make you wonder whether they are up to the task. All this is in my opinion, of course."

Is the world warming, cooling, or is the global temperature standing still? What does the future hold? Do past trends mean anything for the future? What period are we examining?
For the purposes of this article, several short and long periods will be examined, 15, 150 and over 1000 years into the past, and predictions for 40 to 70 years into the future. 15 years is actually a very short period in light of the fact that the AMO and PDO tend to vary in 60+ year cycles. We are currently near or just past the peak of both of these ocean cycles. The 1970’s cool period was 40 years ago. The 1980’s and 90’s were a period of warming. The peak was reached with a crescendo in the 1998 super-El Niño year. Here is a chart beginning January 1998.

Figure 1 is temperatures from HADCRUT4, sea surface (SST), and UHA, plotted with a combination of AMO and PDO indexes. All data downloaded from WoodForTrees. Linear trend lines added.
The linear trends for all the temperature series for the last 15 years are nearly flat. Some are rising slightly; some are falling slightly. All are, statistically speaking, flat.
Why?
We are at a peak of a 60-year temperature cycle. Many others have described this: here, here, and here, among others. Temperatures are flat because the only way from here is down, up has ended. If you look at history, this is easy to see. Here is the history of AMO and PDO, the two controlling ocean cycles.

Figure 2: The Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation PDO).
If these are combined, Figure 3 results.

Figure 3, AMO and PDO combined. Data from the last 15 years was used in Figure 1.
The thing to remember about the AMO and PDO indexes are that they are de-trended. Any long-term warming or cooling beyond their 60-year cycles are not reflected in these indexes. But we can see in Figure 3 the cooling period around 1910, the rapid warming in the 1920’s and 30’s, the cooling in the 1970’s, and the warming again in 1980’s and 90’s. We can also see that the warming has reached a peak and is set to switch to cooling. If the cycle repeats as it was twice before, the bottom of the next cooling will occur in the 2030’s.
The long term trend is set by the longer solar cycles. Here is the solar activity, calculated from the Beryllium 10 isotope created by cosmic rays at the top of the atmosphere in response to solar magnetic activity. There are 3 different calculations shown, along with the Be10 anomaly on which they are based.

Figure 4 has three plots of TSI and one of the Be10 anomaly on which they are based. The Be10 data has been inverted to match the TSI data. (Less Be10 = higher TSI) Source NOAA here.
The minimums seen in the TSI and Be10 data all correspond to well-known historical warm and cold periods. These are:
– Oort minimum (see Medieval Warm Period) 1040 to 1080
– Medieval Maximum (see Medieval Warm Period) 1100 to 1250
– Wolf Minimum                1280 to 1350
– Spörer Minimum             1450 to 1550
– Maunder Minimum          1645 to 1715
– Dalton Minimum              1790 to 1820
Table 1 is a list of the minimums seen in Figure 4 from left to right. Links are to the Wikipedia articles.

Figure 5 is the Hadley sea surface temperature (SST) dating from 1850.
In Figure 5, we can see the cooling in 1910 and 1950-70, as well as the 20’s and 30’s warming and the 80’s and 90’s warming. The current halt to the warming is also seen.
The TSI data resolution was 6 or 7 years, one data point for each half-solar-cycle. I reduced the SST data to the same resolution by averaging the data for 6 years prior to each data point, and then plotted SST and TSI together. The TSI data based on the Beryllium10 anomaly ends at 1982.
TSI sets the long-term trend for temperature. For temperature, I have used the Hadley HADSST2 data going back to 1850. Here is that chart:

Figure 6 above is TSI and SST plotted to the same resolution.

Figure 7 is a scatter diagram of the Sea Surface Temperature versus TSI plotted in Figure 6.
Notice the long delay on SST cooling in the late 1800’s in Figure 6. The delay seems to be one whole solar cycle of 11 to 12 years. There seems to be little or no delay on warming in the early 1900’s. The TSI data is a bit more than one solar Wolf-Gleißburg cycle in length, the peaks coming in 1865 and 1982. From here, the solar cycle is down. The statistics are clear: The slope in Figure 7 is 0.2875°C per W/m2 of TSI. The R2 value is 0.712, R = 0.844, and the p value is 0.00001. If there were no lag in cooling after a drop in TSI, the R2 value would be even higher. It is clear to me that long term, the sun is driving temperature.
We are now moving into a quiet-sun situation. Projections are for sunspots to completely disappear late in this decade. If TSI drops as low as it did in the Maunder or Spörer Minimums, global temperature will drop by 1 to 1.3°C in 20 to 30 years, into another Little Ice Age that might last for 20 to 40 years. Luckily, the drop should be slow enough that perhaps all the CAGW advocates will be gone or converted in time for us to prepare and adapt.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate science/renewable energy critic Rainer Hoffmann has researched the literature on mean global surface temperature.
Stunningly, he shows that something is not right with the figures coming from the world’s leading climate experts. The figures tell us the mean global surface temperature has dropped 1°C over the last 25 years. At that rate, we’ll be in an ice age by the year 2100!
Page 1 of Hoffmann’s two-page pdf file shows literature that says the mean global temperature in 1990 was 15.5°C. Page 2 shows the literature that says it is now only 14.5°C.
Here’s a chronology of the global mean surface temperature figures from the leading experts over the last 25 years:
1988: 15.4°C
Der Spiegel, based on (untampered) data from NASA (see chart right).
1990: 15.5°C
According to James Hansen and 5 other leading scientists; they too claimed the global mean surface temperature was 15.5°C. Also Prof. Christian Schönwiese claimed the same in his book “Klima im Wandel“, pages 73, 74 and 136. 15.5°C is also the figure given by a 1992 German government report, based on satellite data.
2004: 14.5°C
14 years later, the temperature mysteriously drops to 14.5°C, according to professors Hans Schellnhuber and Stefan Rahmstorf in their book: “Der Klimawandel”, 1st edition, 2006, p 37, based on surface station data from the Hadley Center.
2007: 14.5°C
And also according to the Holy Climate Bible, the IPCC WG1 AR4 (page 6 of bmbf.de/pub/IPCC2007.pdf).
2010: 14.5°C
Reconfirmed by Professors Schellnhuber and Rahmstorf in their book: Der Klimawandel, 7th edition, 2012, page 37, (see chart right) based on surface station data.
2012: 14.5°C
Also given by Prof Mojib Latif, March 20, 2012, 1:55 mark.

I wrote about this issue once before awhile back. But now Hoffmann has summed it nicely in just two pages, see link at the top of the page. The consensus today for mean global surface temperature seems to be 14.5°C, while in 1990 it was a balmy 15.5°C.
Of course we know that the mean global surface temperature has not fallen 1°C since 1990, so it is obvious that the experts are all confused about what the real mean temperature really is.
It is highly disturbing that mean global surface temperature numbers may simply have been plucked out of the blue. At least there’s agreement that the temperature has stagnated over the last 10 years or so…at 14.5°C.
Often we see temperature trends depicted as anomalies. But anomalies from what?
The whole business of transforming society based on a figure that we now see is completely in dispute and in a state of utter confusion needs to be stopped until the issue gets cleared up. If it was 15.5°C in 1990 and today it is indeed only 14.5°C, then shouldn’t we be preparing for something totally different? Which figure is right?
The scientists need to explain this situation. Talking about trends and anomalies when there’s no agreement on the benchmark temperature makes no sense.
Rainer Hoffmann’s dissident website, www.solarkritik.de, was shut down on 30 November, 2012. The message left at the site says Hoffmann left Germany and is now being sought by the authorities.
UPDATE:
Hoffmann writes he fled the country in order to avoid involuntary, forced admission to a psychiatric center, as ordered by a seemingly irate justice system.
The legal issues of Mr. Hoffmann are not the main issue here. The real issue here is that the climate institutes don’t have their numbers straight.

"There is huge potential for using electric vehicles to tackle climate change, give us cleaner air and grow the green economy. The question is, when it will make sense for most of us to ditch diesel and petrol, and go electric? Given the pace of innovation in the sector, it might be sooner than you think. New research from the University of Leeds has investigated innovations in electric mobility that could take the electric car from a niche to the mass market. From new big data applications to smart infrastructure solutions, there are a host of developments that could make 2017 the year of the electric car. It is already much cheaper per mile to drive electric than diesel or petrol – it costs about 12p per mile for liquid fuel versus 2p-4p per mile for electric. Most people will also do the majority of their charging at night, when the price of electricity is much lower than during the day.  As more and more of us get smart electricity meters in our homes, our energy providers will be able to charge us more accurately for when we use electricity as well as how much we use. This means we will be able to access electricity tariffs which offer very low prices during the night. So long as consumers set the car to charge after 9pm, they could hit prices under 2p per mile. Watch out for electricity suppliers offering special deals to electric vehicle customers. Low-price electricity is often the greenest electricity. As we build more wind and solar power into our electricity systems, the cost of electricity on the wholesale market falls. This is because when it’s windy or sunny those technologies have to sell into the market, so the more of them there are having to sell, the more it becomes a buyer’s market.  Some electric cars can already be switched on and off charge remotely  – and there is no reason they cannot be programmed to charge when electricity is cheapest or greenest. Look out for new apps and programs to link car charging with renewable energy by remote scheduling charge cycles. For 97% of the time, we are not behind the wheel of our cars. This has led to a host of non-ownership models where people take short-term rental of cars, buying “mobility as a service”. This research shows that innovative ideas around mobility as a service could be linked with the energy system to offer low-carbon vehicle access to everyone – whether they want to actually own a car or not. Anyone who already uses car clubs, or thinks they might ditch fuel in the near future, might find themselves riding electric sooner than they thought. Until now, having a driveway or garage was the only realistic option for everyday charging. Public charge provision has been patchy – drivers are often forced to use slow chargers in inconvenient locations to top up. This leaves anyone with no off-street parking with no reliable everyday option for charging their vehicles. But throughout 2017, UK cities from Bristol to Nottingham have been investigating new rapid charger provision that can fully charge a normal electric vehicle in the time it takes to drink a coffee and check emails.  These rapid charger points are available in motorway service stations, but they are set to appear in cities, too – so not having a driveway won’t stop you buying an electric vehicle if you live anywhere close to one of these “filling stations of the future”. Look out for them at a forecourt near you. Linking up your brand new electric car with your home sounds great, but in the past would have set you back at least £35,000 for the price of a car, some solar panels and some smart conversion kit. But now as the first generation of electric cars are arriving on the secondhand market, anyone can get a bargain. AutoTrader has led the way by allowing users to search exclusively for fully electric-powered cars.  Anyone who takes a look will see a good quality used example can cost about the same as a conventionally powered car in the same class. Expect to see a growing market for used electric cars and extended warranties on batteries and charging kit. Overall, this research showed us that new partnerships between car makers, energy utilities and cities will offer many more options for us to take our first ride in a purely electric car. We need smart ways of charging so we don’t overload our existing electricity grids – and we might need to get used to seeing a lot more electric vehicle-only parking – but 2017 is looking like a critical year for electric mobility.  It makes a lot of sense to link all these innovations so that new electric cars can get the cheapest, greenest power possible – and we can finally feel less guilty about driving when we could have walked."

"The environment was notably absent from Theresa May’s recent speech laying out her Brexit negotiating priorities. It was also rarely mentioned during the referendum campaign. But worries that the UK could turn itself into a post-Brexit pollution haven have now been thrust front and centre by another often overlooked political actor: the European Parliament. The parliament is often derided as a symbol of the Brussels’ gravy train, or more recently a boxing ring for UKIP’s MEPs. Yet it is an increasingly significant force in EU affairs, and has a long-held reputation for trying to enhance its own powers and for promoting greener policies.  Over the years, the parliament’s environment committee – a cross-party group of 68 MEPs  – has led efforts to tighten car emissions, ban leaded fuel and the use of sealskins and, more recently, to secure strong climate change legislation. It has also provided an entry point to the EU legislative process for less powerful actors like environmental campaigners, who struggle to have their voices heard by national policymakers or the European Commission.  But how and why will this institution make a difference to Brexit? The European Parliament’s consent is needed for any deal negotiated between the UK and the EU. So not only does Theresa May’s government need to secure the support of 27 EU states for its final Article 50 deal, but also a simple majority of the 751 MEPs. The parliament has now decided to flex its legislative muscles by outlining the areas it views as priorities in the upcoming negotiations. Maintaining environmental standards is apparently a red (or green) line for members of the chamber’s influential environment committee. Crucially, air quality has been identified as a central issue for MEPs and is an area that the UK government continues to struggle with. Yet again, this year EU mandated air quality limits have already been breached in London and other urban centres. But why would “Brussels” care what kind of environmental rules the UK chooses to adopt post Brexit? There are two main reasons why UK environmental policy is of interest to its European partners. First, environmental pollution is transboundary: the UK gained its reputation as the dirty man of Europe in the 1970s and 1980s because its emissions from coal fired power stations led to acid rain in Scandinavia. Its unpleasant habit of pumping raw effluent into the North Sea was also unwelcome. It is unlikely that our EU neighbours will want to see the UK return to its old habits of using prevailing winds and currents to dispose of unwanted waste in cost-efficient ways.  Second, environmental rules have major trade implications. EU policy was developed to even out differences across states, to prevent those with weaker environmental policies being able to secure competitive advantages. There are consequently good trade reasons for the EU to ensure that the UK maintains the same environmental standards. No European country wants its farmers or carmakers, bound by restrictions on pesticides or emissions, to have to compete with a UK that relaxes such regulations or scraps them entirely. The European Parliament can play a useful role in reminding EU negotiators of the importance of environmental regulations for the effective functioning of the single European market. The parliament’s intervention adds another important voice to the Article 50 debates that may be useful to the Greener UK campaign that seeks to see UK standards maintained post Brexit."
"Most of the world’s primate species are threatened with extinction, according to a disturbing new study. But the threat is more urgent and critical for some species than others. Of all 504 primate species, the rarest and most vulnerable is found only on one tropical island at the southern tip of China. The majestic and enigmatic Hainan gibbon is confined to a single small patch of forest. Only around 25 remain. Gibbons are small apes found throughout Southeast Asia. They live in forests, and are able to swing from tree to tree at incredible speeds. With all but one of the 19 recognised species officially listed as endangered or critically endangered their future is far from certain. Not only is the Hainan gibbon (or Nomascus hainanus) the world’s rarest ape and rarest primate, it’s one of the rarest mammals of all. The entire species now consists of a single population of around 25 individuals, which separates into smaller social groups. The animals are restricted to just two square kilometres of remnant rainforest in Bawangling National Nature Reserve on Hainan Island in the South China Sea. Sadly, numbers have plummeted over the past 50 years. As with so many other species, this precipitous decline is the result of decades of deforestation and an expanding human population which hunts the gibbons for food or poaches them for traditional medicines and the illegal pet trade.  Southeast Asian animals are particularly vulnerable to these so-called anthropogenic pressures. The deforestation rate is the highest among the world’s tropical regions and alarmingly it is predicted that up to 85% of the biodiversity is likely to disappear by 2100. To protect a very rare species on the brink of extinction, you first have to understand its genetic health. Has the inbreeding that inevitably occurs in a very small population caused any unwanted traits, such as weakness to a disease, to become more common? My former student Jessica Bryant recently led an assessment of the genetic health of the Hainan gibbon. She gathered genetic samples of the current population from faeces and compared them to historical samples found in museums. Her work showed the Hainan gibbon has seen a major drop in genetic health, which can in turn lead to ill-health or fertility problems. The study shows that genetic diversity has declined since the 19th century and even further within the last 30 years, representing declines of around 30% diversity from historical levels.  There is also evidence for a recent population bottleneck and an earlier bottleneck in the late 19th century when numbers were already pretty low. Such bottlenecks can occur when there is a dramatic reduction in the size of a population which leads to a reduction in the variation in the gene pool of that population, which in turn can affect the offspring of that population.  Those 25 gibbons are now closely related. Individuals will find even other social groups are filled with their half or full siblings, and inbreeding is likely to increase in the future – there simply aren’t enough of these gibbons for them to mate with anyone but a close relative. This genetic study and other recent research by an international team from UCL, the Zoological Society of London, Bawangling National Nature Reserve and Kadoorie Conservation China, suggest that the long-term recovery of the Hainan gibbon will require intensive management and new strategies may have to be developed to ensure their survival.  One option is to relocate some individuals to new areas of Hainan Island. But this is risky: without buy-in from local people and the authorities, a new gibbon population would be threatened by hunting or deforestation – the same forces that caused their demise in the first place. These fascinating apes are clearly capable of grabbing the public’s imagination. When an entirely new species, the Skywalker gibbon, was discovered recently, the announcement enjoyed international attention. While the Hainan gibbon’s future may seem bleak, scientists across the world are working together to better understand the needs of extremely rare species. In the case of the Hainan gibbon, we just have to hope that this is enough to save them from being the first ape to go extinct."
"The federal environment department says it is not aware of any countries other than Australia planning to use controversial “carryover credits” to meet international climate commitments. The comment, at a Senate estimates hearing on Monday, comes as the Morrison government rebuffs calls from international leaders, analysts and activists for it to abandon the use the credits to meet its 2030 Paris emissions goal.  The government says it has earned the right to use the credits, which represent the amount of carbon dioxide by which Australia has “beaten” the targets set under the previous international climate agreement, the Kyoto protocol. Critics say the credits do not represent the emissions reductions needed to help meet the Paris goal of limiting global heating to as close to 1.5C as possible. Instead, they say, the credits are a fudge that cuts what Australia needs to do to meet its 2030 emissions target roughly in half and that Australia can claim access to them only because it set itself unchallenging targets under the Kyoto deal. At the hearing, the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young asked if the department knew of any other country planning to use carryover credits to help them meet their Paris climate targets. Kushla Munro, a first assistant secretary with the Department of the Environment and Energy, said: “At this stage, we are not aware of other countries intending to use carryover.” “So just Australia?” Hanson-Young asked. “At this stage, yes,” Munro said. Officials confirmed that to meet its 2030 Paris target, a 26% to 28% cut compared with 2005 levels, Australia would need to cut emissions by 695m tonnes cumulatively across next decade. They said 367m tonnes would come from the credits carried over from the previous Kyoto agreement. Kyoto credits are not included in the Paris deal, but it is possible Australia could claim them unless they were ruled out through a consensus agreement by all countries involved in UN climate negotiations. In its evidence at Senate estimates, the department suggested the government might not need to use the credits to meet its 2030 target if emissions from electricity generation continued to fall. Jo Evans, a department deputy secretary, said there had been improvements in emissions from the electricity sector year-on-year. “There is some probability that the baseline level of projected emissions will be coming down and it’s quite possible that not all – if any – of that carryover will be needed in the end,” Evans said. This assessment is at odds with several analyses, including one from the government, that found Australia is not on track to meet its Paris target. While emissions from electricity have fallen in recent years, total national emissions have been rising since 2015, largely due to increases from natural gas production for export and transport. Australia bettered its first Kyoto target, which allowed an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2010, and is on target to meet its second Kyoto target, a 5% cut below 2000 levels by 2020. Neither target was consistent with what scientists said the country should be doing to play its part in addressing the problem. The government’s Climate Change Authority recommended Australia should also be doing more by 2030 than it has promised, recommending a minimum 45% cut below 2005 levels if it is to play its part in a deal to limit global warming to less than 2C. Department officials confirmed in Senate estimates that 92m tonnes of the emissions reduction needed to meet Australia’s target was projected to come from “technological improvements” not linked to policy changes but expected through unspecified innovations across the economy."
"The story of Liberia’s former research chimpanzees is both well-known and contentious. A non-profit blood bank, the New York Blood Centre (NYBC), set up a virus-testing laboratory in the country in 1974, and wild chimpanzees were trapped from their forests and housed within the “Vilab II” facility. They were subjected to medical experiments and were intentionally infected with hepatitis and other pathogens to help develop a range of vaccines.  By 2005, the director of Vilab II, Alfred M Prince, announced that all research had been terminated and that the NYBC had started to make “lifetime care” arrangements for the chimpanzees through an endowment. Over the next ten years, the chimps were “retired” to a series of small islands in a river estuary, receiving food, water and necessary captive care (at a cost of around US$20,000 a month).  Then, in March 2015, the NYBC withdrew its help and financial support and disowned Prince’s commitments. The move left about 85 chimps to fend for themselves. Escape is impossible, as chimpanzees are incapable of swimming well, and many are suspected to have likely died from a lack of food and water. Although the Liberian government owns the chimps as a legal technicality, the day-to-day management of the chimps and the experiments were carried out by NYBC and it in no way absolves it from ultimate responsibility. But it has used this to distance itself from calls for it to continue funding care. In a statement last year it said it had had “unproductive discussions” with the Liberian government and that it “never had any obligation for care for the chimps, contractual or otherwise”. It has also said that it can “no longer sustain diverting millions of dollars away from our lifesaving mission”.  Understandably, animal rights groups are vocally opposing the blood bank’s actions. This is not a discussion about the ethical nature of animal testing for medical use. Regardless of how they got there, nobody could argue that these sentient apes do not deserve access to food and water. As a primatologist, I am interested in how a group of semi-wild former lab chimps are now cared for, where they harbour both diseases that could pose a threat to other animals and zoonotic diseases, which may be transmitted to humans. After receiving a call from the Humane Society of the United States, animal welfare and great ape specialist Jenny Desmond and her wildlife veterinarian husband Jim moved to Liberia in November 2015 to coordinate the work there. They lead a small but dedicated local team that is now offering these abandoned apes a brighter future. I spoke to the Desmonds recently. Of the chimps currently on the islands, they told me, 11 were born after 2006 due to lack of proper birth control. Jenny estimates that “30 of the adult chimpanzees ‘retired’ in 2005 have died”. Without the contraceptive implants often used in sanctuaries, the population became unmanageable.  Reintroducing these animals to the wild is not a possibility. Release programmes are controversial and these chimps could infect wild chimpanzees with the diseases they were once inoculated with. “We don’t even know exactly which chimps were inoculated with what diseases,” Jenny said. With a life expectancy of 60 years or so, it is now vitally important to provide the best care to these animals. There are currently 63 chimpanzees spread across six islands in groups of between nine and 13. Fortunately, when the Desmonds arrived, they found a dedicated and well-trained staff already close at hand, as many of the former local NYBC employees who had worked with the chimpanzees for decades are still in the area. Yet a lack of infrastructure on the islands and mainland has made targeted monitoring and treatment almost impossible. The chimpanzees range freely on the islands and there are no holding facilities, meaning individuals cannot be separated and health checks routinely be given.  But despite a string of complications and hurdles, Jim Desmond is optimistic about the progress made so far:  Our two primary goals when we arrived were to improve the diet of the chimpanzees and implement a birth control programme. We revised their existing diet, adding variety and flexibility, making it more nutritious and allowing for more effective food procurement. We also switched from NYBC’s former every-other-day feeding schedule to daily feedings and hope to eventually move to a twice-a-day system. The chimps’ overall health has already improved dramatically and the birth rate is now coming under control, thanks to daily progesterone pills. Their future is by no means secured, however. Crowd-funding is being used to help with the high monthly care costs and long-term funding is not assured. The NYBC chimpanzees of Liberia were used for decades in order to develop treatments intended to save many human lives. However, after the research finished and a decision was made (rightly or wrongly) to keep the chimpanzees alive, those animals were then at the mercy of others, and this should rightly be the medical research community.  Ethologist and renowned chimpanzee conservationist Jane Goodall believes that the NYBC is responsible for the well-being of the chimpanzees for the rest of their lives. “They knew full well that chimpanzees are long-lived,” she told me in a recent interview. “Whether or not the chimpanzee experiments were actually useful to science is irrelevant in this instance. The callous abandonment to their fate is unforgivable. We of course recognise the important role of blood banking organisations, but the NYBC has seriously fallen down here and must make it right.”  NYBC was unavailable for comment. However, this situation is an important case when it comes to the treatment of former laboratory animals, from both a moral and scientific perspective. Captive management of any sentient species is often complex. But when the animals were used for experiments, there is surely an implicit obligation for the research community to care for them when they are no longer of any scientific value."
"Around 600 pilot whales recently became stranded on a New Zealand beach, around 400 of which died before volunteers could refloat them back into the sea. Sadly, this kind of mass whale stranding has occurred since human records began, and happens somewhere in the world on a regular basis.  At the end of 2015, 337 sei whales died in a fjord in Chile after the largest ever beaching of whales of this species. Mass strandings can also occur in northern Europe. In February 2016, 29 sperm whales were found stranded on the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands, eastern England, and northern France, a record for this species in the North Sea. Why do these creatures, which are masters of living in a totally aquatic environment, enter an inhospitable land environment where inevitably some, if not all, will die? Mass strandings almost invariably involve oceanic species of whales. Long-finned and short-finned pilot whales tend to be the most frequent casualties. Other species typically are false killer whales, melon-headed whales, Cuvier’s beaked whales and sperm whales. All of these normally live in waters over 1,000 metres deep and are very social, forming cohesive groups that in some cases may number hundreds of animals.  Although it’s tempting to automatically blame whale strandings on human activity, the fact that deep-dwelling species of whales most often get stranded, and in the same locations, indicates that in many cases natural causes are more likely to be to blame. Mass strandings of these oceanic species tend to be in very shallow areas with gently sloping, often sandy, seabeds. In those situations, it is no surprise that these animals, which are used to swimming in deep waters, can get into difficulties and even if re-floated will often re-strand. The echolocation they use to aid navigation also does not work well in such environments. So it is quite possible that the majority of such strandings are simply due to navigational error, for example when whales have followed a valuable prey resource into unfamiliar and dangerous territory. This may have been the cause of the mass stranding of sperm whales in the North Sea, some of which had recently digested oceanic squid in their stomachs. The ratio of strandings to sightings for sperm whales in the North Sea is significantly higher south of the Dogger Bank where shallow, often sandy, environments prevail. And the same goes for Farewell Spit, Golden Bay in the South Island of New Zealand, where the recent pilot whale stranding took place and where similar incidents have occurred several times in the last few years.  Both areas have seen a number of mass strandings of those particular species in the past. In the southern North Sea, there are records of mass strandings of sperm whales dating back at least to 1577. However, mass strandings aren’t only caused by whales getting lost or misjudging the depth of the water. One or more individuals may be diseased and, as they become weaker, they seek shallower waters so they can more easily come to the surface to breathe. Once their bodies come to rest on a hard surface for any extended period, there is a greatly increased chance that their chest walls will be compressed and their internal organs damaged. Occasionally, live strandings may derive from human activities, particularly military activity that involves the use of sonar. This connection was first suggested in 1996 after a NATO military exercise off the coast of Greece coincided with the stranding of 12 Cuvier’s beaked whales. Unfortunately, there was no opportunity for veterinary examination.  But in May 2000, another beaked whale mass stranding took place in the Bahamas alongside naval activity using similar loud mid-frequency sonar. A number of the whales were examined, and haemorrhaging, particularly around the inner ear, was discovered, indicating acoustic trauma. After a similar incident in the Canary Islands in September 2002, veterinary pathologists analysing the whales also identified symptoms of decompression sickness. This suggests that the animals do not always die from stranding but may be injured or die at sea first. Many researchers now believe that naval sonar might produce behaviour in whales that interferes with their ability to manage the gases inside their bodies, affecting their ability to dive and rise to the surface safely. Loud noise in the ocean has become a major conservation concern as humans introduce sounds of varying intensities and frequencies into the marine environment from different technologies and even explosions. Seaquakes are another source of intense underwater sound and those might also lead to physical damage or behaviour resulting in strandings, although no one has yet produced a statistical link between the two.  The kind of strandings seen in New Zealand, where very large numbers of whales become beached but a significant proportion can be rescued, also raises the question of whether some healthy animals simply follow others into dangerously shallow waters. Many years ago, I went to the aid of two short-beaked common dolphins that  stranded alive in the Teifi Estuary, west Wales. One of the individuals died quite quickly and a subsequent post-mortem revealed it had a heavy lung parasite infection, which was thought to have affected breathing. The other individual remained close to its dying companion and appeared to be in great distress, whistling frequently. We managed to successfully refloat this other dolphin in the end and it swam away, but the incident highlighted to me the strong social bonds that can exist between individuals. When we see large numbers of whales or dolphins undertaking what appears to be mass suicide, the chances are that they are vocally responding to one another, reflecting their strong sociality. Recent research suggests that whales in mass strandings aren’t necessarily even related to one another. So perhaps mass strandings are a reflection of just how strong the social bonds between whales really are."
"In 2011, a marine heatwave hit the west coast of Australia leading to ten days of above average sea temperatures. The area was already known as an ocean warming “hotspot”, but this particular period was a tipping point, causing dramatic changes to the marine ecosystem. Underwater kelp forests along the coast reduced in density by 43%, with some disappearing entirely.  The loss of kelp resulted in an ecological shift, which led to the growth of different kinds of algae as temperate water species were replaced by subtropical and tropical species. Five years later, kelp forest recovery has still not been observed. A few days of extreme heat resulted in apparently irreversible change. The frequency and intensity of extreme events, like marine heatwaves, are only expected to increase, and their consequences are hard to predict. But while some of these extreme events could be devastating, it isn’t all doom and gloom. Even though human-induced climate change is happening, local steps can be taken to help alleviate the impacts on our marine environments. And by focusing on a localised approach, we could make a positive difference on a global scale. For example, in Australia, the government of Queensland spent AUS$7m on a 560 square kilometre cattle station in a bid to protect the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Site. This cattle station had been producing as much as 40% of the sediment running into the Normanby River system and ultimately the Great Barrier Reef.  The very existence of the Great Barrier Reef and its extraordinary biodiversity ultimately depends on the health of the corals. When they are covered by sediment, their ability to photosynthesise is dramatically reduced, resulting in less healthy coral. Unhealthy reefs are less able to deal with predators and other damaging events. In buying the cattle station the government is able to stem the sediment runoff away from the Great Barrier Reef and provide a healthier environment in which the coral can thrive. This is just one example of scientists using local knowledge successfully to inform ministers to make decisions on the local scale that alleviate the problems faced by marine ecosystems of climate change, over fishing and pollution. To apply such processes in more places in the world, organising climate information and action must move from a global to a regional scale. Overfishing and pollution can be much more effectively dealt with by focusing on local responses.  The Pacific Islands for example, rely heavily on the tuna fish industry. But they have faced major problems of over fishing and reducing stocks – from both small vessels and industrialised ships from other countries. Only a united front would enable control over stocks and a future for the industry.  So in 1982, a collective of islands focused on the conservation and management of tuna in the pacific set up the Naura agreement. Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Naura, the federated states of Micronesia and Palau, and more recently Tokelau, all signed up to the Vessel Day Scheme for Pacific tuna, which limits the amount of days available for fishing to maintain tuna populations. In the last five years the collective has received global recognition for its sustainable management methods – and an increase in revenue from US$60m to US$360m. Over in the Caribbean, meanwhile, Antigua has some of the most degraded coral reefs in the region. Overfishing is thought to be a main reason for this as it has reduced the amount of herbivorous fish, resulting in the proliferation of seaweed – a main competitor of the corals.  To improve the health of the reef, marine protected areas – and specifically a “no take zone” – were created in 2014 in conjunction with the local fishermen. Within a year, this change in local management led to significant increases in the biomass of target fish species. This allowed herbivore fishes to actively graze on the seaweed biomass, enabling respite and providing recovery time for the corals.   In Fiji, mangrove trees are being planted to combat coastal erosion caused by rising sea levels and increasing storm surges. While a direct benefit to Fiji’s inhabitants against potential harm from the ocean, this action also creates a habitat and a site of refuge for many juvenile marine species that will also be affected by future climate change. Lessons can be learned from all of these local strategies which could be replicated in similar environments facing similar problems. But developing these initiatives will depend on our understanding of key organisms and their interactions with each other. These are some of the areas suggested by professors Daniela Schmidt and Philip Boyd, in a commentary on what ocean scientists should consider when informing policymakers.  Small island nations will feel the impact of global changes on the ocean first, so they are leading the way in adaption and mitigation techniques in retaliation to changing climates. With the additional threat of America no longer being a part of the international agreements on global warming, tackling climate change on a local and regional scale may be our only hope."
"The UK government’s European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill is short, extremely short, at just 137 words, but will nevertheless have huge ramifications. Tucked away in the “Commentary on provisions of Bill” is the long-awaited clarification that Brexit will also mean Brexatom, with the UK leaving the Euratom Treaty. The existence of such a treaty may come as surprise to many people. Euratom was in fact one of the three founding treaties of what is now the European Union, and in 1957 established the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) to support the development of nuclear energy. Since then it has remained largely unreformed, and exists as a legal entity separate from the EU. There was therefore some legal ambiguity as to whether the UK could remain with the Euratom after it left the European Union. This has now been clarified: the UK is leaving anyway. The Euratom Treaty covers nuclear non-proliferation as well as safety standards for workers, the public and the environment. The Euratom executive has its own research and development programme and is a global leader in nuclear fusion. It also set up a nuclear-specific loan facility and created a supply agency to ensure adequate access to nuclear materials (such as uraniam fuels).  The UK government must now start to unpick these institutional relationships and start building up its domestic capabilities in nuclear safety, research and so on. By choosing to exit Euratom, it has also left European institutions and the remaining member states with some problems.  In the short term, the most direct additional government expense will be in research and development. It might still be possible to remain in the EU’s research programme, as demonstrated by Switzerland, which makes a financial contribution to take part. The Euratom research budget is €1.6 billion over five years. The UK currently pays around 12% of the whole EU budget which means that its contribution to Euratom’s research budget is about £32m a year. This in turn results in, at least, a similar level of investment in UK-based projects. While it is less than the government’s domestic nuclear research budget of £66m, it would be a considerable additional amount to fund.  The largest share of Euratom research budget goes towards nuclear fusion. Fusion is the politically controversial process of combining atoms, rather than splitting them (nuclear fission). To some, it offers the opportunity for clean and limitless energy, while others see it as a technology that is always 40 years from commercialisation.  In France, Euratom is building the International Thermonuclear Experiment Reactor (ITER) which, when complete, will be the world’s largest fusion experiment.  Euratom already funds the Joint European Torus (JET), a precursor to the ITER based in Oxfordshire. Brexit will be particularly problematic for the £2.5 billion JET facility as its current funding expires in 2018. The EU provides €60m a year for its operation so the UK will need to provide significant post-Brexit finance if it is to keep operating. However, the nuclear industry is also concerned that Brexit will impact upon its costs. For the reactor builders, being outside the nuclear common market (another key chapter of the Euratom Treaty) as well as the single market and having no freedom of movement may lead to higher prices if tariffs and customs checks are introduced or if restrictions are imposed on foreign nuclear scientists and engineers. There will also be technical and institutional challenges to replace the functions carried out by Euratom safeguards inspectors. Chapter VII of the Euratom Treaty establishes a nuclear material control system, giving the European Commission responsibility for “satisfying itself” through physical inspections at nuclear facilities that material is not being diverted for military purposes.  In 1976 a trilateral agreement was signed between Euratom, the International Atomic Agency (IAEA) – the international nuclear watchdog – and the UK, sharing responsibility on the non-proliferation of nuclear material. Since 2010 the IAEA has reduced its presence during regular inspections in Europe as it relies more on the “complementary results” of Euratom inspections. A quarter of all time spent on nuclear inspections throughout the EU is carried out in Britain, due to the scale of nuclear fuel fabrication and waste management facilities, such as Sellafield. Without Euratom involvement, the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulations will need to undertake many more inspections to meet IAEA requirements. The government should be able to find the extra cash, but it will be difficult to quickly hire and train the necessary new staff to implement rigorous safeguards. Leaving the Euratom Treaty will also have political implications for the UK and the EU. Outside the EU, the UK is going to have to develop new or adjust existing bilateral nuclear trade agreements so it can still import uranium or crucial reactor parts. While some argue that outside the EU the UK will be free from the political shackles of the Brussels bureaucracy and “anti-nuclear” member states like Austria, the UK diplomatic service will have to work hard to replace the conferred influence of being part of the EU. The political impact in the EU remains equally unclear. Britain has been one of Europe’s most active supporters of nuclear power, and the industry’s trade association worries that Brexit could tip the balance of member states towards an anti-nuclear majority. The complications around Brexatom also puts a spotlight onto the Euratom Treaty itself, whose legal status and many of its functions are out of step with the modern EU and may once again lead to calls for it to be abolished."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe U of A Science News website has an interesting report on precipitation reconstructions using tree rings. The reconstruction goes back some 470 years in the Southwest, covering most of Arizona, western New Mexico and parts of northern Mexico.

Today when drought strikes, we are told by the media and catastrophe-obsessed scientists that it’s unusual and so it gets blamed on man-made climate change.
Lead author and doctoral candidate in the U of A School of Geography and Development Daniel Griffin says, “This is the first time researchers have used tree rings to take a closer look at the monsoon in a large and important area of the American Southwest.”
Moreover, he adds (my emphasis):
Monsoon droughts of the past were more severe and persistent than any of the last 100 years.“
Other excerpts:
“…the late-16th-century megadrought caused landscape-scale vegetation changes, a 17th-century drought has been implicated in the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 and the 1882-1905 drought killed more than 50 percent of Arizona’s cattle.”

Well imagine that! All this when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were at the “desirable 280 ppm” and climate and weather back then were more or less stable.
Griffin did not cherry-pick tree-rings to get politically correct results, it seems. No bum steer here. The U of A News writes that “the researchers used samples from 50 to 100 trees at each of 53 different sites throughout southwestern North America […] which covers most of Arizona, western New Mexico and northern parts of the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua.”
“It was a massive undertaking…to measure almost 1 million tree rings.”
So you see, the U of A can produce quality tree-ring results after all, so long Michael Mann doesn’t get his littler fingers into them. Thanks to Daniel Griffin and his team for this effort and these very interesting findings. I’d like to see how the precipitation patterns match up with solar activity.

"Although the results of climate research have been consistent for decades, climate scientists have struggled to convey the gravity of the situation to laypeople outside their field. If anything, the wider public only recently seems to have awakened to the threat of the climate crisis. Why? In our new book, Discerning Experts: The Practices of Scientific Assessment for Environmental Policy, we attempted to illuminate how scientists make the judgments they do. In particular, we wanted to know how scientists respond to the pressures, sometimes subtle, sometimes overt, that arise when they know that their conclusions will be disseminated beyond the research community – in short, how scientists are affected when they know the world is watching.  We explored these questions with respect to assessments of acid rain, ozone depletion and sea level rise predictions from the west Antarctic ice sheet. While climate skeptics and deniers often accuse scientists of exaggerating the threats associated with the climate crisis, the available evidence suggests the opposite. By and large, scientists have either been right in their assessments, or have been unduly conservative. We noticed a clear pattern of underestimation of certain key climate indicators, and therefore underestimation of the threat of climate disruption. When new observations of the climate system have provided more or better data, or permitted us to re-evaluate earlier conclusions, the findings for ice extent, sea level rise and ocean temperature have generally been worse than previously thought. One of the factors that appears to contribute to this trend of underestimation is the perceived need for consensus, or what we call “univocality”: the felt need to speak in a single voice. Many scientists worry that if they publicly air their disagreement, government officials will conflate their differences of opinion with ignorance and use this as justification for inaction. Others worry that even if policy-makers want to act, they will find it difficult to do so if scientists fail to send an unambiguous message. Therefore, scientists actively seek to find their common ground, and to focus on those areas of agreement. In some cases, where there are irreconciliable differences of opinion, scientists may say nothing, giving the erroneous impression that nothing is known. How does the pressure for univocality lead to underestimation? Consider a case in which most scientists think that the correct answer to a question is in the range one to 10, but some believe that it could be as high as 100. In this case, everyone will agree that it is at least one to 10, but not everyone will agree that it could be as high as 100. Therefore, the area of agreement is one to 10, and this will be reported as the consensus view. Wherever there is a range of possible outcomes that includes a long, high-end tail of probability, the area of overlap will lie at or near the low end. We are not suggesting that every example of under-estimation is caused by the factors we observed in our work, nor that the demand for consensus always leads to underestimation. But we found that this pattern occurred in all of the cases that we studied. We also found that the institutional aspects of assessment, including who the authors are and how they are chosen, how the substance is divided into chapters, and guidance emphasizing consensus, also generally tilt in favor of scientific conservatism. Knowing this, what do we do? To scientists, we suggest that you should not view consensus as a goal. Consensus is an emergent property, something that may come forth as the result of scientific work, discussion and debate. When that occurs, it is important to articulate the consensus as clearly and specifically as possible. But where there are substantive differences of opinion, they should be acknowledged and the reasons for them explained. Scientific communities should also be open to experimenting with alternative models for making and expressing group judgments, and to learning more about how policy makers actually interpret the findings that result. Such approaches may contribute to assessments being more useful tools as we face the reality of adapting to the climate crisis and the disruptions that will occur. For political leaders and business people, we think it is important for you to know that it is extremely unlikely that scientists are exaggerating the threat of the climate crisis. It is far more likely that things are worse than scientists have said. We have already seen that the impacts of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are unfolding more rapidly than scientists predicted. There is a high likelihood that they will continue to do so, and that the IPCC estimates – that emissions must be rapidly reduced, if not entirely eliminated, by 2050 – may well be optimistic. The fact that this conclusion is hard to swallow does not make it untrue. And for ordinary citizens, it is important to recognize that scientists have done their job. It is now up to us to force our leaders to act upon what we know, before it is too late. Dale Jamieson, Michael Oppenheimer and Naomi Oreskes are authors of Discerning Experts: The Practices of Scientific Assessment for Environmental Policy. This piece is largely excerpted from that book"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few years ago, scientists were claiming that the Arctic would warm quickly in response to global warming. But then temperatures in the northern hemisphere began to drop.
And before you knew it, scientists were claiming that cold temperatures actually proved global warming.

No warming in sight for Alaska. Temperature anomaly forecast for May 15 – 22. Source: wxmaps.org.
If we look at Alaska over the last few days, then global warming must be galloping out of control. Before you know it, the globe will be covered in ice as it overheats. Hey, that’s global warming science…and there are plenty of dupes and chumps out there to lap it all up.

The online News Miner of Alaska reports on a number of records being set. What follow are some new May 14 records, with the old ones in parentheses:
– Eielson Air Force Base: 22°F (26°F in 1954).
– College Observatory, University of Alaska Fairbanks: 21°F (24°F in 1964).
– Bettles: 11°F (22°F in 1986).
– Galena: 13°F (16°F in 1965).
The News Miner also reports that record low daytime highs were recorded:
Fairbanks also set a new record for the coldest high temperature at the airport Monday with a high temperature of 37 degrees. That broke the record of 40 set in 1937.
Other record low maximum temperature records were reported at Galena (31), Tanana (34) and Eielson Air Force Base (38).
Fairbanks avoided another record cold high temperature Tuesday when the high temperature at the airport hit 40 degrees, surpassing the record of 39 degrees in 1937″
That means sea ice melt will be delayed, thus the sunlight will get reflected back out, and then the albedo catastrophe that the warmists keep bringing up when ice melts will occur in reverse. Oh, I forgot. In climate science these processes are only true in one direction, i.e. warming.
Meanwhile the online UK Daily Mail reports of snow in Britain: http://www.dailymail.mailonline.

"The London plane tree, a divisive staple of many Australian city streetscapes, will be gradually removed from Melbourne’s central business district and replaced with species resistant to climate change such as Moreton Bay figs, jacarandas and sweet gums. London plane trees make up 70% of the tree population in Melbourne’s inner city. While admired by some for their hardiness and environmental benefits such as providing extensive cooling and shade, the trees are also unpopular for shedding leaf and shoot hairs, known as trichomes, during the same period that grass pollen levels are at their highest.  It means the trees are also blamed for causing hay fever and allergic reactions, even though the most common cause of hay fever is grass pollen and there is limited evidence that plane trees cause allergies. However, the fine hairs are renowned for making people cough and for irritating skin. A University of Melbourne botanist, Ed Newbigin, who heads the Melbourne pollen count, said “lots of people hate plane trees”. “They certainly do. But they’re not going to cause anaphylaxis,” he said. “You’d have to bury yourself in them for that. They’re more of an irritation to the eyes and skin, and they’re also a bit messy. You’ll be sitting outside of a cafe on a sidewalk and suddenly you’ll have bits of plane tree blow into your coffee.” To Newbigin, however, “they’re a beautiful tree”. “They have an open canopy, they take surgery well so you can get them to grow around power lines, so they do a lot of things that are good for cities and they do make cities cooler on a hot day.” The acting lord mayor, Arron Wood, said the main reason the trees were being replaced was that many were planted in the 1980s and 1990s when they replaced poorly performing ash trees and some elms and paperbarks. But the trees were now in poor health and needed to be removed, he said. “The plane trees in Swanston Street form a consistent and relatively healthy avenue, but where plane trees in other parts of the city need to be removed we are taking opportunities to replace them with different tree species,” he said. Along the Russell Street median strip the trees are being replaced with spotted gums, while along Exhibition Street they have been replaced with camphor laurels. Port Jackson figs have replaced them along Lonsdale Street, while liquidamber, lemon-scented gums and red ironbarks are being planted along Southbank Boulevard. This was also being done to increase tree diversity, the council said in a statement. The director of respiratory medicine, allergy and clinical immunology research at Monash University, Prof Robyn O’Hehir, said the fine particles from plane trees could cause throat irritation and laryngospasm – a spasm of the vocal cords – even in people who are not prone to allergies. “I warn patients to wear wraparound sunglasses and avoid prominent plane tree areas such as street cafes in Carlton in August and September when they are most problematic,” she said. “People often need water or a mouthful of bread to clear the fine particles from their throats.”"

The UN has asked people around the world for their top priorities. With 625,000 votes, climate is at the very bottom.
Not surprisingly, education, health care and corruption-free governments rank at the top, along with jobs, water and food. (People who would focus on food and water first are probably not on-line.)
Immediate environmental concerns for rivers and forests rank in the middle, whereas climate comes in at the last position.
This seems not only to follow quite closely the rankings in the Copenhagen Consensus, but also to make simple sense. If your kids are dying from easily curable diseases, have no food, or no jobs, your main concern is not a 2.6℃ temperature rise by the end of the century. If you have enough resources to worry about the environment at all, you worry about immediate concerns like air and water pollution.
It is only in rich countries (with high HDI) where climate comes in much higher, and yet still only at number 8 of 16.
I’m right now in Sweden, where my demographic group have put climate at the very top as #1. That only makes sense, when you have ample food and health care, a well-functioning government and a clean environment.
Go ahead and tell the UN which priorities *you* think the world should focus on:

"Towns and villages along the east coast of England were put on red alert on Friday 13 January. A combination of strong winds and high tides led to fears a “storm surge” would wash over flood defences, and residents of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk and Jaywick, in Essex, were among those ordered to evacuate.  In the end, the worst was avoided. The winds, tides and waves didn’t quite combine to cause serious flooding, and people have returned home. But this was not the first time the region had been threatened with inundation, and the flood defences that held firm in 2017 were largely built in response to a previous, more deadly, storm surge. The worst natural disaster in modern British history occurred on the night of January 31, 1953. A tidal surge caused the North Sea to rise up to five metres above its average level, which led to widespread flooding along the east coast of Britain, particularly south of Yorkshire. Some 30,000 people were evacuated, 1,000 square kilometres of land was inundated, and 307 people in England and 19 people in Scotland died. The death toll was particularly bad on Canvey Island in the Thames Estuary.  In the low-lying Netherlands the consequences were much greater – more than 1,800 deaths. Soon after, the Dutch began to construct their huge and very costly system of flood defences. The response in Britain was less decisive. Former chancellor and home secretary Viscount Waverley oversaw an inquiry, publishing a very effective report later that year. Waverley sought expert opinion on how best to renew flood defences and his recommendations included the creation of a new early warning system, quickly established, and the construction of a retractable barrier to protect London. The long political machinations that eventually led to the passage of the 1972 Thames Barrier Act are fascinating in themselves, but what is more immediately arresting is the explanation Waverley offered for the tidal surge itself. For the first time, Waverley’s report made climate change a concern of government. Waverley explained that the flooding was caused by a combination of factors. Strong northerly winds coming in off the Atlantic coincided with a relatively high tide, thereby forcing an unusually large quantity of water down the narrowing north-south axis of the North Sea to the bottleneck at the Straits of Dover. The rotation of the earth ensured that the water was deflected to the west of the tidal currents, thereby hitting the east coast of Britain. A significant quantity of excess water was forced up the Thames Estuary, threatening to spill over London’s flood defences.  Waverley was at pains to point out that the high tide and the surge were distinct phenomena. Had the surge occurred at low tide, its effect would have been little noticed. Also, inland rainfall had been below average. Had east coast rivers been at their strongest, the destruction caused by the tidal surge would have been much greater, causing significant loss of life and damage to the capital’s infrastructure. Indeed, the risk to the London Underground conditioned much of the debate that followed. The data presented to Waverley suggested that floods like January 1953 were becoming more frequent and that the combination of factors that produced them were likely to happen more often. There were three reasons for this. First, water levels were rising. By the 1950s scientists had known for a generation or so that the climate had been warming for a century, and that this was causing glaciers to melt. Second, the phenomenon of tilt: the north-west and north of England was gradually rising and the south-east was gradually sinking – or downwarping – a notion that had some popular traction, especially in East Anglia. Downwarping compounded the effect of higher water levels and was also caused by climate change. At the end of the last ice age, glaciation had reached as far south as the line from the Bristol Channel to the Wash. With the weight of ice no longer acting on northern Britain, a gradual correction was taking place – and continues to.  Third, was the idea that changing weather patterns made tidal surges more likely. Sou’westerlies dominated the weather patterns of the region, but strong northerlies were becoming more prevalent, possibly as part of a 200-year cycle. For all these reasons the east coast, and London particularly, faced an increasing threat from the North Sea. Thanks to Waverley, this thinking held sway in Whitehall in the decades that followed, shaping the tortuous process that led to the construction of the Thames Barrier. But if climate change was understood to be a factor in the growing threat to the east coast, there was little suggestion that any of it was caused by human activities. Instead, scientists pointed to the shift in and out of ice ages that occurs naturally over many thousands of years. Climate change, considered a force of nature, had yet to be politicised, even as it became a factor in policy making. The threat climate change poses a given population depends as much on the capacity of the state to build adequate defences as it does on geographical good fortune. The debate of the 1950s and 60s also throws into sharp relief how politically significant anthropogenic notions of climate change have become.  Then, it was a question of defending vulnerable people and infrastructure against apparently natural phenomena, now the question of causation has hugely complicated and politicised possible government responses. This raises profound questions about environmental justice at both a national and global level. As the terrible flood of 1953 and recent events throughout the world have shown, it is poor, marginal people who drown in floods, whether in Britain or elsewhere."
"If we didn’t realise that 2016 was the year of upheaval before November 8, we certainly do now. Brexit, which seemed hard enough to digest, was merely the amuse bouche prior to the red meat of Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election.  Dessert came on December 4, with the constitutional referendum in Italy, which saw off the country’s moderate prime minister, Matteo Renzi. Expect 2017 to bring strong electoral rewards for Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Marine Le Pen in France and the AfD in Germany. There seems to be a global trend – but of what? Wherever we look, the sans-culottes are storming the trendy neighbourhoods of the biens-pensants, but is there a wider pattern?  Broadly speaking, there are two separate attacks on an apparently settled order – one from within, one from without. Neither has a clear agenda, and each is more oppositional than constructive. It is therefore all the more important to understand what they oppose. They are both reactions against a liberal ideal that has been in the ascendant, enabled by technology, which champions society characterised by high connectivity. It’s a vision of a society in which everyone has lots of weak – usually transactional – ties with lots of people across different networks that are easy to pick up and put down. This liberal order rests on a global view that freedom – social and economic –  generates prosperity and tolerance. Who could oppose that? Well, it turns out that plenty of people can. One is a broadly radical group which buys into the liberal vision while resisting details of its implementation. Many of its affiliates in the UK have lined up behind Jeremy Corbyn, who increased his mandate as leader of the Labour Party in 2016. They may also be associated with the Green Party, or the Occupy movement, or Podemos or Syriza, or Bernie Sanders in the US. Their understanding of politics diverges from the 20th-century notion of political action framed by relatively firm ideology and specific institutions (such as political parties and trade unions) working within a well-understood parliamentary or representative framework. Enamoured with neither the framework nor their representatives within it, the radicals see politics as a type of self-expression, while social media orients them towards other individuals and away from institutions. The internet is a key tool: it renders them visible to each other and makes political action at scale simpler to undertake. These are people who tend towards internationalism and want to expel corruption from the liberal order, not to overturn the liberal order itself. Some are driven by the failure to deliver prosperity following the financial crash, some by a perception that certain groups are disadvantaged within liberalism – women, for example – which makes identity politics seem attractive. Others are driven by environmental concerns, or by a deep hatred of capitalism. The politics of this group is not particularly stable – and has been characterised by Helen Margetts and colleagues as “chaotic pluralism”. The second “movement” is very different: neither technologically enabled nor self-consciously organised – and rooted in a feeling of being invisible to urban sophisticates and opinion-formers. These are the Brexit voters, people willing to have a punt on Trump, Le Pen, AfD or UKIP. They feel vulnerable in open economies – and polling shows their opposition to globalisation, free markets, big business, inequality, technology and the internet, immigration, multiculturalism, social liberalism, welfare, political correctness, greenery and feminism. This group is united by a rejection of the connected liberal ideal, preferring a more traditional arrangement of people with fewer, stronger ties to a smaller number of others – ties that are not necessarily chosen and which are not necessarily easily removable. It is a local view,. It is focused less on prosperity than on identity, belonging and making the world familiar, navigable and comprehensible for citizens. They reject the liberal consensus, the networked individual, the gig economy and the constant need to reinvent oneself in a dynamic global market. Despite some shared goals, these two groups will find it hard to work together. One set of borderline racists, variously known as the alt-right or Génération Identitaire, attempts to straddle this divide. They align themselves with outsider populists, such as Trump and Le Pen, while borrowing the methods and technologies of the radicals.  But despite their supposed love of homeland and racial purity, they still look more like a load of internationalist millennials talking among themselves. They attempt to defend the basis of the liberal ideal against a supposed threat from other cultures (they are united by Islamophobia, for example). At the same time, they indulge in the joys of that quintessentially 21st-century techno-pastime: “trolling”. They are part of the chaotic pluralism – and surely cannot speak for redundant steelmen in Pittsburgh or rural Catholics in Poland. So the liberal order is under threat from two directions. Failure to adapt will be catastrophic, as nobody has much of an idea what to replace it with – if Donald Trump governs like the populist he seems, we can expect him to eschew tough decisions while presiding over a ballooning government deficit. Accommodation with one group will exacerbate conflict with the other – if you accommodate UKIP, you alienate the Hampstead liberals, and vice versa. The defence of the liberal order has for many years relied on the assertion that there is no alternative. True or not, this is not enough to sustain it – Project Fear, which painted scary pictures of the world under Brexit, Trump, et al, was a flop. A stronger defence is needed with cultural traction, not based merely on the prospect of buying off the discontented or scaring them back into the fold.  Turning inward is no easy option, as evidenced by Theresa May’s car-crash visit to India in November, where the business-friendly Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi – no mean player of the race card himself – turned out to be far less interested in trade than, guess what, the free movement of people. The best had better stop lacking all conviction – as Yeats might have put it. They need to drum up some of that passionate intensity if mere anarchy is not to be loosed upon the world in 2017."
"Audience members at the Royal Court theatre will be banned from taking in single-use plastic bottles as part of a mission to become a net-zero carbon arts venue in 2020. The London theatre announced it was scrapping its plan to have a month of performance on the climate emergency. Instead, it said, it would spend the time taking stock to find ways to make the organisation net zero by the end of next year.  That will include examining all aspects of its operations, from lighting and set design to its bar and restaurant and whether someone can take in a single-use plastic bottle of drink. “It would be banned and I think it’s really important that it is banned,” said the theatre’s artistic director, Vicky Featherstone. “We are not nannying people: when they leave our building they can behave how they want but, actually, I think it is really important that people have to think about how they come in to the space and what it means. “My feeling about it is we are all in such a dystopian, existential crisis about this real thing that is in front of us, that to be able to go somewhere and to be told … about how to model your behaviours within that building will be a really calming thing for people.” The theatre announced this year that it would give March 2020 over to work on the climate emergency. But things have changed quickly and the issue is already embedded in the work and thoughts of Royal Court writers, Featherstone said. “It felt a bit simplistic to be saying we were going to be programming work specifically just for a month around the climate emergency when all the writers are writing about it all the time. “Instead of filling March with possibly very brilliant monologues about the climate emergency, we are going to stop and take stock and learn how we can, from March onwards, commit to the building becoming net-zero.” The plan is to make changes in its rehearsal and experimental performance space, Site, which will then be applied to the main building as it transitions to a net-zero arts venue. A lot of work has been done by arts organisations around the UK to reduce, offset and neutralise climate impact. The Royal Court initiative arguably takes this to the next level and its executive producer, Lucy Davies, said the theatre would share all of its experiences, “including all the experiments that fail”. Featherstone said anyone entering the building from March would be contributing to the commitment. “The Royal Court has always been radical and must always be radical and fearless in its approach to the way that the work is made, who makes it and who it is for,” she said. “It feels like we don’t have a decision here; we just have to do it. It has to be now.” The theatre said more information about public events during Open Court: Climate Emergency (2-20 March) would follow in early 2020."
"The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is on a collision course with the government over proposals to water down his green plan for the capital, which involves stopping the expansion of Heathrow and protecting the green belt. Planning inspectors want Khan to withdraw his objections to Heathrow’s expansion, permit fracking in London, and loosen his commitment to the green belt by allowing building in “very special circumstances”.  Khan is expected to write formally to the secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, Robert Jenrick, to reject these proposed changes to the “London Plan” policy. Ministers will then have six weeks to choose whether to force through the changes by legal means. The brewing row highlights the tensions between local governments, which in some areas are taking a tough stance on climate change and environmental issues such as air pollution, and central government, which is accused of lagging behind on concrete actions to fulfil the UK’s national goals on the climate emergency and environmental protections. Jules Pipe, deputy mayor for planning, regeneration and skills, said: “Tackling London’s filthy air and the climate emergency are among the mayor’s top priorities. London has declared a climate emergency and it’s critical we move towards renewable energy to improve the capital’s toxic air quality, protect the health of Londoners, and keep the city on course to being a net zero-carbon city by 2050.” Khan’s plan would ban fracking in London, prevent the massive expansion of Heathrow backed by the government, and enshrine stronger protections for the green belt and metropolitan open land. A report by the Planning Inspectorate, a quasi-independent government agency, suggested changes to the London Plan that would allow for fracking in London, and for development in the green belt “in very special circumstances”, with alterations to the boundary of the green belt in “exceptional circumstances”. The inspectors want the changes in order to bring the London Plan into line with national policies, set by central government, and the great majority of the measures in the London Plan received their approval. Their recommendations are non-binding – however, to ignore them, the mayor must write to the secretary of state explaining why he is doing so. A spokesperson for the Planning Inspectorate said: “The London Plan has been examined by an independent panel of three inspectors. The panel’s role in the examination is now complete. The report sets out any recommended changes, as well as the reasoning behind those changes, following the examination in public. It is for the Greater London Authority to consider the changes and publish the report at a timing of their choice.” The effects of the changes proposed by the inspectors are likely to be minor in practice. For instance, there are no current plans to frack in London, and none are likely to be brought forward. Fracking has in effect stalled across the UK. Allowing for building on the green belt in “very special circumstances” would be open to challenge and require explanations of what made circumstances so special that the presumption against building should be breached. The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts On Heathrow, the London Plan will in effect be subordinate to the decisions of the courts, where attempts to stop the airport expansion by legal means are already well under way. Last week, a new legal front opened up in the ongoing battle, when WWF was granted permission to make arguments against expansion based on the rights of children. Khan’s objections to Heathrow expansion are nuanced, moreover, by his backing for increased capacity at Gatwick. The row over the London Plan is significant as it highlights the gap between local and national government on green issues. Local mayors and council leaders wishing to implement environmental improvements, whether on air pollution or measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sometimes lack the powers to do so. Even where they are given power, for instance in setting up clean air zones, they may be frustrated in raising funding for their plans, when local authorities are facing cuts, large deficits or even bankruptcy. Khan will write to the secretary of state before the end of the year, and the government will have six weeks in which to respond. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “It is for the mayor of London to take forward the planning inspector’s comments on the London Plan. The secretary of state will respond to any letter from the mayor of London in due course.”"
"Whether you think autumn officially starts at the beginning or end of September, you only have to look at the trees to see the season is changing. Leaves on deciduous trees always change colour from green to vibrant hues of yellow, orange, and red. But some years the colourful show is more spectacular than others. One of the most outstanding recent years in the UK was 2008. And the Forestry Commission is expecting 2016 to be another one of the best.  So what produces an autumn to remember? Variation from one year to the next in nature can be seen in a number of phenomena, such as the amount and duration of spring blossom or the quantity of fruit and berries on bushes and trees. Oenophiles (wine lovers) will know that the quality of grapes from which wine is made varies from one year to another. The underlying explanation for all these phenomena is basically the same: the weather. The distinctive autumnal woodland colours in leaves are formed by the combination of four classes of chemicals: chlorophyll, carotenoids, xanthophylls, and anthocyanins. Chlorophyll, the main chemical involved in photosynthesis, reflects green light, which explains the green colour of most deciduous trees in spring and summer.  As the days shorten in temperate latitudes, trees prepare for their winter dormant period by withdrawing nutrients from their leaves. Chlorophyll is rich in nitrogen. While some chlorophyll breaks down throughout the year, the process accelerates during autumn. As less green light is reflected, the colours of other chemicals in the leaves become visible. Carotenoids, another chemical involved in photosynthesis, tend to be orange. The yellow xanthophylls are oxygenated carotenoids. The many anthocyanin compounds produce a palette of reds, ranging from the brightest scarlet to maroons and purple. Put these colours together and you have a vibrant patchwork of colour clothing the countryside, urban parks and gardens. Data from the Met Office show that August 2016 was warmer (by 0.6℃) and sunnier (110%) compared to the long-term average. Combined with a wet spring (rainfall 30% above average in the east and south), this will have led to higher than average levels of sugars in plant tissues – and it is these sugars that are the real key to the richness of the autumnal colours. Anthocyanins are large, complex molecules containing a sugar, usually glucose. So more sunshine means more glucose, more anthocyanins and more vibrant autumnal colours in 2016. Anthocynanins are produced by some species of tree but not by others and they are also important in the production of the intense colours of many fruits and berries, including the colour of red grapes. In leaves, as the level of chlorophyll decreases, anthocyanins are produced. It is still not absolutely clear what function is performed by anthocyanins. It costs the plant energy to make them and only some tree species produce anthocyanins. Around 15% to 30% of tree leaf colour is caused by carotenoids and xanthophylls alone. There is some suggestion that anthocyanins are antioxidants and perform a protective role by preventing free radicals (reactive atoms or molecules) from destroying plant tissue and DNA. But this explanation is not universally accepted.  Other explanations are that anthocyanins effectively mask the leaves visually from some predators that can see the green leaves but do not possess the photoreceptors required to detect red leaves or insects that find red less attractive than green. As the chlorophyll breaks down and leaves naturally turn yellow and orange, so that the carotenoids and xanthophylls are no longer masked by the green, they attract sap-sucking aphids. So some species of tree produce a bright red pigment in the leaves to confuse insects. Although the summer weather means we can expect an impressive autumn, there are still some questions. Will 2016 be a long autumnal season, stretching from mid-September into November – or will it be cut short? In 2008, there were a few early frosts. Frost promotes abscission, the process by which the leaf detaches from the twig. In 2008, leaves fell from the trees over a relatively short period of time. That, of course, brings with it the joys of kicking through piles of fallen leaves, but an early frost will shorten the duration of the autumnal show, as might the high winds associated with autumnal storms. In the absence of early frosts and storms, however, we can look forward to a magnificent display. But for how many more years will this continue? Climate change has seen the onset date of leaf colour change being pushed back. That narrows the window during which the colours can be seen and enjoyed. If we are lucky this year, we will see a peak of colour in mid to late October with leaves still on the trees in November – but watch the weather forecast for the latest."
"Much of the global south – broadly comprising the continents of Asia, Africa, and Latin America – was shaped by colonialism. The so-called “great game” and the scrambles between Britain, Portugal, Belgium, France and other European states were for power, profit and – most visibly – for land.  Today, new scrambles are afoot from Brazil and Nigeria, to Ethiopia and Indonesia. Once again, land is the prize. In the past decade, almost 50m hectares of land have been leased or bought from individuals, communities and governments in the global south for the large-scale production of biofuels, food, forest resources, industrial goods, infrastructure, tourism and livestock. A complex network of multinational companies, financial institutions and governments in the north are the key beneficiaries.  Take, for example, Feronia Inc – a company based in Canada and owned by the development finance institutions of various European governments, including the UK, France and Spain. Feronia controls 120,000 hectares of palm oil plantations in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some of the countries that were once colonised are now the colonisers: China and India have huge investments in Cambodia, Indonesia, Guyana, Ethiopia and Brazil among other countries. According to the Land Matrix database, China controls 258,728 hectares in Cambodia. China’s Union Development Group (UDG) has a land concession of 45,100 hectares within Botum Sakor National Park for the development of a tourist resort. With the blessings of the central politburo of the Communist Party of China, UDG has also invested US$3.8 billion in a new deepwater port in the country, with access to 90km of coastline, on a 99-year lease. Similar investments have been made in maritime infrastructure in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. As we know, China is keen to increase its strategic and commercial influence over the South China Sea and Asian waters in general. Land deals are implemented – and often initiated – by sub-national states which are in competition with each other to win major investments. For example, since economic liberalisation in 1991, Indian states have competed with each other – and with states in neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and China – to bag business opportunities. I interviewed several senior civil servants in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. On the understanding that certain details of our interviews were kept off the record, one told me:   Companies are like bridegrooms. If they are bringing an iconic brand into the  state, they come with a huge list of demands, the primary one being land. In the case of [an automobile multinational], we had large, vacant plots, which we could transfer to them in a short period. In addition, they wanted road, rail and port access. They wanted to be near a metropolis. They wanted all sorts of social infrastructure, like land for an international school and sporting facilities for families of executives … Overall, there were 80-90 parameters related to land, tax concessions and clearances for water, electricity. His colleague added: [Companies] have played off states against each other. Take for example [a multinational]. We were trying to get them to [our state]. [They were to invest] US$2 billion … [But] the company wanted US$100m from us. [The Company’s] alternate sites were in Vietnam and Guangzhou in China. Finally Vietnam got [that] project. The latter official hinted that governments in India and competitor countries are willing to entice companies with hard cash, tax concessions and other subsidies in order to bag their investment.  These agreements tend to take place outside boardrooms. Deals are struck in the breakout spaces, green rooms, bars and clubs and people’s homes – in other words, in the institutional shadows. In Zimbabwe, war veterans can act as intermediaries who facilitate or block land deals at the local level, while in Cambodia and Vietnam, land investors may operate through middlemen – including moonlighting officials – in order to circumvent official rules. In India, an elaborate network of brokers, aggregators and consultants mediate between firms and governments in land acquisitions. During fieldwork in India, I found local government land offices with six or seven workers teaming up with an army of 50-plus middlemen who sat right outside and had easy access to the officials within. These middle men look into title deeds and ownership histories for a fee and work with bureaucrats to illegally fudge and clean up land records. Middle men also peddle information about who is facing hard times and will sell land easily and who will not. They may work with land aggregators employed by big companies to put together large, commercially viable parcels of land. In a densely populated country with great pressure on natural resources this has serious social implications. National and sub-national states are falling over each other to facilitate land deals in the name of attracting capital. The elites that control these states are also ensuring their longevity through the facilitation of prestigious land deals for private investors. Being pro-business is generally seen as a badge of honour and is projected as a plus point for politicians in election campaigns. Among the more humble collaborators in the global land grab, middle men – and the shadowy institutions through which they operate – must be understood in the context of high unemployment, which make land work attractive. And, understandably, like anyone these are people with aspirations for consumption and social mobility. The flashy cell phone, the proximity to rich and powerful people, the ability to get things done, all these indications of rising status are more likely to flow on from having been involved in a successful land transaction than by sitting outside a job centre. As we know from the history of European colonialism, the land grab would not have been possible without collaborators on the ground – local princelings and administrators were the linchpins of the colonial project. In enabling the transfer of power, they were able to enhance their own influence. Colonial-era princelings and administators have now given way to accommodating politicians, bureaucrats, middlemen and mediators of various types. As such, today’s story of globally traded land plays out along similar lines to colonial times."
"Labour will unveil plans to create a carbon-neutral energy system by the 2030s including insulation upgrades for every home in the UK and enough new solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches. The party will set out its fast-track climate strategy on Thursday after adopting plans to work towards a net-zero carbon economy two decades ahead of the government’s legally binding 2050 target. The plan includes 30 recommendations to tackle emissions from the energy system, including home energy efficiency upgrades such as insulation and double glazing that will focus first on damp homes and areas suffering fuel poverty. The party also plans to install 8m electric heat pumps to help wean Britain off its use of gas heating, and build another 7,000 offshore and 2,000 onshore wind turbines to help clean up the UK’s electricity supply. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said the report would kickstart Labour’s Green Industrial Revolution – but the next five years will be crucial. “The Labour party has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world and is the only party turning their targets into detailed, credible plans to tackle the climate and environmental crisis,” she said. “The recommendations in this report could put the UK on track for a zero-carbon energy system during the 2030s, but only if rapid progress is made early on. The next five years are therefore crucial.” The plan emerged after the party revealed a wide-ranging set of climate measures at its party conference in Brighton last month. They included a £250bn transformation fund to help drive its plans for a “green industrial revolution”, including a £3.4bn national network of electric vehicle charging points and a vow to ban sales of new fossil fuel cars by 2030. The party’s report estimates that the investment in clean electricity and home efficiency projects could create 850,000 new skilled jobs in the green industry and increase household incomes by 2% by boosting employment, capital investment and labour productivity. The economic predictions were prepared by a team of economists at the Sustainability Research Institute, backed by the University of Leeds, who were tasked with analysing the impact of the plans over the decade from 2020 to 2030. Labour’s plan also has the backing of a panel of energy experts and academics who have signed up to a statement in support of the plan. The statement confirms that Labour’s energy plan is “feasible” and does not rely on “clearly implausible or inappropriate” measures to increase the UK’s low-carbon energy by 2030.  Long-Bailey said the party was working with trade unions to “ensure that the changes to our energy system will be planned democratically, with the interests of workers and local communities at the heart of the transition”. Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said “the bold report” showed the scale of investment that will be required to deal with the climate emergency. “The report is right to say that we can’t hit net zero if we don’t immediately get on with delivering lots more renewable power, insulating homes and buildings and trialling at scale the potential solutions to heat decarbonisation. This all costs money, but investing more now will bring enormous benefits,” she said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago NTZ wrote about a recently published brochure released by the Umweltbundesamt (UBA), which is Germany’s version of the EPA.

UBA Director Jochen Flasbarth lost control of the agency to radical zealots, now under massive fire. Photo: UBA.
The notorious brochure not only included an alarmist summary of climate science today, but also contained a sort of “black list” of US and German skeptics, portraying them as “spreaders of half-truths and misinformation”.
In that article I expressed doubts about this brochure holding up legally, and said we likely have not heard the last of this story. Boy was I right! Hat-tip Bernd Felsche.
Henryk Broder sees parallels with dark regimes
For starters, yesterday, flagship national daily Die Welt, one of the targets of the UBA brochure, published a commentary written by veteran, renowned journalist Henryk Broder. The title: A government agency declares the climate debate ended.
What follows are some of Broder’s comments on the notorious witch-hunting UBA brochure:
The UBA Environmental Agency claims to have the power of authority when it comes to climate change and has put some journalists on the pillory in the debate. Such an approach reminds us of the Reichskulturkammer and the East German regime.”
Broder writes that one has to be careful before making Nazi comparisons, but says “sometimes there are stunning similarities or parallels that bear witness to an amazing continuity of thought and action.” He writes:
There was a Reich Chamber of Films that controlled German film-making. Only members of the Reich Chamber of Films were allowed to work in film production. Every one else was forbidden to work in that occupation. The same rule applied for the Reich Chamber of Theatre, Reich Chamber of the Press, Reich Chamber of Broadcasting, Reich Chamber of Music, and the Reich Chamber of Arts. All these chambers operated under the umbrella of the Reichskulturkammer (RKK) [Reich Chamber of Culture], which was created by the Reich Minister for Education and Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels.
At the end of the Third Reich, the RKK and its departments disappeared into the rubble of German history. And up to today no one has ever proposed a new founding or re-establishment of such an institution. However: There is now a ‘Federal Chamber of Climate’ that is under the name of the Umweltbundesamt UBA.”

I’d like to remind readers that Broder is by no means exaggerating here. The brochure really is that nasty. Rahmstorf is all over it. The UBA brochure takes aim at American and German journalists and scientists only because they have a different opinion about how the world’s weather works over the long-term.
Broder writes that the UBA’s latest step “is an unprecedented case of government authoritarian intervention in a public discussion we’ve seen since World War II“, adding that the UBA has gone too far:
It draws the lines in the climate debate. That means it has ordered an end to the debate. And it determines who has the right to say something, and who is to remain silent.”
If there was ever proof that the warmists have lost the debate, the UBA has delivered it on a silver platter.

Broder concedes that perhaps the comparison to the third Reich is overdoing it, and so ends his commentary:
Therefore the question is not: ‘Is there climate change?’, but rather it is: ‘Are we on the way to a second East German Regime where the government is responsible for today’s weather forecast and the climate for the day after tomorrow?’ “
UBA brochure “a scandal”
Broder is just the latest to speak out on the UBA’s anti-democratic direction. Die Welt Editor in Chief Jan-Eric Peters wrote at his Facebook site:
One should use the term ‘scandal’ sparingly. However, when a government agency such as the German Environment Agency publishes a sort of black list on unliked journalists in a brochure funded by taxpayers, and requests them to stop spreading untruths, then this is indeed a scandal!”
At his klimazwiebel blog Hans von Storch writes in a reader comment writes:
I suspect that there is going to be public, critical interest aimed at this UBA Sleeping Beauty Castle.”
Even devout green protagonaists of man-made global warming are horrified by the UBA’s authoritarian brochure, like ZDF television. Very few media outlets are greener and more one-sided than Germany’s ZDF public television. ZDF journalist Reinhard Schlieker comments, writing that the “UBA goes after journalists and scientists who claim that man-made global warming has not been proven” and that the brochure comes across as an “official defamation for a ‘good cause'”. Suddenly, we see that the ZDF recognizes that the UBA has gone way over the line, and that there is no consensus in climate science after all.
The ZDF article continues, describing the “chamber” mentality of the brochure:
In Part B of the brochure that the science is settled and that cluelessness rules in the public debate which is influenced by somehow misled journalists. This part is based mainly on findings from Prof. Stefan Rahmstorf, who works at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and vehemently advocates that only qualified scientists should have the right to express views on climate science – everyone else should not be given the authority to do so.”
The ZDF continues:
The publication of the UBA could produce the impression with readers who are unfamiliar with the topic that, with these journalists and authors, we are dealing with intentional fraudsters who are controlled by outside forces and paid by lobbyists.”
Knowing what I know about some of those targeted by the UBA, you can be sure they are not going to take this “defamation” laying down. Expect much more to develop on this in the days and weeks ahead.
Oh, the ZDF ends with:
According to information from heute.de [ZDF] Those involved are are considering a lawsuit. Heute.de has sent a list of questions and requested an explanation.”

"At the end of last year, China announced a complete ban on its ivory trade and processing activities by the end of 2017. The news, a late Christmas gift to many conservationists, was greeted as a “game changer” by groups including the World Wildlife Fund, which says around 20,000 African elephants are being killed every year for their ivory. As the world’s largest consumer of ivory products, Chinese demand has seen poaching increase and ivory prices rise. The country has had a seemingly insatiable appetite for so-called “white gold”.  At a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) last September, a resolution was tabled which recommended that its 183 member states “close their domestic markets for commercial trade in raw and worked ivory as a matter of urgency”. China’s support of the resolution surprised many and led to it being adopted by consensus. The country had taken a big step in re-evaluating its relationship with ivory and its effect on the world’s elephants. The subsequent announcement on December 30 2016 saw China commit to closing up to 15 of its 34 ivory processing firms and 50 to 60 of its 130 licensed ivory retail shops by March 31 2017. The second stage will see China phase out the country’s remaining registered legal processors and traders by the end of the year.  China has a popular ivory carving industry with a history which stretches back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties. To assist those who carry out this work, there will be schemes to assist ivory carvers with the transition into working with other mediums. “Master carvers” will be encouraged to work in museums and in the repair and maintenance of artistic and culturally significant ivory artefacts.  The Chinese move effectively brings to an end the future of the country’s domestic ivory market. But there are millions of pieces of (currently) legally owned ivory artefacts all over China which will have to be dealt with through a strict new management system. Ivory products will only be displayed in museums and art galleries for non-commercial purposes or exhibition and the giving and inheriting of ivory will still be allowed.  More worryingly, the Chinese ban on trade specifically excludes items described as “genuine antiques”. This exemption raises concerns that elephants will continue to be poached to supply an increased trade in “ghost ivory” (illegal ivory sold as antique legal ivory) as the legitimate market closes.   Another problem is that a large portion of China’s ivory trade will simply shift to Hong Kong, which is not subject to the Chinese ban. Hong Kong is the world’s biggest legal retail market for elephant ivory and a major transit hub for illegal imports. Hong Kong has itself pledged to phase out its domestic ivory market by 2021 and it is hoped that the Chinese announcement will encourage Hong Kong to speed up the timescale. But there is no guarantee this will happen. Concerns over the sale of “ghost ivory” alongside legitimate legal ivory pieces are even greater in Hong Kong. “Hong Kong ivory” has even come to be a derogatory term to describe new ivory masquerading as old.  This point was recently highlighted by British auctioneer James Lewis, who said of his experiences in Hong Kong: You see old ivory on the same shelf as new ivory. I realised then there’s a major market in the Far East that looks at ivory as a commodity as well as an art form, and that the old ivory market is fuelling modern ivory demand. But these concerns should not distract us from the positive aspects of China’s plans. In terms of addressing the decline in wild elephant populations and Asia’s attitudes to ivory, the Chinese ban can only be a good thing. Provided Beijing is able to police and manage the changes effectively it could even be the “game changer” conservationists hope for.  Just as importantly, the fact that China has gone so far and with such a strict time scale after years of negotiation could be the catalyst for other states such as Hong Kong, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam to follow suit. Demand for “white gold” has taken the elephant to the brink of extinction. Chinese remorse could be the species’ salvation."

By Sebastian Lüning and Fritz Vahrenholt
On May 10, 2013, at the online Austrian ORF, there was a rare interview with the CLOUD Experiment director of the European European Organization for Nuclear Research, Jasper Kirkby. Within the scope of the CLOUD project, it is being investigated to what extent solar activity has on cloud formation via the mechanism of cosmic radiation and the impact this could have on the Earth’s climate (see Chapter 6 of our book “Die kalte Sonne“). Here’s an excerpt of the worthwhile interview:
ORF: What is the relationship between solar activity and cosmic radiation?
Kirkby: Cosmic radiation consists of high energy, charged particles. When they reach our solar system, they are deflected away by the magnetic field of the sun. Foremost by the magnetic field of the solar plasma. When the sun is active, less cosmic radiation reaches the Earth. The relationship to the solar cycle: When there are many sunspots, the Earth receives 10 – 30% less cosmic radiation.
Is this relationship sure?
Yes, it is solidly confirmed. We also know that cosmic radiation ionizes every cubic centimeter of the Earth’s atmosphere. Unsure so far is whether or not this also could have a climatic impact. Clouds are extremely important for the Earth’s climate. If I could magically eliminate all clouds from the atmosphere, then 30 watts of additional heat energy would reach every square meter of the Earth.
To put this number into context: The warming of the atmosphere through the impacts of man is currently pegged at 1.5 watts per square meter. Small variations in cloud cover could have large impacts.
What do your experiments show?
At this point in time we cannot say if cosmic radiation impacts the climate. So far up to now we have investigated the production of condensation nuclei for cloud droplets – particularly those that are formed from gas, i.e. gas-to-particle-conversion”. They represent about half of the condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. The remaining nuclei come from soot and dust.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




What gases are involved in this process?
We have looked at sulfuric acid and ammonia. The results of the first trials: Cosmic radiation enhances the formation of condensation nuclei from gases by a factor of 10. But that alone is too little to have a significant impact on cloud formation. According to our latest experiments, there has to be another gas or vapor involved that enhances this process. We suspect organic substances.
Which ones?
The results are currently being reviewed by a journal. Unfortunately I can’t tell you more. Only this much: The results are very interesting. Over the course of the year there are going to be some publications on the subject.
Let’s assume that you are able to show that cosmic radiation indeed does contribute a lot to cloud formation. What would that mean?
I think that the experiments are important in two ways. Firstly, they would show that there is a natural source to climate change. And the other point is that it would change our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. We know quite a bit about greenhouse gases. What we know little about are aerosols. These are particles that come from industry floating in the atmosphere. They surely have a cooling effect. However, we have no idea just how great this effect is. It may be small, but it may be very big. Maybe it is even big enough to offset the additional CO2 in the atmosphere.. We don’t know.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week hard-hitting Swiss weekly Weltwoche published a revealing interview with IPCC WG-1 Co-Chair Thomas Stocker. The interview was conducted by Markus Schär.
Dr. Sebastian Lüning was given permission to republish the interview at the Die kalte Sonne site here, adding his rebuttals and corrections. Lüning writes: “Thomas Stocker showed a number of memory lapses in the Weltwoche-Interview.”
What follows is the interview along with Lüning’s rebuttals in English. Because of the interview’s length, it will appear in 3 or 4 parts over the next few days. Some parts have been slightly shortened and edited.
The Stocker interview not only exposes misleading science, but also provides good hints as to how the IPCC intends to approach its 5th report.
INTERVIEW

WELTWOCHE: How do you explain the cold winters of the last years?
STOCKER: There’s been no long series of cold winters in Switzerland, every one was different. Basically I tell people, “You can’t look at the temperatures of one winter and at one station. Instead many years of very precise observations have to considered if you want to see a long-term trend.” And especially this winter there are ideas for explanations in the science. 
Lüning: Every winter was different? To the contrary the last five years indeed do have something in common. Meteorologist Dominik Jung of wetter.net reported in February 2013: “With the current winter we now have five consecutive colder-than-normal winters.” This is visibly very awkward for Stocker, and so he just doesn’t mention it and hopes no one will notice.
WELTWOCHE: Some colleagues are aggressively pursuing the hypothesis that the cold winters are due to melting ice in the Arctic.
STOCKER: Yes, there are indications from a couple of studies – though I wouldn’t call it anything robust at this point – that the low sea ice cover is having an impact on the statistics of the frequency of high pressure regions. This is having a strong impact on the weather events at our latitudes, as we are currently experiencing now.
WELTWOCHE: The German colleagues who developed this hypothesis presented it to the media as truth.
STOCKER: I don’t pay so much attention to what these colleagues are saying, and it is not for me to comment on. The following is clear: We have to rationally approach the problem of communicating on the big problem of climate warming, that is to stick to the facts – this is valid for all sides. That’s a big challenge today when everything has to fit in the 140 characters of a tweet. With such a complex issue, it just doesn’t work: On one hand we have to communicate the facts, and on other hand also the uncertainties.
WELTWOCHE: The colleagues are tweeting these findings like they are sure: “The cold winters stem from the climate warming.”
STOCKER: That’s the statement from one ot two publications, but it’s no scientific consensus; forming a consensus is a tough job. At the IPCC we just can’t take every single paper from all institutes worldwide. It’s possible that in the coming report there will be a statement on that, on how ice cover in the Arctic influences the statistics of high pressure regions. But for now we are working on it.
Lüning: That’s a major blow to his colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), who quickly thought up the Arctic ice theory after the first cold winters showed up. Totally convinced, the dubious patchwork was presented to the media as the solution to the cold winter paradox. But now it’s official: the IPCC Co-Chair does not see any robust science in the Potsdam theory and no scientific consensus.
Here it would have been nice if Stocker had brought up another study on this, like the one from Mike Lockwood et al from 2010. This paper found a really convincing mechanism where weak solar phases could lead to cold European winters. Moreover, from Stocker’s very own institute, the Oeschger Centre for Climate Science in Bern, came a study in January 2013 written by Ulf Büntgen confirming that Eastern European cold phases over the last 1000 years occurred during weak periods of solar activity (see our blog article”Osteuropäische Kälteperioden während solarer Schwächephasen“). It’s hard to believe that Stocker suddenly cannot remember the latest research results coming from his very own institute.
WELTWOCHE: Us lay-people would much prefer to have experts who can tell us what’s ahead, and not experts who later explain why something didn’t happen like it was supposed to.
STOCKER: That’s right. That’s why at the IPCC we look back regularly: What did we say in the first report in 1990, the second in 1995, the third in 2001 and the fourth in 2007? We can show that the projections of the global mean temperature were extremely good already back in 1990. At the time we already had the most important blocks of the science in place in order to – of course within the uncertainties – reliably estimate the temperature development. But we never claimed, and we aren’t claiming now, that we can project the temperature 10 years down the road. Such a short-term forecast is not possible, and will never be possible. There’s the trend, and it will be overlaid with short term fluctuations. We’ve always communicated that.

Lüning: At this point Stocker is digging himself into a hole. Stocker claims outright that the IPCC projections were “extremely good“. This is untrue – and Stocker knows it. The real observed, measured temperature development is now departing from the IPCC projection range, and Stocker is keeping completely quiet about this fact, insisting the false projections are “extremely good”. Here he is intentionally misleading the unfamiliar readers. But luckily Weltwoche did not fall for his deception. Later in the interview Weltwoche comes back and presses Stocker on the point. But first Weltwoche repeats a question that Stocker had attempted to dodge.
WELTWOCHE: We would tend to believe the cold winter theory had it not come from the very same people who just ten years ago told us children would not know what snow is.
STOCKER: That’s why the IPCC avoids making such statements.
Here Stocker throws his climate-alarmist colleague Mojib Latif under the bus and distances himself from the failed predictions and media gaffe. A clever move on his part. Stocker is then asked once more about the failed IPCC projections.
WELTWOCHE: You emphasized that you had correctly predicted the temperature development. But that’s hotly disputed. In the draft of your report in the fall of 2012, you depicted a chart that showed the temperatures of the last years being below all the projections of the IPCC. 
STOCKER: At the moment we find ourselves at the lower limit when you look at the last 10 years, but still within the communicated uncertainties.
Lüning: At this point Stocker was forced to admit after all that the IPCC’s projections were not “extremely good”, like he had claimed earlier. But hey, it was worth the try. Most other newspapers would not have noticed his error and Stocker’s version would have gotten through. Weltwoche turns up the heat:
WELTWOCHE: The very uncertain uncertainties 
STOCKER: This is precisely why we specify uncertainties. But we also have to look back: Were there earlier periods where the global mean temperature stagnated over 10 or 15 years? Indeed we find several such windows in the last 100 years. So it’s nothing really unusual. 
Lüning: Of course there have been cold phases in the past. And we noticed that the cold was always in sync with the cold Pacific and Atlantic Ocean cycles. The IPCC just doesn’t want to acknowledge this relationship and stubbornly claims the cold would never follow any system and would just disappear. This is the only way that the IPCC could so grandly fail with the temperature development of the last one and a half decades. At about 2000 the PDO began its downward phase. So it was clear from the start that we should expect cooling for the coming decades. If the IPCC had accepted this empirical forecasting tool earlier, it would have one less problem to deal with today. However, there’s a good reason why the IPCC refused to acknowledge the PDO’s obvious impact on the global temperature development: During the main warming phase of 1977-2000 the PDO climbed and remained at a warm plateau, taking the global temperature up a few tenths of a degree with it. These were a few tenths of a degree that the IPCC had already chalked up to CO2.
Weltwoche then brought up a topic over which some members of the IPCC have had sleepless nights:
WELTWOCHE: IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri recently admitted that there has not been any global warming for 17 years.
STOCKER: I can’t tell other colleagues what to say.
Lüning: What is he saying? Isn’t Stocker aware of the real measured temperature curve? The stop in warming is a fact. Even Pachauri admits it. Does Stocker seriously believe Pachauri made a mistake here? Weltwoche:
WELTWOCHE: He’s your boss.
STOCKER: My function together with the international team of authors is to summarize the science; that’s what we are doing right now. From the studies we are addressing the following: a) is such a stagnation usual, b) are we going to see such phases also in the future, and c) this is the most important point, there are in the meantime over 100 simulations of climate development using the latest models. The question is: Do we see simulations that show no warming between 1998 and 2012? We do find such simulations, not many, but one or two. We are simply living in a realisation of a climate system with its chaos of natural variability – in the single one observed of many possible physical ones.
Lüning: Here Stocker is spreading the full superbness of the IPCC. Using lots of impressive words, he’s trying to come up with reasons for the warming stop, but is sadly unable to come up with anything convincing. As expected, Stocker pulls out the old chaos models from his hat. He’s hoping that of the hundreds of simulations carried out, a few will be able to show a warming stop over the last 15 years. This would then be the proof that the models are “extremely good”.  Is Stocker really so naive to think that this would actually serve as proof? This would be like someone picking all 49 numbers of a lottery and then later claiming he picked the 6 correct numbers!

"In 1974, the World Food Conference declared that: “Every man, woman and child has the inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition in order to develop their physical and mental faculties.” The conference set as its goal the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition within a decade.  Two decades later, in 1996, the World Food Summit was assembled in an explicit admission that this goal had not been met. More than 10,000 participants from 195 countries gathered in Rome and, over five days of intense discussion, set a target of reducing by half the number of undernourished people by no later than 2015. Food security was defined in the following declaration: Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. The summit set out a seven-point plan of action, including managing population growth and migration, reducing poverty and promoting peace and stability. Ambitious goals which, so far, have failed with most future predictions showing things are going to get worse.  Four years ago, I started to work directly in the world of food security research and if there is one thing that I have learned in the intervening period it is that it is complicated. Here are some of the factors that have made it so difficult to fulfil those ambitious goals.   Population growth The current global population is 7.4 billion and it is growing rapidly. We are expected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100. At the same time income levels are expected to increase. In order to feed this larger and richer population food demand is therefore expected to increase by 70% by 2050. However, neither the growth nor the increase in wealth is expected to be evenly distributed. India, China and Africa are predicted to make up an increasing share of the world population and India and China expected to make up 50% of the global middle class consumption by 2050. This means that the demands for food will obviously be greater in those areas with larger populations, but in countries where there is also an increase in wealth there is likely to be an increase in demand for less healthy and less environmentally friendly Western-style diets. Climate change: Our ability to provide food for this growing population will be seriously affected by the changing climate. Current predictions for global warming are for an increase in temperature ranging from 0.6℃ to 4℃ use sy by 2099. The Paris climate agreement sets out a global action plan to limit global warming this century to 2℃. This will be a difficult target to achieve both in the light of Donald Trump’s (at least pre-election) declaration that he would cancel the agreement, but also given the expected increase in food demand with agri-food accounting for about 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions. However, the impact of these predicted changes will not be evenly distributed. The Met office has produced a tool which allows us to investigate the impact of climate change on food insecurity and which shows that under all scenarios Africa is the most vulnerable to food insecurities. But even within Africa some countries are more vulnerable than others, with Niger, Somalia and Mauritania the most vulnerable and South Africa and Algeria the least. Using the same tool, we can see that in Asia there are currently medium levels of vulnerability to food insecurity with Mongolia and the Philippines the most vulnerable. Under many climate change scenarios this vulnerability increases across Asia but countries such as Burma and Papua New Guinea show the largest increases. These results mean that the spatial scale at which we consider food security is very important and mitigation plans which might be put into place to deal with these vulnerabilities need to take these geographical differences into account. Malnutrition: Today the world faces a double burden of malnutrition that includes both under-nutrition and obesity. In 2015, more than 1.9 billion adults worldwide were overweight while 462m were underweight. This divide is not simply between the developed and developing world, low and middle-income countries are now seeing a rise in childhood obesity and this is increasing at a faster rate than in richer nations. This is related to the increase in wealth and changes in diet discussed earlier.   Given these issues, different countries will need different solutions. Africa is going to have to deal with the double burden of increasing populations and more drought risk. Solutions in Africa need to focus on sustainable intensification with better solutions in increased yield and reducing waste through pests, diseases and storage. One technological solution is to develop drought-resistant crops, although the efficacy of this is debated. The issue here is not the technology but how to distribute it.  According to the Global Plant Council, while some farmers are using these drought-resistant varieties successfully (5m smallholder farmers in 2014), the adoption of these seeds varies from country to country. Some farmers are unaware of the availability of the seeds and others are unable to either access or afford them. In the developed world, experts are more concerned by the health risks associated with obesity and our focus needs to be on sustainable nutrition. There is a lot of evidence that diets which are healthier for us as individuals are also better for the environment. No one has yet identified an “ideal diet” but according to a Food and Climate Research Network report in 2014, the lower the meat, fish and dairy content of a diet, the lower the environmental impact. However, nutritionally, that will mean that reduced meat intakes need to be compensated for with increases in the quantity and diversity of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and legumes. We also have to be careful that demands we make on the food system in this country do not increase problems in other countries and we do not shift the burden of production. This can be done through the use of, for example, Life cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA aims to address the environmental aspects and potential environmental impacts (for example, the use of resources and the environmental consequences of releases pollutants) throughout a product’s lifecycle from the acquisition of raw material, through the production, use, end-of-life treatment, recycling and final disposal. However, LCA is a general approach which can be applied to any product and, because of the complexities of the food system, needs to be tailored in order to be used more effectively. The “simple” solution to the issue of food security is that we all demand less, eat more sustainably and be more careful with our resources. That is clearly much easier said than done. If there is plenty of food in the supermarket it is difficult to believe it matters if we buy that extra packet of biscuits – and we are up in arms that the price of Marmite might increase.  Even the future leaders of some countries do not believe in climate change. However, alarming though the potential lack of Marmite is, we should bear in mind that other countries are already suffering the burden of food insecurity and focusing our resources towards finding solutions in those countries will benefit us on many levels. _This article is part of a series by The Conversation on food security.

"The world’s largest global forum for young leaders will open on Tuesday, as more than 2,000 young people from across the world converge on London. One Young World’s 10th annual summit will welcome young delegates from more than 190 countries as well as political and humanitarian leaders, including the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, the former president of Ireland Mary Robinson, Sir Richard Branson, Sir John Major and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. “Our young delegates are founders, activists and entrepreneurs in their own right, united by a common goal to resolve some of the world’s most pressing challenges – from climate change and violent extremism to sexual violence and poverty,” said Kate Robertson, a cofounder of the UK-based not-for-profit organisation. In a world where the most recognisable climate activist is a 16-year-old girl from Sweden, Robertson said: “At the heart of every global threat is a failure of leadership. This new generation is the most informed, most educated, most connected generation in human history.” Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com The organisation estimates that almost 21 million young people have been impacted by its ongoing programme of mentoring across the world. The Duchess of Sussex, the singer Ellie Goulding, the supermodel Leomie Anderson and Edward Enninful, Vogue’s editor-in-chief, will also attend the annual four-day summit, which will be London’s largest and most international event since the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The summit will also feature speeches from 30 global chief executives, including Alan Jope of Unilever, James Quincey of Coca Cola, Bram Schot of Audi, and Feike Sijbesma from DSM. They will be speaking to some would-be leaders of the future, among them: Madhav Datt Datt founded Green the Gene as a small environmental club in his school when he was eight years old. The organisation is now one of the world’s largest youth-run environmental non-profits. It has projects in 62 countries and has mobilised more than 7,000 young people, all under 24, to build tangible solutions for communities facing acute climate crisis. Now 23, Datt has created a number of technology and data projects to address specific problems, including low-cost water filtration units, providing safe water to more than 40,000 people in rural Tanzania, recycling 3,000,000+ litres of swimming pool water annually in Haryana in India and planting more than 1,500,000 trees in Gambia and 600,000 in India. As a software engineering intern at Google, Datt developed machine-learning algorithms for Nest thermostat energy demand response programs, to reduce energy used by home heating/cooling systems during peak demand times. I learned about the climate crisis at firsthand: the water level in our local dam had fallen by 2ft, which meant our water and electricity was severely rationed. There was nothing abstract about the issue for me. Starting the environmental club, planting trees and talking to local shopkeepers about plastic bags were things I couldn’t not do. One of the biggest things that being young gave me was the power to go up against huge issues because I simply didn’t appreciate that they were widely regarded as impossible problems. Bella Burgemeister Burgemeister was 10 when she decided to write a book to help school-aged children understand the climate crisis. The book, now in its second edition, is in every school in her community in the south-west of Western Australia. In the past three years, Burgemeister has spoken to 5,000 children and 8,000 adults in schools, conferences and meetings. She is a climate activist and organiser. It was tough, aged just 10, to get my head around things like economic growth and responsible consumption but it’s important that children understand these issues because for most of my life, the major political parties have done as little as they can get away with when it comes to climate change.Young people like me are the ones who will live with the consequences of inaction on climate. That was a huge motivator for me. Some politicians and local councillors said I was too young but I didn’t care: I knew what I was doing was right. Edgar Edmund Edmund founded Green Venture Recycles, a company that turns plastic waste into affordable building products, when he was 14. The Tanzanian company has already turned more than 20m plastic bags into 20,000 bricks. I was 12 when I became aware that climate change was causing the floods that regularly destroyed my community. The flood waters were always full of plastic waste. When I was 15, I had a lightbulb moment: I realised that plastic was harder after being heated, which meant I could use the plastic waste to rebuild my community’s homes strong enough to withstand the floods. It was one solution to two problems. I asked myself whether I was too young to deal with this but I realised that if I had to wait for someone else to solve the problem, it would be too late. I designed my first machine using $20 of savings. It took me a year of hard work but after I’d finished, I took it to a science fair and won $100. I used that money to make a more efficient machine which was nominated for a prize in South Africa. I won $15,000 in that competition and used it to create an electric machine. Then I was invited to Sweden and won $7,000 and met investors who helped me get the machine into production. Brighton Kaoma Growing up in the Zambian city of Kitwe, 12 -year-old Kaoma saw the impact of climate breakdown firsthand: as floods and droughts began to destroy his community, he found he was having to walk an extra mile to fetch water and suffered repeated respiratory infections because of the toxic emissions from nearby copper mines. When he was 14, Kaoma asked a local radio station if he could present a show on the environment. Environmental Watch became one of the station’s most popular programmes, educating listeners about the problems affecting them – from global heating and deforestation to pollution – and how they could help. Now 25, Kaoma has founded Agents of Change Foundation, training young people to be agents of change in their community. It has trained 260 children so far, many taking up leadership positions in their own communities. I mobilised my community, we planted trees, I organised marches, opened conservation clubs in schools across the area. By the time I approached the radio station, they had already heard about me and my work. Being so young meant I was free-spirited: I wasn’t afraid on my programme to call a spade a spade. I called to task multinationals and government.  People said I was too young. They threatened me by saying my life would be affected by getting on the nerves of everyone from government to local business. But I was fearless. I was too scared of my future, living in a world with no resources other than those that had been polluted, to let them scare me. Noga Levy-Rapoport Levy-Rapoport, 17, is a core UK Student Climate Network organiser and spokeswoman for Labour for a Green New Deal. She led her first London climate strike at 16. I have aways been aware of climate change but we all grew up being told that if we recycled more and switched off the lights, we would save the planet. I realised as I got older that that’s wrong. I realised that I couldn’t plan my future 20 to 30 years ahead because the world was going to hit a brick wall: it would descend into chaos. Young people have so much power because we’re so angry. We’re growing up in climate change and amid political disasters.  There’s always a risk that adults will think that we will sort this out but we’re really clear: we don’t have time for us to grow up before a solution is found. We’re very clear that it’s your mess and you must clear it up. Kehkashan Basu Winner of the 2016 International Children’s Peace Prize, Kehkashan Basu has been campaigning on behalf of children’s rights, gender quality and climate change since she was 8 years old. When I was 8, I planted my first tree and began talking to the children and grown ups around me about environmental issues. I realised that the children were so much more responsive and enthusiastic than the adults I was speaking to, so I determined to work with children instead, informing them about environmental issues and what they could do about it. Young activists have an advantage over adults because we have an uninhibited view of the world. We’re not affected by cynicism or by awareness of how big problems are. We are determined to solve problems and are truly open to new solutions. The world needs more of that attitude. This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover? Email us at theupside@theguardian.com "

Share this...FacebookTwitterA week ago meteorologist Dr. Karsten Brandt published an analysis of precipitation in Central Europe, particularly Germany. His article was titled: “More heavy rains?” In it Brandt asks: “How frequent are such events and are they increasing?”

Hat-tip: Bernd Felsche at FB. 
In his article Brandt analyzes data to see if weather extremes, especially in the form of heavy rainfall episodes (30+ litres per sq m in 24 hours), are more frequent than they were 30 years ago.
Brandt looked at a representative central German weather station – in Bonn – and looked at the period of 2007 – 2013, i.e. 2357 days. On average 2.19 mm of rain fell each of the 2357 days, the range was 0 to 59 l/m².
30l/sq m or more fell an average of less than 2 days per year.
Analyzing the data, Brandt found that:
The total rain amount increased over the 30-year period just few percentage points. Since the mid 1980s average daily precipitation went up from an average of 2 l/m² per day to 2.2 l/m² for the last 6 years.”

That’s a 10% increase, which is well within the range of natural variability. Brandt adds:
The frequency distribution for precipitation has not changed much when one looks at data from the 1980s and 1990s.
Since the 1980s in Bonn, 2 days a year can be expected to see a rain amount of 30 l/m² or more. A significant increase in heavy rain events since the mid 1980s cannot be found. The state environmental office of North Rhine Westphalia reached a similar result in a study of numerous weather stations in North Rhine Westphalia from the 1950s until today.”
Brandt then goes on to explain that the biggest problem is the growing asphalt and concrete surfacing, which he says grew 1% per year between 1997 and 2007. This is the primary factor in river flooding.
Brandt summarizes:
This small study indicates that heavy rain events have not increased significantly as many people may have assumed. In our cities however, we have to expect rainfalls exceeding 30 l/sq m or more in 24 hours to occur 2 times per year.
The water management of the city has to be able to deal with this amount of water over the long term, so that repeated damage can be avoided.”
Globally, no trend in precipitation over past century!
Okay, this is for Central Europe only. What about the globe as a whole? Surprisingly even Wikipedia writes the following when it comes to global precipitation:
Globally there has been no statistically significant overall trend in precipitation over the past century, although trends have varied widely by region and over time.”

"The 2019 hurricane season, which has already seen parts of Texas flooded and the Bahamas devastated, is prompting existential angst for a unique US culture that fears being torn asunder by the climate crisis. Fiercer storms and the encroaching seas are gnawing away at the Gullah Geechee nation, a distinct cultural group that historically dwelt on a 425-mile stretch of coastline from Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida. Today, the bulk of this community, descendants of African slaves and native Americans, resides only on the low-lying fringes of South Carolina and Georgia.  Hurricane Dorian, which lacerated the Caribbean in early September, uprooted trees and left debris strewn across historic Gullah Geechee sites, according to Queen Quet, the elected chieftess and head of state for the community, which declared its own nationhood in 2000. A destructive recent pattern, marked most severely by Hurricane Matthew in 2016, is taking hold. “The biggest concern is the massive number of [storms] that are arriving on our coast annually,” said Queen Quet, also known as Marquetta L Goodwine, who is also a computer scientist and historian. In the English-based creole language used by the Gullah Geechee, she is known as the “head pun de boddee”. “We are convinced that this is directly linked to climate change dynamics,” she said. “There have never been this many hurricanes and tropical storms in succession. This is causing a major strain on the community being able to recover financially from these.” A rapidly warming ocean and atmosphere is helping fuel stronger, if not more numerous, hurricanes, climate scientists have found. But periods of drought and rising sea levels are also a major concern for the Gullah Geechee, owing to their precarious perch on a string of tidal and barrier islands called the Sea Islands, previously the site of rice, cotton and indigo plantations. “The very existence of the Gullah Geechee nation is threatened by the rapid erosion of our Sea Islands due to the sea level rise issues brought on by climate change,” said Queen Quet, who has attempted to rouse the US government and the United Nations to the cause of a culture expressed through its arts, basket weaving and spiritual music, much of it based upon an intrinsic link to the sea.  Because of their geographic isolation, the Gullah Geechee developed a distinct language and culture, stemming from west and central Africa. Beginning in the late 19th century, theirs was a slow-paced life of fishing and mule carts on dirt roads. Dishes were based around okra, rice and yams. Many of the traditions continue today, with heritage tours helping provide locals with an income as well as cultural preservation. Threats loom, however. Earlier this year Queen Quet appeared in front of a congressional committee to explain how prized seafood is disappearing as the waters warm. Shellfish are threatened as the ocean acidifies while once-common catfish are vanishing. Her people’s unique culture “will not continue to thrive or survive if we are displaced from the Sea Islands,” Queen Quet warned. The plight of the Gullah Geechee is echoed in other distinct cultures across the US that find themselves on the frontline of the climate crisis. Often forced on to land vulnerable to drought or flooding by colonial dispossession and a lack of political clout, these communities face an overwhelming threat to their way of life. “There will be tremendous stories of adaption and change as well as horrifying stories of losing homelands, family and cultural practices,” said Kyle Whyte, an expert in indigenous environmental issues at Michigan State and a member of the Potawatomi native American people. “Lots of indigenous cultures place importance upon resilience but that doesn’t mean that climate change risks aren’t a threat. Many are going to have to work very hard to maintain their way of life.” In Arizona, the Navajo are under pressure from rising temperatures and a dwindling water supply. In Washington state, the Quinault Indian Nation is attempting to relocate the village of Taholah – including its housing, post office, school, daycare, gym and police and fire service – to 200 acres of higher ground due to the threat of riverine flooding. Further north, Alaska is heating up at twice the global average, causing roads to buckle and houses to subside as permafrost locked in the soils starts to melt. Native communities, which rely on stable sea ice for subsidence hunting and transportation, are at particular risk, with at least a dozen towns attempting to relocate. One, the small coastal town of Newtok, received $15m in federal funding last year to start moving houses to safer ground, although the fate of other at-risk towns remains unclear. The threat to traditional practices has helped spur a legal challenge led by young Alaskans who are suing their state government over the harm caused by the climate crisis. “Climate change is not just a political issue for me, it’s my lifestyle, it’s what I face every day back at home,” said lead plaintiff Esau Sinnok, an indigenous Alaskan from Shishmaref, a barrier island menaced by coastal erosion. “The one and only place I get to call home is being eaten by the sea.” Adapting to the changing environment isn’t simple – funding and political will is lacking and minority communities can feel wary dealing with US authorities that have previously wrought dispossession and discrimination. Splits within communities can also appear. Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana, populated by the ancestors of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw tribe who were forced there after fleeing persecution, has lost 98% of its land mass over the past six decades due to coastal erosion, leaving a slender strip of land just two miles long and a quarter-mile wide. In 2016, residents were the first to be given federal funding to relocate the community to drier ground, although many now don’t want to sever their deeply rooted bonds to the island. “This here can’t be remade someplace,” island resident Chris Brunet told the LA Times. “Cultural practices across the US have already been threatened for many decades and climate change is making things worse,” said Whyte. “These people are often tied to a certain area and don’t have the options to move like other people. They can exercise their culture and self-determination on small areas of land only. Native people certainly didn’t choose to be in this situation.” Queen Quet said lawmakers need a much greater appreciation of the cultural threat posed by climate change. “Without the ability to continue our cultural traditions on the land and the sea, we would not be able to continue to live in the healthy, balanced manner that is central to traditional Gullah Geechee culture,” she said.  “You may move to another place, but that does not mean that the environment of that new place will allow your cultural traditions to be sustained. Heartache has killed many people that have been displaced.”"
"The town of Fria in Guinea was built around bauxite mining in 1957. It used to have good facilities: water, electricity, schools, housing and hospitals. But since the last company mining there began to decrease activities in 2008 after the financial crisis and a fall in aluminium prices, the population has increasingly lived in poverty with high rates of unemployment. Families that used to provide for their extended families cannot today afford to care for the needs of their own children and immediate relatives.    In 2009 Julien Brygo, a French photojournalist, wrote:  Many of the benefits the locals used to enjoy are being lost. While accommodation remains free, the children’s nursery is closed, the swimming pool, athletics tracks and sports stadium have fallen into disrepair, water and electricity are now rationed. The Pechiney hospital, as the locals still call it, long recognised as the best in Guinea, is no longer regularly supplied with medicine. Russian parent company RUSAL finally closed the mine in 2012. The move left more than 1,000 permanent employees and 2,000 outsourced workers without pay. One resident spoke of a starving population who were “selling their property, their homes, and plots of land and even furniture to survive”.  Fria’s sad decline is because it is an “enclave”, a town built to respond to the needs of a refinery, run by a succession of companies before RUSAL took up operations 16 years ago. It is just one of an increasing number of makeshift towns built around rural mineral extraction sites in African countries including Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Sudan, and Nigeria, which are being driven by growing foreign investment in mining. These new urban developments are sustained, managed and controlled by the mining companies. And although the nature of these towns vary between countries and what is being mined, they all share some common characteristics. They are all administered by foreign companies in accordance with the norms of “home” states, such as the US, France and Australia, and mostly managed by foreign nationals – with heavy support from outside investment.  It means these enclaves develop economies that are totally disconnected from the wider realities of the host countries. And in the case of Fria, the danger is that when mining activities stop, the people living there are left in extreme poverty with no alternative livelihoods.  Despite slow economic growth in Guinea between 1958 and 2008, the mining sector is the largest contributor to the state’s export revenue and its most stable source of tax revenue. In 2008, Bauxite – the main source of the world’s aluminium accounted for about US$596m (40%) of the country’s total exports. Industrial mining activities provided about 22,000 direct full-time jobs and created over 50,000 indirect jobs.  And enclaves come with some advantages. In Guinea, for example, because high amounts of electricity are needed to extract alumina from bauxite, the enclaves benefit from 24/7 electricity. And although much of the highly skilled expertise is provided by expats from abroad, the mining sector still offers job opportunities to nationals, sometimes creating collaborations between mining companies and local education centres.  In Guinea, bauxite mining is the second-largest employer after the civil service. Then there are the jobs needed to run operations: drivers, technicians, engineers, cooks and security agents. And because many of those involved in operations are Western foreigners, the infrastructures are built to those standards and often health services are the best in the country.  In two other Guinean enclaves, Kamsar and Sangaredi, employees and their families live with 24/7 access to water and electricity, reliable healthcare, subsidised food, supermarkets, air conditioning, good schools, free housing, good roads and cultural spaces. Everything has been built to meet the standard of living expected by foreign expatriates. Though the state provides some security services and administrative officials, these staff, too, benefit from the lifestyle created.  But life in an enclave is totally different from that lived by the majority of Guineans outside of it. Less than 15 minutes’ drive away and you step outside the enclave bubble and into the realities experienced by the majority of Guineans. Much of the population faces poverty with no access to basic infrastructure such as water, electricity and health services. Life in the enclaves is what the majority of Guineans would like to see the mining sector provide to wider society.  There are some formal and informal economies that crop up just outside the mining enclaves, which enable at least some other Guineans to benefit from the mining sector. For instance, outside of Kamsar there is a large market created to meet the needs of the mine workers and their families and which draws in local entrepreneurs from elsewhere in Guinea who want to take advantage of the higher salaries linked to the enclaves.   But after 50 years of development of the extractive industry, Guinean society as a whole is yet to benefit significantly from the revenues of its mining sector. And worst of all, when mining activities stop, it is the general population who have never benefited from the mining who also end up with environmental damage such as land degradation and pollution. After the investment is gone, most of the services provided in the enclaves disappear as do the jobs. Towns like Kamsar and Sangaredi are still attractive now, but unless the government intervenes to make sure the rural economy is developed and unless mining revenues are more fully fed into the overall economy, these towns won’t contribute to sustainable development in Guinea. Talking to people in local communities near bauxite mining areas in Guinea, I found many expressed dissatisfaction about the division between those inside and outside the enclaves. It doesn’t help that in Guinea, in contrast to places like Sudan, Nigeria and Angola, mining activities happen in close proximity to local communities, meaning company transportation passes through local towns. Some have resorted to addressing mining companies directly with specific demands for the development of their towns in return for the stability of mining activities.  Between 2007 and 2012, for example, mining firm Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (CBG) (part-owned by the Guinean goverment), was the victim of several youth-led protests in Kamsar demanding more support to improve their livelihoods. Protests lead to the temporary disruption of mining activities which in turn can lead to lost revenue for the company. To avoid the disruption of their mining activities, CBG told me in 2014 that it had responded to the youth protests by implementing several community projects. One of these projects,  “Toutes Petites Entreprises” was created to promote, support and sponsor local youth led enterprises and to ensure that the CBG offers job opportunities to youth living in neighbouring local communities. These initiatives have contributed to improving the relationship between CBG and neighbouring communities. But more remains to be done in order to ensure that mining revenues benefit wider Guinean society.  In order to avoid further clashes with local communities, mining companies such as CBG urgently need to work together with the state to ensure that profits from mining benefit all. And to prevent mining companies leaving ghost towns like Fria, plans must be put in place to promote the kind of economic development that will sustain the population long after mining has finished."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAxel Bojanowski has written a piece at the online Spiegel titled “Madness of the Do-Gooders” where he reviews Hans von Storch’s and Werner Krauss’s new book: “Die Klimafalle” (The Climate Trap), which has harsh words for climate alarmism.
Many of the harsh words are aimed, not surprisingly, at Germany’s notoriously alarmist and catastrophe-obsessed Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), which is directed by Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber.
Bojanowski brings up many of the points that I brought up in an earlier post here, e.g. that the “climate debate has reached a dead-end“, that “the science is suffering from a credibility crisis“, and that some scientists like Schellnhuber have “taken on the role of prophets“.
Bojanowski adds other points, first reminding us that there is no consensus on the science and that opinions run across the board. He emphasizes that von Storch and Krauss do not want in any way to play down the seriousness of climate change: “Climate change is a serious problem“. Yes, that’s especially true if the world is preparing for the completely wrong scenario.
Bojanowski quotes von Storch and Krauss concerning the politics and science:
Climate science has been kidnapped by politicians who claim their decisions are already prescribed by science and therefore are without alternatives.”
Von Storch also calls the IPCC climate report a “joint production by science and politics.” Bojanowski adds: “Scientists have succumbed to the temptation of shaping policy“.

Von Storch makes one assertion I think needs to be responded to. He says he is in no way on the same side as the climate skeptics, and tends to label both sides of the debate as disgraceful. The problem here is the narrow fashion in which von Storch and Krauss view the debate to start with. They view it as non-believers vs devout believers, when in truth it’s a debate of many non-catastrophe believers vs a small group of fanatic catastrophists.
Indeed there are many luke-warmers who believe in greenhouse-gas warming among the “skeptics”. Many have no interests at all, except in finding the truth. Here von Storch and Krauss commit a huge disservice in throwing legitimate skeptics in the same bag with denier wingnuts.
On the subject of consensus, Bojanowski writes that reaching consensus is the duty of policymakers, and not scientists.
One of the main targets of von Storch’s and Krauss’s book is the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and the WBGU, which advises the German government on climate issues. The WBGU’s 9 members come solely from catastrophe-obsessed institutes, like the Potsdam Institute, and call for a rash, complete overhaul of the global economy in order to ward off a “dangerous climate change“. Von Storch and Krauss criticize this, rightfully claiming: “No grand global plan can bring about the solution.”
Bojanowski writes in the end that the advisers at the Potsdam Institute have made it very clear they will not comment on von Storch’s and Krauss’s critical book. “The PIK scientists recently published a comic book that explains the ‘Great Transformation’ to children – with the PIK advisers themselves as comic heroes.”
That sums it up nicely.

"Cornwall, on England’s south coast, is best known these days for surfing and sandcastles. But for centuries it was world famous for its tin and copper mines. Now, a recent discovery could see a mining boom in the county once again – and the whole UK should benefit. On January 19, the British company Cornish Lithium entered into an agreement with Canada’s Strongbow Exploration to explore and potentially develop lithium mining in Cornwall. This is just a first step and it may be years before any lithium comes on stream, but it’s worth taking a look ahead.    Lithium is a light and shiny silver metal with high conductivity which makes it ideal for use in products such as batteries. Since lithium has been the hottest commodity of the past year, a new domestic supply could help the UK become a global player in the burgeoning electric car market. While most commodities faced price declines over the past few years, lithium has been on the rise. Until late 2015, it hung around the $6,000 per tonne mark but it has since surged due to a rise in demand. By mid 2016, the price had more than tripled to over $20,000 per tonne. Demand for lithium is driven by the growth in electric vehicles and renewable energies, besides ongoing demand from ceramics and glass. The metal is a key ingredient in the Li-ion batteries needed to run new electric vehicles and consumer gadgets such as mobile phones, laptops and cameras. Chinese megacities are also getting serious about electric bikes, scooters and vehicles to combat air pollution, and Tesla’s order books for the recently announced Model 3 are swelling. Goldman Sachs expects 20.5m electric vehicles to be sold globally between now and 2025 – almost 10m more than it expected one year ago. The industry’s lithium consumption will increase fivefold.  Chemical companies that process raw materials for batteries will benefit, and so could the Cornish lithium miners, if they manage collaborations with such companies. However, the next few years are likely to be a preparation for this “take-off”, rather than a rapid scale up.  Things are more uncertain in the medium term – consumers may lack confidence in the next generation of electric vehicles, and car makers are likely to advertise more traditional models and lobby against new regulation until they are “ready-to-go”. Consequently, the lithium industry won’t enjoy much certainty – for now. However, the outlook is promising – speakers at a Goldman Sachs low carbon event stated that not even the changing US policy landscape under President Trump is likely to alter the core market forces driving the growth in electric vehicles. They forecast a transformative tech shift, with electric vehicles adding to the momentum in energy efficiency, solar PV and onshore wind.  But markets change fast and there is a huge risk of high-tech disruption and vulnerabilities as suppliers are manifold, often small, and conducive to risks of both finance and regulation. Changes in the supply chains will affect many automotive suppliers, the chemical and oil industries, and potentially the steel industry, too. With headwinds expected from China, Japan and other countries, companies will have to accelerate efforts to access these markets, and stretch out to new miners and suppliers across the world. But a robust industrial strategy across all these sectors should benefit Cornwall and the UK. While lithium may be a crucial ingredient in these batteries, the good news is that it only makes up a small share (around 3%) of production costs. Even if prices continue to be volatile – a consequence of rapid development in risky regions and sectors – it shouldn’t affect batteries too much. Lithium is usually extracted from brine (salty water) found in salt flats. The process involves using large amounts of water and chemicals, with severe consequences for these sensitive ecosystems.  Miners in Cornwall hope to produce lithium from hot spring brines while using geothermal energy extracted from these springs, which could drive processing costs down. But the project will not be without risks, including the possibility that radioactive radon could be released from granite. Also lithium recycling is not (yet) feasible, but recovering other materials from batteries such as magnesium, mercury and zinc may well trigger recycling efforts.  Cornish Lithium must now begin the crucial task of getting local people and other stakeholders on board – what’s known as a social license to operate. Cornwall already benefits from a thriving tourist industry. However, its centuries-long history as a mining region means it may well cope with the associated challenges. It has the potential to become a wellspring of new industrial activity, and Britain’s first lithium boom."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen you look at what’s going on in some of the world’s leading democracies today, with some institutions running rampantly out of control without oversight, we should not wonder why people in droves are losing faith and trust in government.
Government issues pamphlet identifying enemy skeptics
The latest example comes from the powerful German Ministry for Environment: Umweltbundesamt (UBA) with the release of its latest 123-page pamphlet titled: Und sie erwärmt sich doch…Was steckt hinter der Debatte um den Klimawandel (It is indeed warming…What’s behind the climate change debate?). In the brochure the UBA (Germany’s equivalent of the EPA) insists the climate catastrophe is coming, and appeals to the public not to listen to skeptics.
In fact, the German government pamphlet specifically singles out, identifies and targets US and German skeptics, portraying them as “spreaders of half-truths and misinformation“. Welcome to open and tolerant debate in the Federal Republic of Germany!
You’ll recall that the UBA are the ones who recently admitted being baffled by the 15-year global temperature stagnation that has taken hold.
Government makes it clear: climate debate not welcome!
Reading the pamphlet, it is clear that this is a one-sided, catastrophe-obsessed propaganda piece that advocates completely the alarmist side of the debate and outright dismisses and marginalizes the growing non-alarmist side. The pamphlet is truly a disservice to the German taxpayers and a mass deception of the public. The Greens and the Ministry of Environment, as you will see, are brazenly targeting specific individuals and organisations whose only “crime” is having a differing opinion. Skeptics are being viewed as a threat.
I can’t imagine how intimidated those named in the pamphlet (especially the German skeptics) must feel today. The full power of the German government has them in its sights.
Only alarmists are cited as honest sources
Just a look at the references cited at the back of the pamphlet on page 116 already tells the story. Sources cited include radical environmental groups Germanwatch, Greenpeace and klimaretter.de, ultra-alarmist institutes like the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and dogmatic outlier scientists like Stefan Rahmstorf, Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, and Naomi Oreskes, just to name a few.
UBA has black list of American skeptics
According to the UBA, all the climate doubt stems mainly from the USA. Beginning on page 100, the UBA lists the Americans responsible for “spreading doubt and false information“, among them: ExxonMobil, Fred Singer, Sallie Baliunas and Willie Soon, Frederick Seitz, Joe Barton, Pat Michaels, John Christy, Ross McKitrick and the Heartland Institute. The UBA cites the Union of Concerned Scientists and a one-sided Die Zeit smear from November 2012 as its reliable sources for this information.
The name “Rahmstorf” appears throughout the pamphlet. One quickly gets the impression that the pamphlet stems from the German Ministry of Rahmstorf. Little wonder that when taken as a whole, the pamphlet is a huge public deception. Then again, misleading the public is nothing new for Professor Rahmstorf, for German readers: http://www.klimastorch.de/rahmstorf-vs.meichsner.pdf.

On page 106, the UBA claims that the Climategate e-mails “were stolen”, as if by criminals.
The UBA endorses RealClimate.org
On page 116, the UBA tells readers what it feels are reliable information sources of information on climate science. The German Ministry of Rahmstorf , of course, suggests Stefan Rahmstorf, who is “an international renown climate scientist who is often featured in up-to-date books, newspapers and television shows” against the “climate skeptical half truths and false reports“. The UBA also recommends Rahmstorf’s Internetblog Klima-Lounge and the Potsdam Institute.
Moreover, the UBA recommends the site of “a group of 11 American and European scientists, among them Stefan Rahmstorf and Michael Mann, RealClimate”. The UBA also suggests alarmist site Klimaretter.Info as a good source of all sorts of information.
Government black list of German skeptics
The UBA also tells us to whom not to go for information (the bad guys) and publicizes a sort of black list of skeptics. On page 110 it lists the “climate change skeptics in Germany“, which include the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning, journalists and publicists Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch, film-maker and publicist Günter Ederer, and newspaper Die Welt.
In government’s view, skeptics are crackpots
In a nutshell, here we have the German government informing the public which people to be on the look-out for. If this holds up legally, remains to be seen. It is not the job of the government to tell the public who the goods guys and bad guys are in a public debate.
In its closing statements, the UBA pamphlet writes (p. 113) that:
– Parts of industry are financing campaigns to spread doubt and a false information over the results of climate science; the target is to fool the public;
– Often scientists of foreign disciplines and without any knowledge of climate science appear in public with climate-skeptical claims.”
In the UBA’s view, those who publicly doubt the coming climate catastrophe are to be viewed as crackpots and industry hacks, and are thus to be ignored. The pamphlet reads like a declaration of war. I have a feeling that we have not heard the last of this story.
More tomorrow.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSaturday I posted about a recently published study by He YuXin et al, which happened to catch the watchful eye of Sebastian Lüning of kaltesonne.de/. Lüning comments on what the paper means for Michael Mann:
=================================================
Medieval warmth at the northern Tibetan Plateau casts doubt on Michael Mann’s temperature map 
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning
In 2009 the inventor of the renowned hockey stick graph Michael Mann and his colleagues published a paper in the journal Science where they attempted to refute the global significance of the Medieval Warm Period. The idea behind the paper was to show that the warmth in some areas was offset by cold in other parts of the world. To show this the authors searched out places that were colder than normal 1000 years ago.
The problem was the Atlantic region, which had an excellent amount of data to support the Medieval warmth. Here the temperatures stood at least at today’s levels. Therefore Michael Mann searched around for other regions where far less data was available and found the Central Eurasian region would do just fine. The scarcity of available data left lots of room for interpretation. This is how the authors plotted a huge region of cold over a large swath of Central Eurasia during the Medieval Warm Period, which supposedly offset the inconvenient Atlantic warmth.

Figure 1: Temperature anomalies during the Medieval Warm Period 1000 years ago as to Mann et al. (2009). In Central Eurasia the authors interpreted a pronounced cold zone.
A Chinese team of scientists led by He YuXin of the University of Hong Kong, however, took a very close look at Mann’s liberally interpreted data and his postulated Central Eurasian cold zone. Using sediment cores extracted from two different lakes and using the so-called alkenone method, the Chinese scientists reconstructed the temperature development over the past 2000 years for the northern Tibetan Plateau, which according to Mann was significantly colder 1000 years ago.

The surprise was big when the new, hard data showed the opposite was in fact true. It turns out that the region of the theoretical cold in the northern Tibetan Plateau during the Medieval Warm Period was indeed not colder but was warmer than today, see Science Bulletin.
In their paper, YuXin and his colleagues made yet another interesting discovery. In the abstract they write: ‘Further, our temperature reconstructions, within age uncertainty, can be well correlated with solar irradiance changes, suggesting a possible link between solar forcing and natural climate variability, at least on the northern Tibetan Plateau.’
The surprisingly good synchronicity between sun and climate in the region of study is clearly visible from the study’s chart:

"For thousands of years humans turned to nature to cure and soothe their ills. Modern science built on these ancient foundations and the “natural product discovery” programmes established by pharmaceutical companies provided us with medicines that could treat cancer, infections and more. But discovering medicines found in nature is far from straightforward. It’s hard enough to gather sufficient numbers of the useful organism, whether that be a tree root or a venomous snake, and it’s even harder to isolate the exact medicinal compound and then produce it in large quantities. With all these stumbling blocks it’s no surprise that pharmaceutical companies shifted their focus from nature to the laboratory and began designing compounds from scratch, huge numbers of which could then be screened for promising activity. From the 1990s onwards the pharmaceutical companies duly terminated their nature discovery programmes and the huge collections of screening extracts they amassed were sold or disbanded. Recent developments in genetics have prompted a shift back towards natural products, however. Scientists can now mine an organism’s entire DNA to search for useful compounds, and it is becoming increasingly evident that we have barely scratched the surface of nature’s molecular diversity, which has been honed by more than three billion years of trial and error. There are many more drugs still undiscovered, lurking within plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. This realisation, and looming health crises like the rise of antibiotic resistance, has renewed interest in the search for useful compounds in nature – known as bioprospecting. Most nature-derived medicines today are sourced from plants, fungi and bacteria. Those medicines that have been extracted from animals have largely come from just a few sources: venomous vertebrates like the gila monster lizard or jararaca snakes, leech saliva, or the venoms and secretions of organisms like sponges or molluscs. But animals are incredibly diverse, and we’ve barely tapped into the potential pharmaceutical use of the most diverse group of all – insects. Insects occupy every conceivable terrestrial and freshwater niche on Earth. Consequently, they have a bewildering array of interactions with other organisms, which has meant they’ve evolved an enormous variety of compounds to protect themselves or for preying on others. Of the tiny proportion of insects that have been investigated, several interesting compounds have been identified. For example, alloferon, an antimicrobial compound produced by blow fly larvae, is used as an antiviral and antitumour agent in South Korea and Russia. The larvae of a few other insect species are being investigated for potent antimicrobials. Beyond flies, a compound sourced from the venom of the wasp Polybia paulista can kill cancer cells without harming normal cells. So why is it that bioprospectors have paid relatively little attention to insects? The sheer variety is partly to blame – with many millions of species to search through, finding a useful insect is like looking for a needle in a haystack. And though we consider insects to be everywhere, the reality of this ubiquity is vast numbers of a few extremely common species. Most insects are hard to find and very difficult to rear in captivity.  And even when a useful species has been identified and reared successfully, it’s still incredibly difficult to obtain sufficient quantities of the relevant material. Insects are generally very small and the glands inside them that secrete interesting, potentially useful compounds are smaller still. The good news is that we can overcome some of these difficulties by using knowledge of natural history to target our efforts. Myself and David Wilcockson at Aberystwyth University term this approach “ecology-led drug discovery”.  Many insects advertise the production of potentially useful compounds in the way in which they live and where they live. Some produce potent, complex venom for subduing prey and keeping it fresh for their offspring. Others are masters at exploiting filthy micro-habitats, such as faeces and carcasses, where they are regularly challenged by myriad micro-organisms. The insects in both these examples have a battery of antimicrobial compounds to deal with pathogenic bacteria and fungi which could potentially serve as or inspire new antibiotics for humans. Although natural history knowledge points us in the right direction it doesn’t solve the problems associated with the small size of insects and the tiny quantities of interesting compounds they produce. Fortunately, it is now possible to identify and then snip out the stretches of the insect’s DNA that carry the codes for the interesting compounds and insert them into cell lines that allow larger quantities to be produced.  As much as I’d dearly love to help develop a blockbuster insect-derived medicine, my main motivation for looking at insects in this way is conservation – I want drugs from bugs to generate funds for basic exploration, species discovery and natural history. All species, however small and seemingly insignificant, have a right to exist for their own sake, but this sentiment lacks the political clout needed to fight for the urgent preservation of nature. We need something more tangible, something that is directly relevant to people, and you would be hard pressed to find anything that is held so dear as health. If we can shine a light on the darker recesses of nature’s medicine cabinet, exploring the useful chemistry of the most diverse animals on the planet, I believe we can make people think differently about the value of nature."
"The groundhog has evolved into a winning combination of cute and ungainly. This burrowing squirrel may resemble a furry cube with a leg at each corner, but do not be deceived by its bumbling, hapless charms: this is a Nostradamus of the animal world. In North American folklore, the groundhog can apparently be used to foresee the future, as many a town in the US and Canada will vouch on February 2 as they celebrate Groundhog Day. Groundhogs are great diggers and spend much of their time hunkered down in their burrows – understandably since they feature in far too many food webs. They’re among nature’s “true hibernators”, and become fully dormant for much of the winter. This period, so the story goes, is broken on February 2 when they emerge from their burrows. For the human celebrants of Groundhog Day, everything depends on whether the animal is spooked by its own shadow. If it is cloudy, the hogs stay out and about and spring will come early. But if the sun shines brightly and the groundhogs catch sight of their own shadow, they flee back underground, and winter will apparently return for another six grim weeks of ice and rain.  Some groundhogs really do wake up from hibernation in early February, while the weather is still very cold, before going back to bed until March. However, this has nothing to do with scary shadows.  Their early emergence is primarily down to males checking out the whereabouts of neighbouring females with an eye towards amorous opportunities later in the spring. Given this, jumping back into your burrow at the slightest hog-shaped silhouette might not be the best reproductive strategy.  In some European traditions, the weather on February 2 has a similar significance, but without the groundhogs. In the north of America, the hogs are essential, perhaps an evolution of Germanic folklore imported by immigrants who became the Pennsylvania Dutch (from the German: Deutsch). The custom spread, and today many towns have annual ceremonies.  There are even celebrity groundhogs, with their own entourage of handlers. After all that time underground, you might expect a dazzled groundhog would be spooked by anything, especially a fan club of oddly dressed town elders. Meanwhile “Groundhog Day” has entered the popular lexicon in the wake of the 1993 film of the same name in which a pompous weather forecaster arrives in town to deride the locals’ affection for their fortune-telling rodents, only to find himself trapped in a time loop, the day repeating itself until he is redeemed by love. Further south in the US, a menagerie of other species has acquired this remarkable gift of prescience, including coypu and crayfish. However, among planet Earth’s fortune telling fauna the groundhogs’ weather forecasting is tame. The US National Centre for Environmental Information has investigated Punxsutawney Phil, the most famous groundhog of all, and found his forecasts show “no predictive skill”.  In recent years, the football futurology talents of Paul the octopus has attracted particular acclaim. Paul, who lived in a Sea Life Centre in Germany, correctly predicted four of six matches in Euro 2008, then seven of seven in 2010. Statisticians were consulted and, understandably, weren’t sure what to make of this, probably because all the octopuses that were not so on the ball were not being recorded.  After Paul’s death, an imitator, Otto, tackled not only football but eventually the UK’s Brexit referendum. Sadly, her football punditry proved poor and her career ended with a whole-hearted, or, more precisely for an octopus, whole-three-hearted, prediction of a victory for Remain. Maybe we’re better off sticking with groundhog forecasts."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot surprisingly Dana Nuccitelli of SkepticalScience.com obstinately refuses to see the facts, even when they are staring him right in the face. Richard Tol at Twitter has thrown the now notorious John Cook survey, of which Nuccitelli was a co-author, into the dustbin of history.
Here’s the exchange between the two:

 
Tol’s last comment pretty much sums up the quality Cook’s and Nuccitelli’s work. I could say every day last year in my hometown was over 25°C (if I ignore 320 of them and misclassify a quarter of the 45 I did count).
Dana Nuccitelli is becoming a real asset for the skeptics, one that we certainly don’t want to lose.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast week, the German Federal Umweltbundesamt (UBA), Germany’s version of the EPA, issued a one-sided alarmist pamphlet that attempts to declare the climate debate over and attacks prominent skeptics.

Controversial 123-page pamphlet…in it the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) declares climate debate over and names and portrays skeptics as “spreaders of half-truths and misinformation”.
In the pamphlet, he German government UBA specifically singles out, identifies, targets and attacks US and German skeptics, thus sparking outrage.
Some of the Americans targeted include scientists Fred Singer, Sallie Baliunas, Willie Soon, Frederick Seitz, Pat Michaels, John Christy, Ross McKitrick and conservative think-tank Heartland Institute. The German targets include European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Fritz Vahrenholt, and Sebastian Lüning, as well as journalists and publicists Dirk Maxeiner and Michael Miersch, and film-maker / publicist Günter Ederer, and national newspaper Die Welt.
Today flagship daily Die Welt has a commentary by law professor Thorsten Koch titled: “State Propaganda – The Federal Environment Agency violates the rules of neutrality”.

In his commentary Koch writes:
The pamphlet is a product of official state action in which in one sense the claims that contradict the ‘scientific consensus’ made by ‘climate change skeptics’ (p. 110) are polemicized. Even the ZDF public television website ‘heute.de’ diagnosed it as ‘official state defamation’. This makes the matter legally questionable.”
Koch then explains that the government is allowed to participate and take a position on the climate issue, but adds:
Strange however that a government office is attempting to bindingly specify the state of knowledge in a scientific question. That is the job of a scientist. Even more it is neither scientifically or legally appropriate if scientific truths – and thus ultimately only the current state of the error – are announced with official authority.
Deciding scientific controversies is no duty of the state. The attempt we have here by the Environment Agency to decide a scientific controversy is in this form unique.”

And we may also add that it is also not the duty of a handful of scientists to decide political controversies…at least not in democratic societies.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOther than NASA GISS, few institutes are as climate warming-obsessed as the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). To keep the global warming fear machine up and running in the future, it looks like the PIK is expanding its facilities (warning: at this PIK link there’s an atrocious translation to English).

Hello? Anybody here? Warmist PIK’s new facility construction shut down by snow and cold! Photo source: pik-webcam.
However, it’s obvious from the above photo that construction of its new global warming facilities have been stopped – because of bitter cold!
The photo taken this morning by the PIK webcam doesn’t show any construction activity at all happening on the site. It has been shut down by the unusual late-March bitter cold and snow, which according to PIK’s own climate models, were supposed to be a thing of the past.
And that isn’t about to change anytime soon as the forecast for the days ahead doesn’t look good: -13°C over the weekend! This means no work until at least after Easter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning’s and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt’s Die kalte Sonne website talks about the latest study on Antarctic ice. Remember that we keep hearing that the next IPCC report will be even scarier than the last one of 2007.
========================
Antarctic Ice Sheet Indeed Melting Slower Than Originally Thought
By Fritz Vahrenholt and Sebastian Lüning (translated, edited by P Gosselin)
We often read that the ice caps are melting faster than ever and that sea level rise has accelerated over the last decades. It is feared that sea level could be 2 mters higher by the year 2100. It is true that a majority of water stored on land as ice is located in the Antarctic ice sheet. If it melted completely, sea level would rise 60-65 m.
Luckily today we have satellites to permanently monitor the ice caps on Earth. And so far over the years, we have collected a good amount of data. Indeed it is only necessary to measure in detail the height of the ice cap over the continent and then automatically compute an ice volume. From the change, one could then calculate the melt rate.
But things aren’t quite that easy. When the last ice age ended 12,000 years ago, part of the Antarctic ice thawed. This reduced the load on the continent and thus allowed it to rise like an unloaded cargo ship – a process that is still taking place today. This is called glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). This value itself is not easy to determine. The uncertainty here is estimated to be 50-150 billion tons per year (gigatons/year). That’s no chicken feed – especially if you consider that the melt rate assumed so far is only 26 gigatons per year. Here we see that the uncertainty is multiple times more than the actual data signal itself. That hardly induces much confidence in the results.
An international research team led by Erik Ivins of the Jet Propulsion Lab of Pasadena, California has taken a closer look at the GIA-correction and has reworked the data. They just recently published the results in the Journal of Geophysical Research. Based on data of the last decade, they’ve determined that the Antarctic ice melt represents in the worst case an amount of o.16 mm/year in terms of global sea level rise. That is signficantly less than what the IPCC proposed in its 2007 climate report. Back then the IPCC propoosed a sea level rise contribution by Antarctica in the worst case of 0.56 mm per year, see Table SPM1 of IPCC AR4).

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his klimazwiebel.blog here, Professor Hans von Storch posted an interview conducted with German Weather Service (DWD) press spokesman Gerhard Lux that had appeared earlier in the Offenbacher Post.

Arctic, public domain photo – NASA.
The interview focused on the new hypothesis put out by some scientists now claiming that the cold winters are caused by global warming, i.e. a warm Arctic is disrupting northern hemispheric weather patterns and thus causing cold winters in Europe and elsewhere.
Here’s what von Storch had to say about that hypothesis:
An interesting aspect that demonstrates the difficulty in which climate science now finds itself is that here a hypothesis was formulated (Arctic ice deficit, subsequent winter anomaly) that ends up being a possible explanation in a model experiment. But here it cannot be concluded that this is the only or even the dominant explanation. What’s next is falsification of the suggestion using forthcoming observations to see whether the explanation is robust, or whether maybe indeed other explanations are more effective (e.g.: stochastic climate fluctuations). This is actually a normal process in science, and the fact that the explanation came afterwards, and was not searched and found before the occurrence of the phenomenon, is just more reason for doubt.”
Other experts also doubt (or outright dismiss) the hypothesis:
1. Veteran meteorologist Klaus-Eckard Puls:
This is an embarrassing calamity for German climate alarmists, who 2 years ago began concocting a meteorologically adventurous hypothesis in an attempt to save face. […] The climate models had predicted nothing of the sort.
Proof that winter weather in one region can be derived from the earlier summertime weather of another region has yet to be found by the generations of meteorology! If it were the case, the problems of longer-term seasonal forecasts would finally be solved.
To this day there is no correlation whatsoever between NAO with CO2.
Our winter weather is still always made in the winter, and there is absolutely no evidence for claims to the contrary!
This completely contradicts meteorological and textbook knowledge: High pressure systems are not created above warm water – low pressure systems are.”
2. Gerhard Müller-Westermeier of the German Weather Service (DWS) in January 2010 found the British claim (warming Arctic leading to reduced pressure difference between Iceland and the Azores) to be “very adventurous”:
We’ve had mainly mild winters in  which single cold months have been widely scattered, like 2009. This winter [2010] is an cold outlier that doesn’t change anything in the overall picture. In general it’s going to get warmer, also in the winter.”
This appears to be about an earlier variant of the theory.
3. Prof. Jochem Marotzke, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (Jan 2010) on the above variant:
They got caught in a classic trap. They are only looking at one factor from the many that determine our climate. For higher air layers, at about 8 km in altitude, we expect that the atmosphere over the tropics will warm more quickly than over the Arctic. That would increase the temperature difference. Moreover the greenhouse effect will overlap the changes in air pressure difference.”

Notice all the contradictions popping up already.
4. Veteran meteorologist Thomas Globig:
I’ve been hearing from some media that it’s all because of the ice melt in the Arctic. That is when the Arctic gets warmer, here it gets colder. Naturally that’s all nonsense! Back then [in 1853] there was no large summer ice melt in the Arctic. Therefore the whole thing has nothing to do with a trend. It is simply just plain weather!”
5. Andreas Friedrich, German Weather Service DWD says in the daily NZ of 8 April 2013, p.7, that there’s no seasonal relationship to be found in weather:
Meteorologists are arguing over the supposed relationship between March cold and July heat. […]  A cold spring is no sign for a hot summer. There’s no relationship; the weather does not have a memory. […] That a cold March – and Match 2013 in Germany was much too cold – allows us to draw the conclusion of a hot summer is refuted by the data of the past years. […] There’s no relationship; it’s all completely coincidental.”
Here Friedrich is talking about spring dictating summer – reminding us that one season’s weather does not dictate the weather of the following season, let alone the season after that!
6. German Weather Service (DWD) press release, 12 April 2013:
Also according to the estimation of the National Weather Service it cannot be conclusively judged whether these research results indeed will be true. The Earth’s climate is a complex system of feedbacks and an exact forecast of its behavior is possible only with great difficulty.
Notice how the German Weather Service press release ignored von Storch’s comments I quoted above. They just left them out.
7. Thomas Stocker, IPCC lead scientist. Weltwoche, No. 15.13, p. 36-40, on the Arctic warming/cold winter explanation:

That’s the statement of one or two publications, but still no scientific consensus. Building a consensus is a tough job. At the IPCC we simply just cannot take in every single study from all the institutes worldwide. It’s possible there will be a statement on this in the coming report, i.e. how the Arctic ice cover influences the statistics of high pressure regions. But for now we are still working on it.”

We wish Stocker lots of luck getting a consensus on that one. (Models aren’t going to cut it).
8. Even Gerstengarbe, one of the study’s authors, expresses doubt!
The studies of this development are ongoing, and so at the moment no conclusions can be made on whether or not Central Europe will have the ‘pleasure’ of cold easterly winds more frequently.”
The media just forgot to mention Gerstengarbe’s little disclaimer clause.
To sum up, the “warm-causes-cold” scientists remind me of the alcoholic who claims his hangovers are due to his leather allergy: Every time he wakes up with his shoes on, he has a big headache!
But the warm Arctic theory is far worse because there’s a correlation only for a couple of years. We can see that the IPCC scientists are setting themselves up to look like complete asses once more.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust be patient. The warming is really coming. It’s just going to take a little longer than we first thought.
After David Viner had made his now famous “Snowfalls are now just a thing of the past” claim in 2000, the always publicity-seeking Prof. Mojib Latif of Germany’s Max Planck Institute made sure to get in on the act, telling Spiegel only days later: “There aren’t going to be winters with strong frosts and lots of snow at our latitudes anymore, like 20 years ago.”
Today, as Germany reels from its 5th colder-than-normal winter in a row (a record), Latif’s words are sounding cavernously hollow. As a result, Germany’s fundamentalist warmist, catastrophe-obsessed blog site klimaretter.de (climate rescuers) has gone into the damage-control mode, and has conducted an interview with the Prof. Latif in order to re-convince the public that the threat is still out there, is real and that we must remain afraid.

Latif is a meteorologist and climate scientist at the Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Kiel (Geomar). He’s also a top IPCC scientist. Photo credit: Björn Láczay from Moosburg, Germany. Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license.
Latif: Warming has been small so far
In the interview Latif claims that people have simply forgotten what a winter really looks like, and that’s why snow makes us think the winter is harsh.  He tells us that also in times of global warming there can be real winters. “The warming so far with 0.7 to 0.8 on a global average is still small.” The natural climate fluctuations can still have their full impacts. “Still small”? Before they told us that kind of warming was “unprecedented”.
Latif now postpones warm winters by up to 100 years!
When asked about his David Viner-like comment made to Spiegel in 2000, Latif is forced to amend it, saying: “Indeed there won’t be any more cold winters in 2050 or 2100, if the mean temperatures are several degrees higher.” There we have it: Warm winters suddenly postponed 50 – 100 years.

Latif: Recent cold winters are just weather
When asked to explain what is behind the unexpected, recent harsh winters, Latif tells klimaretter that there are currently 2 explanations: 1) The Arctic ice melt may be changing the atmospheric currents, or 2) changes to currents in the stratosphere. Latif then seems to go on and dismiss both of these explanations, offering his own: “My hypothesis is: The cause is the completely normal chaos of the weather.”
Latif: Warming has stopped but is taking place “in the background”
Ooooh, we’re so scared. Latif acknowledges that warming has stopped over the last 15 years, but labels the conclusion that the AGW theory is therefore wrong as “nonsense”. The recent temperature stagnation “is not in contradiction to global warming“, and cites natural fluctuations that “can have an impact for decades“. He insists that “warming is still taking place in the background“.
Latif: Accelerated warming is just around the next corner!
In the interview, Latif claims that once the natural and man-made causes start complimenting each other, global temperatures will take off again. “The current stagnation means everything but calling off the alarm.”
Now IPCC scientists are telling us that the big bad warming is still out there, that we still need to be very afraid, but that it’s only postponed…maybe up to 100 years… But it’s out there!
This all reminds me of a scene in the 1986 movie “Stand By Me” (one of my favorites) where scaredy-cat Vern is guarding the camp, scared crapless of a cricket (at 10:12).

"It looks like Donald Trump’s “great, great wall” is actually going to happen. Its likely impact on human society has been well-noted, but in the longer-term a barrier across an entire continent will also have severe ecological consequences.  The US-Mexico border is around 1,900 miles (3,100 km) long and some of it has already been fenced off. According to Trump the proposed wall will cover approximately 1,000 miles and “natural obstacles” such as rivers or mountains will take care of the rest. Aside from the debates over whether or not the wall will do much to stop drug trafficking or illegal immigration, how much it will cost the US taxpayer, or whether Mexico will pay for it, a 1,000-mile wall has significant environmental costs. For a start, all that concrete will generate millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions. And then you have the fact the wall will ravage a unique desert habitat that straddles the two countries and will prevent the movement of local animals.  US Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) has estimated that the wall will threaten 111 endangered species as it passes through four key wildlife reserves on the US side of the border and several nature reserves on the Mexican side. Some of the affected species are obvious: animals with cross-border populations include bighorn sheep, ocelots and bears. Splitting plant and animal populations by building a concrete wall promotes inbreeding and a decrease in genetic diversity, which makes many species susceptible to diseases and epidemics. The wall is also likely to wipe out the few jaguars still lingering in Arizona and New Mexico by cutting them off from breeding populations south of the border. Other species are more unexpected: the bald eagle, America’s national bird, can obviously fly over any barriers yet the disruption to its habitat means it makes the FWS’s list of affected migratory birds. Even marine animals such as manatees or sea turtles can’t escape the wall’s impact. The Trump wall may never become anything more solid than a metaphor for increased border surveillance, aided by technology, to keep illegal immigration under control. However, if a vast concrete wall really is built, and if it is as tall and impenetrable as Trump hopes, it will presumably last for thousands of years. This will have long-term ecological consequences.  The glacial and interglacial cycles of ice ages and warm periods unfold over thousands of years. Over the past 11,000 years we have had a relatively stable climate, but anthropogenic warming is delaying the arrival of the next ice age.  As species start to feel the pressure of a warming climate, they will need to move towards the poles as their habitats shift. Plants and animals currently found in central Mexico may find their “natural” home moves north of the border. The wall will make such movement impossible and will make these species vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Equally, in the much longer term, if or when the next ice age eventually begins and ice sheets start to expand southwards, species from the north of the wall will need to move south to escape the freezing temperatures. The Trump wall will pose a significant obstacle for such movements.  On evolutionary timescales of millions of years, such an obstacle in the movement of animals and plants will drive extinctions and the emergence of new species. A political act of this kind can have far-reaching consequences for the ecological and even evolutionary landscapes. Preexisting security barriers across the US-Mexico border are already making life difficult for local wildlife, according to peer-reviewed research. Scientists across the world consistently call for more permeable border fences in order to allow animals to move through them. One 2011 study even looked specifically at the US-Mexico border. The authors warned species were being forced into risky unfenced “bottlenecks” and called for better planning tailored towards wildlife movement. Our knowledge of how to conserve animals across international borders has come a long way. Many nations have embraced shared responsibility for shared wildlife, and a number of international legal instruments also set out the “dos and don'ts” for conservation in transboundary regions. If Trump really wants to show his prowess in construction, and wants to leave a long-term infrastructure legacy, then he should build bridges for wildlife on the US-Mexico border – not walls."
"UK backing for a World Bank fund to help poor countries will hinge on reforms at the global institution to channel more money into tackling the climate crisis, improving gender equality and ensuring vulnerable countries can pay their debts. Speaking in Washington, the international development secretary, Alok Sharma, said the size of the UK’s contribution to the Bank’s concessional loan facility for the world’s least-developed countries would depend on a more focused anti-poverty approach. The Bank is currently seeking contributions from rich countries for the 19th replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA 19), which provides soft loans and grants for countries in financial difficulty. Britain is one of the few countries to meet the United Nations target for spending 0.7% of national income on development assistance, and the size of the aid budget meant it was the biggest single donor to IDA 18, a three-year $75bn (£58bn) round of funding which expires in 2020. Sharma, with the Bank keen to raise even more money for IDA 19, made it clear he intended to use the UK’s leverage to secure change. In a meeting with Malpass at the Bank’s annual meeting in Washington, Sharma said action was needed to: Increase the Bank’s financial support to tackle the climate crisis, including helping the most vulnerable communities to become more resilient and preparing for potential natural disasters Preserve biodiversity and invest in innovative nature-based solutions such as reforestation Focus on mobilising private-sector investment for the poorest countries – and making a priority of green, quality infrastructure projects that form the backbone of economic growth Bring about improved debt transparency and sustainability, through balancing the need for finance with limits on how much governments are borrowing from different sources before the International Development Association agrees more loans Provide extra money and an increase in World Bank staff based in fragile and conflict-stricken countries Improve rights of women and girls through increasing access to safe family planning services, ensuring girls can go to school and stronger laws against gender-based violence. Sharma said: “The UK is leading the way to build sustainable economies. It is my ambition that within 10 years our partner countries will raise 10 times more resource through private-sector investment and their own tax revenues than they receive in UK aid. “To help meet this challenge, the World Bank must prioritise fighting climate change, investing in quality infrastructure, improving the rights of women and girls and giving a lifeline to people living in conflict zones.” A World Bank spokesman said: “We are always grateful for the United Kingdom’s support of IDA. The proposed policy package in IDA 19 will direct more funding toward people in fragile and conflict-affected situations, and will reaffirm our commitment to projects that benefit the climate and promote greater inclusion, for example on gender and persons with disabilities.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the SciLogs website, Stefan Rahmstorf of the über-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research presents Part III of his Mann-hockey-stick-resurrection series.
Here he explains to his German readers how the temperature really developed over the Holocene and why the 20th century is “unique”.
To do this, Rahmstorf uses the findings of the already refuted Shaun Marcott et al paper, reminding us that Marcott et al “tried out 20 different averaging methods and carried out 1000 Monte Carlo-simulations ” in order “to confirm the robustness of their results“. Rahmstorf writes:
To put the main results in a nutshell, it appears as follows:

Fig. 1. Blue curve: global temperature reconstruction from proxy data from Marcott et al., Science 2013. Shown is the RegEM version – noteworthy differences between the variants with different averaging methods appear only at the end, where the number of proxy series decreases, but where the temperature course is well-known from the instrumental measurements. Red curve: global temperature for (HadCRU). Graphic: Klaus Bittermann.”
Next Rahmstorf explains how there had been a long term general cooling over 5000 years, and that that this was interrupted suddenly by a skyrocketing warming over the last 100 years, a warming that completely cancelled all the cooling that had taken 5000 years to accomplish.
Rahmstorf then compares the Marcott reconstruction to the PAGES 2k reconstruction, as shown in his Fig. 3:


Fig. 3. The last two thousand years taken from Fig. 1 compared to the PAGES reconstruction (green), which is explained in Part 1. Graphic: Klaus Bittermann.”
On Fig. 3 Rahmstorf comments:
What we see is that both reconstructions produce consistent results. The course of the last 1000 years is practically identical and is, by the way, one more confirmation of the ‘hockey stick’ from Mann et al. 1999 – see part 2 of this series, The hockey stick debate.”
So now in Rahmstorf’s mind, the hockey stick is back to life (again).

Next Rahmstorf asks if the modern warming is unique, and explains the methodology used for the 20th century temperature reconstruction:
Because of the mentioned limitations of sediment cores, the new temperature reconstruction does not extend to the present, rather only until 1940, and the number of data curves used decreases significantly before that. (Therefore the shown range of uncertainty becomes increasingly wider near the end and reconstructions with various averaging methods diverge here – here we show the RegEM method because it works the best with the decreasing data coverage – see the blog from Grant Foster for more details, who is a professional statistician). The warming of the 20th century is therefore only captured to some extent, which is not a big problem because the warming is optimally documented by weather stations. There’s no doubt about the climate development of the 20th century.”
True there is no doubt about the 20th century. All the doubt surrounds the reconstructions over the course of the Holocene, and there’s very much in dispute. Moreover, splicing datasets coming from totally different measurement methods is dubious in the least, and is thus nothing less than creative curve designing. On the splicing, Rahmstorf comments.
There is a certain amount of room for play on how one splices the proxy data (blue) to the thermometer data (red) – Here I made it so that the mean value of the Marcott curve is the same as the mean value of the PAGES 2k reconstruction for the time period of 1000 to 1940 AD.”
Rahmstorf does admit that there are problems with the Marcott paper, yet feels that in principle it is correct and that the 20th century warming is unique, citing three reasons: 1) other proxies have never shown a warming like that seen in the 20th century during the entire Holocene, 2) statistics expert Grant Foster says so, and 3) such a rash warming must have physical reasons, and thus would have to disappear just as quickly.
Rahmstorf summarizes by saying that although the Marcott curve can be improved on, he believes that the course of the curve is “for the most part correct” and claims that a gradual cooling over the last several thousand years was abruptly interrupted in the 20th century.
To drive the point across to his readers, Rahmstorf then reaches ever deeper into his creative curve-designing toolbox and next splices on a scenario produced by model projections that use the worst-case climate-sensitivities (which have been shown to have been completely exaggerated) to the already dubiously diced and spliced proxy/instrumental reconstruction. By now the curve looks worse than Evel Knievel did after his worst motorcycle crash:


Fig. 4. Global temperature since the last ice age 20,000 years ago and extended until the year 2100 for a intermediate emissions scenario with about 3°C of warming. Graphic: Jos Hagelaars.”
This is not above finger-painting of curves in climate-kindergarten.
Rahmstorf’s Fig. 4 tells us what will happen if we “do not rashly reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases”. He writes that “we are in the process of catapulting ourselves out of the Holocene.” and that if we continue on, “we will know longer recognize our Earth by the end of the century.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his Die Welt blog, journalist Ulli Kulke has a commentary on the recent scientific study issued by the NOAA and its latest findings concerning the US drought last year, which now states that it was due to just plain bad, natural weather and was not man-made.
Kulke calls the findings embarrassing for President Obama, who now likes to “blame such single meteorological events on man-made climate change”.
Kulke writes that the tragic drought in the US states had no connection with climate change, at least nothing of significance. Even more embarrassing: “The study had been written by scientists of the US government and was made public on Thursday by five different government institutes.” The NOAA report concluded:
The Central Great Plains drought during May-August of 2012 resulted mostly from natural variations in weather.”
Kulke adds concerning the lack of southerly winds from the Gulf and lack of midwestern thunderstorms, which led to the drought (my emphasis):
The study’s authors trace both phenomena back to the jet stream – an upper altitude strong wind that blows from west to east around the northern hemisphere and influences weather events – has been a little more to the north lately (by the way: sober meteorologists also blamed a shift in the jet stream for the drought in Russia three years ago and for the catastrophic floods in Pakistan). No climate model ever predicted such a situation.”

Let’s be very clear on that, as some scientists are now scrambling to connect jet stream variation to man-made climate change using “model simulations”.
Kulke tells German readers that the study found no relationship between a man-made climate change and an increase in extreme weather events, even if such events are always gladly postulated. Kulke reminds us: “Also the IPCC has not been able to find such a relationship. President Obama should have learned something from that.”
The NOAA report of course is not only an embarrassment for the president, but also for scientists, like Kevin Trenberth, who is employed by the NOAA, and who now requests studying to see if the jet stream shift is perhaps connected to climate change. Kulke sarcastically states that for Trenberth today, “There can be no large meteorological event that is not influenced by man.”
Kulke reminds German readers that Trenberth is the scientist who in a Climategate e-mail wrote of another major dilemma that has long dogged climate science: the lack of warming, “We can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty  that we can’t.”
Kulke concludes: “Even if someone does manage to slap together a relationship between the jet stream and climate change, it’s still not going to help Trenberth at all to get out of his dilemma.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal investment in renewable energies in the first quarter of this year plummeted a whopping 22%, falling to $40 billion, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance here.
The consequences for many companies and their employees of course will be calamitous to say the least. So many employees had been given the false promise of green jobs. Now, as governments are realizing that green energies are enormously expensive, and man-made climate change is over-hyped, subsidies are being slashed.
On their own, renewable energies are unable to compete and investors are turning their backs.
Green investment plummets 96% in Spain
Ironically, the hardest hit country was Spain, writes gstriatum.com. In the first quarter of 2013 Spain saw almost all of its investment in renewable energies evaporate, plummeting a mind-numbing 96%. President Obama once touted Spain as a shining example of green economy success, see here and here. Clearly Obama’s energy advisers had no clue about the complete lack of viability of renewable energies and have left the President standing embarrassed.

France and Italy have also been hard hit.
Michael Liebreich, Chief of Bloomberg New Energy: “For investment in clean energy to play its role in stemming the growth in world emissions, we would need to see investment levels at least double by 2020, rather than fall.”
What Liebreich really means here is: If countries cannot even afford the current level, then doubling the investment is completely out of the question. Expect green energy to die on the vine. The boom is over.
Bloomberg blames the collapsing investment on the uncertain political conditions in key markets like USA and Germany. Clearly the two countries are thinking twice about following Spain’s footsteps.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Economist here has an excellent analysis of the German “Energiewende” which is the country’s bold transformation to (80%) renewable energy by 2050. Right now the Economist is not too impressed, and its report should serve as a warning to other countries contemplating a similar move.
Hat tip Judith Curry (must read).
Some quotes:
“Germany’s Energiewende bodes ill for the country’s European leadership.”
“The reality has been messier, marked by price distortions, political U-turns, surging costs and inadequate infrastructure.”
“Businessmen say the Energiewende will kill German industry. Power experts worry about blackouts. Voters are furious about ever higher fuel bills.”
“…people see no paradox in demanding an end to nuclear power but objecting to the new transmission grid being built in their backyard.”
“…modern, clean natural-gas power plants are not viable. Only ageing, dirty brown-coal power stations with low variable costs can compete. The result is a web of grotesque distortions.”

“The cost of this mess is passed on to electricity users.”
Here we note that the Greens propose having industry take over the costs, but so far have been unable to explain what industry would do with these added costs. Not being able to think more than one step ahead is a chronic illness of the Greens.
“Germany’s most energy-intensive industries are now eyeing expansion on the other side of the Atlantic.”
Read the entire report here: www.economist.com/tilting-windmills.
The direction of the Energiewende is clear, and thus it is not hard to predict what’s up ahead for the country if it doesn’t make radical adjustments soon. Yet, its leaders refuse to pull their heads out of the sand and insist it’s going to work…somehow. From a sociological point of view, it is intriguing to observe a movement that is so cock-sure of itself, proud, arrogant, and obstinate that it would prefer to compromise the entire nation before admitting it has erred. History repeats.
The problem is that the green movement is massively institutionalized at every civic level and has been codified as the moral thing to do by all parties. How can it backtrack now and save face? Can we expect it to dismantle itself? The answer is clearly no.
Global warming science prematurely became fact and settled science years ago in Germany. Anyone who disagreed was labelled a heretic, outcast or extremist. Just take a look at the latest UBA brochure. As the Economist shows, it is truly a sad situation when a country meanders so far off course that its “extremists” in the end are proven to have been right all along.
I don’t see any change of direction coming at all. The green religion has even been hammered deep into the psyche of schoolchildren. Germany finds itself back in familiar historical territory. The only thing that can save it now is a major explosive upheaval. The longer the pressure builds…

"When Charles Darwin stopped briefly at the Falkland Islands on the famous voyage of the Beagle, he ran into one of the great mysteries in animal evolution. The islands had just one native terrestrial mammal, which he confusingly described as a “wolf-like fox”. It wasn’t clear what the species was descended from, or how it had ended up in such a remote place, hundreds of kilometres from the nearest mainland. The Falkland Islands wolf, known also as the warrah or Dusicyon australis, was hunted to extinction in the latter half of the 19th century. As such it was little studied. Darwin’s visit, in the species’ final decades, remains one of the only scientific observations of this poor animal. Scientists long thought that the extinct Falklands wolf was, as its name suggests, similar to a wolf. However, new research by colleagues and me published in the journal Mammal Review reveals that, in terms of skull shape and feeding habits, this mysterious “wolf” was more like a jackal. The Falklands wolf had previously been linked to wolves, coyotes and domestic dogs, and scientists even named it Canis antarticus. It wasn’t until 2009 that DNA analysis was used to prove its closest living relative is the maned wolf of South America, which is actually neither a wolf nor a fox. Nevertheless, this species of wild canid (the wider dog family) is characterised by unusually tall limbs, which make it very different from the rather sturdy Falklands wolf. So where did the Falklands wolf come from? By looking through the South American fossil record, scientists identified its direct ancestor as an extinct fox known as Dusicyon avus which was once found as far south as Patagonia. A 2013 study found Falklands wolf DNA split from its mainland ancestors about 16,000 years ago – during the last ice age.  At that point, when sea levels were much lower, Patagonia was only separated from the Falklands by a small passage of shallow sea which would have frozen over at times. This meant Dusicyon avus probably walked across an ice bridge to the Falklands, before evolving in complete isolation into the warrah.  Mystery solved. So we now know where the warrah came from, but what was it actually like? I wanted to figure out its ecology, and that meant looking at its bones and comparing them to other canids and what we know about their behaviour. To do this, I worked with a team of LJMU colleagues, a paleontologist from Argentina, and curators at the Natural History Museum (NHM) in London. We dug through the cupboards at the NHM and World Museum Liverpool to build a database of more than 120 digital images of representative skulls of living wild canid species, including rare specimens of Falklands wolf and its ancestor Dusicyon avus.  We then mapped out various anatomical landmarks that would be present in each (the tip of the upper and lower jaw, say, or the relative position of upper and lower canines and molar teeth) and used this information to quantify the shape of all the wild canid skulls we investigated. This gave us directly comparable data which helps reveal similarities and differences between species.  We realised the Falklands wolf and Dusicyon avus most closely resembled the jackal species found in Africa and Eurasia. Shared features such as wide elongated muzzles, narrow cheekbones, large first lower molars and thick lower jaws, are typical of medium-sized opportunistic predators.  As with jackals alive today, the Falklands wolf would have been an unfussy eater, capable of scavenging or killing everything from small ground-nesting birds to marine mammals like seal pups. Jackal-like feeding habits may even have determined the fate of these “wolves”, as they would also have targeted sheep which were imported to the Falklands from the 1850s onwards. The Falkland Islands wolf is one of many species that, after colonising South America, quickly evolved features similar to distantly-related counterparts in the Old World. The bush dog of South America is another. With its short muzzle and wide cheekbones, this small canid resembles in skull morphology the much larger African hunting dog and the Asiatic dhole. All three species hunt in packs and independently converged on the same head shape, which gives them an unusually strong bite and means they can grab hold of fleeing large prey like deer or capybara.  South America represented an important “laboratory” for the natural selection of modern canid species. The continent now has the world’s richest diversity of dogs, wolves and their relatives. The historical loss of the Falkland Islands wolf highlights, again, that humans are their greatest threat."
"How time flies. But as the festive season draws to a close there is one thing left to sort out: what to do with the Christmas tree? Do we recycle it or just throw it away?  The tradition of decorating Christmas trees is still going strong. Yet there is an inevitable seasonal increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Nobody wants to be a Grinch or a Scrooge. But, perhaps it is possible to reduce our carbon footprint by thinking about what we do with our Christmas trees afterwards. It is commonly thought that real Christmas trees are better for the environment than artificial trees. Real trees can be decompose into compost and be recycled or be turned into wood chippings for reuse. All local authorities will provide some form of recycling service for Christmas trees. But statistics for Christmas tree recycled are not recorded separately from other forms of waste. It is estimated that 160,000 tonnes of real Christmas trees is either flytipped or goes to landfill. That could amount to local authorities having to pay up to £12.8m in landfill taxes – a lot of money that could be better spent on improving recycling and other council services. A real Christmas tree that is sent to landfill has a carbon footprint of about 16kg. As it decomposes, it produces methane. But an artificial tree produces more than twice the greenhouse gas emissions than that of a real tree that goes to landfill and more than 10 times that of a real tree that is incinerated. An artificial tree is also thought to have a higher initial carbon footprint because it is made of plastic, which comes from oil. Recycling, landfill and incineration are not the be-all and end-all of waste management. According to the waste hierarchy, which forms the basis of EU and UK waste policy, reuse and prevention should be seen as higher priorities. While artificial Christmas trees cannot be recycled, they can be stored away in January and reused year after year. Real trees cannot generally be used more than once. If you can hold on to an artificial Christmas tree for at least 10 years, it becomes the greener option. In other words, using one artificial tree for 10 years produces the same amount of carbon emissions as buying a new, real tree a year for 10 years. As evergreens, real Christmas trees can be reused if they still have their roots. As well as being replanted in gardens, they can shore up flood defences or offset carbon emissions. But they do that anyway without being chopped down for Christmas.    Real Christmas trees may be a minority taste anyway. Some 6m to 8m real trees are sold every year in the UK. But, according to research carried out in 2012 by consumer group Which?, only 20% of households were planning to buy real trees, with 50% of households opting for artificial trees. The falling pound may have given British Christmas tree growers a boost over artificial tree manufacturers.      The debate over whether real or artificial Christmas trees are better for the environment goes on every year. But whether a tree is man-made or natural is not necessarily what matters. What counts in the battle against climate change is what happens after Twelfth Night, when it’s time to take the fairy lights down."

"The world’s most seemingly-toxic lakes are under threat. And they are also home to one of our most familiar birds: the flamingo. All flamingo species have evolved to live in some of the planet’s most extreme wetlands, like caustic “soda lakes”, hypersaline lagoons or high-altitude salt flats.  One species, the lesser flamingo, has taken this relationship to the limit. Most are found in super-alkaline lakes throughout Africa’s Great Rift Valley, which host immense blooms of microscopic blue-green algae (called cyanobacteria). These poisonous plants produce chemicals that, in most animals, can fatally damage cells, the nervous system, and the liver. The lesser flamingo, however, can consume enormous amounts with no ill effects (unless you count their colourful plumage, which comes from a pigment in the algae). Two of the lesser flamingo’s preferred habitats, Lake Bogoria in Kenya and Lake Natron in Tanzania, are hypersaline and hostile to practically all other forms of life (Natron water can even strip away human skin).  For the flamingos this a bonus. Special tough skin and scales on their legs prevent burns, and they can drink water at near boiling point to collect freshwater from springs and geysers at lake edges. If no freshwater is available, flamingos can use glands in their head that remove salt, draining it out from their nasal cavity.  With few other animals able to cope in such conditions, there is minimal competition for food, and these toxic wetlands are home to massive flocks. Million-strong gatherings provide several benefits. Mass synchronised nesting gives flamingos the best possible chance to raise the maximum number of chicks, while on choppy days a dense mass of birds swimming together also helps create the optimal feeding environment (still water) within the centre of the group. Sheer numbers also make it harder for predators like hyenas or jackals to identify individual victims. As such, a single flamingo is not a happy flamingo. The species is happiest in huge gatherings, and these won’t occur around any old lake – the lesser flamingo specifically needs its toxic, salty paradise.  But these places are rare. Across the six flamingo species there are only 30 or so regularly used breeding sites worldwide and, while the global population of around 3.2m lesser flamingos is impressive, it is largely reliant on a few huge groups (about 75% nest at Lake Natron alone). What if something happens to one of their highly-specialised breeding sites? Unlike many other species that can still breed in smaller populations as their habitats become damaged, these birds cannot easily survive in small groups. Having evolved in such a hostile environment with few rivals, they would have trouble adapting to a more competitive lifestyle elsewhere. With most of their eggs in one toxic basket, the lesser flamingo is unusually vulnerable for a species with millions of individuals. Indeed, the number of lesser flamingos in the wild is already decreasing each year. And humans are to blame. Wetland habitats have been polluted by agricultural chemicals and sewage, feeding and breeding grounds have been disturbed, and declining algal blooms mean some populations are starving to death. Even a diet of toxic algae can’t save flamingos from ecological disturbances. If humans take too much water from a lake, or climate change causes excess evaporation, then salinity levels will become unstable. Populations of cyanobacteria can explode and the birds end up consuming new species which can poison them and cause mass deaths. Attempts to extract sodium carbonate (a useful industrial material known as soda ash) from Lake Natron represents another danger. Mining would disturb the birds, who like privacy when breeding and tend to nest far from shore, on remote islands that have been isolated by flooding. It would also make the water more choppy, affecting their food gathering.  Given how slow flamingos are at adapting and changing to new nesting areas, any Natron development must be avoided. Anthropogenic disturbances have previously caused lesser flamingos to abandon suitable breeding sites, and back in 1993, polluted water in Lake Bogoria and nearby Nakuru killed more than 20,000 lesser flamingos – the first of a series of recurring deaths. The latest mining proposal has been withdrawn but such developments haven’t been completely shelved. Conservation groups remain alert. Monitoring and protecting the population at Lake Natron is the top priority for lesser flamingo conservation, according to a recent assessment by BirdLife International. Large-scale soda ash extraction, the report says, would be “disastrous for the species” and could see the flamingos become officially “vulnerable” or even “endangered”. The importance of these unique, and apparently hostile, wetlands is clear to see. Life in the Rift Valley lakes is a delicate balance. And it is clear that we are already harming these unique and fragile ecosystems. If humans were to cause drastic changes, their spectacular pink inhabitants would vanish forever."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust call it the Great Solar Energy Bubble! It has popped for good, and what’s left behind is a whopping 21 billion euros in destroyed capital, Germany’s flagship daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) writes today.
One of the arguments used to convince people of the virtues of solar energy was that “the sun doesn’t send a bill … energy from the sun is free!” Even Dave Suzuki once claimed that.
The notion that “solar energy is free” has turned out to be an expensive myth. Quite to the contrary, the bills for solar energy are now coming in, and they’re huge.
Hat-tip Benny Peiser.
Not Long ago investors were exuberantly bullish when it came to investments in solar energy in Germany, so were large companies. Today, however, many have since lost their shirts. And the FAZ now writes large corporations who placed their bets on solar power and solar heat are “pulling out disillusioned“. “The strategy ended in a debacle.”
As an example, the FAZ cites Siemens, who announced on Monday that its solar unit would be liquidated and shut down completely by next spring after the company’s solar strategy “ended in a debacle” after having “poured about a billion euros into the business“.

Looks as if the solar industry in Germany is “dead”
The FAZ writes that Siemens now follows a long list of failed solar companies in Germany (once ballyhooed as a model for the rest of the world), joining Bosch, who announced too that it would withdraw from the solar business, thus putting the jobs of 3000 employees at stake in economically depressed East Germany. Supervisory board chairman Franz Fehrenbach now says it looks as if the solar industry in Germany is “dead”.
Solar manufacturers blame the plummeting prices for panels and modules, as well as competition from China. FAZ reports that “a total of 1.56 billion euros had been completely written off by the company by the end of 2012. On top of that come operating losses totaling 750 million euros”.
The FAZ then tallies the total capital destruction by the German solar industry as a whole, pegging that number at 21 billion euros! The FAZ writes:
Investment stars Solarworld and Q-Cells have destroyed capital to the tune of double-digit billions of euros. In December 2007 the East German Solar Valley cell and module manufacturer Q-Cells was considered to be an aspiring candidiate for the first league stock market. Nothing came of that. Instead the company declared itself insolvent in 2012 and was bought up by a Korean company. Private investors practically lost everything.”
So much for the claim that “solar energy is free”. Once again, the central planners demonstrate again how effective and talented they are when it comes to destroying wealth and capital.

"Brexit risks harming the UK’s environment unless the government passes stiff new legislation before it triggers Article 50. That’s the conclusion of a major new report by the Environment Audit Committee, a cross-bench group of 16 MPs.  In the run-up to the referendum, most experts were very worried about the environmental impact of Brexit and, since the vote, some of these concerns have been confirmed – think, for example, of Michael Gove and John Whittingdale inviting companies to draw a wish list for a bonfire of EU social and environmental legislation. On the other hand, some environmental NGOs have launched a campaign to achieve a “Greener UK” after the vote, seizing Brexit as an opportunity to increase, not decrease, environmental ambition. So, which way is Britain going to go? This depends on whether Theresa May’s government uses the Brexit negotiation to actually deliver on its manifesto commitment to “be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than it found it”. As with anything Brexit-related, a “green Brexit” is full of uncertainties, and faces both technical and political difficulties.  However the audit committee’s report can help us draw “green lines” on which to judge how eco-friendly Brexit is really likely to be.  Long before the referendum the government started working on two parallel 25-year plans for the environment and agriculture/food. But progress has been slow, and consultation on this flagship policy has still not started. As with Brexit more generally, clear environmental goals have been promised but not yet delivered. The absence of clarity on what the government is trying to achieve for farming and the environment makes it difficult to ensure these unknown objectives are not inadvertently thwarted during the Brexit negotiations.  A first Brexit green line, then, is that negotiating objectives should be, as much as possible, aligned with the 25-year plans. The MPs’ report suggests the basic framework and consultation on both plans should take place before the government officially starts negotiating to leave the EU. This would ensure any conflicts between the two plans and the Brexit negotiation brief are considered and hopefully mitigated. The prime minister has called for a “Great Repeal Bill” to transfer to UK law all applicable EU law and ensure a smooth transition. But copy-pasting legislation is not so straightforward: the environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, told the environmental committee that, of the 800 or more pieces of European environmental legislation, up to a third would not be automatically carried over. What is striking in the committee’s report is how little is known about what these gaps actually are, and which policy areas are particularly at risk.  A second green line for Brexit would be to identify these gaps as soon as possible and make sure they are effectively plugged by the time the UK leaves the EU. To do this, the committee suggests that “any provisions which cannot be transposed into UK law should form the basis of a new Environmental Protection Act”. May’s government is working on a Brexit deal for the “whole UK”, but environmental policy is a devolved area. While there are of course EU-wide rules, they’re implemented slightly differently in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Common rules limit regulatory divergence, although it still exists: for example, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland have banned their farmers from growing genetically modified crops but England has not. The Great Repeal Bill therefore risks fuelling constitutional tensions within the UK. Establishing UK-wide rules, such as minimum pollution standards, would see Westminster taking back control from the devolved administrations, and not just from Europe. It would be politically difficult – indeed the Scottish government is clearly opposed to it – but may be, to some extent, environmentally necessary.  A third green line for Brexit would thus be to achieve both minimum standards throughout the UK and to respect devolved administration’s competences to adopt more ambitious and innovative policies. Coordination will not only be needed between devolved and central administration, but within central administration itself. How the UK answers the two central Brexit questions – in or out of the single market? In or out of the customs union? – will have major impacts on the environment. Notably, if the UK opts for a hard Brexit (out of both single market and customs union) and is to negotiate its own trade deals, environmental standards could be at risk. Just think of the Europe-wide mobilisation against the EU-US trade deal TTIP on this very basis. A fourth green line for Brexit is that the UK environment should not lose out from these new deals. The committee asks that “the government should guarantee that it will not trade away environmental protections, animal welfare and food safety standards, as part of the negotiations to leave, or as part of future trade deals”. These four green lines will allow us to gauge the Brexit negotiation from an environmental perspective. A first test will be in how the government responds to the Environment Audit Committee’s report. But the key test will be the UK’s official negotiation position and whether it makes any mention of the environment."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJoe Bastardi has left a comment at Rolling Stone in response to their “10 Dumbest Statements Ever Made About Global Warming” commentary.
Here it is:
By the way, talking about deceit. THIS WAS A GLOBAL WARMING ISSUE. that is the game you chose. To then conveniently turn into Climate Change, which is redundant since over the history of the earth, no place on earth has had a constant climate, because of the nature of the planet and its relation to the sun ( ever notice most of the land is in the northern hemisphere, ocean in the south, a continent at the south pole of the earth, a  frozen ocean at the north, the seasons,  and the changes in feedback at different times of the year, check out MJO phase charts if you wish to see a classic example of that)  is merely deceit. No one denies that there is variance or climate,   THE ISSUE IS CATASTROPHIC WARMING AND WHEN IT STOPPED  you simply decided that if you point out occurrences that people were not able to see as fast before,  then you can point out all the wild things that actually have been happening on the planet since time began. But now you get to see them point them out and say see. Classic example hurricanes. Both Irene and Sandy were not major hurricane yet in 1954 and 1955 5 major hurricanes hit the east coast from NC north in  a two year period. In 1938  a hurricane drove 15 feet of water in Providence rhode island. The weather you see now is just like the weather in the 1950s, the last time the atlantic was warm while the Pacific was cooling and we are seeing the same  things in the 3 true canaries in the coal mine, western Europe, Alaska and the far east where winters first turn colder. Because of the reduction of available moisture from a cooling tropical Pacific, the US first turns dry and dryness breeds heat. Anyone that looks at decadol charts  from the 1950s can see that, along with the increased hurricane threat on the east coast, which so  far can not hold a candle to the 1950s.   But I am sure none of this matters to you. But changing the game from what you started, GLOBAL WARMING, to something none of deny, climate and the variances, is simply cheating. You started it , you are getting whipped, and its only going to get worse once the atlantic flips into its cold mode  and the decreased TSI due to the sun takes over. I made a forecast 4 years ago that by 2030 temperature would return to where they were in the late 1970s, at the start of the satellite era,  and at the end of the last cold cycle of the Pacific, before it warmed ( now back to colder).
By the way, just how are your computer forecasts that have caused draconian measures to be advocated that inhibit the progress of men doing.. well lets see
http://c3headlines.typepad.com…
Point is you are the ones deceiving people. You are the ones changing the playing field  You are the ones that said global warming, saw you were getting whipped and are trying to change this to something that is inherent to the system naturally, in an effort to deceive  people.    Stick with what you said,  GLOBAL WARMING IS THE ISSUE,  and face the facts. And quit lying about people that  know darn well that the earth is in a constant state of change, and with change, comes conflict, which over a period of years produces the climate  NATURALLY.”
I don’t know about dumb statements, Joe, but C3 Headines show 44 definitely dumb model forecasts.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWith atmospheric CO2 concentrations reaching the 400 ppm level, the media and a number of alarmist scientists have set off the mega-alarm bells, claiming “record high levels” of CO2 had been reached, and that the planet is on the verge of an overdose. This is based purely on ignorance of the Earth’s history.
Worrying that 400 ppm is too high is like worrying about your fuel tank overflowing when it reaches the 1/8 mark during filling.
Figure above-right: At 400 ppm CO2 levels are actually dangerously low in historical terms.
From a historical perspective, an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 400 ppm is actually almost scraping the bottom of the barrel. Over the Earth’s history, atmospheric CO2 concentrations have ranged from 180 ppm to 7000 ppm, see Figure 1 below. On that scale we are in fact today barely above the Earth’s record lows.
Figure 1: Atmospheric CO2 concentration is just barely above the life-sustaining levels of 150 ppm. For life to have real buffer against mass extinction, CO2 needs to be closer to 1000 ppm. Source here. 
That 400 ppm is actually dangerously low is a fact the alarmists keep avoiding and suppressing. Below 150 ppm, plant-life dies off on a massive scale. The Earth actually came very close to that point many times over the last 2 million years during the ice ages. At the bottom of the last ice age just 20,000 years ago, life on the planet literally teetered on the brink when CO2 fell to a level of just 180 ppm. Do we really want to live on the brink of extinction.
It’s a fact that biologists have shown that once the atmospheric CO2 level falls below the 500 ppm level, plants really begin to suffer. Many of us have seen the video showing how plants grow faster under higher CO2 concentrations. The following charts show the growth curves of some plants as a function of CO2 concentration:

Figure 2: Plant growth vs CO2 concentration. Plants really begin to suffer once CO2 concentrations fall below 500 ppm. Source: click here.
Note that at high CO2 concentrations, such as 800 ppm, plants thrive. But as CO2 levels fall off, growth rates really start to plummet once they fall below 500 ppm. History shows that the Earth sustains much more life, i.e. is much greener and fruitful, when CO2 levels are higher, i.e. in the vicinity of 1000 ppm.
No one disputes that man’s activities have helped to increase atmospheric CO2 concentration, and it should not be in dispute that plants and life on the planet are thankful that man has done so. At 400 ppm, the planet is a safer place to be and will be even safer at 1000 ppm.

"If one in five people in richer countries adopted low-meat diets, and threw away a third less food than they currently do, while poor countries were assisted to preserve their forests and restore degraded land, the world’s agricultural systems could be absorbing carbon dioxide by 2050 instead of adding massively to global heating as they do at present. Tree-planting and improving the fertility of soil through better farming practices would also be needed, according to a study of global forests, farming and food systems published in the journal Nature Climate Change.  Managing agricultural and other land in a more environmentally sound manner could take the world nearly a third of the way towards meeting the Paris agreement goals. “These [measures] are feasible now and deliver many other benefits,” said Stephanie Roe, environmental scientist at the University of Virginia and lead author of the paper. “Recent reports on the state of our forests and food systems show a worrying lack of progress in the land sector, and our window of opportunity to deliver on the Paris agreement is getting smaller. However, I remain optimistic because we have all the tools we need, as well as increasing public pressure and political will to turn things around.” The changes would also allow for healthier diets globally, improve livelihoods in poor areas, preserve wildlife and flora, and make for higher water and air quality. Many of the measures suggested, such as cutting food waste and shifting from excessive meat consumption, would also save money. For example, improving soil management through organic farming practices would cost about $57bn (£43.9bn) but save nearly $2tn over the period, according to one estimate used in the study. Land accounts for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions, or 11 gigatons of carbon dioxide a year. With the right measures, according to the study, it would act instead as a carbon sink absorbing 3 gigatons from the atmosphere a year by 2050. That could give some scope for other sectors such as aviation to continue to use limited amounts of fossil fuels while staying within the global carbon budget needed to avoid a temperature rise of more than 1.5C (a rise of 2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. The authors set out a roadmap for the six large-scale measures they propose, including: reducing deforestation, peatland burning and mangrove destruction by 70%; restoring forests, peatlands and coastal mangroves to generate enough carbon dioxide saving to cancel out China’s annual emissions; planting trees to save as much carbon dioxide as that emitted by the EU. Improving farming practices, including moving to more organic practices, would mean better soil management that could cut carbon dioxide equal to India’s annual emissions. Consumer food waste in rich countries and big developing countries could be cut by a third, while the losses from food production in poor regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and south-east Asia could be cut drastically through simple measures such as more refrigeration and better transport. Moving a fifth of people to plant-based diets in developed and emerging countries, particularly the US, the EU, China, Brazil, Argentina and Russia, is seen as possible by 2030. These near-vegan diets would involve consuming less than 2,500 calories a day and no more than 60g of animal protein. The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts Prof Thomas Crowther, founder of the Crowther Lab, who was not involved with the study, said: “This is an excellent review of the many carbon drawdown solutions that the land can provide. There are immense benefits of restoring natural ecosystems like forests, wetlands and peatlands. Managed ecosystems can also be critical through effective agroforestry, biochar techniques and regenerative agriculture that can increase soil carbon sequestration. The review also reveals the considerable uncertainty and challenges that we face in realising this carbon drawdown potential, highlighting the need for more quantitative research into the scale and dynamics of carbon storage on land.” Developing nations are hoping that the forthcoming UN meeting on the climate emergency, COP25 in Santiago, will encourage rich countries to focus on helping them cut emissions through better land use and management of the oceans. A spokesperson for the UK’s Department for International Development said: “Cutting carbon emissions by helping developing countries change how they use and farm land is a priority for UK aid. We are fighting illegal deforestation and supporting poor farmers to make their practices greener. By making farming practices more efficient, we reduce the amount of land needed to produce food.” Nancy Harris of the World Resources Institute, a co-author of the study, said: “The longer we delay action to protect forests, the more difficult it will be to achieve the Paris agreement targets and the more we will need to rely on unproven negative emission technologies.”"

The Neglected Sun” is now available for pre-ordering at Amazon (US). Check the Amazon site for your country on how to order. You should also be able to order at most major bookshops. Image: Stacey International
This is the book that sent shock waves across the German climate science establishment, causing many media outlets to fret that the end of the world may not be coming after all.
Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s book claims that the climate models have been hopelessly distorted by IPCC scientists, and that these models irresponsibly exaggerate the impact of CO2 on our climate.  The authors support their assertions with a crushing load of scientific evidence stemming from hundreds of peer-reviewed papers; they cite over 900 sources – most peer-reviewed. Their conclusion: The sun plays a far greater role in driving climate than what the IPCC would have us believe.
Vahrenholt, a professor of chemistry, was once a big believer in the IPCC’s science. The high profile professor and Environment Minster of the City Of Hamburg was made CEO of German power giant RWE Innogy, the renewable energy arm of the company. His job: To put the power giant on the path to renewable energies. Vahrenholt led the installation of massive offshore windparks. No one has been responsible for installing more wind power in Europe than Vahrenholt.
But after just a few short years, RWE was surprised by the much lower than expected results – as if the wind in northern Europe had gone into the doldrums.  RWE demanded an explanation from Vahrenholt, who had relied on wind forecasts from experts. In search for an answer Vahrenholt found a paper by Lockwood that showed Europe’s climate was strongly correlated with solar activity and that it was in part responsible for the wind doldrums.

In December 2009, Vahrenholt was asked by the IPCC to review the draft report on renewable energy. He was horrified by what he had found: 293 errors and deficiencies in the 1000+ page report. Worse, in February 2010 at a Washington D.C. meeting of IPCC experts, no one refuted these errors. He asked himself: “Could it be that the same sloppy approach was used for the core area of climate protection?”
RWE colleague Dr. Sebastian Lüning, a geologist, gave Vahrenholt a copy of Andrew Montford’s The Hockey Stick Illusion. Vahrenholt tore through the book in a matter of days and dug deeper into the science. He was shocked by the deception and distortions he found in the IPCC literature. This is what eventually led Lüning and Vahrenholt to write Die kalte Sonne.
Many readers here have asked if and when the book would be printed in English. Now I’m pleased to say that the the printing presses are gearing up to print in English.
The English version is considerably updated and includes newer literature and developments, which not surprisingly confirm Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s suspicions of reduced CO2 climate sensitivity.
Actually The Neglected Sun has turned me into a mild luke-warmer. The evidence presented in the book does not dispute the greenhouse properties of CO2, and shows that they are real and are a factor, but that they are quite exaggerated. Vahrenholt’s and Lüning’s conclusions are actually not far from those of many serious climate scientists.
It’s emerging that Vahrenholt and Lüning are turning out to be correct with their assertions on CO2 climate sensitivity. You’ll can read all about it. The English version has been changed around a bit, and I assure you that you will not be able to put it down after the first short introductory chapter.

Does Anders really want to play this game?
Let’s just take one moment to recall some of the really dumb things warmists have claimed. Shall we make a list of the 100 dumbest things said by warmists?
Heck, one could easily find 1000 dumbest things ever said by them…and you’d still only be scratching the surface. Let’s recall some of the absurd things Hansen, Gore, Viner, Latif, Rahmstorf etc. have claimed, e.g. snowless winters, death trains, Earth’s center is 1 million degrees, warming causing cold weather, 1.8 meter sea level rise and so on.
The multitude of really dumb things said by warmists is indeed the main reason why they are getting crushed in the climate debate and need the German government’s environment ministry UBA to help them out.
If any reader wants the job of making a list and publishing it here, be my guest. Better yet, ask Anthony Watts to publish it so that 100,000 climate readers will be reminded of the mega-follies of the global warming movement.

"In the geographical heart of Africa lies a huge wetland. After years of exploring these remote swamps, our research shows that the region contains the most extensive tropical peatland on Earth.  Astonishingly, 145,500 km² of peatland – an area larger than England – went undetected on our crowded planet until now. We found 30 billion metric tonnes of carbon stored in this new ecosystem that nobody knew existed. That’s equivalent to 20 years of current US fossil fuel emissions. You can read the important science in Nature. Here we describe how we did it, and our struggles against sabotage, arrest, and losing our own minds. Peat is usually associated with cold places, not the middle of the hot, humid, Congo Basin. It’s an organic wetland soil made of partially-decomposed plant debris. In waterlogged places those plants can’t entirely decompose, and are not respired as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The peat thus builds up slowly, locking up ever-more carbon. The amounts involved are huge: peat covers just 3% of Earth’s land surface, but stores one-third of soil carbon. We knew that peat can be formed under some tropical swamp forests. Might the world’s second largest tropical wetland, known as the Cuvette Centrale, overlie peat? After the eureka moment of asking the right question, we searched to see if somebody else already knew the answer. About once a decade from the 1950s some obscure report would mention in passing that there was peat in the Congo Basin. Not one gave a grid-reference, village or river to locate it. It was important to confirm whether it was present, though, as peatlands in Southeast Asia have been targeted for palm oil  and other industrial agricultural projects, leading to huge carbon emissions and catastrophic wildlife losses. Palm oil is now on the march in Africa. For our Congo search, we had nothing to go on. Given the Congo Basin is slightly larger than India, it is not practical to just turn up and begin your search on foot. To pinpoint where to go, we combined data from different satellites to identify year-round waterlogged areas with the right sort of plants. In 2012, with researchers from Congo and UK universities plus NGO Wildlife Conservation Society, we began to look for peat in northern Republic of Congo. No one was really prepared for the reality of life in the swamps. The forest is quite open, which increases the equatorial heat, but humidity is still 100% which makes it extremely sweaty. Your feet are wet and your new world is filled with insects.  Walking through the swamps is only possible in the dry season. Wading is the mode of transport at all other times. But then when it is dry, there isn’t any free-flowing water. We often had to filter drinking water from the pits that crocodiles excavate and live in. Dry land and water kept us leashed near the edges of the swamp. But, happily we found some peat. There were various hiccups. The team allegedly did not have the right papers, and was put under “town arrest”, confined to the provincial capital Impfondo. A week in and still no movement, but a friendly BBC journalist asked if the government had any comment on the arrested UK student. The next day everyone was free.  On another occasion, a curious panther unearthed and broke our instrument measuring the water table. But, as the work progressed, we learned more and more about the swamp from the local villagers who made the expeditions possible. We would see elephant feet and gorilla hands imprinted in the peat. We were increasingly in awe that a remote, almost unknown, wilderness such as this could still be found on Earth today. We were then able to undertake our biggest expedition yet: a 30km walk to the centre of what we suspected was one of the largest single areas of peatland in the region.  In February 2014, our team of three scientists and five assistants from local village Itanga, with the blessing of their chief and elders, began its trek to the middle of the swamp. With all our food and equipment on our backs, the days were spent advancing our way through (or sinking into) the forested swamp, sampling the peat and overlying vegetation every 250 metres, then doubling back to pick up more food and equipment.  In the evenings, we made wooden platforms, on which we could pitch freestanding mountaineering tents. We washed in one of the many muddy pools of water on offer. The team would then sit round the fire – on a platform, to be out of the water – and enjoy a meal of cassava and smoked-dry fish. After 17 days, covering just 1.5km a day, we finally reached the centre of the swamp between two of the major rivers. Our reward was not only the knowledge that these peatlands are indeed vast. We also found ever-deeper peat, reaching up to 5.9m, roughly the height of a two-storey building.  Yet being in such a remote location was mentally disconcerting. We knew that tree roots would always stop us sinking into the peat up to our necks. And we knew that the rain in a single torrential storm was not enough to flood the swamp and erase our path out. But our senses informed our brains that this was a dangerous place. Days later, wading the last river, we appeared blinking into the bright sunlight of the savanna, all eight of us sank to our knees, elated to have survived. Our field measurements revealed that just two specific forest types have peat underneath: a year-round waterlogged swamp of hardwood trees and a year-round waterlogged swamp dominated by one species of palm. We then used satellite data to map these two specific peat swamp forests to determine the boundaries of the Congo Basin peatlands. Combining this area with peat depth and peat carbon content from our laboratory analyses allowed us to calculate that just 4% of the Congo Basin is peatland, but it stores as much carbon below ground as that stored above ground in all the trees of the other 96%. And now what? In policy terms, while the area is not under immediate threat, it needs protecting: as well as being critical habitat for gorillas and forest elephants, the Congo peatlands are only a carbon-rich resource in the fight against climate change when left intact.   The good news is that the Republic of Congo government is considering extending the area of protected swamp by expanding the Lac Tele Community Reserve by up to 50,000 square kilometres. And for us scientists? Now we know that this vast new ecosystem exists, we’d like to know how it works."

"On Christmas Day in 1879 the combination of fog and smoke was so dense over London that it was virtually dark at noon. Nowadays, with many people staying at home and fewer vehicles on the road, the ambient air quality on Christmas Day is typically very good. However air in the home may be at its worst.  On Christmas, indoor sources of air pollution can generate particles that, in terms of number and mass concentrations, significantly exceed background levels. Here are a few reasons why. Cooking the traditional Christmas dinner can result in elevated levels of a number of pollutants. Ultrafine particles (UFP) smaller than 100 nanometres are of special interest from a health perspective, since they can penetrate deep into the respiratory system and cause inflammatory effects. A number of studies have reported increased UFP concentrations associated with electric stoves and cooking utensils, perhaps from heating detergent residues. The number of particles emitted during cooking depends upon factors such as the raw food composition, cooking temperature and style – stirring food has been shown to produce larger aerosols as the ingredients are splashed about and tiny specs fly into the atmosphere. Gas cooking is a major source of both nitrogen dioxide (a harmful gas) and particulate matter (tiny, often hazardous particles suspended in the air). Kitchens with gas cooking can have higher levels of nitrogen dioxide than even a busy roadside. In fact it has been shown that gas cooking is associated with increased risk of both current and lifetime asthma. The health risks associated with cooking are poorly understood, although UK regulations require extractor fans in kitchens. Given that it takes more than four hours to prepare and cook the average Christmas dinner, people with asthma or cardiovascular disease may want to avoid the kitchen. When cooking, especially with gas, it is important to keep the extractor fan on or open a window.  Wood burning is becoming more popular – often for aesthetic reasons – and this releases significant amounts of particulate pollution into the outdoor environment. Wood smoke is a significant reason why many cities are exceeding European air quality limits during winter. In Denmark, emissions from wood-burning stoves are calculated to cause 400 premature deaths every year, while in London it accounts for between 7% and 9% of wintertime particle pollution. Studies have also shown wood smoke can enter neighbouring homes. Even if wood is burnt in modern stoves rather than open fires, start-up, stoking and reloading can still cause high emissions. Smoke from firewood contains hundreds of compounds which can cause cancer, mutations or defective pregnancies.  To reduce emissions allow wood to season before burning it. Keep it dry as it burns most efficiently when its moisture content is below 20%. The use of candles to create a warm, festive atmosphere is common in homes over Christmas. While they look attractive, once lit, they emit ultrafine particles which may contain metals released from the colour pigments. Soot can also be produced, typically when the candle flame flickers due varying air flows.  Scented candles are even worse as they release various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), identified by the EU as priority indoor pollutants. However certain house plants can help clean up these compounds. Party poppers are an often overlooked source of indoor air pollution. In Britain, they are classified as fireworks. While the impact of fireworks outdoors is well documented detailed knowledge of how it affects the indoor environment is lacking. Although party poppers are short lived, they can generate large concentrations of ultrafine particles.  The figure below shows the result of 10 party poppers in a typical dining room. Particle concentrations are more than 100 times higher than those at the roadside and these levels can persist for some time.  It also needs to be remembered that many household activities such as sweeping, hoovering, or even simply moving about, can generate larger particles – although hopefully no one is cleaning the house on Christmas Day. But if you are particularly worried about indoor air pollution a low-cost sensor would make an excellent scientific stocking-filler."
"In 2015 the Welsh singer and activist Charlotte Church was widely ridiculed in the right-wing press and on social media for saying on BBC Question Time that climate change had played an important part in causing the conflict in Syria. From 2006 until 2011, [Syria] experienced one of the worst droughts in its history, which of course meant that there were water shortages and crops weren’t growing, so there was mass migration from rural areas of Syria into the urban centres, which put on more strain, and made resources scarce etc, which apparently contributed to the conflict there today. Goaded on by the tabloids, Church reaped a whirlwind of public ridicule: But what she said was correct – and there will be an increasing convergence of climate, food, economic and political crises in the coming years and decades. We need to better understand the interconnectivity of environmental, economic, geopolitical, societal and technological systems if we are to manage these crises and avoid their worst impacts.    In particular, tipping points exist in both physical and socio-economic systems, including governmental or financial systems. These systems interact in complex ways. Small shocks may have little impact but, a particular shock or set of shocks could tip the system into a new state. This new state could represent a collapse in agriculture or even the fall of a government. In 2011, Syria became the latest country to experience disruption in a wave of political unrest crossing North Africa and the Middle East. Religious differences, a failure of the ruling regime to tackle unemployment and social injustice and the state of human rights all contributed to a backdrop of social unrest. However, these pressures had existed for years, if not decades.  So was there a trigger for the conflict in the region which worked in tandem with the ongoing social unrest?  Syria, and the surrounding region, has experienced significant depletion in water availability since 2003. In particular an intense drought between 2007 and 2010, alongside poor water management, saw agricultural production collapse and a mass migration from rural areas to city centres. Farmers, who had been relatively wealthy in their rural surroundings now found themselves as the urban poor reliant on food imports. Between 2007 and 2009 Syria increased its annual imports of wheat and meslin (rice flour) by about 1.5m tonnes. That equated to a more than ten-fold increase in importing one of the most basic foods.  There is a tendency these days to believe that global trade will protect the world from food production shocks. A small production shock in one region can be mitigated by increasing, temporarily, imports of food or by sourcing food from another region. However, certain shocks, or a set of shocks, could create an amplifying feedback that cascades into a globally significant event.  The food system today is increasingly complex and an impact in land, water, labour or infrastructure could create fragility. A large enough perturbation can lead to a price response in the global market that sends a signal to other producers to increase their output to make up for any shortfall. While increased prices can be beneficial to farmers and food producers, if the price increase is large enough it can have a significant impact on communities that are net food importers.   Additionally, food production is concentrated both in a relatively small handful of commodity crops such as wheat, rice and maize as well as from a relatively small number of regions, for example the US, China and Russia. This concentration means any disruption in those regions will have a large impact on global food supply. Reliance on global markets for sourcing food can therefore be a source of systemic risk. In 2008 the global price of food increased dramatically. This increase was the result of a complex set of issues including historically low global food stocks, drought in Australia following production lows in several other areas over the previous few years, and speculation and an increase in biofuel production in North America.  This spike in global food price in 2008 was a factor in the initial unrest across North Africa and the Middle East, which became known as the Arab Spring. As prices peaked, violence broke out in countries such as Egypt, Libya and Tunisia. In Syria a local drought which coincided with this global shock in food prices resulted in dramatic changes in the availability and cost of food. In response small groups of individuals protested. The government response, combined with a background of rising protests, existing social tensions and instability in the wider region, quickly escalated into the situation we are experiencing today. The events in Syria, then, appear to stem from a far more complex set of pressures, beyond religious tension and government brutality, with its roots in the availability of a natural resource – water – and its impact on food production. This is worrying as decreasing water availability is far from a localised issue – it is a systemic risk across the Middle East and North Africa. Over the coming decades this water security challenge is likely to be further exacerbated by climate change. To better manage these types of risks in the future, and to build societal resilience, the world needs to understand our society’s interdependence on natural resources and how this can lead to events such as those that unfolded in Syria. We need analytical, statistical, scenario or war game-type models to explore different possible futures and policy strategies for mitigating the risk. By understanding sources of political instability we hope to get a better handle on how these types of crisis arise."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Geophysical Research Letters has just published the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research’s crystal ball visions for the monsoons in India, PIK press release here. I’ve highlighted the language to emphasize the speculative nature of the study.
Ups-and-downs of Indian monsoon rainfall likely to increase under warming

Day-to-day rainfall in India might become much more variable due to climate change – potentially putting millions of poor farmers and the country’s agricultural productivity at risk. The Indian monsoon is a complex system which is likely to change under future global warming. While it is in the very nature of weather to vary, the question is how much and whether we can deal with it. Extreme rainfall, for example, bears the risk of flooding, and crop failure. Computer simulations with a comprehensive set of 20 state-of-the-art climate models now consistently show that Indian monsoon daily variability might increase, according to a study just published by scientists of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

‘Increased variability – this rather technical term translates into potentially severe impacts on people who cannot afford additional loss,’ says Anders Levermann, one of the study’s authors and co-chair of PIK’s research domain Sustainable Solutions. ‘The fact that all these different models agree is a clear message that adaptation measures can be built on.'”
Let’s stop right here. Models are pure speculation and only a gambler gambling with someone else’s money would trust them. To get an idea of just how much we ought to trust models, let’s have a look at how global temperature models have been doing so far:

Global temperature model performance thus far: drroyspencer.com/
Sorry Anders. I don’t mean to be picking on you today, but the “state-of-the-art climate models” have been crap so far, to put it diplomatically. As one reader commented over at WUWT, “98% (TM) of climate models say that 97% of climate scientists are wrong!”
The PIK press release continues:

Even if seasonal mean precipitation would remain unchanged, impacts could be substantial, Levermann points out. “Focusing on the average is not always useful. If rainfall comes in a spell and is followed by a drought, this can be devastating even if the average is normal. This requires the right kind of adaptation measures that account for this variability – such as intelligent insurance schemes, for example.” 
‘Limiting global warming is key, adaptation cannot replace but rather complement it’
The strongest change of 13 to 50 percent is found in a scenario in which greenhouse gases continue to be emitted unabated. However, even if global warming would be limited to the internationally acknowledged threshold of 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, this would bear the risk of additional day-to-day variability between 8 and 24 percent above the pre-industrial level, according to the analysis. ‘So limiting global warming is key to reduce day-to-day monsoon variability, adaptation cannot replace but rather complement it,’ says Levermann.”
The above monsoon variability claim is an assumption based WAGs (wild ass guesses) built into models. It’s pure speculation, and has no better quality than the global temperature models presented above.
The researchers focused on the ten models with the most realistic monsoon pattern – a conservative approach, as these ten models yield generally lower rates of change. The other ten models showed higher rates of change. ‘This is not about exact percentages. It is the clear trend that conveys the message,’ says Arathy Menon, lead-author of the study. The scientists used the latest ensemble of climate models, prepared for the 5th assessement report of the International Panel on Climate Change. All of them show increased variability.
‘This is a robust indicator’
Taking into account all 20 models, the spread of results reduces when the scientists looked at the rainfall changes per degree of global warming independent of the exact time path of the warming. The consistent result is that 4 to 12 percent variability change of daily monsoon rainfall in India are to be expected per degree Celsius of warming. ‘This is a robust indicator,’ says Menon.”
The “ensemble of models” used have been completely wrong so far, as Dr. Roy Spencer’s chart above shows. Faulty climate models cannot possibly be used as a basis for a “robust indicator”.
About 80 percent of annual rainfall in India occur during the monsoon season from June through September. Factors that could perturb rainfall regularity include the higher holding capacity of moisture of the warmer air, but also more complex phenomena like cooling in the higher atmosphere which changes current pressure and thereby rainfall patterns.

"In the UK, roughly a third of the food grown in the field never actually makes into anybody’s mouth. For every three pigs raised on a farm, the equivalent of one will ultimately be sent to landfill. A third of all apples, perfectly good for consumption, will somehow be discarded. The message is simple: we waste food, and we waste a lot of it. Food waste is a global problem,  but in the developed world, where our farming and manufacturing practices are efficient, the food waste that occurs at these early stages is largely unavoidable (meat bones, egg shells, banana peel and the like).  Conversely, in UK homes – where 7m of the 13m tonnes of food waste comes from each year – 77% of waste is either avoidable (at some point, it has been perfectly good food) or possibly avoidable (food that some people eat, but others don’t, such as potato skins and meat fat). This is akin to throwing away one shopping bag in five as you leave the supermarket – with an annual cost to a family of four of more than £740.  Clearly, not all food waste is equal. The cost and environmental impact of a kilo of beef is much higher than that of a kilo of potatoes, as would be expected. And so with short shelf-life food categories. Fresh produce, bakery, meats and dairy top the most wasted list – and have the largest energy, CO2, and water footprints – and so should be the main focus for reducing waste. It seems too easy to say that it is the responsibility of consumers to reduce these ridiculous levels of waste. And it is too easy. A couple of years ago, Professor Tim Lang wrote here about food waste being a symptom of a much bigger problem, explaining that the relative low cost of food almost forces a consumer society to buy more food than it can eat. It is arguably the economic powerhouses (in this case, the food giants) that drive this through brand advertising, store layouts and clever pricing strategies. So the question is now: isn’t it the food providers’ responsibility to reduce food waste? Well, the answer is that both providers and consumers have a part to play. For the consumers, the argument for this is easy: wasting less food equals saving more money, and you feel good for doing less harm to the environment. For the providers (manufacturers and retailers), the drive is less clear: selling less food equals less profit. So how can food providers help consumers reduce food waste, but still remain profitable? There are a few options, but some of them are not easy to swallow. The price of food seems a pretty obvious place to start. Consumers currently spend around 11% of their income on food and drink. Five decades ago, the proportion was three times higher, so naturally people wasted less. In sub-Saharan Africa, where consumers spend half of their income on food, it would be difficult to envisage high levels of waste. But increasing the price of food such that consumers “value” it more is likely to be very unpopular – and such a move would fly in the face of the modern food industry and its apparently eternal price wars. Looking at the statistics, it appears that a large proportion of food waste is due to products with short shelf-lives not being used in time. Consequently, there is potential for improvements in food processing or packaging and storage to increase the useable life of such products and reduce the potential for spoilage before use.  But given that leading supermarkets demand 90% of product life at the point of store entry, and goods already have extended lifetimes due to already excessive packaging and protective atmospheres, significant increases in shelf-life are unlikely.  A brave move might be to abolish “use-by” and “best-before” dates (we didn’t have them before the 1970s), but this would open up a legislative can of worms. Until somebody invents a device that can reliably tell whether a leg of lamb has gone off, I suspect these dates are likely to stay. You could just make sure you eat the food before it goes bad, but the nation’s already bulging waistline might struggle with this extra consumption. Food waste via overconsumption is yet another issue. Perhaps the greatest improvement would be to completely change the food provision market. Consumers are like micro-manufacturers: they buy stock (ingredients) and use processes (cook) to meet a demand (their family’s hunger). But unlike manufacturers, consumers aren’t very good at managing their inventory, using their processes efficiently or predicting demand accurately. This leads to food waste.  There is therefore an argument for food providers to help consumers meet their families’ needs by selling meals, not food. It’s not inconceivable to imagine in the future people planning meals and then ordering them off the internet for home delivery – it might build better relationships between providers and consumers, too. Even if consumers pay more for food which is delivered when wanted and actually gets eaten, it would be more convenient and could well end up being  cheaper overall. Whichever approaches materialise to successfully reduce food waste, one thing is certain: there needs to be a collaborative, mutually beneficial approach for both providers and consumers. Only with this market-level change can we expect the amount of food we throw away to diminish."

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnce again German meteorologists are reminding us how the predictions of warm, snowless winters made in 2000 are turning out to be completely false, as Bild writes here, just when Germany gets socked by more snow and cold.
A few days ago I wrote a post about Mojib Latif postponing warm winters by up to 100 years into the future as a result. It seems indeed much of what Latif writes and says needs to be taken with much caution. Not everything he says is accurate. In fact sometimes he plays it a little fast and loose with the truth.
In the very same interview at klimaretter, he is quoted as saying (my emphasis):
When I was a kid in the 1960s, we sometimes still had snow at Easter. In the meantime we have really forgotten how a winter really appears – and there can be winters also in times of global warming.”
Well, he was a kid growing up in Hamburg. So just how many snow-blanketed Easters did Hamburg see in the 1960s? We know it saw one hell of a hurricane that makes Sandy look like a picnic.
Latif used the word “sometimes” to describe the frequency of “having snow at Easter” in the 1960s, implying 3, 4, or maybe 5 times. It would be stretch calling 2 times “sometimes”. Once is certainly not “sometimes”.

Sorry I have to do this, but what follows are the Easter snow ON THE GROUND statistics in cm for Hamburg of the 1960s, looking at Holy Thursday through Easter Monday:
1960: 14-18 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1961: 30 March – 3 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1962: 19-23 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1963: 11-15 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1964: 26-30 March; 0,0,0,0,3cm
1965: 15-19 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1966: 7-11 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1967: 23-27 March; 0,0,0,0,0
1968: 11-15 April; 0,0,0,0,0
1969: 3-7 April; 0,0,0,0,0
Of the 50 days of Easter-time during the 1960s, only one single day saw snow in Hamburg – a whole 3 cm on Easter Monday, March 30, 1964!
Maybe there’s a good reason why people don’t recall the winters that Mojib says we supposedly used to have. Perhaps it’s because they never really occurred as he claims they did. Or did Mojib spend his Easters up in the mountains during his childhood and he’s confusing them with Hamburg?
We don’t want to be too hard on Mojib, as it is true that the 1960s were colder than say the 1990s or 2000s.
But if someday you should ever find yourself drinking a beer together with Mojib and he starts telling his fishing stories, just remember his Easter snow stories.

"Nine more people in Bristol and 13 in Derby are going to have a stroke because of air pollution. Dirty air will give 12 more people in Birmingham and 87 in London a heart attack. In Liverpool, seven extra children with asthma will be hospitalised, as will five more in Nottingham. These stark figures from King’s College London on the impact of high pollution days on individual towns are a reminder that dirty air is a killer and that the climate emergency is a health emergency.  But it is also a clear warning that while the NHS and local government are gradually getting to grips with the air pollution crisis, piecemeal solutions will fail without massive government action. Cutting air pollution by a fifth would result in 77 fewer children in Oxford and 150 in Southampton suffering low lung function each year. Twenty fewer people in Manchester and 17 in Liverpool would develop lung cancer. Like the microscopic particles themselves, air pollution is sometimes difficult to detect in the climate emergency debate. It is certainly part of the narrative, but the immediacy and severity of its threat is yet to be highlighted fully by campaigners. It is hard to think of a more compelling message than we are being poisoned in our own homes, right now, every day. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has been one of the most outspoken campaigners, ramming home the message that 86% of UK children are breathing dangerous levels of toxic air. The harm even begins before birth: a Belgian study found thousands of pollution particles per cubic millimetre of tissue in every one of 25 placentas they examined of non-smoking women in a low-pollution town. One of the key advisers to the college is clinical researcher Professor Stephen Holgate. His expert evidence was crucial in persuading the high court to overturn the coroner’s verdict that nine-year-old Lewisham girl Ella Kissi-Debrah’s death in 2013 was caused by asthma. Her mother, Rosamund, wants the new inquest next year to consider whether Ella was killed by air pollution. Such a verdict would be a world first.  Public services are beginning to mobilise. The NHS is responsible for a third of the public sector’s carbon emissions, while health and social care together account for around 6% of the carbon footprint of England. Although these emissions have fallen by approximately 20% over the past decade, the NHS has struggled to make reduction a central goal. But that is changing. The King’s College analysis brutally exposes that this a health crisis. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens is now pushing that argument, giving licence for NHS organisations to act. Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust has declared a climate emergency and is tackling the problem with energy and creativity, looking at everything from ambulances to anaesthetic gas. Greater Manchester and its mayor, Andy Burnham, are aiming to make the city carbon neutral by 2038, with plans including taking control of the bus network and tackling heavily polluting coaches, lorries and taxis. But Scottish Power has exposed the deception behind the UK government’s declared aim of zero carbon emissions by 2050. It estimates that to achieve this the UK will need 25m charging points for electric vehicles – which means installing 4,000 a day – and 23m electric heat pumps to replace home gas boilers, all at a cost of £300bn. This rams home the scale of action required if the zero emissions target is to be anything other than meaningless rhetoric. Looking at the fiasco around the rollout of fast broadband, such a gargantuan change to our infrastructure – never mind our lifestyles – looks far beyond our reach. Local public services have big contribution to make to cleaning up our air. But without a huge push from central government we are doomed to keep hearing rubbish as we breathe dirt."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman flagship news magazine Spiegel Online today has an article authored by Axel Bojanowski which takes a close look at the recent John Cook survey. German alarmists like the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research hailed it as proof that climate science was settled and done.
But Spiegel draws a different a totally conclusion.
First Bojanowski describes how a large number of Americans have serious doubts when it comes to man-made climate change, and so surveys get conducted with the aim of trying to sway public opinion. The latest was carried out by John Cook of the University of Queensland in Australia, and the results were published in the journal of Environmental Research Letters: 97% of thousands of papers surveyed agree that climate change is man-made, it asserted.
But Bojanowski trashes the findings:
There’s an obvious discrepancy between the public perception and reality. The authors speak about ‘consensus on man-made climate change’ – and thus this threatens to further increase confusion within the public. The survey confirms only a banality: Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that man is responsible for at least a part of the climate warming. The important question of how big is man’s part in climate change remains hotly disputed.
In the draft of the next UN report that will summarize climate science knowledge in September, it is stated: ‘It is extremely likely that human activity is responsible for more than half of the warming since the 1950s.’ The estimations from scientists on the exact extent vary vastly – here the consensus ends.”
Bojanowski then gives Spiegel readers the results produced by Cook: “About two thirds took no position on the subject – they remained on the sidelines. 97% of the rest supported man-made impact.

Also in an additional step, 35% of the authors who took no position were left out of the survey results altogether.
A new German survey produces similar results: no consensus!
Bojanowski then reports on another still unpublished German survey conducted by the University of Mainz in Germany. Senja Post told SPIEGEL ONLINE that “123 of 292 climate scientists asked participated in the study“. The result (warmists may want to sit down before reading):
Only 5% of those responding believed natural factors played the main role in the warming. However, Post then asked about the extent of the man-made warming. The result looked very different. Only 59% of the scientists said the ‘climate development of the last 50 years was mostly influenced by man’s activity. One quarter of those surveyed said that human and natural factors played an equal role’.”
Only 10% of German scientists say computer models are sufficiently accurate
Bojanowski then writes that skepticism is even far more widespread when it comes to the reliability of computer models. “Only 10% said climate models are ‘sufficiently accurate’ and only 15% said that ‘climatic processes are understood enough’ to allow climate to be calculated.”
Bojanowski sums up: “There’s plenty of fodder there to continue the ideologically influenced debate about climate – no matter what is said about consensus.”

"Forget about oil or gas – you should be worrying about the less discussed but far more concerning fact that the world is running out of clean, drinkable water. I wrote this article while in Kathmandu. Nepal’s capital and largest city has a severe water shortage. Even though all homeowners pay a fee to the government to get water on tap, supplies run only once a week for a few hours. Desperate residents are then forced to purchase water from private suppliers. While this is affordable for richer people, it’s a big problem for the lower and middle classes. For many in the developing world, water is really the difference between prosperity and poverty. More than a billion people around the world have no reasonable access to fresh water. Most of the diseases in developing countries are associated with water, causing millions of deaths each year (a child is estimated to die from diarrhoea every 17 seconds). Given all this, we have to come up with a solution to global water use fast, before water scarcity becomes a major cause of international conflict. The vast majority of our water is found in the oceans. Only 3% is fresh and can be used for farming and drinking, and in any case most of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. That means just 0.5% of the Earth’s water is accessible and, of this, more than two thirds is used in agriculture.  If we’re going to cut back on our water usage, we have to focus on making our farms more sustainable and efficient. With the global population still growing, we’ll need to produce ever more crops using less water, in less agricultural land. Worldwide, just over a third (37%) of the land that could be used to grow crops is currently used. Potential farmland is available, but it’s not developed due a lack of infrastructure, forest cover or conservation. A lack of land isn’t really a big problem as of now – but water is.  So how to grow crops using less water? One option would be to find a sustainable way to remove salt from our (essentially infinite) reserves of sea water. The farm in South Australia pictured below uses energy from the sun to extract seawater and desalinate it to create fresh water, which can be used to grow crops in large greenhouses.  Such farms are based in barren areas, and the plants are grown with hydroponics systems that don’t require soil. Growing crops like this all year round would significantly reduce freshwater usage in hot and dry regions, but the cost of setting up these greenhouses remains an issue. Water shortages would also ease significantly if farmers could simply use less water to produce the same yield. Easier said than done, of course, but this is especially important in drought-prone areas. Plant scientists around the world are busy identifying genes that enable plant growth in arid, dry conditions. For example, what is it that makes upland rice grow in dry soil while lowland rice requires well irrigated paddy fields for growth? Once the keys to drought tolerance are identified, they can be introduced in crops through genetic engineering (and no, this doesn’t involve injecting food with toxins as suggested by a Google image search). Farmers traditionally bred drought tolerant crops through the slow and painstaking process of selection and crossing over many generations. Genetic engineering (GE) provides a short-cut. A recent study identified diverse root architecture systems in different chickpea varieties. Future studies hope to identify genes that make some roots efficient at capturing water and nutrients from dry soils. Once a genetic factor is identified, scientists are able to directly deliver the gene that helps plants to capture more water. A key factor for drought-tolerance in plants is the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), which increases plants’ water efficiency in droughts. But ABA also reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis, which reduces plant growth in the longer term, and as a result crop yields decrease. But plants didn’t always have this trade-off: modern crops have lost a key gene that enabled early land plants like mosses to tolerate extreme dehydration. This enabled early plants to colonise land from freshwater around 500m years ago. Modern desert mosses also collect water through their leaves which helps them to grow in dry conditions.  This is the big challenge for plant scientists. To engineer crops that can be grown with minimum irrigation and that will eventually help relieve water scarcity, we’ll have to reintroduce the dehydration tolerance systems which many “higher” plants have lost but things like moss have necessarily retained. Genetic engineering remains controversial even though extensive scientific studies report GE crops available in the markets are safe for consumption. This is partly just a communication failure. But the fact is we will eventually need to use all the tech available to us, and GE crops have too much potential to ignore."
"Republicans in the US have axed Obama-era anti-corruption rules for energy and mining companies. The move, which is awaiting sign-off by President Trump, reverses years of progress in a sector often accused of dodgy dealings. It also threatens to kick off a global race to the bottom, as countries compete to offer oil firms the murkiest business environment.  The rule in question is a requirement for American oil, gas and mining companies to publicly disclose all payments of US$100,000 or more to foreign governments in connection with projects abroad. A version of the rule was first adopted in 2012 under the Dodd-Frank Act, passed in response to the financial crisis. After several years of legal battles with industry lobbyists, the latest version was implemented in 2016. On February 3 the Republican-controlled Senate passed a resolution to scrap the requirement entirely. The resolution has already passed through the House of Representatives, and Trump is expected to give final approval within days. Energy firms have always been bitterly opposed to these rules – and for good reason. For decades, many of them have used corruption to exploit developing countries that are resource-rich but badly governed. As far back as 1976 the Watergate scandal revealed several well-known American oil companies had counterfeited their records abroad or utilised shell companies  in tax havens such as the Bahamas. It is not surprising that Rex Tillerson, Trump’s new secretary of state, personally lobbied against those transparency rules when he was Exxon’s top executive. The Republicans have sided firmly with the energy firms. The latest resolution was sponsored by Senator James Inhofe from oil-rich Oklahoma, a man who once displayed a snowball in congress to show global warming wasn’t happening. In the Senate, Inhofe argued the previous transparency “struck at the heart of American competitiveness” by making public information held by the US’s “very best companies” on “how to win oil and gas deals” – information that foreign competitors don’t have to provide. In other words, in the wake of President Trump’s desire to cut regulations for American businesses, the Republicans have decided to deliberately give a green light to secret and potentially corrupt deals abroad – all to protect the competitiveness of US energy companies. Trump was supposed to be a champion of impoverished middle class Americans, of course, shunned by a corrupt political establishment. More and more that looks like a bad joke. A series of blatant conflicts of interest and special political interventions are proving just the opposite.  Across the world, the energy sector is particularly prone to corruption. Partly, this is down to the uneven distribution of oil and gas reserves which boosts their geopolitical importance and means countries who need to import energy may feel they’re forced to bend or break the rules. The concentration of enormous amounts of wealth in relatively few countries and firms also gives the sector “an unfair advantage in the political marketplace”, with professional lobbyists able to influence government decisions. Energy industry corruption is so pervasive that a country can even discover lots of oil and gas and yet still see its development decline – a paradoxical phenomenon known as “resource curse”. The Niger delta provides a perfect example, where vast oil reserves have led to conflict and a tremendous amount of crude spilled from pipelines has harmed the local environment and people. Yet despite this grim scenario, the sector was actually becoming less corrupt before the latest intervention. The process started in the 1970s after the public condemnation that followed Watergate. It was then indirectly fostered by further economic globalisation, which inherently requires a trading system with at least some transparency and fair dealing. Over the past two decades anti-corruption laws were passed at the international level by organisations like the UN or the OECD, while individual countries imposed their own rules like the UK’s Bribery Act 2010. In the US, opposition to corruption made it into the Obama administration’s National Security Strategy which was adopted in May 2010. Three years later the EU, following America’s example, adopted a new Accounting Directive, which requires oil, gas and mining companies to publish details of payments made during their commercial operations.  The complete change in the US’s anti-corruption strategy risks sending everyone back to the old days where multinational corporations acted with impunity. In fact, it is hard to believe that other virtuous countries will continue to impose transparency rules that are more stringent than those applicable to the firms of the world’s largest economy. Congress’s decision represents a major blow to global anti-corruption efforts. And, as the Panama Papers demonstrated for the umpteenth time, corruption primarily benefits the dominant class of a country. No wonder politicians are rarely serious about tackling it."
"Paradoxically, of the one billion people classified as food insecure by the United Nations, about 500 million are smallholder farmers in developing economies. Some of these producers are exporting luxuries such as coffee, cocoa, exotic fruits and sugar for consumers in developed economies. Due to poor and volatile prices coupled with unfair trade rules, they simply don’t earn enough to feed their families all year round and often experience the problem of seasonal hunger between harvests.  This lack of nourishment can lead to stunting, weakened immune systems and more vulnerability to disease and infection. Children are particularly vulnerable, as periods of under-nutrition can hinder both their physical and mental development. Seasonal hunger is a serious problem for many coffee and cocoa farmers. Smallholder coffee farmers in three Central American countries were found to have no guarantee of food security for three to four months every year. Fairtrade was set up initially to work with marginalised smallholder farmers as a “a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect that seeks greater equity in international trade”.  Sales of Fairtrade products have grown to €7.3 billion (£6.3 billion) working with 1,230 producer organisations consisting of 1.6m farmers. Fairtrade certification actively supports producers in developing countries through importing and retailing their products. Moreover, acting as a social movement, fair trade campaigns for changes in the conventional terms and conditions of international trade which disadvantage producers in developing economies.  The movement prioritises socioeconomic factors by working to facilitate market access for producers, paying producers a fair minimum price which provides producers a guaranteed price when the world market price falls below this level. The stability of the Fairtrade minimum price means that producer cooperatives may be able to obtain finances and credit services. Cooperatives also gain security from longer-term contracts with exporters through the Fairtrade market.  In addition, whatever the conventional market price, producers in the Fairtrade system are also paid a social premium per tonne of produce (for cocoa it is US$200 per tonne) which is used for community infrastructure projects such as crop diversification schemes to combine cash and food crops, building schools, water provision and health services.  Jane Sepkazi, 36, a member of the Sireet OEP tea co-operative in Kenya, is one of the farmers who have been trained by their Fairtrade partners to grow different crops as part of her organisation’s plan to increase food security for farmers. The idea is to make farmers less reliant on tea for their income and offer ways to use their land to produce food. Sepkazi lives on her 0.2-hectare farm with her parents and two children and as well as tea, she has chickens and a kitchen garden. “I’ve been taught poultry keeping so I don’t rely just on my tea crop,” she said. The impact of Fairtrade is significant. A study by the Center for Evaluation at Saarland University in Germany found that smallholder farmers who benefited from Fairtrade enjoyed higher and more stable incomes than producers in the respective comparison groups. A further study involving coffee farmers in Uganda showed that participation in Fairtrade increased household living standards by 30% and significantly reduced the
prevalence and depth of poverty. Banana farmer Julio Mercado Cantillo, 57, lives on his farm in Macondo, Colombia, with his wife Alicia, children and grandchildren. For Cantillo, one of the benefits of Fairtrade has been better and more stable prices for his bananas, which has improved his income and the food security of his family. Cantillo explains: When we began growing bananas, it was tough. There were some days when we only had one meal. Since we joined Fairtrade, everything has changed. We now have all of our daily meals and we have also managed from the extra income from Fairtrade to buy farm animals which provides an extra source of food, and the opportunity to bring in more income by selling the animals. Nicaragua is the second poorest country in Latin America after Haiti and during the “thin season” before the coffee harvest, farmers in central Nicaragua often rely on food programmes to feed their children. To tackle this, the COOMPROCOM coffee cooperative has invested its Fairtrade Premium income in programmes that focus on food and nutritional security in the community. These include setting up a revolving fund that allows farmers to access quick loans to make emergency purchases of food. Another is a programme focusing on child nutrition that encourages farmers to grow food crops (such as beans, rice, tomatoes and corn) and diversify diets so that they are less reliant on food purchases. To help tackle the problem of seasonal hunger, the Fairtrade movement has also given birth to some very interesting financial institutions such as Shared Interest, Oikocredit and Cordiad which provide social finance for innovative trade mechanisms for smallholder farmer groups such as pre-finance for individual orders, credits and loans for stock facilities and pre-harvest loans when cash flow is a major problem for producers. Being part of the Fairtrade system provides a very useful safety net for smallholder farmers, but it can’t do everything in isolation. Fairtrade works best when it operates as part of a bigger system – within a framework of collaboration backed by supportive policy at national and local level and coupled with meaningful commitments from business.  There is still much work to be done to continue the positive impact of Fairtrade – the movement needs to keep the pressure on both policy makers and business leaders to ensure consumers can choose Fairtrade at the point of purchase. In the UK, Fairtrade companies are having to fight hard to maintain their position on the supermarket shelf – and the movement needs to redouble its efforts to communicate with consumers to explain how their purchase of Fairtrade goods can help people like Sepkazi and the Cantillo family keep their heads above water even when times are tough. _This article is part of a series by The Conversation on food security.

"Engineering firms are under increased pressure from their own employees to abandon controversial fossil fuel projects, as the sector turns its attention to the climate crisis. About 1,000 Australian engineers and 90 organisations – including large firms and respected industry figures who have worked with fossil fuel companies – have signed a declaration to “evaluate all new projects against the environmental necessity to mitigate climate change”. As the Australian Engineers Declare movement gathers pace, some industry figures say firms that work on Adani’s Carmichael coalmine project face a potential revolt from staff, and might struggle to recruit highly skilled people. In the past few months, integrated services firms Aurecon and Cardno have both announced they would cut ties with Carmichael. The resources lobby has attempted to nullify the impact of environmental activism with veiled threats that companies might be effectively blacklisted from work on other projects. But little attention has been focused on a likely more compelling factor in those decisions – the influence of employees, whose expertise is the only real asset of most firms. “I worked in the fossil fuel extraction industry and I’m proud of the projects I worked on,” says Robert Care, the 2014 professional engineer of the year, and one of the industry’s most influential figures. “But I wouldn’t do that work today, no I wouldn’t.” Care said most engineers could recognise the energy sector was transitioning, and that they should help shape that transition rather than clinging to the way things are. The approach is in contrast to Australia’s resources sector, whose sales pitch has been focused on the provision of jobs in thermal coal. “If we don’t act and act together, then at some stage in the future we will have … disenchanted, disenfranchised people, workers who have been cast aside,” Care said. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “I think we do now know there’s a problem with continuing the way we are. We’ve got to change. Now we know there’s a problem we need to work together. The young engineers I encounter, they understand the concerns and they want to be part of the solution.” Engineers Without Borders Australia interacts with about 10,000 university students through training courses each year. The organisation’s chairman, Gavin Blakey, says young engineers care about building sustainable futures. “As an organisation actively building the engineering workforce of the future, we are seeing an increasing number of students and professionals who passionately believe in the role the sector can play in addressing global challenges,” Blakey said. Michael Green, the director of Bradman Recruitment, said engineers seeking work were clearly prioritising firms that made careful decisions about which projects they worked on. “(Firms) will start having problems recruiting, particularly younger people. The last couple of years the climate emergency concept is there, it is affecting people’s decisions. If you’ve been lucky enough to pick up expertise in renewables, you’re going to be far more favoured by employers than those who don’t.” Next week, environmental activists intend to again ramp up pressure on GHD, an engineering and services company whose statements about its work on Carmichael have not been definitive. GHD has worked as a consultant and contractor for Adani in Australia for almost a decade. In a statement on its website, the company has made clear its contracts expire in December, but has not made clear whether it would consider future work. Care said firms taking on controversial work could face a “revolt” from staff. “GHD are now in the situation where no matter what they do they’re going to draw flack,” he said. “We should be doing everything in our power to say we don’t do projects that are not going to benefit (the community and climate).” One of the world’s most storied engineering firms, Arup, has signed on to Engineers Declare. The 12-point declaration acknowledges that engineers are connected to 65% of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions and pledges to actively work towards a low-carbon future. “Engineers are uniquely placed to make a significant contribution to tacking climate change, through the projects we choose to do and how we choose to do them, our ability to solve complex problems and the investments in research and innovation that we make,” the chair of Arup Australasia, Peter Chamley, said."
"The people of Paris could be using the waterways instead of roads, as early as summer. A new design concept called the Seabubble is due to be piloted in the French capital. The people behind the idea foresee a fleet of small electric hydrofoil taxi vehicles carrying passengers along the Seine, and much like a car sharing arrangement, its designers have even suggested they may be piloted by individual users. Seabubbles, which can seat up to five people and are shaped like a car, employ proven hydrofoil technology which has been in use since Enrico Forlanini first baffled the inhabitants of Italy with it in the early 1900s.  Hydrofoil technology uses an underwater foil or arm which helps to lift the boat’s hull out of the water so that it can coast on the water’s surface. The drag reduction on these fast and efficient modes of water transport means a smoother ride – even in choppy waters. Larger hydrofoils are in use across the world. You can already catch a hydrofoil ferry in St Petersburg, Russia.  If these hydrofoil vehicles were adopted as a city transport, it would provide a fun, silent, electrically propelled and emission-free alternative to spending time in cars or buses on congested roads, or in the gloom of the Paris Metro system. Its designers are reportedly also seeking permission to use them on the Thames in London.  Paris already has an established and successful dry land equivalent in the electric car sharing scheme Autolib, so the Seabubble already has a lot going for it. While the thought of using a water vehicle to get around a city with a 30-mile diameter may seem curious, let’s not forget that water has been used to travel across large cities for years. London, Venice, Hong Kong, Buenos Aires, New York, Auckland, and Rotterdam all use water buses and taxis of some description.  The river system in Paris snakes its way through the city in such a way that many important parts of town would be in easy walking distance from any moored boat. But as promising as this may be, there are still many unanswered questions.  Although water transport is used across the globe, they are all usually operated by a captain, and run along set routes, but Seabubbles’ designers propose that they could be driven by members of the public. Anyone operating a boat in France requires a boat licence. In fact, there are three different licence types, depending on the type of “driving” you intend to do. So whether there would be enough incentive for someone to embark on a lengthy and thorough training course is yet to be seen. It might make more sense for these to exist as a taxi service for most.  It’s fair to assume that navigating the waters would require some measure of seamanship since avoiding collisions with other Seabubbles and drifting objects would present a daily challenge. Larger vessels would also be a constant and inflexible presence on the Seine and if a large quantity of Seabubbles come into use, they will contribute significantly to the on-water traffic, of which there is already plenty. Nevertheless, Seabubbles claim that compared to roads, there would be less objects to hit in the water and that their vehicle is easier to handle than a car. They also suggest that innovative detail solutions could take care of any likely gremlins. Technology such as sonar and sensors could be employed to “read” the water ahead and reduce engine performance when objects are spotted. Or an automatic parking function could self-moor the vehicles once they are within reach of their landing. Seabubbles can reach a speed of 20mph, and although this is seemingly modest, it is actually quite respectable on water. However, water feels firmer at higher speeds so this can put strain on the vehicle body. The stresses on their gliding points are high, and their structure is subject to a high levels of vibration – meaning that hydrofoils require regular and extensive maintenance. This combined with high usage and a potentially changing, relatively inexperienced clientele, means they may come in for frequent repairs.  All this considered, the project already has the backing of the city of Paris. And if the French pilot phase goes well, some of these questions should be answered, and Seabubbles may well provide Paris with another attraction."
"Socially and politically, 2016 was a momentous year for Britain. It was also a record breaking year for energy and the environment, but thankfully for all the right reasons. Britain’s electricity was the cleanest it had been in 60 years, as coal collapsed and renewables rose to record levels. In 2016, just 9.3% of British (not UK – as Northern Ireland is calculated separately) electricity was generated from coal, down from more than 40% in 2012. This is the lowest share coal has ever provided in the system’s 100-plus year history, and the lowest absolute quantity burnt since the start of World War II. In fact, at 10.2% of generation, wind farms produced more electricity, a significant milestone in Britain’s low-carbon transition. Natural gas has picked up most of the slack and posted its best year since 2010; but nuclear, solar and biomass are all also on the rise. The demise of coal means British carbon emissions from electricity generation have halved over the past four years. This is not greenwashing or creative accounting. When factoring in the emissions released abroad from producing electricity and biomass that is then imported, Britain’s electricity sector released 82.4m tonnes of CO2. The last time annual emissions were below 100m tonnes was back in 1955. Emissions were 25% lower than in 2015, so changes in the electricity mix mean that each Briton effectively produced 400kg less CO2 – without lifting a finger. The carbon content of a unit of electricity has fallen to 277 grams per kWh, beating the strict pathway set out in the Climate Change Act’s Carbon Budgets by up to four years. The coal collapse led to a number of other milestones being reached, including solar generation being greater than coal over the months of May, July and August. For the first time since the national grid was established in the 1930s, there were times with no coal generation at all. After first occurring on May 10, there have now been 200 coal-free hours. Scotland’s power sector is now entirely coal free, after its last station at Longannet closed in March. Electricity demand continued its downwards trend, and now stands 20% lower than its 2005 peak, despite the population rising by 5m in that time. Demand is therefore back to levels seen in the late 1980’s, which also contributed to reduced fuel burn and reduced emissions. Wind had a solid year, but annual output fell slightly as the number of storms of late 2015 were not repeated in the 2016 winter. Additional wind farms were deployed, and Britain’s capacity reached a new high of 14.33 GW. This meant that, during Storm Barbara just before Christmas, wind was able to set new records for weekly, daily and hourly output, peaking at 5.30pm on the December 23 when it generated 10.7 GW of electrical power (nearly a quarter of the national total at a peak time of day and year). Solar also had a solid year, with installed capacity surpassing the 10 GW mark, despite fears about subsidy cuts. Throughout the year it amounted to 3.2% of all British output, though at its peak on May 12 it nearly reached 20%. Biomass also posted its highest ever output at 14,198 GWh over the year, up 25% on 2015, and almost double its output in 2014. Output should continue its upwards trend now that the third coal unit at Drax power station in Yorkshire has permission to be converted to biomass (this means it will burn wood pellets imported from the US – a practice more sustainable than it sounds). Renewables have seen a dramatic rise in Great Britain, with just over 28 GW of wind, solar and biomass installed – around 1 kW for every household. This is five times more than just five years ago, and as of December 2016, Britain has more renewables (combined) than any other type of generation, beating even gas turbines. Putting together renewables, nuclear, and imports from France (which are almost all nuclear and hydro), Britain hit the milestone of supplying more than half its electricity from low carbon sources in the summer of 2016, up from 20% in 2010. It seems Britain’s low-carbon transition is proceeding at full force. Renewable capacity and output are breaking new records, a combination of carbon taxes, fuel prices and clean-air legislation have forced coal down to levels not seen for two generations, and demand is falling thanks to improving energy efficiency. After a decade of relative stagnation in the 2000s, the 2010s have marked a dramatic shift, resulting in emissions halving in just four years.
A bit of good news to start 2017. The data used in this article is based on the Energy Charts and Electric Insights websites, which allow readers to visualise and explore data on generation and consumption from Elexon and National Grid. Data from other analyses (such as BEIS or DUKES) will differ due to methodology, and particularly by including combined heat and power, and other on-site generation which is not monitored by National Grid and Elexon. Our estimated carbon emissions are based on Iain Staffell’s research published in Energy Policy, and account for foreign emissions due to electricity imports and biomass fuel processing."

"Humans have a much longer and wider penis than the other great apes. Even the largest of gorillas, more than twice as heavy as a human, will have a penis just two and half inches long when erect. However our testicles are rather small. A chimpanzee’s testes weigh more than a third of its brain while ours weigh in at less than 3%. The relative size of our penis and testes is all down to our mating strategies, and can provide some surprising insights into early human culture. Primates exhibit all sorts of mating behaviour, including monogamous, polygynous – where males have multiple mates – and multimale-multifemale. One indicator of which behaviour occurs in a species is the size difference between males and females. The greater this sexual dimorphism, the more likely the mating is either polygynous or multi-male to multi-female. This can be shown by observing chimpanzees and gorillas, our closest living relatives.  Male chimpanzees are much larger than females, and they have a multi-male to multi-female mating system. Essentially, male chimps have sex all the time with any female and with any excuse. A female therefore may contain sperm from multiple partners at any one time, which puts the sperm itself – and not just the animals that produce it – into direct competition. For this reason, chimpanzees have evolved huge testicles in order to produce massive amounts of sperm, multiple times a day. Male gorilla are also much larger than females, but they have a polygynous or harem-style mating system where many females live with a single male. With little or no competition actually inside the uterus, gorillas have had no need for a testicular arms race to facilitate the production of more and more sperm. Their testes, therefore, are relatively small. This is similar to modern humans, whose testes are also of very modest size and produce a relatively small amount of sperm. In fact human sperm count reduces by more than 80% if men ejaculate more than about two times a day. The human penis is large when compared with those of our closest relatives: chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. However, primatologist Alan Dixson in his wonderfully detailed book, Primate Sexuality, suggests that if we look at all primates, including monkeys, this is just wishful thinking.  Comparative measurements show the human penis is not exceptionally long. The Hamadryas baboon, for instance, a native of the Horn of Africa, has an erect penis that is five and half inches long – slightly shorter than an average human male, but they weigh only a third of our weight.   The human penis is in fact extremely dull – it does not have lumps, ridges, flanges, kinks or any other exciting feature that other primates have. In primates, this lack of penis complexity is usually found in monogamous species. This observation clashes with the fact that men are significantly larger than women. This suggests our evolutionary background involved a significant degree of polygynous, rather than exclusively monogamous, mating. This is supported by anthropological data showing that most modern human populations engage in polygynous marriage. Anthropologists Clellan Ford and Frank Beach in their book Patterns of Sexual Behaviour suggested that 84% of the 185 human cultures they had data on engaged in polygyny. However, even in these societies most people remain monogamous. Polygynous marriages are usually a privilege reserved only for high status or wealthy men. It is worth noting that hunter-gathers around the world practice only monogamy or serial-monogamy which suggests that our ancestors may have used this mating system.  At first sight, however, it would seem sensible for males to reproduce with as many females as possible. Human monogamy has long puzzled anthropologists, and lots of effort has gone in to working out what keeps males hanging around. Three main theories have been put forward. First is the need for long-term parental care and teaching, as our children take a long time to mature. Second, males need to guard their female from other males. Third, our children are vulnerable for a long time and infanticide could be a risk from other males. So to ensure that children are able to reach maturity the male is likely to stay to protect them, both socially and physically. This may be why males have maintained their larger relative size. If we view the evolution of monogamy mating systems in humans through the lens of human society it is clear that it takes a huge amount of social effort to maintain and protect more than one mate at a time. It is only when males have access to additional resources and power that they can protect multiple females, usually by ensuring other males protect them. So monogamy seems to be an adaptation to protect one’s mate and children from other males. This monogamy is reinforced by the high social cost and stress of attempting to do this for multiple partners, and it has become supported by cultural norms. So when living in complex human societies the largest and most important sexual organ is the brain. Somewhere in our evolutionary past how smart and social we are became the major control on our access to sexual partners – not how big or fancy a male’s penis is."
"Lake Chad is a hydrological miracle – a life-giving, freshwater lake in the Sahara desert. But the region around the lake has been engulfed in a violent crisis for more than a decade, which has left nearly 10 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Military crackdowns on insurgent groups such as Boko Haram have failed to end the violence. Bringing durable peace to the region requires unpicking a Gordian knot of many interlinked factors: poverty, sectarian mistrust, political marginalisation and corruption. The risks posed by the climate crisis to the rainfall-dependent livelihoods of the people of Lake Chad are an important strand of this challenge.  For years, the prevailing narrative about Lake Chad is that it has been in inexorable decline as a result of the over-extraction of water and climate crisis. A much-repeated factoid is that the lake shrunk by 90% between the 1960s and the 1990s. This statistic is employed to back up a compelling series of causal links to explain the many problems that the region faces. The story goes as follows: the declining lake has done farmers and fishermen out of their jobs, who have been recruited into armed groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State, fuelling the ongoing violence that blights the region. Under this logic, refilling the lake might seem a step worth taking – to reverse the decline of both lake and region. And the Inter Basin Water Transfer project proposes to do just that. It calls on international donors to bankroll the 2,400km (1,500 mile) Transaqua canal from the Ubangi river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Lake Chad, through war-torn Central African Republic, at an estimated cost of $50bn (£39bn) – roughly a third of the annual global aid budget. A feasibility study is already under way. Nigeria, with the support of the African Development Bank, is actively looking to raise the money needed for the project. Our two-year study of climate change and security risks in the Lake Chad region charts the hydrological health of the lake over the last 30 years. The conclusion – uncomfortably for the pipeline’s proponents – is that the lake is not actually shrinking. True, the size of the lake did fall steeply between the 1960s and the 1990s. True, the lake fluctuates dramatically over the course of each year and across decades. However, since the 1990s Lake Chad’s size has, on average, been stable. By some measures, it has even been growing. The story of an ever-shrinking lake has been built on snapshots of data – the extremes of lake size in the 1960s and 1990s – taken out of their wider context. It has proved to be a doubly convenient narrative for leaders in the region: it takes the spotlight off serious governance failures, which set the stage for the conflict in the first place, and it also makes the case for a highly lucrative, technical fix as the solution. The danger is that the canal will not address the various problems facing the region and instead, at best, provide multiple opportunities for corruption and personal enrichment for those involved and, at worst, exacerbate the region’s environmental and conflict challenges. Let’s be crystal clear here: we are not suggesting that the Lake Chad region is immune to the effects of the climate crisis, quite the opposite. Temperatures in the region are rising one and a half times faster than the global average. The unpredictability brought by climate change is worsening the political and economic conditions that gave rise to the violence in the first place. But, so far at least, it is not happening due to a shrinking lake. Lake Chad is caught in a conflict trap that undermines people’s ability to deal with the changes that an increasingly variable climate is bringing. A thorough, fact-based understanding of the interlinked climate and conflict risks facing Lake Chad is fundamental to appropriate solutions to ensure that hugely costly responses do not actually make things worse.

"It must have been an incredibly morbid sight. Walkers on Marazion beach in Cornwall, at the south-western tip of mainland Britain, recently discovered tens of thousands of dead fish had been washed ashore overnight. One eyewitness told the Plymouth Herald the fish stretched “as far as the eye could see”.  People speculated that pollution or natural predators such as dolphins or porpoises chasing the fish ashore may be to blame. But a much simpler explanation soon unfolded when the Cornish Sardine Management Association said that one of its vessels had been fishing close inshore and had had to release one of its catches for safety reasons.  Exactly what happened in this case remains unclear. But why would a ship ever need to dump fish for safety reasons? After all, catching lots of fish is surely the entire point. In any case, a European Union discard ban was first implemented in 2015 in order to stop this sort of thing.  The ban applies to the discarding of commercially valuable species for which an EU catch quota is set. The process is being phased in gradually and first on the list are “pelagic” fish like mackerel or herring that live in the midwater to close to the surface of the sea. These species of fish were chosen because they are seen as the least complicated fisheries that generally have few bycatch species associated with them.  Other more complex fisheries like those for cod, Norway lobsters (scampi) and Dover sole, that have a greater mix of species in their catches, will gradually come under the rules of the discard ban. By 2019, all quota species will be encompassed by the legislation. TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s Fish Fight campaign successfully made it seem abhorrent to throw back perfectly edible fish simply because a vessel had no quota. Yet the Marazion stranding highlights the potential tension between well-intended legislation designed to reduce waste, and the issue of vessel safety and perhaps unintended consequences of management measures.  Most of the fish in question were reported to be sardines. At present, sardines are not a quota species and hence are exempt from the EU’s discards ban, which means there is probably no further cause for concern from a legal perspective.  But thousands of dead fish on a popular beach is a horrible sight, whatever the law says. It makes fishermen appear wasteful and creates a negative impression of the entire fishing industry.  Although fishing is a highly sophisticated business these days, it remains imperfect. Mistakes can happen, however experienced the skipper.  In sardine fishing, the net is typically laid around the shoal and tightened like a bag. The net is then retrieved slowly to the side of the vessel and the fish are brought aboard. In the case of the Marazion deaths, the vessels involved will be relatively small and have limited storage space so keeping everything balanced is crucial. If by sheer bad luck the net encircled a shoal of fish that was larger than the skipper realised, the boat is immediately put in a dangerous situation. A large catch on one side of the vessel will create an imbalance that will make it much more prone to capsizing when in rough seas. A fisherman died off the coast of nearby Devon in 2012 when his heavily-laden trawler capsized in similar circumstances.  Therefore if the catch is physically too large to retrieve, the vessel would have no choice other than to release the bottom of the net so that the catch falls away. So surely the fish will swim off? Sadly not in this case. Many midwater species like sardines and mackerel are quite delicate and vulnerable to damage due to the high number of fish caught in the net. In this instance the sardines would most likely likely have been incapacitated as a result of being hauled to the side of the vessel, and when released from the net they would have been washed ashore with the action of tide and waves. No one wants this to happen – not least the fishermen themselves. Improving the welfare of fish within nets is an emerging area of research, as reducing stress during capture improves the quality (and price) of the fish that end up in restaurants.  Sonar that can better estimate the size of schools of fish, along with other improvements to fishing technology, will gradually eliminate the sort of mistakes that led to the reported fish kill. Fishermen have every incentive to adopt these technologies as slipping fish is not only undesirable, but also a dangerous, even life-threatening situation."
"While the energy in fossil fuels is valuable for society, burning them has well documented environmental consequences – global warming, smog and the effects of nitrous and sulphur oxides. Many think the time has come to stop burning them almost entirely. This led to the Guardian launching a campaign a couple of years ago to “keep it in the ground”, which attracted much support.  The Paris Agreement is a shift in this direction with its commitment to keep the global temperature rise this century to 2℃. But within days of it coming into force last November, Donald Trump was elected American president. He wants the US to withdraw from the agreement and has appointed a fossil fuels champion, Rex Tillerson, as secretary of state.  There may however be a way to reconcile these two sides that is not being discussed. Instead of burning gas and coal in power stations and burning petrol and diesel in cars, we could extract their energy by burning them at source – in offshore power stations. In parallel with developing green energy technologies like wind and solar, much attention in recent years has been devoted to cleaning up traditional fossil-fuel power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS).  Most of the emphasis has been on post-combustion capture, which involves removing carbon dioxide from the power station flue gases then compressing it into a liquid. This is then pumped to a storage facility, commonly proposed in the UK to be depleted oil and gas fields offshore.  So far CCS in the UK is still not much further forward after more than ten years of endeavour. It doesn’t help that the technology has several major difficulties. The process of removing, treating and pumping carbon dioxide is costly and energy intensive, which is somewhat self-defeating. And moving the hydrocarbons hundreds of kilometres from their source to treat and burn them only to pump the carbon dioxide all the way back again is very inefficient.   So why not move the power station to the oil and gas field instead? You would burn the hydrocarbons in their containing rock by feeding them oxygen or air, while pumping pressurised water from a surface facility – per the diagram below. The heat from burning the hydrocarbons would convert the water into steam, which would be piped up to the surface to power a turbine to produce electricity that could be transmitted to shore using power cables.  In-situ combustion No hydrocarbons would be taken to the surface in this process, and the carbon dioxide and other environmentally unfriendly combustion products would remain locked within the subsurface reservoir. And in case you are wondering if the process is unsafe, it isn’t. Isolate the oxygen supply and you can quickly stop combustion. There’s also no question of explosions because these need a free path. Hydrocarbons are stored in a rock matrix, so no such paths are available.  Not only would this be a new form of green power for homes and businesses, with a concerted shift to electric cars it could displace petrol and diesel. It could also potentially be applied to onshore shale oil and gas reserves. In short, this is about having our cake and eating it.  In-situ combustion has already been used for many years in places such as the US and Romania to extract heavy oil. This involves injecting air or oxygen to burn the oil and gas within the reservoir, but instead of producing steam like in my proposal, the heat thins the heavy oil and turns lighter components to vapour, enhancing the flow to the surface.  That said, subsurface steam generation and surface power production present numerous uncertainties. We’d need significant research and development to prove the concept. Areas to be addressed include:  Modelling the combustion process: developing a model of the heat generation and the way the thermal front would move through different kinds of rock is likely to be extremely complex.  Efficiency of heat transfer: how much of the heat could be captured to produce steam? Steam well design: this would require a new well completion arrangement with materials that could handle very high temperatures.  Surface facility and transmission requirements: what does the surface facility look like – steam turbines, high-voltage DC generation? What other support systems are required? What are the requirements for moving the power onshore?  Effect of combustion products over time: would the build-up of carbon dioxide and other gases undermine the process? Where would these products migrate to and what would happen to them?  Reservoir seal integrity: would the seal that prevents hydrocarbons and combustion products escaping be maintained, or would the process compromise its integrity? Effect on hydrocarbon recovery: current techniques for extracting oil from the North Sea can remove a maximum of about two thirds of what is in a reservoir. Would burning the materials in-situ enable you to access more of the energy over the conventional process?  Integration with other infrastructure: what potential is there for linking this kind of facility with other oil and gas fields and also offshore wind farms? Commerciality: you would of course need to calculate full capital and operating costs for the process, together with the associated revenue streams. Conventional accounting might prejudice analysis of such a scheme, however, unless there is a value ascribed to the benefit of emissions reduction using full-cost accounting techniques, the overall benefits for society will be missed. Developing this kind of scheme would not come cheap. In the UK it would require such a level of investment, integration and commitment across the competing energy companies that the current fully private set-up would be a barrier.  The best route would be to set up a state energy company – accepting that nationalising the remaining resource in the UK continental shelf was necessary to maximise what was left. This sort of thinking is necessary if we are to achieve our climate change goals. Offshore power stations could be exactly what we are looking for."
