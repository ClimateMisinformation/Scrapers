"The recent coordinated push for new coal-powered electricity generators in Australia comes as the industry is on its last legs. The intensified push for government handouts can be seen as a last-ditch attempt for the coal industry to squeeze some money out of the unwise investments it made at the end of the mining boom. Here are the facts and figures that point towards that conclusion. Australia joined 174 countries and the European Union in 2015, signing the Paris agreement. In doing so, Australia agreed to do its part in keeping the global temperature rise “well below” 2C. It also commits countries to achieving net-zero emissions “in the second half of this century”. That agreement, designed to stop runaway climate change, requires that all of Australia’s coal-fired generators close. According to the International Energy Agency, OECD countries such as Australia need to shut down almost all of their coal-fired power stations by about 2035. And the rest of the world will need to phase out coal power by 2050, it says. With coal-fired power stations taking up to a decade to build, and designed to last 30 or 40 years, building new ones now is obviously inconsistent with those commitments. In particular, Australia has committed to reducing its emissions by 26% below 2005 levels by 2030 – a commitment that is not strong enough to limit global warming at 2C and will need to be “ratcheted up”. But the Australian government recently released projections of the country’s carbon emissions showing that current policies are going to cause emissions to rise to 2030, not drop, leaving Australia overshooting that commitment by a long way. In producing those projections, the Department of Environment and Energy assumed that 2,000MW of coal capacity would retire between 2020 and 2030, and that the generation would be taken up by existing coal and some gas. (That’s equivalent to about two large power stations.) If, instead, even more coal is built, the already rising emissions would get even worse. Meanwhile, even before coal generators begin to close, the demand for their power has been dropping as renewables enter the mix. According to data from the Office of the Chief Economist, the demand for coal-generated electricity has dropped by more than 15% in the past eight years. Moreover, New South Wales budget papers show that the state government has recently downgraded its projections for domestic consumption by a whopping 20%. Last year it estimated domestic consumption would be 30m tonnes a year for the next five years. This year it changed that estimate to just 24m tonnes each year. In response to the new figures, the NSW Greens’ energy spokesman, Jeremy Buckingham, said: “Coal power has been in decline for nearly a decade and it is clear that no one is going to build a new coal-fired power station anywhere in Australia. “Coal is the whale oil of the 21st century and should be phased out as rapidly as possible for the sake of the climate.” While the proponents of coal talk about coal power being “cheap and reliable”, they are wrong on both fronts. Coal is now the most expensive form of new power. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the cost of energy from a new coal power plant would be $134-$203/MWh. That’s more expensive than wind, solar or highly efficient combined-cycle gas (costing $61-$118/MWh, $78-$140/MWh and $74-$90/MWh, respectively). Whether or not an energy source is “reliable” depends on what you’re relying on it for. The only people who still think we need the old-fashioned sort of “baseload power” that coal provides – power that is always running regardless of whether you need it – are those in the coal industry. Coal power stations are slow to start up and so can’t respond efficiently to fluctuations in supply and demand. Old energy systems were built assuming coal would always be running. It was the “baseload” energy and other forms of energy such as gas would switch on to satisfy the peaks in demand. In a world where wind and solar energy can produce a lot of energy, but not constantly, baseload needs to be replaced with flexible power that can smooth out the spiky energy supply created by variable sources of renewable energy. In the short term, that can be gas. But, in the longer term, to stop runaway climate change, that service will need to be supplied by renewable sources such as battery storage, hydro, solar thermal with storage or geothermal. When competing with renewables, coal generators end up burning costly fuel, even when they are giving the electricity away for free. Leonard Quong from Bloomberg New Energy Finance said when releasing a recent report: “In the grid of the not-too-distant future coal’s baseload operation becomes a curse, not a blessing.” And Steven Holliday, the chief executive of the UK’s National Grid, recently said: “The idea of baseload power is already outdated.” According to the Office of the Chief Economist’s most recent Resources and Energy Major Projects Report, there are 37 major coalmining projects that are currently in the works. However, that number has dropped since the last report a year ago and, in that time, no new projects have moved from along the pipeline from being “committed” to “completed”. If all the projects still listed as being actively pursued were to reach completion, they would produce almost 300m tonnes of coal each year. Adam Walters from Energy & Resource Insights said that list is a “salient reminder, if one is needed, that vast amounts of proposed new coal capacity, much with most approvals in place, remains waiting for a favourable market”. He said most of those projects were begun during the mining boom, when commodity prices were high. With prices depressed, they’ve stayed on the books but are not progressing. The push for rejuvenating the coal industry with government subsidies is the sort of thing that could help the industry get some of these projects back on track, Walters said. The global coal industry recently saw its biggest player, Peabody, go bankrupt in the US. If companies are forced to take write-downs for these projects by admitting they will never go ahead, it could mean the end for some of the companies. At his National Press Club address last week, Malcolm Turnbull appeared to point to this as the reason he is now looking to subsidise the most expensive and dirtiest form of energy, saying that it could help our mining industry. He said: “As the world’s largest coal exporter, we have a vested interest in showing that we can provide both lower emissions and reliable baseload power with state-of-the-art, clean, coal-fired technology.”"
"It’s fitting that as Donald Trump continues to flirt with anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, inoculation may provide the key to effectively debunking this sort of misinformation. That’s the finding of a new study published in Global Challenges by Sander van der Linden, Anthony Leiserowitz, Seth Rosenthal, and Edward Maibach. The paper tested what’s known as “inoculation theory,” explained in the video below by John Cook, who’s also published research on the subject. The video is a lecture from the Denial101x free online course, which itself is structured based on inoculation theory:  According to inoculation theory, facts are important but by themselves aren’t sufficient to convince people as long as misinformation is also present. People also have to be inoculated against the misinformation, for example through an explanation of the logical fallacy underpinning the myth. To test the theory, the study authors ran an experiment using a fact that’s been subjected to a tremendous misinformation campaign: the 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. There’s been some debate among social scientists about consensus messaging, with most research suggesting it’s effective and important at convincing people about the importance of climate change.  However, Dan Kahan has argued that given science communicators’ efforts over the past decade to inform the public about the expert consensus, the fact that so few people are aware of it suggests that consensus messaging is a dud. If it were going to work, it should have worked by now, the argument goes. This new study guts that argument. In their experiment, the scientists first asked their representative American subjects “To the best of your knowledge, what percentage of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening?”. The average answer was between 70% and 73%. Each group was then presented with evidence of the 97% expert consensus. That raised the average answer to about 90%. As you would expect, facts were effective when presented by themselves. The authors ran three more tests. First, after showing the 97% consensus evidence in pie chart form, they then presented a group with a piece of misinformation – the infamous Oregon Petition, which is often used to argue there is no climate consensus. This misinformation completely offset the influence of the facts – the subjects’ answers in this group fell all the way back down to a 73% perceived consensus. In the next tests, after showing the evidence of 97% consensus, the scientists “inoculated” the groups against the misinformation. In one test, they informed the group “Some politically-motivated groups use misleading tactics to try to convince the public that there is a lot of disagreement among scientists.” In the final test, they provided much more detail about the specific flaws in the Oregon Petition, and how it misinforms people.  After then showing these groups the Oregon Petition misinformation, the average perceived consensus rose to 80% in the first test, and 84% in the second test. The inoculation offset about half to two-thirds of the effect of the misinformation, and participants’ perception moved closer to the truth.  As lead author Sander van der Linden explained, the effectiveness of the inoculation across the political spectrum was particularly encouraging: We found that inoculation messages were equally effective in shifting the opinions of Republicans, Independents and Democrats in a direction consistent with the conclusions of climate science. What’s striking is that, on average, we found no backfire effect to inoculation messages among groups predisposed to reject climate science, they didn’t seem to retreat into conspiracy theories. There will always be people completely resistant to change, but we tend to find there is room for most people to change their minds, even just a little. As John Cook put it: The intriguing result was the inoculation worked across the political spectrum - even among conservatives - which tells me that nobody likes to be deceived. These results suggest that consensus messaging hasn’t been terribly effective at changing peoples’ minds about climate change because there’s been a simultaneous misinformation counter-campaign, articulated by Republican strategist Frank Luntz in his infamous leaked memo: Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community. Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate. Those who oppose taking action to curb climate change have heeded Luntz’s call. “There is no consensus” is the fourth most popular myth in the Skeptical Science database. An analysis of climate editorials published by conservative columnists between 2007 and 2010 found that “no consensus” was far and away the most popular myth, made in a whopping 64% of their climate editorials. The climate consensus misinformation campaign has been robust, and as in van der Linden’s study, canceled out much the effect of the 97% consensus fact. The challenge then is in delivering the facts and inoculation to the individuals who are being exposed to the misinformation. Conservative media outlets are the primary climate misinformation delivery system, but are unlikely to also publish facts and explanations about why their misinformation is wrong. However, while individuals who rely solely upon biased media outlets may be incurable, the majority of the public could potentially be inoculated against misinformation. The study thus provides a key message for those fighting against the growing post-truth, “alternative facts” culture: facts by themselves are insufficient, but explaining the flaws underpinning associated misinformation can help weaken its effect and increase public acceptance of the facts. The fact-myth-fallacy debunking structure explained and implemented in the Denial101x free online course is thus a valuable tool for scientists, science communicators, and anyone struggling to break through ideological barriers to facts."
"The Clean Energy Regulator has castigated a major electricity company for choosing to pay a $123m penalty rather than build or contract new wind or solar power. It said the move was “hugely disappointing” and customers would rightly be outraged to know the company wasn’t using money collected for investing in renewables in the proper way.  ERM Power has announced it will pay the regulator rather than buy certificates of green power generation to meet its renewable energy target obligations for 2016, citing tax reasons. “We view the intentional failure to surrender certificates as a failure to comply with the spirit of the law and an undermining of the objectives of the scheme,” the regulator’s chair, Chloe Munro, said. “It’s our view that an investment in a growing industry is money better spent than a financial penalty that has no return.” ERM customers were charged prices that included a component to pay for extra renewable energy generation, she said. “We believe many customers would be disappointed to know that this money has not been used for the intended purpose.” The renewable energy target works by allowing generators of renewable energy – both large-scale and small systems such as household solar panels – to create certificates for the electricity they generate. Electricity retailers buy those certificates and have to surrender a certain number of them to the regulator each year as a way of ensuring they use an amount of renewable energy. In a statement to the stock exchange, ERM said the price for the large-scale generation certificates had more than doubled to nearly $90 each, while the penalty to the regulator was valued at $65 per certificate. The company said it continued to meet other green power obligations and supported the principles of the renewable energy target. Munro said that on the whole, the energy sector took a responsible approach to its obligations and there had been a recent uptick in new projects supported by large electricity retailers. The head of the Clean Energy Council, Kane Thornton, said he thought ERM Power customers would be disappointed by the decision. “Failure to meet obligations under the RET is like deciding to demolish a heritage-listed building and then paying the resulting fine,” Thornton said. He said ERM Power was a major energy retailer that held contracts to supply power to the New South Wales and Queensland governments.  “These governments and other customers should be asking why ERM has made a decision not to meet their obligations or support renewable energy projects which will deliver major economic benefits to regional parts of Queensland and NSW,” he said.

"The evacuation of nearly 200,000 people near Oroville Dam is the kind of event that makes climate change personal. A co-worker of mine was forced out of his home for several days by the emergency evacuation, and another friend was visiting Lake Oroville and happened to leave 15 minutes before the evacuation order was issued. Like many extreme events, the Oroville emergency is a combination of natural weather likely intensified by climate change. California regularly sees “atmospheric rivers” that deluge the state with rainfall, but in a hotter world, scientists anticipate that they’ll be amplified by an increase in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere.  Northern California is in the midst of its wettest rainy season on record – twice as wet as the 20th century average, and 35% wetter than the previous record year. It proved to be almost too much for America’s tallest dam to handle. Water managers were forced to use Oroville Dam’s emergency spillway for the first time ever, which then began to erode, posing the threat of a failure and catastrophic flooding of nearby towns. While studies haven’t yet connected this extreme wetness to climate change (there are still several months remaining in California’s rainy season), what we’re seeing is consistent with climate scientists’ expectations of a hotter world. Dams in the United States were built 50 years ago, on average. Since then, the Earth’s surface temperature has warmed about 0.75°C, and there’s now more than 5% more water vapor in the atmosphere as a result, which intensifies storms. With hotter temperatures, more precipitation falls as rain and less as snow, and California’s Sierra snowpack also melts earlier in the year. Climate change stresses California’s water infrastructure through all of these mechanisms.  Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute has been researching the impact of climate change on the water cycle since the 1986, when his dissertation was the first research to conclude that the Sierra snowpack would be at risk due to rising temperatures from global warming. He also found that this would lead to increased winter runoff and flood risks, which is exactly what we’re now seeing. As Gleick told me: Our infrastructure was designed for yesterday’s climate, not today’s or tomorrow’s. We know the climate is changing and we need to be prepared. Gleick warned 30 years ago that this increased runoff would add stress to California’s water infrastructure, also noting that in a hotter world, more precipitation would fall as rain and less as snow. California will get the worst of all possible worlds – more flooding in the winter, less available water in the summer. Gleick’s words now seem prescient. Research has shown that conditions that create both wet years and hot dry years in California are becoming more frequent. California’s intensely wet 2017 is a prime example of weather whiplash, as the state is just now emerging from a 5-year drought that was its most intense in more than 1200 years.  Studies have found that global warming intensified that drought by about 15–35% through factors like increased evaporation and water demand, pushing it into the realm of record-shattering intensity. As Gleick recently wrote, extreme weather is battering California: We already see fundamental changes in storm frequency and intensity, increases in the size and duration of droughts and rainfall events, disappearing snow packs, growing agricultural water demands with rising temperatures, and more. We cannot afford the luxury of pretending climate change isn’t real, and we cannot afford to ignore the risks to our water infrastructure posed by these changes. Any investment in infrastructure must take climate change into account through smart flexible design, integration of better weather-forecasting and modeling tools, and adoption of new standards for facility construction and operation. Environmental groups warned the state about Oroville Dam in 2005, noting that in an intensely wet year like we’ve seen in 2017, its emergency spillway could erode, and thus should be coated with concrete. State agencies concluded that the cost of this project couldn’t be justified given the low probability of such a wet season, but climate change increases the likelihood and intensity of extreme precipitation events. The environmental groups were proven right. These are some of the many hidden costs of climate change. Intense droughts and floods exert extra stress on aging water management systems, farms, and other infrastructure. Lives are put in danger, as my friends’ were. On the other side of the world, Australia is in the midst of a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures reaching 44°C (111°F), 12°C (22°F) above normal. Such dangerous heatwaves are now twice as likely to occur because of human-caused global warming. It’s becoming more and more difficult to deny the reality and dangerous consequences of human-caused climate change, and more costly to do so."
"The man tipped as frontrunner for the role of science adviser to Donald Trump has described climate scientists as “a glassy-eyed cult” in the throes of a form of collective madness. William Happer, an eminent physicist at Princeton University, met Trump last month to discuss the post and says that if he were offered the job he would take it. Happer is highly regarded in the academic community, but many would view his appointment as a further blow to the prospects of concerted international action on climate change.  “There’s a whole area of climate so-called science that is really more like a cult,” Happer told the Guardian. “It’s like Hare Krishna or something like that. They’re glassy-eyed and they chant. It will potentially harm the image of all science.” Trump has previously described global warming as “very expensive … bullshit” and has signalled a continued hardline stance since taking power. He has nominated the former Texas governor Rick Perry, a staunch climate sceptic, as secretary of energy and hopes to put the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) under the leadership of Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, who has been one of the agency’s most hostile critics. John Holdren, Barack Obama’s science adviser, said Happer’s outspoken opinions would be a “substantial handicap” for a job that has traditionally involved delivering mainstream scientific opinion to the heart of policymaking.  “Every national academy of science agrees that the science is solid, that climate change is real,” he said. “To call this a cult is absurd and … an insult to the people who have done this work.” Happer also supports a controversial crackdown on the freedom of federal agency scientists to speak out about their findings, arguing that mixed messages on issues such as whether butter or margarine is healthier, have led to people disregarding all public health information. “So many people are fed up of listening to the government lie to them about margarine and climate change that when something is actually true and beneficial they don’t listen,” he said, citing childhood vaccines as an example. “The government should have a reputation of being completely reliable about facts – real facts.” Happer dismissed concerns that Trump is “anti-science”, saying he had a positive impression of the president during their January meeting. “He asked good questions – he was very attentive, actually,” he said. Climate change was mentioned but was not the main focus of discussions, according to Happer, who revealed that Trump had expressed support for solar energy in areas like Arizona “where it makes sense”. “His comments were that of a technically literate person,” he said. “He wasn’t ideologically opposed to renewables; he wasn’t ideologically in favour of them either.” Unlike many of his scientific peers, Happer is in favour of contentious legislation aimed at reining in the ability of federal agency staff to hold press conferences, give television interviews and promote their findings on official websites. The “Secret Science Reform Bill”, which is being pushed by the Texas Republican Lamar Smith, chairman of the House science, space and technology Committee, would require federal agencies to publish all the raw data underpinning any proposed regulations and for new findings to be scrutinised extensively by outside experts before being announced. However, critics view the bill as an attempt to strip federal agencies of autonomy and reduce their regulatory powers. “There is this special need for government science to be especially clean and without fault,” said Happer. “It’s OK to have press conferences, but before you do that you should have the findings carefully vetted.” When asked for examples of where the current vetting process has failed, Happer cited a recent controversy surrounding a high-profile paper published by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) scientists showing that global surface temperatures had risen again after temporarily levelling off. Earlier this month, a retired Noaa scientist, John Bates, accused his former colleagues of rushing out the paper ahead of the UN conference, prioritising political impact over scientific rigour – although Bates later clarified that he had an issue with timing and transparency rather than “tampering with data”. “This disappearance of the hiatus in global warming, which was trotted out just before the [UN] Paris conference … it was clearly just a political fanfare,” said Happer. “We shouldn’t be doing that. They were fiddling with the temperature records to make the hiatus go away.” Happer argues that climate monitoring, such as the collection of CO2 and atmospheric temperature data, is valuable and should be continued. However, he claims that the overall threat posed by global warming has been overplayed by scientists swayed by a political agenda and power-hungry civil servants. “There’s a huge amount of money that we spend on saving the planet,” he said. “If it turns out that the planet doesn’t need saving as much as we thought, well, there are other ways you could spend the money. “When you talk about fossil fuel companies being motivated, well, there’s nobody more motivated than the people working for the federal government,” he added. “You can’t rise in the American bureaucracy without some threat to address.” However, Holdren said that the evidence that human activity is causing global warming – a view supported by 97% of active climate researchers – is compelling. “It is clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that humans are causing climate change,” he added. Happer said he began to question the emerging consensus view on climate change while working as director of research at the Department of Energy in 1991-93 as part of the George HW Bush administration. Climate scientists would “grudgingly” present their work to administrators, he claims, while those in other fields would share their results with enthusiasm. “I would ask questions but they were evasive and wouldn’t answer,” he said. “This experience really soured me on the community. I started reading up and I realised why they weren’t answering the questions: because they didn’t have good answers. It was really at that point that I began to get seriously worried about climate as a science.” Concerns about the Trump administration’s apparent disregard for mainstream scientific thinking on climate change has triggered a wave of activism, including plans for a science march in various cities. However, Happer said that the public, who may view scientists as part of a privileged elite, may be less sympathetic. “There’s a potential downside [to the march] of them being seen as a greedy bunch of spoiled people,” he said. “I don’t think they’re that way myself, but it could be easily twisted into that kind of narrative.” David Gelernter, a Yale computer scientist who has also questioned the reality of manmade climate change, is also reported to be in the running for the role of science adviser, but was not available for interview. • This article was amended on 17 February 2017. An earlier version referred to the George W Bush administration where the George HW Bush administration was meant. The article was further amended on 22 February 2017 to correct the name of John Bates."

"Clean energy projects in Queensland are already on track to create more employment than Australia’s largest proposed coalmine, which if funded federally would cost taxpayers 21 times more per job, according to new study. Federal government agencies are investing $71.4m in seven solar farms and a windfarm in Queensland, which are set to deliver a total of 2,218 jobs, according to analysis by climate advocacy group 350.org.  Adani’s proposed Carmichael coal project in central Queensland, which has obtained conditional approval for a $1bn federal infrastructure loan, is predicted to deliver 1,464 jobs. The level of federal subsidy for Adani would amount to $683,060 a job, compared with $32,191 a worker in Queensland’s clean energy sector. The Queensland government has accused the federal government of misrepresenting key data while talking up coal in an ideological attack on renewable energy. The Queensland energy minister, Mark Bailey, has told the federal energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, he was using “clearly flawed” modelling to attack the state’s renewable energy target of 50% by 2030. It is the country’s most ambitious target, alongside South Australia’s.  Bailey has rejected Coalition calls for new coal-fired power stations, vowing the state would push ahead with its “clean energy transition” despite the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, “doing his best to spike the development of renewables”. The federal minister for Northern Australia, Matt Canavan, a strong backer of the economic benefits of the Adani project for his central Queensland constituency, has previously told Guardian Australia that renewables projects were not major sources of jobs. Canavan this week called for a new coal-fired power station in North Queensland to help kickstart new industries including mining near Mount Isa in the state’s northwest. Bailey told Guardian Australia the environmental benefits of “so-called ‘state-of-the art clean coal-fired technology’” touted by Turnbull in a national press club address a fortnight ago were “very marginal”. The so-called “ultra-supercritical” coal-fired stations cut carbon emissions by only 8.5% compared with the state’s “supercritical” station at Tarong, or “a mere 15%” compared to average emissions across the national energy market. “In contrast, cleaner sources such as combined cycle gas are 56% more effective, while solar and wind are more than 90% more effective in reducing carbon emissions,” Bailey said. “And they don’t lock in carbon emissions for the next 30 to 40 years, which is the life of an average power station. “The Turnbull government needs to commit to using the latest integration technology and market design to manage the transition to genuinely clean energy sources instead of leaning on phrases like ‘clean coal’ to mask their increasingly anti-renewables stance.” Adani has sought a $1bn loan from the commonwealth’s Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund to help build a railway linking its Galilee basin mine site to its coastal port hundreds of kilometres away. Just over half of its thermal coal is slated for export to the Indian power market, the rest for elsewhere in Asia. A spokesman for 350.org, Campbell Klose, said the figures on federal subsidies to Adani compared to renewable energy projects showed the “minimal return” should the loan go ahead. “Anyone with a pair of eyes can see that if our government was serious about jobs in regional Queensland, they would be investing in clean energy projects,” he said. “You don’t need an economics degree to work this one out. It really makes you wonder who Turnbull and Canavan are getting their advice from.” The Clean Energy Finance Corporation on Monday announced a $20m investment in the Ross River solar farm in Townsville, a 116MW project expected to deliver 150 jobs and enter “full commercial use” in 2018.  The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (Arena) has committed $20m towards the Darling Downs solar farm at Dalby, which is expected to generate 650 jobs but must secure additional funding. The 170MW Mount Emerald wind farm at Mareeba comes with 150 jobs, and is under construction and expected to enter full commercial use in September 2018. Solar farms at Collinsville and Kidston are expected to generate 367 and 379 jobs respectively. Arena is investing a total of $51.4m and CEFC $20m in Queensland renewables projects costing just over $1b. Bailey has written to Frydenberg saying he was “disappointed by the lack of detail” provided to show how the federal environment department estimated the state’s renewable scheme would cost $27b. “It confirms my concerns, however, about your use of this figure which even with limited visibility of your modelling is clearly flawed,” Bailey said in the letter. Bailey told Guardian Australia that while the national energy market was playing “catch up to best practice in energy technology… business does not want to invest in new coal-fired power stations”. He cited the Australian Industry Group’s claim that a new coal-fired energy policy would double electricity prices, as well as ANZ’s policy of not lending to power stations emitting more than 800 kilograms per megawatt hour, which ruled out “most ‘clean coal’ generators”. Australia’s chief scientist, Alan Finkel, who is reviewing Australia’s energy security, last week said taxpayers should not subsidise new coal-fired power. Canavan told the Australian Financial Review that the Queensland government was trying to protect its ownership of two-thirds of the state’s energy generation.  “I think it is a scandal. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has already expressed its concerns about the concentration of generators in Queensland. We do need base load power. There is no base load power north of Rockhampton,” he said."
"My friend and comrade Ken Montague, who has died aged 70 from pancreatic cancer, was a lecturer, writer, climate change activist, trade unionist and Socialist Workers party member, who played a big part in the 1976-78 Grunwick strike for union recognition. The son of Florence (nee Needham), a housewife, and Walter Montague, an engineer, he was born in Stepney, east London. On leaving Raine’s Foundation grammar school, he studied literature at the University of Essex and took his MA there, then gained a certificate of education at Garnett College (now part of Greenwich University).  He started out teaching contextual studies at the London College of Furniture (now London Metropolitan University), and from the mid-70s onwards taught a range of subjects in further and higher education, mostly at Barnet and Southgate College, north London, but also at Middlesex University. As a branch official of the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, later the University and Colleges Union, Ken fought management on pay and conditions, and successfully campaigned to reinstate a number of colleagues. As long-standing secretary of Barnet Trades Council, he joined the Grunwick strike committee, fighting for solidarity between the white, male manual workers and the Asian women who made up the majority of the workforce. Ken argued for mass pickets to shut down Grunwick’s film processing plant in Willesden, north-west London. He was a member of the Campaign Against Climate Change (CACC) steering group and a driving force behind the trade union work of the campaign, becoming secretary of the CACC Trade Union Group. One of his biggest projects was the 2012 Climate Caravan. Ken helped organise dozens of meetings as two vans travelled around Britain to raise awareness of the One Million Climate Jobs report and campaign. He travelled on one leg of the route, organising, speaking and ensuring that the immense logistical task came together. Last year he attended the Paris climate talks, and in his last months had been involved in bringing together a conference on “climate refugees” for the trade union movement. Ken was a great listener, able to motivate people and so build networks. His modesty prevented him from taking credit for his achievements. In 1980, Ken met Janet Geary, a lecturer, at a political meeting. They set up home together in London in 1981, married in 2009 and moved to Rottingdean in East Sussex in 2014. Janet survives Ken, as do their two children, Alex and Kate, and Ken’s son, Brendan, from his first marriage, to Bernadette Dunne, which ended in divorce."

"This week came the news that Australia’s millennial generation are the least optimistic in the world. Fortunately the study was done prior to this week’s events in the federal parliament, because any young person observing what the government did would quickly find themselves even more despondent. The big legislative move this week was the government seeking to pay for its child care policy by introducing numerous cuts to the family tax benefit and to areas which will affect young people more than others. Among the most pernicious was to increase the age at which someone is considered a “youth”. The government is seeking to raise the eligibility for Newstart from 22 to 25 years of age; all those under 25 would instead have to claim the Youth Allowance. For a single person living away that would mean going from receiving $528.70 a fortnight to $437.50. The reasoning for the policy goes some way to demonstrating the contempt this government has for young people. The social services minister, Christian Porter, told ABC’s RN drive on Thursday the reason for the change was that currently the system “structurally disincentives” people aged 22-24 from studying. This is because students are on the lower paying Youth Allowance rather than Newstart. Porter argued the system needed to be changed “because the option consistently exists for [the students] to go onto Newstart and receive slightly more money and not pursue studies”. Such a belief exhibits both a breathtaking lack of logic and a huge amount of disdain for the intelligence of 22-24 year olds. Porter is suggesting a 22-year-old would give up study and the prospects for a better paying job over the rest of his of her lifetime in order to get an extra $45 a week now. Even worse is that Porter’s own defence of the policy destroys the reasoning for it. He told ABC’s Patricia Karvelas the changes would not see people worse off because students are able to earn up to $437 a fortnight and still claim the full amount of the youth allowance. The change is about targeting a segment of the public the government believes cannot hurt it at the ballot box. But the problem for Porter is that system already exists. If, by Porter’s own words, going from Newstart to Youth Allowance does not make someone “materially worse off ... if they are able to engage in employment”, then where is the disincentive to study? The reality is the change is all about saving money by targeting a segment of the voting public the government believes cannot hurt it at the ballot box. It has nothing at all to do with encouraging people to study.  And cuts to Newstart are particularly harmful for young people, because youth are more likely to be unemployed than those over 25. People aged 20-24 account for 10% of the labour force but 19% of the unemployed. The unemployment rate for people aged 20-24 is now 10.5% – the highest it has been since 2001. Since the end of 2015, the unemployment rate for people over 25 has fallen from 4.6% to 4.2%; while for those aged 20-24 it has risen from 9% to the current rate. In periods of weak employment growth life is always toughest for the youth – especially when underemployment is also at record highs. You’re not only competing for work against those who are older and more experienced, you are also competing against those who are older and more experienced and who already have work but are looking for more hours. It’s worth noting that when Christian Porter was a 22-year-old in 1992, only around 15% of those aged 20 to 24 were studying full-time compared to around 31% now – and students are much more likely to be also working than were Porter’s generation back in the 1990s. But then as government backbencher Luke Howarth unintentionally revealed this week, life was a bit different for youth back then.  Howarth argued that the big issue of housing affordability was young people not knowing how to save. He told the Federation Chamber that “I bought my first home when I was about 23. It cost me $93,000, I think, at the time, and I was earning about $27,000 a year working full time in retail.” As Buzzfeed’s Mark DiStefano noted a retail worker can now earn around twice what Howarth did, but the price of a first home at around $440,000 is nearly five times more than Howarth’s first home. I guess that’s just millennials’ fault for being born too late. There was also no joy for the younger generation on the issue that will affect them the most – climate change. Once there was a time when Malcolm Turnbull would make a speech to mark the launch of a plan for “zero carbon Australia”. He would argue that “we must move, if we are to effectively combat climate change to a situation where all or almost all of our energy comes from zero or very near zero emissions sources”. And back in 2010 Turnbull cared deeply about the lives of young people, arguing that “we are asking our own generation to make decisions; to make sacrifices, to make expenditures today so as to safeguard our children, their children and the generations that come after them”.  Now he sits next to a treasurer who brought along a chunk of coal to question time. Now he is a man who uses the climate change denier code of “energy security”, praises coal as vital and decries moves towards greater use of renewable energy as “ideological”. Let us not say Turnbull is now a climate change denier, let us just say he is impersonating one so well that he has fully inhabited the role.  He told parliament, despite all evidence to the contrary, that the load shedding of electricity in South Australia this week was due to a lack of wind and was a sign the state ALP government’s policy toward renewable energy was “a triumph of ideology over common sense” and had the state akin to “the third world”.  But when asked about load shedding in the rather more coal-dependent, NSW suddenly all was well as he replied, “as long as it is controlled and planned, that can be done without impacting on households”. It’s a position that does not bode well for those of the generation who, unlike the prime minister’s, will actually have to deal with the consequences of inaction on climate change.  And along with the changes to Newstart it does not suggest a government that particularly cares about the wellbeing, either now or in the future, of that younger generation. "
"State-based renewable energy targets are becoming essential drivers of Australia’s carbon reduction framework and, based on current policy settings, will be vital for Australia to meet its 2030 emissions targets, according to a report by the energy consultancy RepuTex. The finding comes amid attacks on state-based renewable energy targets by the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and his ministers, who have called for them to be scrapped. According to modelling by RepuTex, since the federal government has excluded the electricity sector from the so-called “safeguard mechanism” and ruled out any sort of carbon trading, state and federal RETs are the only policy tool left to shift the sector away from fossil fuels. The government has released projections showing that under current policies emissions would continue to rise to 2020 and 2030, leaving no chance for Australia to meet its 2030 targets. Renewable energy targets in the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria would have an effect equivalent to that of raising the federal RET to 35% by 2030, from its current target of 23% by 2020, the RepuTex report found. Combined state and federal RETs would amount to fulfilling 20% of Australia’s 2030 abatement task, it said. “In the absence of a federal policy framework, state actions are likely to drive large-scale emissions reductions,” said RepuTex’s executive director, Hugh Grossman. “We would therefore see the states as the dominant driver of the national energy and climate debate.” Grossman said the reliance on renewable energy targets to achieve the transformation was far from ideal, since it didn’t provide certainty to the market and wouldn’t put downward pressure on prices. “We consider not implementing an emissions intensity scheme a policy failure,” he said. Next week Turnbull is expected to outline new vehicle emissions standards which, using a best-case-scenario, Reputex estimated could account for 7% of the government’s abatement task by 2030. Assuming the government doubles its nearly empty emissions reduction fund, and accounting for expected reductions from synthetic greenhouse gases, RepuTex found the government would have left more than 40% of its abatement task unaddressed. “With an EIS off the table, and no extension of the RET, the government has a limited number of policy levers to meet its 2030 target,” Grossman said. As a result, a tightening of the last remaining lever, the “safeguard mechanism”, would be needed, the report said. The safeguard mechanism sets emissions caps – or “baselines” – for polluting industries, with the exception of the power sector. RepuTex found that to fill the abatement gap, the government would need to reduce the baselines by between 1% and 3% each year. Grossman described meeting those tightened baselines as a “modest task for industry”. “This reinforces the zero-sum nature of Australian climate policy – the exclusion of one policy lever is fine – but losses will need to be balanced elsewhere in the economy,” he said."
"Climate change is already wrecking some of Britain’s most significant sites, from Wordsworth’s gardens in Cumbria to the white cliffs on England’s south coast, according to a new report. Floods and erosion are damaging historic places, while warmer temperatures are seeing salmon vanishing from famous rivers and birds no longer visiting important wetlands. The report was produced by climate experts at Leeds University and the Climate Coalition, a group of 130 organisations including the RSPB, National Trust, WWF and the Women’s Institute.  “Climate change often seems like a distant existential threat [but] this report shows it is already impacting upon some of our most treasured and special places around the UK,” said Prof Piers Forster of Leeds University.  “It is clear our winters are generally getting warmer and wetter, storms are increasing in intensity and rainfall is becoming heavier. Climate change is not only coming home – it has arrived,” Forster said. It is also already affecting everyday places such as churches, sports grounds, farms and beaches, he said. Wordsworth House and Garden in Cockermouth, where the romantic poet William Wordsworth was born in 1770 and learned his love of nature, was seriously damaged by two recent flooding events linked to a changing climate.  In November 2009, torrential rain caused £500,000 of damage, sweeping away gates and walls that had survived since the 1690s. Floods inundated the site again during Storm Desmond in December 2015. “When I saw the damage the floods had caused in 2009 I was shocked and it took almost three years to repair the garden,” said the house’s head gardener, Amanda Thackeray. “Then after all that hard work to see the devastation from flooding in 2015 was very upsetting.” A century-long record shows the UK is experiencing more intense heavy rainfall during winter. Researchers can also use climate models to reveal the influence of global warming on some extreme events and have found the UK’s record December rainfall in 2015 was made 50-75% more likely by climate change. Another study found Storm Desmond was 40% more likely to have occurred because of the human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as burning fossil fuels. Birling Gap is part of the world famous Seven Sisters chalk cliffs on England’s south coast and over the last 50 years, about 67cm of cliff is eroded each year. But during the winter storms of 2013-2014, the equivalent of seven years of erosion occurred in just two months. “The succession of storms provided a stark warning that coastal ‘defence’ as the only response to managing coastal change looks increasingly less plausible,” said Phil Dyke, coastal adviser at the National Trust. “We must learn how to adapt.”  Existing buildings at Birling Gap are being lost and new buildings will be designed to be easier to move back as the cliff disappears. Scientists know that climate change is driving up sea levels and increasing the likelihood of more intense storms, meaning the rate of erosion is likely to rise. Rising temperatures are also affecting wildlife, including in the famous salmon rivers, the Wye and Usk, where otters and kingfishers also live. December is peak spawning time for salmon in Wales, but recent winters have been exceptionally warm.  “After eliminating other potential causes such as disease and lack of adults, we have come to the conclusion that the exceptionally high water temperatures of November and December 2016 are the reason for the disastrous salmon fry numbers this year,” said Simon Evans, chief executive of the Wye & Usk Foundation. 2015 was little better, with young salmon found at just 17 sites out of 142, when they usually would be expected at 108 areas. Research has shown salmon populations across the Wye catchment fell by 50% from 1985-2004, despite cuts in water pollution. But stream temperatures have risen by up to 1C in that time, leaving researchers to conclude that climate change is a key factor in plummeting salmon numbers. Slimbridge wetlands in Gloucestershire is one of the UK’s most important bird sites, hosting 200 species from all over the world, but is also seeing changes as the climate warms. Numbers of migratory white-fronted geese have fallen by 98% in the last 30 years due to warmer weather further north.  Geoff Hilton, at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust said the shrinking flocks could have knock-on effects on the wetland habitat: “These are quite big changes ecologically. If you suddenly lose thousands of geese from a wetland, there are bound to be big effects on that wetland.” Warmer conditions have also meant water primrose, an alien invader to the UK, has grown aggressively in wide, dense mats and is seriously damaging native plants and fish. However, warmer winters have seen little egret numbers visiting Slimbridge increasing from just eight in the 1990s to 30 in 2013. Other sites being ruined by climate change, according to the new report, include a famous riverside pub on Manchester’s river Irwell, the Mark Addy, which has not re-opened after the 2015 winter floods and the historic clubhouse at Corbridge cricket club in Northumberland, now demolished after the same floods. The report also warns that the 5,000-year-old neolithic village at Skara Brae on Orkney, revealed after a great storm in 1850 stripped away grass and sand, could be destroyed in future as violent storms become more common."

"The government has clearly decided that electricity prices is its key message for the next three years – and as a result the prime minister has ensured the policy debate will be biased towards climate change denial and will continue to treat Australians as idiots. When the prime minister let fly against Bill Shorten in parliament last week, amid the personal attacks, the only policy areas he broached were company tax and energy prices. Pointedly, energy price was the first issue that came to him after he told his jokes about Shorten dining with Dick Pratt.  Turnbull exclaimed of Shorten that “he is selling out the jobs of Australian workers, every day he perseveres with his ludicrous policies on energy, which will have the result of further unsustainable increases in the cost of electricity”. It is one of the more frustrating aspects of energy policy in this country that it virtually begins and ends with electricity prices and the overarching issue of climate change is almost a side issue. For example, there is next to no political cost that the government – now in its fourth year – still has no long-term climate change policy. Laughably, despite signing up to the Paris agreement, and despite having a goal of reducing emissions to 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030, the government is still conducting a review to work out how it will actually achieve that goal, because its current policy runs out in 2020. Mostly this is because the state scheme it so loves to criticise are the main means by which the targets will be achieved.  Remember that the issue of climate change was a hot-button one 10 years ago in the 2007 election? That was when a journalist could say “the prime minister also gave some new details of how his proposed carbon trading scheme will be set up” and be referring to John Howard. It was also a time when our current prime minister could say of the impact of climate change that “for practical purposes this will mean that by mid-century all or almost all of the world’s electricity will have to come from zero or near-zero emission sources”. And lest you think we have progressed, Turnbull – who once played the role of one who cared about climate change – now stands in parliament and accuses those who would encourage renewable energy as being “ideological”.  And far from being mocked, the move is considered a political masterstroke. It’s rather sad that shafting future generations and adopting the rhetoric of those who see climate change as a UN hoax can get praise and not universal condemnation.  It’s also a weird state of affairs given electricity accounts for just 2% of household annual spending.  On average, Australian households spend more each year on take-away food, eating at restaurants, international holidays, domestic holidays, beer, tobacco and a heck of a lot more on rent. For employee households, the level of spending on electricity is even less than the overall average. For such households, electricity is just the 15th biggest item they spend money on each year. Because electricity is a necessity, it does account for more of the budget of poorer households – such as aged pensioners and those on government benefits, but for none is it the biggest item: The big problem for rational discussion of electricity prices however is that unlike rent – which is a regular fortnightly or monthly cost – electricity for most households is a quarterly cost and thus much larger, and more able to subject households to “bill shock”. And unlike rent or mortgage payments, electricity pricing is bloody confusing and thus very able to be used to mislead – such as suggesting renewable energy is the main culprit rather than responsible for around 8% of the total cost of electricity.  It’s mostly forgotten now, but electricity prices used to rise in line with inflation – and even a bit slower. From 1984 to 2007 electricity prices across the nation rose on average by 3.6% each year, compared to an average annual inflation rate of 4%. But after 2007 electricity prices took off – and zoomed ahead of inflation well before the carbon price was introduced in July 2012: The major reason for the price rises was not renewable energy, but a massive increase in the network costs due to what was referred to as the “gold plating” of the network – essentially over-investing poles and wires because of the ability to pass on the cost to consumers.  It meant that across the nation the rise in electricity price in the two years before the introduction of the carbon price was almost as much as the occurred during the two years that the carbon price was in place: Now while you certainly can argue that energy companies were gaming the system, one of the things in their favour was that prior to 2010 the use of electricity had been rising along with our population pretty much since the second world war: But over the past five years the consumption of electricity has been flat across the country.  Partly this is due to electricity-heavy manufacturing businesses closing, partly it is due to households using more efficient electrical devices – think how much more efficient a refrigerator is now than one bought 10, 15 years ago – and partly it is due to households using less electricity, because of the sharp rise in costs.  There has also in this period been an increase in renewable energy, which as the latest report by the chief economist on Australia’s energy statistics notes, is more efficient than electricity generated by coal. The big driver in the increase in renewable energy since 2010 has been wind and to a lesser extent, solar: That increase, which was driven by increases in the Renewable Energy Target by the Rudd government and the introduction of the carbon price, saw renewable energy go from accounting for 7.5% of electricity generation in 2008-09 to 14.9% by 2013-14. But once the carbon price was removed, that level began to fall: And as a result, after a long downward trend of electricity generated greenhouse gas emissions, once the carbon price was removed in the middle of 2014 those emissions began to rise – and have continued to do so: It’s not something the government likes to talk about – and actively avoids doing so when talking about its energy policy.  And it is worth remembering that the only reason renewable energy, issues with national energy market, worries about brown coal fired power stations closing, or the cost of renewable energy targets by 2030 are an issue is because we need to reduce our emissions.  It is a symptom of the backwards debate we are currently having.  A more sensible debate would be for the fight over how we can reduce our emissions in the most cost effective way.  But that of course would mean putting a price on carbon – either through an economy-wide emissions trading scheme or though a more narrow emissions intensity scheme for the electricity sector. The current debate with its primary focus on cheap electricity instead loads the debate in favour of coal and gas – because currently they are cheaper for generating electricity. But they are cheaper only so long as you pretend that there is no cost of climate change – in effect setting a price of zero for carbon emissions. And when you do that, you end up with idiocy such as the treasurer of Australia taking a lump of coal into parliament giggling like he is some particularly stupid Grade 1 student at show and tell.  The reality is not even the private sector wants to invest in a new coal fired power station because the price of renewables is falling so fast that a new coal power station would not be able to compete.  When you leave climate change out of the debate you end up with the current system where supply can be gamed and where the first step is to blame renewables and it all becomes out finding someone to blame for short-term political purposes.  So long as the energy debate ignores climate change our policy response will remain at that infantile level. And so long as that is the case we should condemn both the policy and the politics."
"The Turnbull government has “no plans” to change the Renewable Energy Target, environment minister Josh Frydenberg has said in response to reports conservative Coalition MPs want the target dropped. In an interview on Radio National Frydenberg said the RET was “balanced” but “not cost free” – warning it added $63 a year to household power bills and attacking Labor for its 50% target on renewables.  On Monday, deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce refused to commit the government to maintaining the RET. Tony Abbott and South Australian senator Cory Bernardi have both publicly argued that renewable energy targets should be scrapped. On Tuesday, Frydenberg said the government had “no plans” to change the target of 33,000 gigawatt hours of energy from renewable energy by 2020, or about 23.5%. He said it was a challenge to meet the target, but a balanced one. Frydenberg said the Australian Energy Market Commission had estimated the RET cost households $63 a year, but that was a “far cry from the 50% target that Bill Shorten is proposing, which we do know will increase prices”. Asked about the Warburton review, which found removing the RET would push up electricity prices, Frydenberg said that was “not right” and a “myth put forward by Labor”. He said the review had found that increasing use of renewables “pushes out” coal, adding to power costs in the medium and long term. Frydenberg said part of the reason for South Australia’s increase in electricity prices was its uptake of renewables and taking the Northern power plant offline. The environment minister said Australia should take a technology neutral approach to meet its emissions reduction targets. He said ultra-supercritical coal power plants could produce 700kg of CO2 for each megawatt hour of electricity, compared with Australia’s current average of 820kg. Frydenberg did not directly respond to questions about how ultra-supercritical power stations would be funded, nor whether they were incompatible with long term targets of zero emissions. He said all choices to reduce emissions had a cost, and more efficient coal plants could reduce emissions from electricity production by 40%. Frydenberg recommitted Australia to its Paris target to reduce emissions to 26-28% on 2005 levels by 2030, even if Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the international climate agreement. Frydenberg continued to emphasise that stability of the power system was the government’s main objective. He warned that integration of renewable energy into the grid was “very challenging” because renewable sources were more intermittent than centralised, synchronous generation from coal and gas. On Monday Labor and the Greens warned the push from Coalition conservatives to cut the RET showed the party was determined to follow Trump’s lead, and was harming jobs in the renewable energy sector. In a statement, the Electrical Trades Union national policy officer, Lance McCallum, warned the government not to present renewables as “unstable, expensive and risky”. He cited a US report, released in January, that a renewable energy target in that country would create at least 4.7m jobs, reduce prices or increase them by at most one cent per kilowatt hour. “The evidence shows very clearly that RETs are economically positive, environmentally beneficial, deliver valuable health savings, and are a vital step on the path we must walk to a clean energy future,” McCallum said."
"The European Union will “vastly overshoot” its Paris climate pledges unless its coal emissions are completely phased out within 15 years, a stress test of the industry has found. Coal’s use is falling by about 1% a year in Europe but still generates a quarter of the continent’s power – and a fifth of its greenhouse gas emissions.  If Europe’s 300 coal plants run to the end of their natural lifespans, the EU nations will exceed their carbon budget for coal by 85%, according to a report by the respected thinktank Climate Analytics. It says the EU would need to stop using coal for electricity generation by 2030. “Not only would existing coal plants exceed the EU’s emissions budget, but the 11 planned and announced plants would raise EU emissions to almost twice the levels required to keep warming to the Paris agreement’s long term temperature goal,” said Dr Michiel Schaeffer, Climate Analytics science director. The report will feed into a review of the EU’s Paris targets next year, which could see the bloc’s planned emissions cuts raised significantly, in line with an aspirational 1.5C goal agreed at Paris. Artur Runge-Metzger, the EU’s lead negotiator at the Paris talks said that the bloc’s first estimates indicated that a 95% emissions cut would be needed by 2050 to cap warming at 1.5C, significantly higher than the 80% pledged in Paris. “We are not only looking at what is technically feasible but what is socially bearable and how we are really going to manage that kind of transition,” he said. Uncertainties stirred by the election of President Trump were causing “a lot of anxiety in the EU and that will spill over into the [low carbon] debate,” he added. But the commission is making contingency plans. “You always need to look at several scenarios at the same time to be prepared and not to be surprised,” Runge-Metzger told the Guardian. “It’s a little bit like playing chess, isn’t it?” Trump has promised a coal renaissance in the US rust belt but coal plants will have to be shut across the planet by 2050 to prevent dangerous warming, the study says, with China planning to mothball its coal industry by 2040.  While the UK has Europe’s third highest capacity for coal, Germany and Poland are responsible for more than half of the EU’s coal emissions and will face the greatest challenges.  Germany is postponing its coal phase-out plans until after elections later this year. Poland, which is preparing a legal challenge to the EU’s climate policy, argues that it can plant trees to offset coal emissions, and one day apply experimental carbon capture and storage technology (CCS).  A Polish diplomatic source told the Guardian that Poland aimed to “develop the [carbon] sink potential of its forests as one of the most cost efficient ways to achieve the necessary reductions.” Steps in that direction will be closely monitored by the commission. “Will the numbers really work?” Runge-Metzger asked. “If you count [existing forests] against emissions, I’m not sure whether that calculation will work in the end. We will have to see additional removals from the air, from land use and forestry which have a certain permanence.” The UK on Wednesday recommitted to a coal phase-out by 2025 but environmentalists fear that “capacity payments” to seven coal plants worth £453m over the next four years could sabotage that deadline.  Earlier this week, the government granted another £78m to keep coal plants open next year – including £10m for Aberthaw, which has repeatedly violated emissions limits, according to a European court ruling last September.  James Thornton, the chief executive of the green law firm ClientEarth said that the UK’s plans were weak and filled with loopholes that coal operators could exploit to stay open.  “The first place we should see proof of ambition is in government subsidies,” he said. “When these are cut, investors catch on. So why are we still seeing subsidies for fossil fuel capacity? “The government has not yet put its money where its mouth is,” he said Anti-coal campaigners have been buoyed by a recent vote in the Irish Dail to divest from all fossil fuels, and a decision by Danish energy giant Dong Energy to stop burning coal at its power stations by 2023. Coal accounted for 80% of Dong’s fuel supplies a decade ago. "
"The impact of climate change on threatened and endangered wildlife has been dramatically underreported, with scientists calling on policymakers to act urgently to slow its effects before entire species are lost for good. New analysis has found that nearly half (47%) of the mammals and nearly a quarter (24.4%) of the birds on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species are negatively impacted by climate change – a total of about 700 species. Previous assessments had said only 7% of listed mammals and 4% of birds were impacted.  “Many experts have got these climate assessments wrong – in some cases, massively so,” said Dr James Watson of the University of Queensland and the Wildlife Conservation Society, who co-authored the paper with scientists in the UK, Italy and the US. Published in the Nature Climate Change journal, the analysis of 130 studies reported between 1990 and 2015 painted a grim picture of the impact of the changing climate on birds and mammals already under threat. Most researchers tended to assess the impact of climate change on one species or ecosystem, and often cast forward 50 or 100 years, ignoring the fact the climate is already altered, said Watson. “I think that’s a real problem with how the scientific community has communicated the issue, because people are always labelling it as a future threat. When you combine the evidence, the impact on species is already really dramatic.” Some species were more vulnerable than others, with elephants and primates’ ability to adapt to changing conditions curtailed by their slow reproductive rates. Rodents that could burrow to escape extreme environments would be less impacted. Mammals with specialised diets were “already far more affected” than others, as were species of birds living at high altitudes. Animals found in tropical and subtropical forests under an existing threat of habitat degradation faced an additional challenges from climate change. Watson said many assessments of red listed species had assumed that hunting, deforestation and loss of habitat posed greater and more immediate risk than climate change. “Many risk assessments are simply blind to the fact that climate change is happening now. If you read a scientific paper on climate change and species, it’s always that things will get worse in the future, not that it’s happening now.” The extent of the problem was likely to be much worse than even Watson’s analysis had found, he said, because mammals and birds were the subject of the most studies. “These are the species that you’d hope we’d be most accurate on. Amphibians, reptiles, fish, plants – we are almost certainly out by a massive order of magnitude in our current assessments of vulnerability to climate change. “We’ve got this wrong for birds and mammals, which are our most studied groups – what are we getting wrong for species we don’t know much about, like corals, bats, frogs, fungi?” Governments needed to act urgently to lessen the impact of climate change by slowing its progress by drastically reducing emissions and strengthening the reliance of species and ecosystems, said Watson. “We’ve got to give nature a fighting chance – that means we have to ensure systems are healthy and functioning. We cannot allow degradation and fragmentation of ecosystems, and we need to manage invasive species. “Policymakers can’t just put it off. They have to realise that every decision they make now impacts species’ chances, and by not acting – by allowing the status quo to continue – we will lose nature’s ability to rapidly adapt in future.” With the IUCN red list the “global standard” by which every nation assessed its progress towards saving threatened species, Watson said he and his co-authors were hopeful that their analysis would influence intergovernmental policy as well as upcoming revisions of the strategic plan of the UN framework convention on climate change. “But just getting the list right isn’t going to solve the problem. It’s got to go beyond documenting a crisis – this study shows we’ve got to act on it.”"

"To fulfil his campaign slogan of “make America great again”, Donald Trump must back the boom in green technology – that was the message from the leading climate figures ahead of his inauguration as president on Friday. Unleashing US innovation on the trillion-dollar clean technology market will create good US jobs, stimulate its economy, maintain the US’s political leadership around the globe and, not least, make the world a safer place by tackling climate change, the experts told the Guardian.  The omens are not encouraging. Trump has called global warming a hoax and is filling his administration with climate change deniers and oil barons. But reversing action on climate change and championing fossil fuels will only “make China great again”, said one top advisor. Here are the messages to Trump from some of the key figures the Guardian contacted.  If I had one minute with president elect Trump my message would be that the best way to ‘Make America great again’ is by owning the clean energy, transportation and infrastructure technologies of the future. Not only will this create countless well-paid, fulfilling jobs for Americans, but will also lock in the US’s geopolitical leadership for another generation. “Mr President, if you want to make China great again, you have to stay the course you have promised. I think it would be the end of US domination in innovation, in economics. If you try to take the US backwards to the days of mountain top removal [for coal] in West Virginia and all those things, then you will just make sure China becomes No 1 in all respects. In the end, you would produce precisely what you promised to avoid to your electorate.” If President Trump wants to deliver greater job security for Americans, he should focus on clean and sustainable industries where the US has a competitive advantage. Those are the sectors that are set to prosper. He needs to build an economy for 2050, not one for 1950. If you want to make America great again, building modern, clean and smart infrastructure makes tremendous commercial and national sense, In the longer term, the low carbon growth story is the only growth story on offer. There is no long-term, high-carbon growth story, because destruction of the environment would reverse growth. If you’re interested in quality, high paying and skilled jobs for the American middle classes, then renewable energy has to absolutely be the place to look. It’s a sector with more employees now than in the US coal industry and with a long way to grow. “If [Trump] wants to achieve the things that he claimed he would: improving the situation of the common man, the best way he could do this would be a programme of a rising carbon fee with the money distributed to the public.” [Mr Trump] you might not realise it yet, but your action, or inaction, on climate will define your legacy as president. The renewable energy transformation is unstoppable and, if the US chooses to turn its back on the future, it will miss out on all the opportunities it brings in terms of jobs, investment and technology advances. China, India and others are racing ahead to be the global clean energy superpowers and surely the US, led by a businessman, does not want to be left behind. Trump’s stance threatens to diminish America’s standing in the world and to weaken the ability of US companies and workers to compete in the rapidly growing global market for clean energy technologies. Quit. But if you have to stick around, realise that the clean energy economy is the greatest, biggest job creator in history. Some leading figures, who will have to deal directly with the Trump administration, chose more diplomatic messages to the new president, while emphasising the vital need to act on global warming: I look forward to working with your new administration to make the world a better place for the people of the US and for peoples everywhere in this very special world. “We present this assessment for the benefit of the American people.”"
"A group of senior Republicans will meet with White House officials on Wednesday to call for a new national carbon tax to replace federal regulations as a way to combat climate change. The GOP elder statesmen – which include former secretaries of state James Baker and George Shultz, and ex-treasury secretary Hank Paulson – will urge Donald Trump’s administration to impose a “free market, limited government” response to rising global temperatures.  The group’s plan outlines a carbon tax of $40 for each ton emitted, which would increase steadily over time. In an attempt to appeal to Republicans wary of new taxes, the plan stipulates that income from this levy would be distributed to the American public on a quarterly basis. “Mounting evidence of climate change is growing too strong to ignore,” the group states. “For too long, many Republicans have looked the other way, forfeiting the policy initiative to those who favor growth-inhibiting command-and-control regulations.” The plan would also sweep away federal regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions. Barack Obama, faced by stiff Republican opposition to a similar market-based carbon plan, deployed the Environmental Protection Agency to draw up rules the directly curb emissions via the clean power plan.  This new proposal estimates that a family of four would receive about $2,000 a year in dividends, offsetting any increase in fuel costs that would occur as a result of the tax.  “Carbon dividends would increase the disposable income of the majority of Americans while disproportionately helping those struggling to make ends meet,” the report states. “Yet these dividends are not giveaways; they would be earned based on the good behavior of minimizing our carbon footprints.” Trump’s antipathy towards climate science, which he has previously called a “hoax” and mere ploy to impose new taxes, suggests that the group of Republicans will struggle to win the president over. Obama’s clean power plan is already slated for abolition, with Trump suggesting the US could also retreat from the international effort to tackle climate change.  Congressional Republicans, too, have voiced doubts over the validity of the science and have consistently opposed any new taxes and any restrictions upon greenhouse gas emissions.  Baker, who was secretary of state under George HW Bush, conceded his group faces an “uphill slog” that may not be successful. “We may not convince the president, but it’s a good plan because it’s a conservative, free market and limited government approach to the problem,” he told CNN. “Republicans have not been at the table because we are skeptics or deniers. But if you see what’s happening to the environment, even if it’s happened before 10,000 years ago, that’s a risk we shouldn’t have to take.” Support for a carbon tax has support in diverse places, including ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company, former vice-president Al Gore and James Hansen, the former Nasa scientist-turned-climate campaigner.  Proponents argue the most efficient way to cut emissions would be a tax that spurs large greenhouse gas emitters to switch to cleaner sources of energy. Rex Tillerson, the former ExxonMobile chief executive and Trump’s pick for secretary of state, has said he supports a “revenue neutral” carbon fee. The idea of a carbon tax will also garner support among progressives who were left deflated after Obama’s initial attempts to institute a national cap-and-trade carbon system were scuppered by Republican opposition.  “It’s a sensible alternative and this group is probably the best possible messengers for this particular president and Congress,” said Andrew Light, a former senior climate negotiator at the department of state during Obama’s administration.  “The structure of this plan should appeal to Republicans because it returns the money from the tax to citizens. We need some action, we need to get to the emissions cuts. This could help us get there.” Environmental groups were cautiously supportive but warned that the tax shouldn’t come at the cost of rolling back clean air laws.  “We have a moral obligation to protect future generations from the growing dangers of climate change,” said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council.  “Effective action means building on the progress we’re already making, not sacrificing those gains by weakening the laws Congress has already passed.”"
"In this new political era, climate scientists and their science are under attack. The attack is from multiple fronts, from threats to pull funding of the important instruments they use to measure climate change, to slashing their salaries and jobs. But there is a real fear of renewed personal attacks, and it appears those fears are now being realized. What the attackers do is identify and isolate scientists – a process termed the “Serengeti Strategy” by well-known and respected scientist Michael Mann who suffered these types of attacks for years.  The author of the recent attack piece, David Rose in the UK, has a history of denying the well-established science of climate change. He has a long history of making incorrect climate change statements. In the attack, Mr. Rose claims that scientists used misleading data in a recent (2015) paper that studied the rate of temperature change across the globe. He reportedly obtained information from someone who works at NOAA to imply that internal review procedures were not followed as the paper was prepared for publication. What Mr. Rose omitted however, is incredibly telling and he does a disservice to his readers. First, he neglects to mention that the work from the 2015 paper authored by Dr. Thomas Karl and others at NOAA has already been independently verified by other researchers. The second thing Rose neglects to mention is that his story’s source was never involved any part of the work. According to a colleague of the authors Peter Thorne, this source: never participated in any of the numerous technical meetings on the land or marine data I have participated in at NOAA NCEI either in person or remotely. This shows in his reputed (I am taking the journalist at their word that these are directly attributable quotes) misrepresentation of the processes that actually occurred. In some cases these misrepresentations are publically verifiable. Mr. Rose further neglects to mention that Dr. Karl was not involved in the development of the critical sea surface temperature data that was used in the study. That information was already published before the Karl paper appeared.  The attack piece also claims that the scientists discarded high-quality temperature measurements in favor of low quality data. This claim is demonstrably false, as described here and here. The lengths to which Mr. Rose goes in his attack are disheartening and dishonest. He includes a graph that appears to show two temperature results that disagree. When they are replotted correctly, as temperature anomalies with correct baselines, the discrepancy disappears. This finding shows that the NOAA results from 2015 actually agree extremely well with data from other institutions. Hilarious screw up by @DavidRoseUK and #FailOnSunday 1st picture is 'evidence' of misconduct, 2nd shows diff when baselines are correct. pic.twitter.com/R5VsqqlNHr But it gets even worse for Rose. Temperature measurement expert Zeke Hausfather, who was the lead author on a study that verified the temperature data, wrote a very quick response to his article. He provided this comparison, which includes data from five different scientific groups. They are all in strong agreement.  NEW | Factcheck: Mail on Sunday’s ‘astonishing evidence’ about global temperature rise | Guest post by @hausfath https://t.co/e7gGNGxIKc pic.twitter.com/BruRecUo34 So Mr. Rose and the climate-change denialists will have to work a bit harder next time. The real story here is that the denial industry has lost the battle on the science. There are no reputable scientists who discount the enormous human influence on our Earth’s climate. Because they have lost that battle, they are manufacturing doubt about the science. They are making misleading claims and attacking scientists with intimidating tactics. This is a playbook that has been used for years. It should alarm everyone that excellent researchers like Dr. Thomas Karl from NOAA can be attacked for just telling us what the data says."
"The destruction of coral reefs worldwide could accelerate as rising carbon emissions help coral-killing seaweeds grow more poisonous and take over, according to researchers. A Griffith University study on the Great Barrier Reef has shown how rising CO2 emissions trigger more potency in chemicals from common “weed-like” algae that poison corals as they compete for space.  The study, conducted on Heron Island with reef and chemical ecology experts from the University of Queensland and the US, predicts that “business as usual” emissions would significantly harm vital corals by 2050 and kill them off by 2100. The researchers said their findings, which shed new light on the competitive advantage seaweeds enjoyed over corals in seawater with rising carbon concentrations, had global implications as one of the most damaging seaweeds was found in reefs worldwide. And the futility of trying to remove seaweeds that had the ability to regrow meant the problem could be tackled only by cutting carbon emissions, they said.  Guillermo Diaz-Pulido, a Griffith University associate professor, said the research was “a major step forward in understanding how seaweeds can harm corals and has important implications for comprehending the consequences of increased carbon dioxide emissions on the health of the Great Barrier Reef”. Scientists previously knew that increased carbon in the atmosphere – which is absorbed by oceans, making them more acidic – affected the behaviour of seaweed. But the study’s co-author Mark Hay, a professor from the Georgia Institute of Technology, said the discovery here was that greater carbon concentrations led to “some algae producing more potent chemicals that suppress or kill corals more rapidly”, in some cases in just weeks. “If the algae overtake the coral, we have a problem which contributes to reef degradation, on top of what we already know with coral bleaching, crown of thorn starfish outbreaks, cyclones or any other disturbance,” Hay said. Diaz-Pulido said a common brown algae species found in reefs worldwide was shown to be among those that caused the most damage. “That’s a problem because if this algae takes advantage of elevated CO2 in seawater that’s even more a matter of concern,” he said. Diaz-Pulido said the “scale of the problem is so big, removing a bunch of seaweed from the reef isn’t going to do much because it just regrows and regenerates”. That is in contrast to human interventions on other coral threats such as the crown of thorns starfish, where local eradication programs have had success.  Diaz-Pulido said his conclusion was that “the way to address this really is to reduce the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere”. The research at Heron Island, a coral cay north-east of Gladstone at the southern end of the reef, used underwater reef experiments and outdoor lab studies. “For the algae to grow they need light and CO2, just like any other plant, and because algae in the future would be exposed to much more CO2 in seawater we wanted to know to what extent the CO2 would affect some of the things algae do, the physiology and the interaction with animals,” Diaz-Pulido said. The study was published on Thursday in the Nature journal’s Scientific Reports, and involved collaboration with Peter Mumby, a University of Queensland professor."
"If you want to see the world’s climate changing, fly over a tropical country. Thirty years ago, a wide belt of rainforest circled the earth, covering much of Latin America, south-east Asia and Africa. Today, it is being rapidly replaced by great swathes of palm oil trees and rubber plantations, land cleared for cattle grazing, soya farming, expanding cities, dams and logging. People have been deforesting the tropics for thousands of years for timber and farming, but now, nothing less than the physical transformation of the Earth is taking place. Every year about 18m hectares of forest – an area the size of England and Wales – is felled. In just 40 years, possibly 1bn hectares, the equivalent of Europe, has gone. Half the world’s rainforests have been razed in a century, and the latest satellite analysis shows that in the last 15 years new hotspots have emerged from Cambodia to Liberia. At current rates, they will vanish altogether in 100 years.    As fast as the trees go, the chance of slowing or reversing climate change becomes slimmer. Tropical deforestation causes carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, to linger in the atmosphere and trap solar radiation. This raises temperatures and leads to climate change: deforestation in Latin America, Asia and Africa can affect rainfall and weather everywhere from the US Midwest, to Europe and China.  The consensus of the world’s atmospheric scientists is that about 12% of all man-made climate emissions – nearly as much as the world’s 1.2bn cars and lorries – now comes from deforestation, mostly in tropical areas. Conserving forests is critical; the carbon locked up in Democratic Republic of the Congo’s 150m hectares of forests are nearly three times the world’s global annual emissions.  And as the forests come down, the people who live in or around them and depend on them become impoverished. Without the forests, people migrate to cities, or move to richer countries in search of work. The world’s rainforests not only provide food, energy security, incomes and medicinal plants for 300 million people, but are home to the richest wildlife in the world. So, what to do? The positive news is that all countries formally pledged at the Paris climate summit in December 2015 to reduce emissions and keep global temperature rises to well below 2C; and in so doing they recognised that this would not be possible without stopping or at least reducing tropical deforestation. The 50 or more developing countries who share the world’s tropical forests all recognised their contribution and promised to crack down on illegal forestry, replant trees and restore degraded forest lands. Some countries were highly ambitious. China, Brazil, Bolivia and Congo DRC together put forward targets that could protect over 50 million hectares of forest over the next 15 years, an area the size of Spain. Indonesia, the world’s sixth largest carbon emitter, promised to cut its emissions by 29% by ending illegal deforestation and restoring 12m hectares of forested land. Ecuador said that it planned to restore 500,000 hectares of forest land by 2017 and then increase that amount by 100,000 hectares a year. Honduras committed to plant or restore 1m hectares of forest by 2030.  If countries stick to their pledges and let damaged forests recover, annual global greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by as much as 24 to 30% – an enormous step.  The science and economics needed to stem deforestation are in place, but there is one huge caveat: countries with tropical forests are some of the poorest in the world, desperate to develop and use their natural resources to grow their economies. Their pledges to stop or reduce deforestation are mostly conditional on rich countries financially and technically helping them achieve this – and the onus on reducing emissions is on these rich countries which have historically caused most climate change.  Rich countries pledged at Paris to raise $100bn a year to help poor countries reduce their emissions. Some of that money should go to tropical forest protection.  In addition, a new UN-backed mechanism called Redd (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) has been initiated that involves rich countries paying countries to protect forests and the carbon stored within them. Tropical and sub-tropical countries could receive both public and private funding if they succeed in reducing their emissions from deforestation. But this is deeply controversial as global schemes are prone to corruption, difficult to implement and hard to measure.  If there is money to protect forests, will it go to big companies as subsidy, or lead to evictions of people and human rights abuses?  There must be safeguards, but Germany, Norway and the UK have together promised up to $1bn a year for Redd schemes until 2020. The World Bank plans to contribute a similar amount to work with African countries. A further fund is intended to benefit indigenous and other forest communities which have been the traditional protectors of the forest.  Until Paris, stopping tropical deforestation was at best unlikely and probably impossible. It remains very difficult, but a political and financial mechanism has now been created to incentivise countries, companies and communities to do so at a fraction of the cost of reducing comparable emissions in the US or Europe. Protecting the forests now depends on rich governments not ducking their responsibilities and playing their part.  Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

"The road to President Trump was long and bumpy. There were many turns not taken, countless alternative routes that would have spared us this outcome. Instead, we kept going, corruption, infighting and sheer obliviousness stopping us changing course. What could have been different? There are a thousand possibilities. You could start with the long decay of the US news media into a branch of the entertainment industry, primed to seize on Trump’s celebrity. A wiser society would have demanded better, resisted more vocally, criticised more intelligently.  Or the rise of Silicon Valley, its hypercapitalist, libertarian ethos helping to weaken traditional sources of information. We now suffer pandemic attention deficit disorder, fake news, hackable everything, cyberwar, and social media bullies, of whom Trump is bully-in-chief. An internet run as a public commons rather than an ad-driven free-for-all would have had very different social consequences. We missed that turning long ago. Or the erosion of civil rights. People of colour have been systematically disenfranchised by a series of interventions, including the gutting of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. Millions were effectively cut out of the election. Their full participation would have made Trump impossible. A renewed voting-rights movement will be part of how we crawl out of the hole we find ourselves in. That will have to include better voting systems and national voting-rights standards. The abolition of the electoral college also is long overdue; its peculiar mechanisms eked out a meagre victory for the loser of the popular vote. And we must undo the gerrymandering that so dramatically favours the Republicans. Or you could backtrack about 90 exits: imagine we had taken the dangers of climate change so seriously that, I don’t know, we had a completely different election about completely different issues, or the several such elections our environmental crisis actually merits. The road is perhaps too pretty a metaphor – call it a highway to hell and start looking for the off-ramps. We’ve missed enough already. This year, you’d be forgiven for thinking “left” was short for “left behind”. Many progressives got stuck in the primary stage, fighting Hillary Clinton as though she were running against Bernie Sanders, rather than Trump, all the way to November. Those who should have known better seemed unable to imagine that anything could be worse than neoliberalism. The Democrats bear responsibility for years of compromise and muddle; they floundered ineffectually while their rivals strategised with brilliance. They can do better – some of them have and will. The leadership shown this month by John Lewis and Barbara Lee, inauguration refuseniks, has been heroic, and the election of the Senate’s first Latina and second African-American woman were high points in an election that plumbed the depths. But more powerful Democrats could have worked harder to stop Trump, starting with the outgoing president of the United States. Barack Obama had all the intelligence information that was belatedly shared with us. He even used the so-called nuclear phone to call Vladimir Putin in October and tell him to stop intervening in the election. He had power over the FBI, and might have installed senior staff who were more loyal to the country than the Republican party. As it was, the FBI smeared Clinton and protected Trump. The latter’s triumph was made possible at least in part by our current president’s dedication to positioning himself above the fray, projecting Olympian calm. This was a season during which he should have been asking himself what Lyndon Baines Johnson would have done, back when the Democrats were fierce fighters. I turned off the radio after Obama said, in his final speech: “In 10 days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy, the peaceful transfer of power from one freely elected president to the next.” I yearned for a leader who would say something like: “Hey, there was foreign intervention in this election, along with voter disenfranchisement, so maybe it wasn’t free and fair. If there was collusion on Trump’s part, that’s treason, so we’re putting it all on hold and asking the supreme court what they think about all these unprecedented problems.” Obama’s statesmanly grace was, in fact, needless acquiescence. Other politicians, as well as ordinary citizens, tried to get the juggernaut to stop. Even Republican senators – John McCain and Lindsey Graham – demanded an investigation of the Russian business before the election, and several of the Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee asked Obama to release the classified information he was withholding. It turns out that a lot of people had material which they could have used to make a fuss before the election on 8 November, or before the electoral college met on 19 December, or before the joint session of Congress certified the result on 6 January. That day, seven Democratic congresspeople stood up to object, but no senator would stand with them. Later, Senator Dianne Feinstein said she believed that Russian intervention and James Comey’s sabotage changed the outcome of the election (and polls pretty much confirm that Comey delivered the coup de grâce). We didn’t need to know the minutiae of the Russian intervention; we already knew that it raised questions so grave that the whole transfer of power should have been halted while it was investigated. As it is, we now have an incoming president whose greatest commitment seems to be to Russian interests, including undermining the EU and Nato, and full-steam-ahead pursuit of fossil fuels. Now we’ve reached the inauguration, in an Oldsmobile with four flat tyres and a boiling radiator, some of us are looking ahead, to where the U-turn options are. That civil society has been galvanised is good news, though it’s hard to anticipate what the fights will look like: basic rights are at risk and pretty much the most destructive candidates imaginable for every cabinet position, from education to the environment, are likely to be confirmed. We need electoral reform to re-enfranchise people of colour and the poor. We need the wild-eyed young radicals to take over the Democratic party and make it reflect their hopes and dreams. We need smart strategists to make the most of the very promising rifts in the Republican party. We need to tell our stories better and learn to influence what stories get told. We need an endless series of reforms, from media and technology to education and healthcare. There’s more than enough work for everyone. There will be too much, and each of us will have to find a piece of the problem where we can be effective and stick to it. We’re going to have to build alliances – that means working alongside people with whom you agree about the big things and not quibbling about the little ones. We’re going to have to remember what kind of power civil society has and how to use it. We’re going to have to be brilliantly organised. Millions were asleep at the wheel; the shock has jolted us awake. What lies ahead is unmapped – but at least we are finally paying attention."
"It’s one of the most maligned conversation starters in the English-speaking world, and yet not only is it consequential, it’s good for us. I’m talking about the weather. Again. Yes, I am an unapologetic lift talker and mostly that involves kicking off a conversation about the weather.  Especially when we’re in the middle of a heatwave and flying foxes are falling from the sky, or it’s snowing in summer, or there’s a terrifying thunderstorm going on. And all that seems to be happening more often, these days.   One of the small benefits of starting off a conversation about the weather is that the person’s response may provide cues as to how – or whether – you should proceed beyond that.  Perhaps you’ll say, “It’s a scorcher out there, isn’t it?” and your fellow lift dweller replies with a comment on climate change. Well there you go, you may very well have a kindred spirit on hand. If, on the other hand, they put their head down and grumble something about a Chinese hoax, you could make the decision to shut up and continue your journey in silence. Or you could casually utter your most convincing fact about climate change in an effort to convert them. Imagine getting into the lift on your way to lunch and then getting out with one less climate denier in the world. Seems unlikely, sure, but you never know what killer fact is that denier’s tipping point.  Or say you make a banal comment about the temperature outside, and the respondent comes up with a witty riposte that sends your heart aflutter. It could be love! Or friendship! Or, at the very least, it could see you leave the lift with a smile on your face that wasn’t there when you entered.  And that’s why I persist in talking about the weather. More important than converting or making assumptions about people’s political inclinations, or trying to find love in a lift or on an aeroplane or train (my other favourite spots for weather talk), is the simple joy of talking to a stranger.  We know that talking to strangers is good for us: it has been shown to improve our mood, make our commute seem shorter, and – if it’s your neighbours you’re chatting up about the unseasonable rain – it may even reduce your chance of having a heart attack. The reason to go in on the weather is simply because, mostly, talking about the weather is a safe topic. Even still, sensitivity is required. If somebody doesn’t want to talk, that’s fine. The eye contact alone may have been enough to make you both feel a little more socially connected.  Now more than ever, we need to reach out to people we don’t know; to find human connection in a world that seems intent on keeping us apart – on creating echo chambers in which we only talk to people who agree with us. At a time when some of us simply cannot understand how another could support Donald Trump, or vote leave, or think Pauline Hanson’s politics are sophisticated, we need to talk to people about the weather. Oscar Wilde said “conversation about the weather is the last refuge of the unimaginative.” but at a time when one half of the population literally cannot imagine how the other half thinks, weather talk may be conversation’s last refuge. It doesn’t have to lead anywhere else. It’s enough to have a conversation about the humidity if the alternative is no conversation at all. The weather is a force that we cannot control but that affects so many decisions we make each day: what to wear, how to travel to work, whether to eat lunch in the park or at our desk, to pack an umbrella or a jacket – just think about how dressing inappropriately for the weather can ruin an occasion or even a whole day.  We have these things in common, and we can talk about them politely if we try. What easier way to remind us of our shared humanity? "
"As the chaos and protests at airports around the US gathered steam on Sunday after President Donald Trump’s startling travel ban on people coming to America from seven majority-Muslim countries, the White House had a lighter listing on its official schedule: a screening of Finding Dory at the White House family theater from 3pm. As the film’s co-star Albert Brooks pointed out, the choice of the film – believed to be the president’s first official screening since his inauguration – comes with layers of irony. After Trump’s executive order, green card holders, visa holders and pre-approved refugees from countries in the Middle East and north Africa were detained at airports or pulled off airplanes around the world.  “Odd that Trump is watching Finding Dory today, a movie about reuniting with family when he’s preventing it in real life,” Brooks tweeted. Odd that Trump is watching Finding Dory today, a movie about reuniting with family when he's preventing it in real life. A sequel to Finding Nemo, the Disney Pixar film follows Dory – a blue tang fish with short-term memory loss, voiced by Ellen DeGeneres – on her journey from the Great Barrier Reef to a marine life institute in California to reunite with her long-lost parents. DeGegeneres did not refer to the Finding Dory screening, but was tweeting her opposition to the travel ban at about the same time as Brooks on Sunday. “America is great because of all the people who came here,” she said. “Not in spite of them.” For me, America is great because of all the people who came here. Not in spite of them. #NoBan P.S. My grandparents were immigrants. The woman making us pizza right now is Muslim. And I'm grateful for all of them. #NoBan Other Twitter users also drew attention to the irony of the film selection, with one posting: “Trump is screening Finding Dory today: the story of a foreigner entering the US without authorization to reunite with her parents #irony”. Trump is screening ""Finding Dory"" today: the story of a foreigner entering the U.S. without authorization to reunite with her parents #Irony pic.twitter.com/FKU7ItiPod Nero played the fiddle while Rome burned. Trump watched Finding Dory At 3pm, Trump is hosting a screening of Finding Dory, a movie about what happens when you're separated from your family.Let that sink in. Finding Dory is awash in themes of environmental conservation – an odd choice for a president who denies the existence of climate change and has claimed global warming is a hoax. In the movie, Dory swims through the beleaguered Great Barrier Reef to return to her childhood home: a habitat which rehabilitates marine life damaged by, among other things, the effects of climate change and pollution. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, clarified on Twitter that while the Finding Dory screening had gone ahead on Sunday, Trump wasn’t watching. “Actually he spent 60 seconds welcoming and thanking spouses and children of White House staff then right back to work,” he said. Actually he spent 60 seconds welcoming & thanking spouses & children of WH staff then right back to work: up next 7pm call w South Korea https://t.co/opr1NVRZsj On Wednesday DeGeneres issued a slight jab at Trump in the opening monologue of her daytime talk show. “Unfortunately, Finding Dory did not get nominated [for an Oscar],” she said. “According to alternative facts, it did,” she joked, referring to the term used by the senior White House aide Kellyanne Conway while defending Spicer’s false claims of the turnout at Trump’s inauguration."

"HCF has become the first Australian private health fund to divest from fossil fuels, having decided that the industry harms the health and wellbeing of its members, pulling about $20m out of fossil fuel companies in Australia and overseas. In a letter to the campaign group Market Forces dated 15 December 2016, HCF said it would be divesting from fossil fuels on the same ground it used for pulling out of the tobacco industry.   HCF has not announced the move publicly but confirmed it to Guardian Australia, saying it expected to have sold all its shares in fossil fuel-related companies by the end of March. In HCF’s latest annual report, it said it had $2bn invested in a diversified portfolio. A spokesperson for the company told Guardian Australia about 1% of its investments were in fossil fuels. That appears to mean the company will be removing $20m from the fossil fuel industry. HCF said it had not announced the decision publicly because it was not intended to generate publicity, but it would consider an announcement after the divestment process was complete. Market Forces and health professionals have applauded HCF’s move. The surgeon Kingsley Faulkner, the national chair of Doctors for the Environment Australia, said: “Responsible health organisations are making a stand and we are delighted that HCF has decided to join them and divest from fossil fuels. “The health consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent in many countries including Australia. The predicted health impacts of failing to [take action] are huge. History will be harsh on those who fail the moral and political challenge to act without further delay. As with tobacco control, Australia could again become a leader rather than a reluctant follower.” Most major health and medical bodies have warned of the extreme impacts climate change will have on human health. The World Health Organisation has estimated that climate change will kill 250,000 people a year between 2030 and 2050 by increasing the rates of malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. The Australian Medical Association released an official position statement on climate change and human health in 2015, which said: “The consequences of climate change have serious direct and indirect, observed and projected health impacts both globally and in Australia.” The then president of the AMA, Brian Owler, said: “There are already significant health and social effects of climate change and extreme weather events, and these effects will worsen over time if we do not take action now.” But health funds have so far been slow to accept the consensus, according Julien Vincent, the executive director of Market Forces. “Health funds have led the broader divestment out of tobacco and in many cases munitions, acknowledging the hypocrisy of investing in products which threaten human health,” Vincent said.  “As the first fund to take the step, we applaud HCF for making the right decision in shifting away from fossil fuels as well. HCF’s commitment has added an entire new sector to the fossil fuel divestment movement and this should send a clear message to all private health funds, which have nearly $13bn under management, that fossil fuels are bad for our health.”  “A wave of health funds divesting from fossil fuels may be the catalyst for passive index managers like Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard to finally produce a fossil fuel-free product for the Australian market.” The renowned epidemiologist, public health researcher and 2003 Australian of the Year Fiona Stanley said: “Human health and financing fossils fuels are fundamentally incompatible. “Institutions that are concerned with protecting and improving people’s health should be doing everything they can to steer our economy away from fossil fuels. “Fossil fuels are a major contributor to air pollution, which is now close to tobacco as a leading cause of death globally. Moreover, the greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels will put people’s health at risk for generations as climate change impacts take effect.” At its annual meeting in November, executives of Medibank faced questions from shareholders about the health impacts of fossil fuel companies that it was investing in. In response to one question, the company’s non-executive director Peter Hodgett said the Medibank had divested from tobacco but would consider further divestment, including from fossil fuels. “In other areas the jury is still out about how much harm is done by these various other items relative to the good and the economic need for them in society,” Hodgett said. “We’ve drawn the line at tobacco but we continue to be open to discussion on these issues.” A spokesman for Medibank said the company was still “open to discussion on these issues”. “We’re of course proud of our work on the tobacco divestment and will continue to listen and work collaboratively with our shareholders, customers and stakeholders,” the spokesman said."
"The UK’s clock has been set to Permanent Global Summer Time once more after a temporary blip. Courgettes, spinach and iceberg lettuce are back on the shelves, and the panic over the lack of imported fruit and vegetables has been contained. “As you were, everyone,” appears to be the message. But why would supermarkets – which are said to have lost sales worth as much as £8m in January thanks to record-breaking, crop-wrecking snow and rainfall in the usually mild winter regions of Spain and Italy – be so keen to fly in substitutes from the US at exorbitant cost? Why would they sell at a loss rather than let us go without, or put up prices to reflect the changing market? Why indeed would anyone air-freight watery lettuce across the whole of the American continent and the Atlantic when it takes 127 calories of fuel energy to fly just 1 food calorie of that lettuce to the UK from California? The answer is that, in the past 40 years, a whole supermarket system has been built on the seductive illusion of this Permanent Global Summer Time. As a result, a cornucopia of perpetual harvest is one of the key selling points that big stores have over rival retailers. If the enticing fresh produce section placed near the front of each store to draw you in starts looking a bit empty, we might not bother to shop there at all. But when you take into account climate change, the shortages of early 2017 look more like a taste of things to come than just a blip, and that is almost impossible for supermarkets to admit. Add the impact of this winter’s weather on Mediterranean production, the inflationary pressures from a post-Brexit fall in the value of sterling against the euro, and the threat of tariffs as we exit the single market, and suddenly the model begins to look extraordinarily vulnerable. I can remember the precise moment I first understood that we had been taken into this fantastical, nature-defying system without most of us really noticing. It was 1990 and I had been living and working with Afghan refugees in Pakistan’s North-West Frontier province for a long period. The bazaars where we bought our food were seasonal, and stocked from the immediate region. Back home on leave in the UK, I had that sense of dislocation that enables you to see your own culture as if from the outside. It was winter, but the supermarkets were full of fresh fruits and vegetables from around the world. The shelves looked wonderful, perfect, almost clinical, as though invented in a lab in my absence; but there was no smell. It was vaguely troubling in a way I couldn’t identify at the time. Our food was not like this before the 1980s. The transformation was made possible by the third industrial revolution – the great leap in information technology and logistics that enabled retailers to dispense with keeping stock at the back of stores. Instead they were able to switch to minutely tuned, just-in-time electronic ordering from centralised distribution centres and to use the space freed up to extend their ranges from a typical 8,000 lines to 40,000, knocking out competition from all sorts of independent specialist shops as they did so. During the 90s there was a 90% increase in the movement of agricultural and food products between the UK and Europe The precursor to these new constantly replenished supply lines was our joining the European common market. Then with Spain and Portugal also joining in 1986, fresh territories from which to source opened up. European funds paid for fast new road networks across the Mediterranean, building the infrastructure for 44-tonne refrigerated trucks to whisk southern produce to northern Europe in the winter months, not just to the UK but to Germany and Scandinavia too. During the 90s there was a 90% increase in the movement of agricultural and food products between the UK and Europe. Food writer Joanna Blythman coined the term Permanent Global Summer Time in an article for the Guardian in 2002. By then the astonishing shift in supply chains had come into sharp focus. Although the new supply system is miraculous in its scale, speed and efficiency, it has two fatal flaws. First, it depends on the profligate use of finite resources – water, soil, and fossil fuels (with all their greenhouse gas emissions). Depending on whose figures you take, between a fifth and a third of UK emissions relate to food. More and more, we eat by exploiting the often fragile ecosystems of other countries. The UK is the sixth largest importer in the world of virtual water – the water needed to produce our food elsewhere. Second, the system is built on the exploitation of cheap labour, mostly migrant, that has been socially disruptive and politically fraught. Migrant labour is not coincidental but structural to the just-in-time model, which needs the extreme flexibility of a class of desperate workers to function. Undocumented, underpaid migrants from Africa have provided the labour to harvest Italian and Spanish crops. Low-paid migrants, predominantly from eastern Europe, have become the backbone of the UK’s centralised distribution centres, providing 35% of food manufacturing labour, and 70-80% of harvesting labour. The brief disappearance of a few green and salad vegetables was hardly a great deprivation, but we should take it seriously as an early warning sign. Like the banking system, our food system seems too big, too sophisticated and too embedded in everyday life to fail. Yet privately, supermarket buyers have been talking for at least five years about “choice editing” – that is, editing out some of the fresh foods we have come to take for granted because importing them is unsustainable. Examples might include asparagus from Peru, 95% of which comes from the Ica valley where wells are running dry, and Moroccan tomatoes sourced from areas suffering severe water stress and aquifer depletion. Supermarkets expected water shortages to bring the first jolts to the system. Brexit and climate change have brought other potential shocks to the fore. The UK only produces a little over half of what its people consume; over a quarter of what we eat and drink comes from the EU. Reverting to more local ways of meeting our needs has become harder as the old infrastructure of regional wholesale markets has disappeared, and as farmers continue to exit the food business because they cannot make a living. The government view, under the current Conservative administration and previous coalition and Labour ones, has been that the market will provide. In a new era of protectionism and with the UK heading out of the EU, that looks increasingly complacent. A decade ago, the Ministry of Defence predicted that changes to the climate, globalisation and global inequality would “touch the lives of everyone on the planet” within the next 20 years. “Food and water insecurity will drive mass migrations in the worst areas, but may also be possible in more affluent areas because of distribution problems, specialised agriculture and aggressive pricing … a succession of poor harvests may cause major price spikes resulting in significant economic and political turbulence,” a document warned. Leaving the EU could be an opportunity for a radical rethink of the food system, but the government shows little sign of grasping it. So when I see glossy magazine pictures and Instagram snaps of summer dishes conjured up in the middle of winter of ingredients flown in from distant climes, I wonder if, a couple of decades from now, we will look to ourselves like the late Victorian colonials photographed proudly next to dead lions and other game in Africa. They could hardly have imagined they were consuming their world out of existence."

"The Bay of Bengal’s basin contains some of the most populous regions of the earth. No less than a quarter of the world’s population is concentrated in the eight countries that border the bay1. Approximately 200 million people live along the Bay of Bengal’s coasts and of these a major proportion are partially or wholly dependent on its fisheries2. For the majority of those who depend on it, the Bay of Bengal can provide no more than a meagre living: 61% of India’s fisherfolk already live below the poverty line. Yet the numbers dependent on fisheries are only likely to grow in years to come, partly because of climate change. In southern India drought and water scarcity have already induced tens of thousands of farmers to join the fishing fleet3. Rising sea levels are also likely to drive many displaced people into the fishing industry.  But the fisheries of the Bay of Bengal have been under pressure for decades and are now severely depleted4. Many once-abundant species have all but disappeared. Particularly badly affected are the species at the top of the food chain. The bay was once feared by sailors for its man-eating sharks; they are now rare in these waters. Other apex predators like grouper, croaker and rays have also been badly hit. Catches now consist mainly of species like sardines, which are at the bottom of the marine food web5.  Good intentions have played no small part in creating the current situation. In the 1960s, western aid agencies encouraged the growth of trawling in India, so that fishermen could profit from the demand for prawns in foreign markets. This led to a “pink gold rush”, in which prawns were trawled with fine mesh nets that were dragged along the sea floor. But along with hauls of “pink gold” these nets also scooped up whole seafloor ecosystems as well as vulnerable species like turtles, dolphins, sea snakes, rays and sharks. These were once called bycatch, and were largely discarded. Today the collateral damage of the trawling industry is processed and sold to the fast-growing poultry and aquaculture industries of the region6. In effect, the processes that sustain the Bay of Bengal’s fisheries are being destroyed in order to produce dirt-cheap chicken feed and fish feed.  The aid that flowed in after the massive tsunami of 2004 also had certain unintended consequences7. It led to the modernisation and expansion of the small-scale fisheries sector, which generated an illusory boom followed by a bust.  In recent decades the governments of the nations that surround the Bay of Bengal have striven to expand and encourage their fisheries. But unfortunately these efforts have often ignored questions of long-term sustainability. Although attempts have been made to regulate fishing in the bay they have been largely ineffective.  In the 1980s and 90s, fisheries expanded into new grounds and began to target new species and for a while there was an increase in catches5. But catch rates began to decline in the late 1990s and trawlers were forced to move farther and farther from their home waters. This in turn has created a little-noticed grid of conflict. In 2015 Sri Lankan authorities claimed to have spotted 40,544 Indian trawlers in Sri Lanka’s territorial waters8. Seventy trawlers were seized and 450 fishermen were arrested. At least 100 deaths have been reported9. Conversely, many Sri Lankan tuna fishermen have also been arrested in India. On the other side of the subcontinent, large numbers of Indian fishermen are frequently arrested in Pakistan: 220 of them were released in December 2016, as a goodwill gesture.  In Myanmar, until a ban was enacted in 2014, the catch collected by foreign fishing boats was 100 times greater than that of local fishermen10. In the troubled Arakan region, where 43% of the population is dependent on fisheries, catches have declined so steeply that many families are mired in debt11. Conflicts over fisheries and other resources are a significant but largely unnoticed aspect of the explosive tensions of the region.  The Mergui archipelago on the Thai-Myanmar border is one of the more secluded parts of the Bay. In the late 19th century an English fisheries officer described this area as being “literally alive with fish”1. Today the archipelago’s sparsely populated islands remain pristinely beautiful while some of its underwater landscapes present scenes of utter devastation. Fish stocks have been decimated by methods that include cyanide poisoning. The region was once famous for its coral reefs; these have been ravaged by dynamite-fishing and climate-change induced bleaching.  Yet the exploitation of these waters continues without check. At night specially equipped, long-armed boats materialise around the islands and shine high-powered green lights into the water to attract plankton and the squid that follow in their wake. After nightfall, a glow that is bright enough to be visible from outer space12 hangs above the archipelago, like a miasmic fog. These squid boats, some of which are probably crewed by men who have been trafficked like slaves13, help to make Thailand the world’s largest exporter of squid – at least for the time being.  At the same time the bay’s ecosystems are also being disrupted by other environmental pressures. Several large rivers empty into the bay, carrying vast tides of untreated sewage, plastic, industrial waste and effluent from the agriculture and aquaculture industries14. The impact of this pollution could be catastrophic. The high load of organic pollutants, coupled with the diminution of the fish that keep them in control, could lead to massive plankton blooms, further reducing the water’s oxygen content.  Last month a multinational team of scientists reported an alarming finding – a very large “dead zone” has appeared in the bay. Apart from sulphur-oxidising bacteria and marine worms, few creatures can live in these oxygen-depleted waters15. This zone already spans some 60,000 sq km and appears to be growing16.  The dead zone of the Bay of Bengal is now at a point where a further reduction in its oxygen content could have the effect of stripping the water of nitrogen, a key nutrient. This transition could be triggered either by accretions of pollution or by changes in the monsoons, a predicted effect of global warming.  What is unfolding in the bay is a catastrophic convergence of flawed policy, economic over-exploitation, unsustainable forms of waste management, and climate change impacts that are intensifying in unpredictable ways. The scientists who identified the bay’s dead zone warn that this stretch of ocean is approaching a tipping point that will have serious consequences for the planet’s oceans and the global nitrogen cycle.  Should the bay’s fisheries collapse there will also be very serious human consequences, including intensified conflict and mass displacement. If millions of people lose their livelihoods then we can be sure that the resultant churning of populations will create huge new streams of migration, across the bay, the Indian Ocean, and indeed, the planet. Recent refugee flows in the region suggest that such a process may have already begun.  For these issues to be addressed there needs to be a sea change in governmental attitudes and policies. For too long the governments of the region, often with international encouragement, have looked upon the sea as a bottomless resource pit to be despoiled at will. They need instead to view it as a wilderness that requires conservation and informed management, in consultation with the communities that are dependent on it. The situation demands carefully crafted solutions since it involves millions of livelihoods that are already imperilled by the dwindling of the bay’s resources.  • Amitav Ghosh is a novelist and non-fiction writer.

"Al Gore knows everybody. He can whip out his cell phone and dial the treasury secretary or the head of a giant solar panel manufacturer and say things such as “I’ll check with President Hollande” or “Elon suggested I call.” It’s amazing, then, that nowhere in his contacts is the number of a documentary film-maker that knows a thing or two about keeping audiences awake.  It’s shocking, really, as the latest entry in the Gore Cinematic Universe couldn’t possibly have more inherent drama. The glaciers are melting, the oceans are boiling, soil is cracked and dry. The planet is facing imminent extinction and only one man has the knowledge, media savvy and political influence to do something. For the love of Gaia, somebody call Michael Bay! An Inconvenient Sequel, however, is not that type of movie. It’s different from An Inconvenient Truth, the celebrated slideshow-as-cinema documentary that won an Oscar and had a striking impact on education and awareness. The 2006 film was notably dry, consisting mainly of graphs and the former vice president’s meagre attempts at cracking a few dad jokes. But its specificity gave it focus, tightly covering the audience with facts and visual reinforcements, like an atmospheric layer around our potentially doomed planet. Eleven years later, the follow-up – which has many of the same producers but different directors in Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk – is uncomfortably desultory and surprisingly vainglorious. As shocking as it may seem, you may yearn for more of those dreary lectures. The first half is spent checking in on what Gore has been up to since the last movie. While George W Bush has taken up painting, Gore has been evangelising against climate change with an increased determination. He hosts group teach-ins so others around the world can present their own version of the Inconvenient Truth slideshow. He’s sitting with John Kerry one day, checking out ice on a glacier the next, then watching YouTube clips of floods while traveling to meet Indian industrialists. It is undeniable that Gore, saggy jeans, Tennessee drawl and all, is a righteous man. These Keeping Up With Al sequences are peppered with more scientific examples of just how bad things are getting thanks to CO2 emissions and overall industrial nastiness. Something resembling a narrative arc comes into focus in the second half, as Gore prepares for the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris. While the movie never quite gets into the specifics of the agreement, it positions India’s prime minister Narendra Modi as a villain whose economic impulses stand in direct threat to the progress the summit represents. (This film suggests that Gore’s back channel networking saves the day, and maybe the world.) Much of An Inconvenient Sequel was shot during the US election campaign, when few rational people were predicting that Donald Trump would become president. A few soundbites from the former reality TV star and developer of wretched Atlantic City casinos are sprinkled in, usually in counterpoint to one of the more trenchant or terrifying scientific facts. There is, therefore, a coda, in which Gore describes the 2016 election as a punch in the face. The next image is of Gore taking the elevator at Trump Tower, determined to make his plea for governmental change, no matter how quixotic that attempt may be. An Inconvenient Sequel is more a portrait of Gore than a call to arms. It ends with a sort of forced positivity, much of which is recycled directly from the first movie: political change is hard, but we can do it, morality demands it. Gore’s passion and anger come out in his speeches, but it begins to feel like a campaign for a non-existent election. Indeed, the most memorable moment is when a Paris-based television interview is interrupted by the terrorist attacks at the Bataclan theatre. This sequence has nothing to do with the climate crisis but everything to do with being human.  I kept wishing that the clearly capable Gore would go for the kill against a climate change denier. Since we are living in an era of fake news, and a new president who revels in it, perhaps that more aggressive side of Gore will come out in the last part of the trilogy. It may not be Gore’s preferred style, but it may be what’s necessary."
"Three-quarters of Australians, including most Liberal voters, oppose the government giving a $1bn loan to Adani to build a rail line between its proposed Carmichael coalmine and the Abbot Point shipping terminal. The government’s Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund (Naif) granted Adani “conditional approval” for a $1bn loan in December last year.  The rail line, if built, would allow Adani to build the country’s biggest coalmine and open up the Galilee Basin to further mines by linking them to an export terminal. Coral scientists have argued the coal needs to stay in the ground if the Great Barrier Reef is to be protected from the impacts of climate change. The government has argued there is no definite link between the coal from the Adani mine being burned and climate change, and the resources minister, Matthew Canavan, has said the mine would “be a good thing for the environment”. But a ReachTel poll of 2,126 people across Australia conducted on 12 January, commissioned by GetUp, found 74.4% of respondents said “no” when asked whether “lending $1bn to an offshore mining company ￼to build a coal rail line is a good use of public money”. Just 16.2% of respondents thought it was a good use of public money, with 9.5% saying they didn’t know. The opposition was strong regardless of voting intention, with 53.7% of those who said they would vote Liberal opposing the loan. Just over 80% of “undecided” voters, 85.5% of Labor voters and 89.9% of Greens voters said the loan was a bad use of public money. A previous survey of people living in the region that would host the mine found two-thirds opposed public money being used to support the mine. Analysis from Greenpeace has suggested the rail project does not meet the requirements for a loan under the scheme, since it will not be “of public benefit” and it is not clear Adani will be able to repay the loan. GetUp’s Miriam Lyons said: “A mere 16% of Australians think this is a good way to invest public money. While we see hospitals and schools starved of resources, the government sees fit to hand over a billion bucks to build Adani’s shiny new train.” Lyons called on Malcolm Turnbull to stop the loan going ahead.  “Prime minister Turnbull’s not even playing for his own team – only 32% of Liberal voters agree with this use of public money,” she said."

"Donald Trump’s inauguration as US president poses a grave threat to the major progress made in the battle against climate change over the past decade. The top 20 things that Trump has pledged to “get rid of” include US commitment to the Paris climate agreement and payments to the UN climate fund, which helps developing countries tackle global warming.  Those working to help poorer states adapt to the impact of climate change and become more resilient to its effects must emulate the approach adopted by the global green movement, which is preparing to fight its corner in the struggle to limit the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.   Apart from activism and political organisation, people working to develop resilience programmes and policies need to frame and communicate the benefits of their work in a way that aligns with the priorities of the new regime. There are five things they can do to counter the looming existential threat posed by Trump if they become more savvy political operators. First, since migration was central to Trump’s candidature, it is vital to stress that helping communities to prepare for the disruption wrought by global warming – not least by adapting their present habits – will curb the involuntary movement of people. Fewer climate refugees will mean less displacement and a reduction in the number of people crossing borders. In 2008, disputed research by Professor Norman Myers, a British environmentalist, put the number of climate change refugees at 20 million and suggested the number could swell to 200 million by 2050, causing substantial displacement in the US and beyond. It is therefore vital Trump is made aware that helping people in vulnerable areas to roll with the punches – an approach that has proved effective in Africa, Asia and the Americas, as the International Organisation for Migration has pointed out – could help reduce these numbers.   Another of Trump’s main planks is economic growth. The centrepiece of his economic plan is the promise to create 25m jobs over the next decade. With that in mind, it is crucial to emphasise that preparing for natural disasters and reducing the risk of them happening in the first place can help to boost economic growth. A World Bank report has argued that such measures “can have immediate and significant economic benefits to households, the private sector and, more broadly, at the macroeconomic level”, noting that the perception of risk from future disasters leads to risk aversion that dampens entrepreneurial activity.  Conversely, adequate measures to reduce risk through resilience programmes and policies can promote investment. For example, government investment in flood defences in Mexico’s Tabasco region has helped stimulate private investment in housing and stopped companies from leaving. The Rockefeller Foundation has chronicled numerous instances from the US, New Zealand, Colombia and India to argue that equipping communities to deal with natural disasters yields a tangible dividend. A third area in which those focused on fostering a stronger ability to absorb natural shocks might make headway with Trump relates to peace and security. Trump pitched himself as the “national security” candidate, so it would be useful to demonstrate that greater resilience equates to greater safety. Last year, 25 US military and national security experts, including former advisers to Ronald Reagan and George W Bush, warned that climate change poses a “significant risk to US national security” (pdf), for instance by causing food shortages that can foment public unease and create a breeding ground for terrorism. Similarly, the Overseas Development Institute claims that the relationship between conflict and disasters is complex but cites examples from Afghanistan, Uganda and Nepal to demonstrate that mitigating the impact of climate change can reduce the risk of conflict. At the same time, there is no need to raise the hackles of the incoming regime by basing the case for resilience solely on global warming. Instead, a fourth strategy would be to frame resilience as an approach that also helps to deal with technological, social, economic and political shocks. Why not point out to Trump that helping vulnerable communities acquire risk insurance, savings and stocks of emergency rations and medicine can help them deal with political unrest and industrial disasters as well as earthquakes, floods and cyclones? Finally, it is vital to talk about the here and now. Climate sceptics deride talk of global warming for privileging abstract future concerns over issues that matter today. This is partly because scientific analysis has used models and forecasts to predict future impacts. Yet natural disasters and other effects of climate change are already eroding 1.6% from global GDP, leading to the involuntary migration of millions of people and exacerbating the risk of conflict and national security threats. These issues are likelier to strike a chord with Trump than scientifically sound projections and predictions. There is an urgent need to maintain the positive momentum on battling climate change. A politically astute approach by the resilience movement can help to achieve that. • Dr Aditya V Bahadur works with the action on climate today programme at Oxford Policy Management and with the risk and resilience programme of the Overseas Development Institute"

"Physicist Steven Desch has come up with a novel solution to the problems that now beset the Arctic. He and a team of colleagues from Arizona State University want to replenish the region’s shrinking sea ice – by building 10 million wind-powered pumps over the Arctic ice cap. In winter, these would be used to pump water to the surface of the ice where it would freeze, thickening the cap. The pumps could add an extra metre of sea ice to the Arctic’s current layer, Desch argues. The current cap rarely exceeds 2-3 metres in thickness and is being eroded constantly as the planet succumbs to climate change.  “Thicker ice would mean longer-lasting ice. In turn, that would mean the danger of all sea ice disappearing from the Arctic in summer would be reduced significantly,” Desch told the Observer. Desch and his team have put forward the scheme in a paper that has just been published in Earth’s Future, the journal of the American Geophysical Union, and have worked out a price tag for the project: $500bn (£400bn). It is an astonishing sum. However, it is the kind of outlay that may become necessary if we want to halt the calamity that faces the Arctic, says Desch, who, like many other scientists, has become alarmed at temperature change in the region. They say that it is now warming twice as fast as their climate models predicted only a few years ago and argue that the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming will be insufficient to prevent the region’s sea ice disappearing completely in summer, possibly by 2030. “Our only strategy at present seems to be to tell people to stop burning fossil fuels,” says Desch. “It’s a good idea but it is going to need a lot more than that to stop the Arctic’s sea ice from disappearing.” The loss of the Arctic’s summer sea ice cover would disrupt life in the region, endanger many of its species, from Arctic cod to polar bears, and destroy a pristine habitat. It would also trigger further warming of the planet by removing ice that reflects solar radiation back into space, disrupt weather patterns across the northern hemisphere and melt permafrost, releasing more carbon gases into the atmosphere. Hence Desch’s scheme to use wind pumps to bring water that is insulated from the bitter Arctic cold to its icy surface, where it will freeze and thicken the ice cap. Nor is the physicist alone in his Arctic scheming: other projects to halt sea-ice loss include one to artificially whiten the Arctic by scattering light-coloured aerosol particles over it to reflect solar radiation back into space, and another to spray sea water into the atmosphere above the region to create clouds that would also reflect sunlight away from the surface. All the projects are highly imaginative – and extremely costly. The fact that they are even being considered reveals just how desperately worried researchers have become about the Arctic. “The situation is causing grave concern,” says Professor Julienne Stroeve, of University College London. “It is now much more dire than even our worst case scenarios originally suggested.’ Last November, when sea ice should have begun thickening and spreading over the Arctic as winter set in, the region warmed up. Temperatures should have plummeted to -25C but reached several degrees above freezing instead. “It’s been about 20C warmer than normal over most of the Arctic Ocean. This is unprecedented,” research professor Jennifer Francis of Rutgers University told the Guardian in November. “These temperatures are literally off the charts for where they should be at this time of year. It is pretty shocking. The Arctic has been breaking records all year. It is exciting but also scary.” Nor have things got better in the intervening months. Figures issued by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), in Boulder, Colorado, last week revealed that in January the Arctic’s sea ice covered 13.38 million sq km, the lowest January extent in the 38 years since satellites began surveying the region. That figure is 260,000 sq km below the level for January last year, which was the previous lowest extent for that month, and a worrying 1.26 million sq km below the long-term average for January. In fact, sea ice growth stalled during the second week of January – in the heart of the Arctic winter – while the ice cap actually retreated within the Kara and Barents seas, and within the Sea of Okhotsk. Similarly, the Svalbard archipelago, normally shrouded in ice, has remained relatively free because of the inflow of warm Atlantic water along the western part of the island chain. Although there has been some recovery, sea ice remains well below all previous record lows. This paucity of sea ice bodes ill for the Arctic’s summer months when cover traditionally drops to its lower annual level, and could plunge to a record minimum this year. Most scientists expect that, at current emission rates, the Arctic will be reliably free of sea ice in summer by 2030. By “free” they mean there will be less than 1m sq km of sea ice left in the Arctic, most of it packed into remote bays and channels, while the central Arctic Ocean over the north pole will be completely open. And by “reliably”, scientists mean there will have been five consecutive years with less than 1m sq km of ice by the year 2050. The first single ice-free year will come much earlier than this, however. And when that happens, the consequences are likely to be severe for the human and animal inhabitants of the region. An ice-free Arctic will be wide open to commercial exploitation, for example. Already, mining, oil and tourism companies have revealed plans to begin operations – schemes that could put severe strain on indigenous communities’ way of life in the region. Equally worrying is the likely impact on wildlife, says Stroeve. “Juvenile Arctic cod like to hang out under the sea ice. Polar bears hunt on sea ice, and seals give birth on it. We have no idea what will happen when that lot disappears. In addition, there is the problem of increasing numbers of warm spells during which rain falls instead of snow. That rain then freezes on the ground and forms a hard coating that prevents reindeer and caribou from finding food under the snow.” Nor would the rest of the world be isolated. With less ice to reflect solar radiation back into space, the dark ocean waters of the high latitudes will warm and the Arctic will heat up even further. “If you warm the Arctic you decrease the temperature difference between the poles and the mid-latitudes, and that affects the polar vortex, the winds that blow between the mid latitudes and the high latitudes,” says Henry Burgess, head of the Arctic office of the UK Natural Environment Research Council. “Normally this process tends to keep the cold in the high north and milder air in mid-latitudes but there is an increasing risk this will be disrupted as the temperature differential gets weaker. We may get more and more long, cold spells spilling down from the Arctic, longer and slower periods of Atlantic storms and equally warmer periods in the Arctic. What happens up there touches us all. It is hard to believe you can take away several million sq km of ice a few thousand kilometres to the north and not expect there will be an impact on weather patterns here in the UK.” For her part, Stroeve puts it more bleakly: “We are carrying out a blind experiment on our planet whose outcome is almost impossible to guess.” This point is backed by Desch. “Sea ice is disappearing from the Arctic – rapidly. The sorts of options we are proposing need to be researched and discussed now. If we are provocative and get people to think about this, that is good. “The question is: do I think our project would work? Yes. I am confident it would. But we do need to put a realistic cost on these things. We cannot keep on just telling people, ‘Stop driving your car or it’s the end of the world’. We have to give them alternative options, though equally we need to price them.” The Arctic ice cap reaches its maximum extent every March and then, over the next six months, dwindles. The trough is reached around mid-September at the end of the melting season. The ice growth cycle then restarts. However, the extent of regrowth began slackening towards the end of the last century. According to meteorologists, the Arctic’s ice cover at its minimum is now decreasing by 13% every decade – a direct consequence of heating triggered by increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Climate change deniers claim this loss is matched by gains in sea ice around the Antarctic. It is not. Antarctic ice fluctuations are slight compared with the Arctic’s plummeting coverage and if you combine the changes at both poles, you find more than a million sq km of ice has been lost globally in 30 years."

"According to Nasa, in 2016 the Earth’s surface temperature shattered the previous record for hottest year by 0.12°C. That record was set in 2015, which broke the previous record by 0.13°C. That record had been set in 2014, beating out 2010, which in turn had broken the previous record set in 2005. If you think that seems like a lot of record-breaking hot years, you’re right. The streak of three consecutive record hot years is unprecedented since measurements began in 1880. In the 35 years between 1945 and 1979, there were no record-breakers. In the 37 years since 1980, there have been 12. The video below illustrates all of the record-breaking years in the Nasa global surface temperature record since 1880.  These include a spate of five record hot years between 1937 and 1944; however, ongoing research is investigating whether some of those are artificial, due to changes in the way temperatures were measured during World War II.  Even including World War II, in the first 100 years of the Nasa data, the high temperature record was broken seven times. It’s been broken seven times in just the past 20 years.  This rapid rate of record-breaking heat (once every three years) is consistent with climate scientists’ expectations. A 2011 paper by Stefan Rahmstorf and Dim Coumou found that as global warming continues, we should expect to set new records about once every four years. Indeed, if we only use the data of the past 30 y, these show an almost linear trend of 0.017°C/y, yielding an expected 2.5 new record hot temperatures in the last decade [1 per 4 years]. Rahmstorf told me that so far, the rate of record-setting temperatures is in line with a consistent human-caused global warming trend: There is no statistical evidence for recent acceleration, just as there never was statistical evidence for a “slowdown” in global warming before the recent series of records. It’s all still within the noise (which could well be hiding an acceleration, but we cannot tell yet from these data). Global temperature wasn’t the only record-setter in 2016. Global warming causes climate change, and North America saw its highest number of storms and floods in over four decades. Globally, we saw over 1.5 times more extreme weather catastrophes in 2016 than the average over the past 30 years. Global sea ice cover plunged to a record low as well. California endured a fifth consecutive year of its worst drought in over a millennium. A drought also savaged the maize harvest in Southern Africa, causing a famine. The list of climate consequences goes on. To paraphrase Taylor Swift, “deniers gonna deny.” As expected, the anti-climate policy advocacy group GWPF claimed that the record-breaking global temperatures somehow prove that global warming has “paused,” because, they argue, the record was only set due to an El Niño event. Not so, say me, statisticians, and climate scientists: @theresphysics Oh my. What tosh. In ENSO corrected data-sets 2016 is still record warm. @dr_david_w @thegwpfcom pic.twitter.com/pUajFbJdr1 Quite obviously, human-caused global warming is the driver behind these frequent record-breaking hot years. Usually an El Niño event will help push a given year over the top, as happened in 2016 and 2015 (but not 2014). However, today’s El Niño years are hotter than past El Niño years because of global warming. Relatedly, testifying before the Senate on the day the record temperatures were announced in a bid to become EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt claimed that we don’t know how much humans are contributing to global warming: This is simply wrong. We wouldn’t be setting a new temperature record every three years if not for global warming, and there’s no question that the warming is predominantly human-caused. The latest IPCC report stated with 95% confidence that humans are the main cause of global warming since 1950, and most likely responsible for 100% of that temperature rise.  Every study quantifying the various contributions to global warming has found humans are the dominant cause. Our fingerprints are all over climate change – the changes are precisely in line with what we’d expect to see as a result of an increased greenhouse effect from human carbon pollution. That’s why there’s a 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. Climate denial is evolving. All of Trump’s nominees rejected his claims that climate change is a hoax, but all cast doubt on the degree to which humans are contributing, and to the threats it poses. It’s a softer, cuddlier form of climate denial that doesn’t reject all scientific research – just the vast majority – and yields the same end result of obstructing climate solutions. But physical reality doesn’t bend to denial or “alternative facts.” Until we address the problem, we’ll continue to see record-breaking heat and extreme weather. The longer we deny and the less action we take, the more extreme the consequences will become. As the renowned glaciologist Lonnie Thompson put it, “the only question is how much we will mitigate, adapt, and suffer.” Allowing for more denial and less action will maximize the third variable in that equation."
"Malcolm Turnbull has hit back at suggestions that his house’s large personal rooftop solar and battery system sends a message contrary to the government’s endorsement of “clean coal”. He rejected the idea that he had ever been critical of the renewables sector and dismissed his treasurer’s brandishing of a lump of coal in question time as “theatrics”.  “It’s not a question of beliefs, saying ‘Do you believe in renewables?’,” the prime minister said. “It’s like saying ‘Do you believe in tables?’ Renewables are there, they are doing well, they have got certain characteristics and you have to design your grid to take account of that.”  As his energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, raised the prospect of changing the mandate of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to accommodate coal, the prime minister said he had always been objective about energy. Asked whether his solar panels were enough to provide power to three average homes, Turnbull agreed that his personal 14.5kW system on the roof of his Point Piper home, with battery storage, was a “large array”.  Turnbull went on to explain his position on climate change and his government’s energy policy. “I believe that climate change is a threat that we have to deal with,” Turnbull told ABC Perth. “I believe that we have to reduce our emissions. I believe that we need to ensure that we use all technologies to generate energy.” A week ago, when blackouts were occurring in South Australia and were threatening other states, Renew Economy reported that Turnbull could rest easy, knowing his solar storage system would cover any energy usage in his own house. “I have never disparaged the renewables sector,” he said on Monday. “This is where, with great respect, journalists sometimes hear what they want to hear rather than what people are saying. “When I spoke at the press club, I made the point of the importance of renewables, I made the point of how the cost of renewables is coming down. The cost per watt of solar panels is a fraction of what it was 10 years ago.  “However, the issue with variable renewables – by which I mean principally solar and wind – is that they don’t generate electricity all the time.” Turnbull said he was the first political leader in Australia to talk about the importance of storage, including pumped hydro and batteries. Last week the CEFC granted a $54m loan to a large-scale solar development which it says has the potential for pumped hydro storage. He also said more gas needed to become available as a back-up. But his finance minister, Mathias Cormann, who has dual responsibility for appointing members of the CEFC board, rejected outright the opinion of the CEFC chief executive, Oliver Yates, that coal investments were very risky for the taxpayer.  Yates told a Senate committee that the CEFC would not likely invest in coal technology. Yates is due to step down within weeks, a position to be filled by Cormann and Frydenberg. “We don’t agree with [Yates], obviously,” Cormann told the ABC.  “I mean what is risky right now, and the experience in South Australia, of course, has shown that, is the reckless and ideological pursuit of state-based 50% renewable energy targets, which have put the stability of our energy system at risk.” Cormann blamed previous Labor policy for the lack of investment appetite for coal-fired power. “The reason why there’s been, you know, obviously no appetite for private-sector investment is because of the policy settings that have been progressively put in place by Labor and Green governments,” Cormann said.“If you look at other parts around the world, high-energy, high energy-efficient and low-emission technologies when it comes to coal have been deployed, are being deployed, are being considered and, you know, we think that that needs to be considered in Australia too.” The Australian Energy Council, representing 21 major electricity and natural gas businesses, has said there is no appetite for new coal-fired power in Australia. “While lower-emissions coal-fired power stations could be considered theoretically, in practice there is no current investment appetite to develop new coal-fired power in Australia,” the AEC chief executive, Matthew Warren, has stated.  “The industry’s investment focus has shifted to a combination of … lower-emissions gas generation, renewables and enabling technologies like storage.”"
"In 2010 the mining industry’s $22m campaign against Kevin Rudd’s resources tax helped bring down a prime minister. For years it has spent huge sums on donations and advertising and lobbying to exert enormous political influence. But the deep-pocketed miners really don’t like it when those with different views find the cash and the smarts to wield some clout. The latest squeal came this week in an appearance by the Minerals Council of Australia before the joint standing committee on electoral donations, which seems likely to reach a bipartisan consensus on banning foreign donations to political parties and other organisations that might influence the outcome of elections – including associated entities (like unions or fundraising foundations) and activist groups like GetUp.   While a ban on foreign donations is, in my view, a good idea, and broader reform of political donation laws is screamingly necessary if politics is to be saved from itself, the MCA seemed mostly intent on using the process to maximise the impact of any changes on environmental groups campaigning against new coalmines. In its submission the MCA listed the declared political expenditure of Greenpeace, the Climate Institute, WWF-Australia and the Australian Conservation Foundation in 2015-16 (just under $582,000 combined) and compared it with the MCA’s own political expenditure for the same period ($789,706). This conveniently omitted another $2.48m in political expenditure declared by ACA Low Emissions Technology (an associated company which grew from the coal industry’s fund for researching “clean coal” but which can now be used for “promoting the use of coal both within Australia and overseas and promoting the economic and social benefits of the coal industry”.) Then again, the appearance wasn’t really focused on self reflection about the political impact of the miners’ own lobbying efforts. They argued environmental groups should have to disclose their donors, including foreign donors, and should categorise much more of what they do as “political expenditure” that has to be declared to the Australian Electoral Commission. I generally agree on the first point. Emails leaked last year showed foreign donors were bankrolling the campaign to prevent the development of the Adani coalmine. It would be far better for such arrangements to be transparent. The arguments also highlight the complexity of defining which organisations should be hit by a ban, or new disclosure rules, and in relation to what proportion of their operations. Any ban has to extend further than the parties themselves otherwise foreign donations will be channelled through the equivalent of the US political action committees. But most of the Mineral Council’s biggest members are multinationals, listed on Australian and overseas stock exchanges. Could their membership fees or fighting fund donations be used for the MCA’s political campaigns if foreign donations were banned? Should their individual contributions be revealed?  What about campaigns like the one a few years back by Peabody, then the world’s largest private-sector coal company, which teamed with the global PR firm Burson-Marsteller to produce a website and social media push targeting China, the US and Australia, called “Advanced Energy for Life”, with the stated aim of “educating and mobilising world leaders, multinational organisations, a wide range of institutions and stakeholders and the general public to end the crisis of global energy poverty” (by supporting the greater use of coal, of course). Some environmental groups are also global entities. But most say their foreign donations are tiny – in the case of ACF less than 1% of income over the past 10 years, and similarly small for GetUp, which voluntarily declares all its revenue and income anyway. And not everything the miners or the greenies do is designed to influence the outcome of elections, so how far do we go with any bans or new transparency requirements? And who would be caught by increased requirements for disclosure? The Institute of Public Affairs runs campaigns that are obviously political but doesn’t disclose its funders. The Australia Institute doesn’t make its donors public either. What about donations from the foreign-owned Adani itself? But the miners appeared only worried about the greenies, having already helped convince a separate inquiry to recommend that conservation groups should have limits placed on the amount of advocacy work they can do (as opposed to on the ground “environmental remediation”) if they want to receive tax-deductible status. “The MCA is not questioning the right of environmental groups to pursue objectives or to raise money for this purpose,” the council says in its submission to the current inquiry, but adds “no organisation should be allowed to pursue an undeclared political campaign with undisclosed foreign donations.” The political battle over the legitimacy of the coal industry is fierce, and the miners have, of late, been trying to stage a fight back – this week launching the sequel to their somewhat mocked “Little Black Rock” campaign promoting high efficiency coal-fired generation plants – TV ads, a website and a social media campaign under the new slogan “Making the Future Possible”. It makes a whole range of debatable claims, including that the International Energy Agency forecasts Australia’s coal exports to grow by 18% out to 2040, which is true, but only under the scenario where the world does nothing more about climate change and warms by at least three degrees.  That kind of fact checking is all part of a proper public debate, where, despite the miners’ best efforts, the idea that coal really isn’t part of the long-term future appears to be winning. It would be a terrible shame if electoral laws were used in a desperate attempt hobble that argument, and an even bigger shame if attempting it did anything to undermine a bipartisan effort to clean up politics."
"If the dissident conservative senator Cory Bernardi’s new political party shares the views of its founder, then we can chalk up it up as another fringe party firmly in the climate science denial camp. Ignoring mountains of evidence from multiple lines of inquiry carried out over many decades, Bernardi has for a long time chosen to listen instead to fake experts pushing talking points that walk like zombies through barbecue conversations across Australia.  A Bernardi-led party would join One Nation, Family First, the Liberal Democrats and Rise Up Australia in rejecting the evidence for action on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  Many of the climate change talking points pushed individually and collectively by these political groups perfectly match the propagandised science pushed by conservative “free market” thinktanks in the US. Like Bernardi, the likes of One Nation and Family First have taken their cues and inspiration from that US network of ideological “thinktanks” that push climate science denial as if their lives, or their salaries, depended on it. Let me explain.  Bernardi has been much more than just an outspoken politician who thinks human-caused climate change is mostly a fraud and that carbon prices are just “a form of socialism”. Bernardi has been a funder and an organiser of the opposition to action on climate change in Australia for years.  When Bernardi launched his Conservative Leadership Foundation (CLF) in 2009, one of the first action items of the groups the CLF helped to establish was to go after policies that put a price on greenhouse gas emissions. Bernardi’s inspiration for forming the CLF, at least in part, came from a reported trip to the Leadership Institute in the US a year or two earlier.  The Leadership Institute trains young people to be conservative activists and “freedom fighters” that will go out into the world to “defeat the radical left.” The CLF helped to fund and establish a network of conservative websites, including stopgillardscarbontax.com, which had another US-based global warming sceptic, the Cato Institute’s Patrick Michaels, as a science adviser. Bernardi himself has spoken twice at climate conferences organised by the US climate science denial group the Heartland Institute – once in Chicago in May 2010 and then again in Sydney in October that same year. Each time, Heartland paid Bernardi’s expenses. In October 2011, Bernardi told Fairfax that he had “no comment” on the Heartland Institute and said his appearance was “not an endorsement or a disendorsement of any other views”. But in his speech to a Heartland Institute-organised conference in Sydney a year earlier, Bernardi offered the institute a glowing endorsement. He told the audience: “I have had association with the Heartland Institute for a little over a year now and it’s great work they are doing.” At the earlier Heartland Institute conference in Chicago, Bernardi said it was “inspiring” to see so many people “committed to common sense on climate change.”  In his speeches, Bernardi offered a rallying call to like-minded folks to take on the science of climate change and efforts to price greenhouse gas emissions, which he said were “a form of socialism.” At the Sydney conference, Bernardi advised the audience that what was needed was to take the efforts of climate science deniers (not his description) and “package it up into political sound bites”. “We have to expose the flaws of the IPCC conclusions and methodology,” Bernardi said, adding that he needed to “draw on the work that’s done by the likes of Heartland.”  Bernardi said: “My role, and I hope you will share it, is to distill the essence of these arguments and put them into something that the Australian people can understand.” A couple of years after Bernardi’s courting of Heartland, the institute ran a billboard campaign comparing people who accepted the evidence of human-caused climate change to the values of terrorist Ted Kaczynski. The Nationals MP George Christensen, who for now has ruled out joining Bernardi, has also spoken at a Heartland climate event. Australia’s richest woman, the mining magnate Gina Rinehart, is also reportedly backing Bernardi and joined him in meetings in New York in late 2016 with key figures from the Donald Trump camp.  Rinehart has previously supported speaking tours by Lord Christopher Monckton, the British climate science denier once described as a “vaudeville artist” by a former version of Malcolm Turnbull (the one that claimed to care deeply about climate change). Cory Bernardi can wield considerable influence outside the Liberal party on an enlarged Senate crossbench. Bernardi's resignation brings the Coalition down to 29 seats. One Nation (three) and the Nick Xenophon Team (three) are key to helping the government achieve a majority of 38 (39 when the two vacancies are filled). Bernardi's vote counts because the government can only afford to lose two or three crossbench votes. Although voters tend to vote for party groups, once senators are elected the seat is theirs, not the party's. Senators who have abandoned their parties include Mal Colston (Labor), Glenn Lazarus and Jacqui Lambie (Palmer United party) and Rodney Culleton (One Nation). Monckton helped to launch minor party Rise Up Australia, fronted by young Earth creationist pastor Daniel Nalliah.  Monckton is also the “chief policy adviser” to the Science and Public Policy Institute (not an actual institute) – another of those US-based “thinktanks” that push discredited climate science talking points.  As recently as December 2016, One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts was rubbing shoulders in Washington DC with a who’s who of climate science deniers from this web of groups.  After quitting the coal industry, Roberts became a voluntary project manager for the Galileo Movement.  But a couple of years earlier, Roberts was in New York for the first of Heartland’s conferences for climate science deniers (also there was David Archibald, a current One Nation candidate in Western Australia who recently labeled single mothers as being too lazy to get partners). Roberts drew on US-based deniers for his “advisory panel” at the Galileo Movement, including Monckton and Michaels. One Nation’s climate policy is a literal cut and paste of the Galileo Movement’s wish list on climate change policy.  The former Family First senator Steve Fielding is another to have returned from a Heartland Institute conference with dodgy talking points under his arm. Fielding is long gone, but Family First’s rejection of hard evidence on climate science remains.  Groups like the Heartland Institute have been galvanised by the election of Donald Trump and, as I’ve argued before, the impact of that web of organisations goes well beyond the US border. "

"We’ve reached peak bottled water. From today, for a sweet £80, Harrods will sell ‘luxury water’ harvested from icebergs off the coast of Svalbard. Svalbarði is the brainchild of Jamal Qureshi, a Norwegian-American Wall Street businessman who visited the archipelago in 2013, and returned with melted iceberg water as a gift for his wife. He then, it seems, decided to bring this water to more people. Astonishingly, the governor of Svalbard has approved Qureshi’s venture. He charters an icebreaker to make two expeditions a year, in the summer and the autumn when icebergs calve away from glaciers that run into the sea. One-tonne pieces of ice are carved from these floating bergs at a time. Using a crane and a net, they are lifted onto the boat and taken to Longyearbyen to be melted down into bottles of “polar iceberg water” which has has “the taste of snow in air”. On each expedition, Qureshi plans to harvest 15 tonnes of ice to produce 13,000 bottles.  The environmental sustainability of the venture is the first concern of many people, Qureshi told the Guardian. “But we’re carbon neutral certified, and we’re supporting renewable energy projects in East Africa and China,” he said. “We also only take icebergs that are already floating in the water and would usually melt in a few weeks, and that can’t be used for hunting [by polar bears].” Some may argue that if you can afford to drink melted ice caps, who should stop you? Your money, your choice. Depleting 30 tonnes of iceberg a year is, arguably, not that much in the grand scheme of things. But Qureshi’s venture is not the first of its kind. Tibet has already approved licences for dozens of companies to tap Himalayan glaciers for ‘premium’ bottled drinking water. Ten major rivers that flow into South Asia depend on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Disrupting their source could have devastating impacts for water security across the region. And this is not the only problem. First, sea ice is already melting. The extent of Arctic sea ice shrank to its second lowest record last year and scientists have warned this could have devastating impacts across the rest of the world, such as shifts in snow distribution that warm the ocean and change climate patterns as far as Asia, as well as the collapse of key Arctic fisheries, which could impact other ocean ecosystems. Icebergs don’t need yet more human interference – no matter how small the scale – to speed up the melting process. Second, the bottled water industry is already giving us enough of a headache. It is estimated that 3l of water are need to produce just one 1l plastic bottle of water, which is more likely to be discarded and end up in landfill than recycled. Beside the fact that our planet is slowly silting up with plastic, it also takes huge amounts of fossil fuels to make water bottles – plastic or glass – and transport them around the world. In the US, for example, 1.5 million barrels of oil are needed per year to meet the demand of the country’s water bottle manufacturing.  But surely the most problematic aspect of this product is the sheer insensitivity of exploiting one of the world’s last wildernesses, and charging such a high price for its product? This, while 663 million people currently live without safe water. Consider the extremes: one person pays £80 to drink water, never before touched by humans and preserved by micron filters and UV light, while another – one of 159 million – depends on surface water, vulnerable to contamination by faeces, parasites, pesticides and more. The emergence of luxury water is just another ugly indicator of our world’s many inequalities. For so many of the things we buy, there is a flashier, pricier, more luxurious alternative for those who can afford it. Why travel in economy if you could travel first class? Why buy from the high-street when you could buy designer clothing ? Water, it seems, is just the next in a list to receive this divisive treatment; why, if you live somewhere it is clean and safe, drink water from a tap when you could drink bottled water from “pristine peaks”, “artesian aquifers” and now “from the top of the world”? The wheels are in motion. Precedents have been set. Will more wealthy entrepreneurs now eye up other precious natural resources to create yet another “must-have” item? We already live beyond our means. Our lifestyle choices see us using the equivalent of 1.6 Earths to provide the resources we consume, and absorb what we throw away. At such a time, Svalbarði seems insensitive, ignorant and irresponsible. It’s time to live sustainably and consume responsibly, not promote mindless habits just because some people can afford it. For some time, water has been thought of as a commodity, and even the former UN special rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation believes it doesn’t have to be free. But something so precious, so essential to all life – human, animal and mineral – should never be marketed as a luxury.  Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

"Britain would be forced to abide by key EU environmental regulations by a pan-European court as part of any Brexit deal, according to a leaked document detailing the negotiating red lines being drawn up by the European parliament. Drafted by MEPs, the paper says the UK should not be allowed to damage the wider European environment after its withdrawal from the EU by unilaterally weakening its commitments to reducing pollution emissions and protecting wildlife.  In a sign of just how far the government’s threat to become a low-tax, low-regulation state has misfired, the document warns that the European parliament would vote down any Brexit deal unless the UK promised to maintain current environmental protection levels.  The prime minister must also put the UK under the rule of a court of arbitration, which would ensure the country kept to its commitments, it adds. The demands would tie the hands of Theresa May should she wish to cut back on regulations post-Brexit, and offers to embarrass the prime minister by putting the UK under the auspices of a European court. The government has put removal from the jurisdiction of the European court of justice at the heart of its vision of the UK outside the EU. The European parliament is drawing up a resolution that will detail what MEPs would find acceptable when any Brexit deal comes before them for consent in two years’ time.  On Tuesday lead MEPs on the environment committee are set to endorse its part of the resolution contained in the leaked document that is intended to shape the negotiations that take will place over the next two years between the European commission’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the British government, and to ensure the European parliament feels able to give its final consent to a deal. In the coming weeks, it will join input from other committees of the parliament. It is likely to form part of the chamber’s published and agreed resolution ahead of Brexit talks upon being signed off by the party political group leaders. The paper, which “calls on the UK to continue to respect its environmental and climate change commitments”, illustrates the anxiety among many in Brussels about May’s government. Britain is obliged to keep national emission of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and ammonia beneath an EU agreed ceiling.  The MEPs write that in the long term there needs to be a “mechanism” to ensure the EU’s environment is not damaged by Brexit, but that in the short term May should also be forced to accept the current regulations during a transitional phase. “Existing legislation which provides for commitments (financial, emissions reduction or of a political nature) cannot simply disappear on the day of Brexit and will require transitional measures,” they write. “[The parliament] expects the UK to implement the emission limits and other provisions decided under the NEC [national emissions ceiling] directive, as the rationale for setting national ceilings for such pollutants is based on their transboundary nature.” The concerns described in the document mirror those of many senior politicians and environmental experts in the UK. Last year Lord Krebs, chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, said it was “absolutely crucial” that “governments in the UK replace European legislation and don’t see this as an opportunity to say we can now have dirtier vehicles or less efficient household appliances”. The document also calls for a “swift” decision on where the European medicines agency, which employs 787 staff in London, will be relocated. The MEPs write: “The good functioning of the European medicines agency must not be compromised as a result of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, as this could affect the approval process for innovative and lifesaving drug.” Under the draft wording of the resolution, the European parliament would call for a “swift agreement over the relocation of the agency as well as transitional arrangement in order to limit the loss of skilled staff and their valuable expertise”. It adds that the parliament “stresses the need to consider the budgetary implications of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU on EU funds and programmes in the fields of environment, public health and food safety. “In this context, [the European parliament] considers that for funds and programmes for which the financial term extends beyond the foreseen date of UK departure from the EU, UK commitments until the end of the financial term should be maintained where possible.”"
"Bill Shorten has declined to be specific about the cost of Labor’s goal to have 50% of Australia’s electricity generated from renewable sources by 2030. In an early morning radio interview on Wednesday, Shorten was asked four times about the cost to consumers of executing such a transition, but the Labor leader deflected, pointing to the costs of not acting.  With the Coalition intent on making energy policy a point of sharp partisan difference, Malcolm Turnbull pounced on the interview, telling reporters in Canberra the Labor leader had admitted “he had no idea what his reckless renewable energy target would cost, or what its consequences would be.” “He confirmed precisely the criticism that we’ve made about Mr Shorten, that he is literally clueless on this subject, mindless, just like South Australia has been.” Labor’s 50% by 2030 policy is not a RET, it is an “aspiration”. Labor’s election policy says the 50% national goal would work in concert with state-based RET schemes, which the prime minister has blasted consistently since a storm plunged South Australia into a statewide blackout last year. During an interview with the ABC Shorten was pressed repeatedly about the practical consequences of the shift – the costs to consumers of executing such a significant transition in Australia’s energy mix. Shorten attempted to explain the broad rationale for increasing renewables in Australia’s energy mix, and he said Labor believed there was “a range of levers which assist, from having an emissions intensive scheme and the energy intensity scheme in the energy industry, having a market trading scheme and an emissions trading scheme [and] looking at the rate of land clearing.” Pressed again on the costs, Shorten declined any specifics, and said “there is a cost in not acting”. “Our answer is very, very straightforward. We think the cost of not acting is far greater.” “We don’t think we could sustain the cost as the Liberals are saying, of building new coal-fired power generation on the scale which Mr Turnbull is saying and we don’t think that, from insurance to drought to extreme weather events, that we can simply go business as usual.” Australian National University research associate Hugh Saddler in July 2015 estimated Labor’s policy would increase wholesale market prices by four cents per kWh above present levels in every state market except South Australia. By signing on to the Paris climate agreement, the Turnbull government has committed Australia to reducing emissions by 26-28% on 2005 levels by 2030. Meeting those targets will impose costs on consumers. The government has been advised by numerous experts that its Direct Action climate policy will not allow Australia to meet the Paris targets, and adopting an emissions intensity scheme, a form of carbon trading, would allow Australia to reduce emissions from energy at the least cost to households and businesses. The government has thus far rejected that advice."
"Global demand for oil will still be growing in 2035 even with an enormous growth in electric cars in the next two decades, with numbers on the road rising from 1m to 100m, BP has predicted. The oil and gas giant predicted that despite electric cars spreading rapidly and renewable energy recording exceptional growth, oil demand would still rise because of rising prosperity in the developing world. BP said electric cars would not be a “gamechanger” for the oil industry. “It’s not Teslas and the US. It’s the fact that 2 billion people, much of that in Asia, are moving to middle incomes, can buy their first motor car and that drives up oil demand. It’s that stuff that really matters,” said Spencer Dale, BP group’s chief economist.  Publishing its energy outlook, which forecasts long-term trends and informs the company’s internal strategy, BP predicted global energy demand would grow nearly a third by 2035. Fossil fuels would still account for 75% of the energy mix, slightly down on the 80% BP forecast last year. Oil demand was unlikely to peak until the mid-2040s, Dale said, in a prediction similar to that of the International Energy Agency but much later than some other observers think. The analysts Wood Mackenzie believe oil demand could “peak well before 2035”, while BP’s rival Shell has talked of a peak as soon as five years’ time. BP has been attacked in the past for repeatedly underestimating the growth of wind and solar power in its annual outlook. Its latest update expects renewables to be the fastest-growing fuel source in coming years, at 7.6% annually, compared with 1.6% for gas and 0.7% for oil, with China driving the largest growth in green energy. Greenpeace accused the company of peddling a “fantasy future where the world fails to act on climate change”. Greg Muttitt, senior adviser at campaign group Oil Change International, said: “Every year BP has predicted a slowdown in renewable energy growth, and every year it has been wrong – but it’s done so again today. And BP says electric cars are going nowhere in the next 20 years, a view not shared by the car industry.” Some forecasts, such as Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s, see more than 200m electric cars globally by 2035. BP’s base case foresees 100m electric cars by then, or 5% of the global car fleet. That’s up from 57m in the company’s outlook last year because of falling battery prices, although BP admitted there was a large uncertainty over the numbers. “BP’s 2017 outlook has increased its electric vehicle projections on last year, but this still lags far behind the potential penetration if the technology were to take off, meaning there is still a risk of the company misreading oil demand,” said James Leaton, head of research at the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a London-based thinktank. BP said the election of Donald Trump as US president and his domestic “America First” pro-fossil-fuel energy plan, published last week, was unlikely to have a big impact on efforts to tackle climate change. But a withdrawal from the Paris climate deal – as Trump has promised – would be more serious.  “My instinct would be in terms of climate, the actual implications of changes in US policy are unlikely to be a big gamechanger,” said Dale. “But what could be a big gamechanger is if the US stops playing its global leadership role, and by stopping it then has significant implications for the wider international community, and the wider commitment, that could have more impacts.” The energy company said the future held “an increasing abundance of oil”, claiming there is enough technically recoverable oil in the ground to meet the world’s entire demand twice over to the middle of the century. But it is not clear how much of that would be economically possible to extract, and the company does not disclose the oil price underpinning its forecasts. An Opec deal reached last year by the world’s largest oil producers to curb production has helped the oil price recover from $30 a barrel last year to about $55 today. Dale would not be drawn on what he thought the price would be in 2035 but said he did not think the current level was sustainable. “I look at what’s happening with investment, with those major oil-producing economies, that [today’s price] doesn’t look like a very sustainable number,” he said. The outlook predicted coal’s ongoing decline would see gas overtake it as the world’s second largest source of energy by 2035, with fracking for US shale driving much of the gas growth.  BP said improvements in energy efficiency and an increasingly lower carbon fuel mix would slow the growth in global carbon emissions, from the 2.1% annual growth of recent years to 0.6% in the next two decades. While describing that as “good news”, it admitted this still put the world on a path to dangerous global warming."
"Barnaby Joyce has refused to commit the government to maintain the Renewable Energy Target, after a report that conservative Coalition MPs want to ditch it if the United States pulls out of the Paris climate agreement. The deputy prime minister ruled out pulling out of the Paris agreement, but criticised “romantic” renewable targets set by states and said MPs were free to think and say what they like about the RET. Australia’s self-imposed target is to achieve 33,000 gigawatt hours of energy from renewable energy by 2020, a target of about 23%. The Abbott government cut the target from 41,000 gigawatt hours in 2015, but the principle of the RET still enjoyed bipartisan support. On Monday the Australian quoted several unnamed conservative MPs who want to ditch the RET, arguing it would help sharpen the Coalition’s attack on Labor’s plan to lift renewable energy to 50%. Tony Abbott and the South Australian senator Cory Bernardi have both publicly argued for the scrapping of renewable energy targets. On Monday Joyce was asked on ABC’s AM if he supported dumping the RET and Australia’s Paris greenhouse gas reduction targets, given the US may withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. “We have an agreement, we’ve signed [it] and we’re honouring that agreement. “We’re ahead of where we need to be ... We’re doing it in a vastly cheaper way than what the Labor party has proposed, with its carbon tax and emissions trading scheme.” Asked what Australia would do if the US withdrew, Joyce said it was a matter for the US. On the report his colleagues were speaking out against the RET, Joyce said: “People have the benefit of free will, they can think what they wish. And on the backbench they can say what they wish.” Asked if the government would retain the RET, Joyce said only “we don’t sign agreements to pull out of them”, in another apparent reference to the Paris agreement not the RET. Australia’s Paris commitment is to reduce emissions to 26-28% on 2005 levels by 2030, but does not specify how emissions reductions must be achieved. The RET is contained in federal legislation and is not mandated by the Paris agreement. Joyce said Australia’s needed commitments to be achievable and would “not put undue pressure on our power prices and deliver affordable electricity to the Australian household”. “That’s why we have an issue with states who go it alone on [renewable energy] targets that are way beyond the capacity for even them to provide, and South Australia is a classic example.” He said South Australia’s targets were “romantic” and as a result the state “couldn’t get the lights on”. Despite government claims Australia is on track to meet its Paris commitments, Australia’s emissions are rising and projected to keep doing so to 2030, meaning the country will fail to meet its 2030 targets. The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, told Triple M in Melbourne on Monday that Australian industry, such as the Alcoa aluminium smelter in Portland, needed open markets and affordable electricity. He said Labor and Bill Shorten were “enemies” of both those aims. “They are threats to both trade and ... affordable electricity with their utterly unrealistic renewable targets that they have no way of achieving in any affordable way.” The Liberal MP, Julian Leeser, told Sky News: “We’re committed today to the 23% renewable energy target – that is the energy target that we have.” But Leeser suggested the government’s position on the RET may change after the Finkel review of Australia’s energy mix. “I am for evidence based policy ... In the event evidence is presented that we should reduce that target, well then we should look at reducing or increasing the target as the case may be, but I support the 23% target.” Shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, told a press conference in Adelaide it was clear “a growing Trumpian faction within the Liberal Party is determined again to smash renewable energy in Australia”. He said Joyce’s interview amounted to a “resounding refusal” to endorse the RET that was settled less than two years ago. Butler said when Abbott planned to cut the RET in 2014 investment in renewable energy collapsed 88% and a government panel of experts said that abolishing the target would actually put upward pressure on prices."
"If you had “National Parks subtweet the new president” on your 2017 bingo card, today’s your lucky day.  After the US National Parks Service was temporarily banned for retweeting images comparing Trump and Obama’s inaugurations, the official Twitter account of the appropriately named Badlands National Park, based in South Dakota, appeared to go rogue by posting a series of now-deleted tweets on climate change.  The tweets were eventually deleted, and, while the official accounts may not be saying much right now, some “alternative” accounts have been set up. One, @BadHombreNPS tweeted: “Hey, friends. Here to support @BadlandsNPS with the science facts they can no longer share!” Hey, friends. Here to support @BadlandsNPS with the science facts they can no longer share! The most popular is @AltNatParkSer, which bills itself as the unofficial “resistance” team of the US National Parks Service. Can't wait for President Trump to call us FAKE NEWS. You can take our official twitter, but you'll never take our free time! One of its initial tweets read: “Mr Trump, you may have taken us down officially. But with scientific evidence & the Internet our message will get out.” The owner of the account has yet to respond to the Guardian’s request for comment, but told reporters:  Hi @JettGoldsmith This accnt being run by several active NPS rangers and friends. We promise 100 percent that we include environmental scientists and far too much coffee. #ResistTrump https://t.co/dV5DZjtmfh As of yet, it has not been verified whether the account is actually run by National Park employees. Eagle-eyed tweeters noticed the account had tweeted about the British general election in 2015.  @WingsScotland Oi, fellow plebian. What say you, honourable rev, on the elecshun result? A National Parks official told BuzzFeed the climate change tweets were posted by a “former employee” who was not authorised to use the account. They added: “The park was not told to remove the tweets but chose to do so when they realised that their account had been compromised.” This isn’t even the first time National Parks Twitter accounts have run afoul of the Trump administration. Over the weekend, they were temporarily told to halt tweeting after its main account retweeted pictures comparing the turnouts of Trump and Obama’s inaugurations. They later apologised for the “mistaken RTs”. We regret the mistaken RTs from our account yesterday and look forward to continuing to share the beauty and history of our parks with you pic.twitter.com/mctNNvlrmv"
"Falling costs of electric vehicles and solar panels could halt worldwide growth in demand for oil and coal by 2020, a new report has suggested.  A scenario that takes into account the latest cost reduction projections for the green technologies, and countries’ pledges to cut emissions, finds that solar power and electric vehicles are “gamechangers” that could leave fossil fuels stranded.   Polluting fuels could lose 10% of market share to solar power and clean cars within a decade, the report by the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London and the Carbon Tracker Initiative found.  A 10% loss of market share was enough to cause the collapse of the coal mining industry in the US, while Europe’s five major utilities lost €100bn (£85bn) between 2008 and 2013 because they did not prepare for an 8% increase in renewables, the report said.  Big energy companies are seriously underestimating the low-carbon transition by sticking to their “business as usual” scenarios which expect continued growth of fossil fuels, and could see their assets “stranded”, the study claims.  Emerging technology, such as printable solar photovoltaics which generate electricity, could bring down costs and boost take-up even more than currently predicted.  Luke Sussams, a senior researcher at Carbon Tracker, said: “Electric vehicles and solar power are gamechangers that the fossil fuel industry consistently underestimates.  “Further innovation could make our scenarios look conservative in five years’ time, in which case the demand misread by companies will have been amplified even more.”  James Leaton, head of research at Carbon Tracker, added: “There are a number of low-carbon technologies about to achieve critical mass decades before some companies expect.”  The cost of solar has fallen 85% in seven years, and the report finds panels could supply 23% of global power generation by 2040 and 29% by 2050, entirely phasing coal out and leaving natural gas with just a 1% share.  By 2035, electric vehicles could make up 35% of the road transport market, and two-thirds by 2050, when it could displace 25m barrels of oil per day.  Under such a scenario, coal and oil demand could peak in 2020, while the growth in gas demand could be curtailed.  It could also limit global temperature rises to between 2.4C and 2.7C above pre-industrial levels, while more ambitious action by countries than currently pledged, along with falling costs of solar and electric vehicles, could limit warming to 2.1C to 2.3C.  But the report shows that cutting carbon from the power sector and road transport may not be enough to achieve international climate targets, so emissions reductions from other sectors such as heating buildings and heavy industry will also be needed. "
"A plan for new coal power plants, which government ministers say could reduce emissions from coal-generated electricity by 27%, would cost more than $60bn, a new analysis has found.    Achieving the same reduction using only renewable energy would cost just half as much – between $24bn and $34bn – the report found. The resources minister, Matthew Canavan, and the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, have been arguing for new coal power plants to be built in Australia. Last week, Canavan released analysis he commissioned from the industry department, which found replacing all Australia’s coal power stations with the latest “ultra super-critical” coal-fired power stations would reduce emissions in that sector by 27%. Frydenberg has also raised the conclusions in interviews, and promoted the benefits of coal power. Neither has responded to questions about the cost of reducing coal-fired power emissions by 27% using the latest technology. So Dylan McConnell from the Climate and Energy College at the University of Melbourne crunched the numbers, and found that the 27% reduction in the coal sector could be achieved, but it would cost $62bn. McConnell said at a conservative estimate, achieving the reduction would require 20GW of new capacity. According to the latest estimates from the CSIRO, new ultra super-critical black coal costs $3,100 per kW to build. “No wonder no one wants to talk about the costs,” McConnell said. He said $62bn would be enough to build between 35GW and 39GW of wind and solar energy. Because that would produce less electricity than 20GW of coal power, it would not completely replace coal power, but it would reduce its emissions by up to 65%. And that would amount to an emissions reduction of between 50% and 60% in the electricity sector as a whole. McConnell found that if the 27% reduction in emissions from the coal generation sector were to be achieved with renewables, rather than with new coal, about 13-19GW of renewable energy would be needed, which would cost between $24bn and $34bn. He said the scenario proposed by Canavan and Frydenberg would end up with 20GW of highly polluting coal power stations that were unlikely to be retired for decades. On the other hand, McConnell said, if that money were spent on renewables, it would leave some coal and gas in place, which ultimately would still need to be removed to meet long-term emissions reduction targets. Neither Canavan nor Frydenberg responded to questions about the costs of building new coal power stations. In a statement, Frydenberg said only that the government was committed to a “technology neutral” approach to meeting emissions targets. “Arbitrarily excluding certain technologies for ideological reasons will lead to higher cost outcomes,” the statement said. The Opposition spokesman for climate change and energy, Mark Butler, said: “This analysis clearly shows the government is off on an economically and environmentally irresponsible frolic with their trumpeting of ‘clean coal’. “As the Australian Industry Group and many others have made clear, replacing our existing coal power with more coal power just doesn’t stack up; either on environmental or economic grounds. “This is just the latest effort of a weak government to appease its irrational extreme right wing and distract from the fact they’re simply incapable of delivering real policy solutions to our significant energy challenges,” Butler said. McConnell pointed out that the latest coal-powered fire stations were not at all “clean”. They produced about 700 grams of CO2 for every kilowatt hour of electricity – much more than the 400 grams from new combined cycle gas turbines, and much more than the average produced by OECD countries, 420 grams per kilowatt hour in 2014, according to the International Energy Agency. OECD countries will need to reduce that figure to just 15 grams per kilowatt hour if the world is to keep global temperature increases below 2C, the agency has said."
"Sweden’s deputy prime minister, Isabella Lövin, has published a photograph of herself signing a climate bill surrounded by her closest female colleagues, apparently mocking a photo of US president Donald Trump. Lövin, who also serves as environment and development aid minister, is seated in the photo at a desk as she signs the bill under the watchful eye of seven female colleagues, including one who is visibly pregnant.  Just signed referral of Swedish #climate law, binding all future governments to net zero emissions by 2045. For a safer and better future. pic.twitter.com/OqOO2y8BU6 The picture seems to be a reference to a series of photos of Donald Trump signing executive orders, including the reintroduction of the ‘global gag rule’, which were widely mocked.  The pictures were taken of Donald Trump on 23 January in the White House, as he signed a decree barring US federal funding for foreign NGOs that support abortion, as his all-male colleagues looked on. This group just made it more difficult for women to get access to health care worldwide. You tell me what's wrong with this picture. pic.twitter.com/8UQFWg8qO3 Sweden, a pioneer in women’s rights, is known for its high level of women in the workplace, including in parliament and government. “We are a feminist government, which shows in this photo. Ultimately it is up to the observer to interpret the photo,” Lövin said. The climate bill she is signing in the photo aims to make Sweden carbon neutral by 2045 and “marks a new era in Swedish climate politics,” Lövin wrote. “There is a global demand for climate leadership. I want to show that Sweden is ready to take that leadership,” she added. Sweden has criticised the Trump administration’s approach to climate policy as it announced legislation binding future governments to a goal of phasing out greenhouse gas emissions by 2045, among the most ambitious by any developed nation. Lövin urged European countries to take a leading role in tackling climate change, now “the US is not there anymore to lead”. Seven of eight political parties – all but the far-right Sweden Democrats – agreed to pass a binding law obliging future governments to set tougher goals to cut fossil fuel use every four years. The law will come into force from 1 January 2018. Sweden’s goal would demand at least an 85% cut in domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 from 1990 levels, the government said. Remaining emissions would be offset, for instance by planting forests that soak up carbon as they grow or by investments abroad.  The European Union as a whole has set a target of an 80-95% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. “2045 is a good year,” Lövin said of the target for reaching zero net emissions, adding: “I personally believe we could get there even earlier.” Among EU nations, she said, Britain, Denmark and Finland have also passed climate laws meant to make long-term policies less easily overturned and to give more certainty to investors.  By contrast, Trump has called climate change a hoax and wants to bolster the domestic coal and fossil fuel industries. He has threatened to pull out of a 2015 Paris agreement on climate change but also said he has an “open mind”.  Lövin said Sweden wanted to set an example at a time when “climate sceptics [are] really gaining power in the world again,” and felt encouraged by pledges by China and India to fulfil their commitments to the Paris Agreement. China is “investing billions and billions of dollars in solar … it’s a game changer,” she said, warning that “those that are still wanting to invest in fossil fuels will be ultimately the losers.”"
"The politicking around refugees following Donald Trump’s travel ban was given a human face on ABC’s returning Q&A program on Monday with personal and probing questions from two Syrian refugees. After two panellists expressed support for Trump’s move to limit migration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, audience member Omar Al Kassab told his story and asked why the panellists would want to ban him from resettling in their country. “During the Arab spring, when marching for freedom and democracy, I was shot and tortured by the Syrian regime, and forced to flee with family,” Al Kassab said. Why would someone ban people like us from being citizens of its country? @herandrews & @XiuhtezcatlM respond #QandA pic.twitter.com/JLxgnDiRPf “Australia has kindly given us a new life and after only two years of learning English, my brother has recently made the news when graduating as a dux of his school and currently studying to be a doctor. I am also halfway through my business degree. Why would someone ban people like us from being citizens of this country?” After measured responses from the federal energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, and the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, the journalist Daisy Cousens gave a blunt opinion. “The thing about immigration is that it has tended to be sentimentalised over the last little while,” she said. “That is fair enough. It is an uncomfortable issue.” .@DaisyCousens believes it is not a racist ban & troublemakers ruin it for everyone. She thinks resettling in the ME is cheaper #QandA pic.twitter.com/s0kOauzCKJ But she said people affected by the ban were linked to terrorism. “I knew a girl, a dancer, who lost her leg. She lost her leg because of these people,” she said. “That is not a racist thing … This is not to do with race or religion. This is to do with radical Islamic terror, which is the political ideology associated with Islam,” Cousens said. An audience member, Johanna Edmond, suggested the Australian government should be embarrassed, since it had painted asylum seekers as security threats for years but now needed to convince Trump the refugees on Manus Island and Nauru were not threats to the US. “Doesn’t it make you blush to now have to admit in arguing with Donald Trump that these people are, in fact, legitimately pursuing fleeing for their safety and have been properly cleared as not security threats?” Edmond asked. .@JoshFrydenberg: Are you embarrassed to argue to the US that our refugees are not security risks? @DanielAndrewsMP also responds #QandA pic.twitter.com/HpoBdzaIFi “Also, if they are safe to go to the US, which we believe they are, why can’t we bring them here?” Frydenberg said the refugees had not gone through the kind of vetting that would satisfy the US, and repeated the government’s position that unauthorised arrivals by boat would not be allowed to settle in Australia. Andrews responded by saying Victoria took more refugees than would be expected, based on its population size. The panel also moved through climate and energy issues. Frydenberg argued that Trump appeared to be “open minded” about renewable energy, to which host Tony Jones interjected: “Your own chief scientist Alan Finkel today compared Donald Trump to the Soviet dictator Stalin.” “He says that under the new president science is literally under attack. This is the same climate science this underpins Australia’s climate policy. Are you at all concerned ... about what the chief scientist is saying?” Frydenberg restated the government’s push for coal-fired power stations. “We have got our targets and what we are saying is we need to be technology-neutral,” he said. “For us, it is not just about reducing emissions, I have to say. First and foremost our priority is about energy security because we got a wake-up call,” he said, referring to the blackout in South Australia last year. Helen Andrews, a political analyst who was billed as a Trump supporter, used the opportunity to launch an attack on “climate alarmism” by drawing on a widely discredited article in the Daily Mail. “Based on the NOAA [US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] whistleblower that went public just this week, that revealed that the so-called ‘pause-buster’ paper under Obama was based on flawed data and flawed models, it sounds like they are the enemies of science and not Donald Trump.” Do you think the young people of Australia should be suing our government? @XiuhtezcatlM responds #QandA pic.twitter.com/bZazFvpR4B Also on the panel was the 16-year-old US climate activist Xiuhtezcatl Martinez. “If you look at Australia you could be 100% renewable energy, it is possible,” Martinez said. “We don’t have to drill for it or dig into the ground for dead plant and animal matter. That is not the future of energy. That is not the future of our country or the world that we should be passing onto future generations. Young people in the future deserve healthy, clean atmosphere where we can breathe the air and drink the water.”"
"A Washington state judge has sparked outrage for remarks questioning the existence of climate change and the role of humans in global warming. During the high-profile trial of Ken Ward, a climate activist facing 30 years in prison for shutting down an oil pipeline, Judge Michael E Rickert said: “I don’t know what everybody’s beliefs are on [climate change], but I know that there’s tremendous controversy over the fact whether it even exists. And even if people believe that it does or it doesn’t, the extent of what we’re doing to ourselves and our climate and our planet, there’s great controversy over that.”  The Skagit County judge made the comments on 24 January while addressing Ward’s request to present a “necessity defense” in court, meaning he would argue that the grave threat of climate change justified civil disobedience. Rickert’s controversial statements, along with his decision to block Ward from arguing that his pipeline protest was necessary to prevent harm to the planet, angered environmentalists who insist that American courts have an obligation to recognize the science and consensus among researchers about man-made climate change.  “I thought it was shocking and deeply worrisome for my case,” said Ward, 60, of Corbett, Oregon, who temporarily shut off the safety valve of the TransMountain pipeline in Skagit County. “We are in the late stages of global collapse, and to have someone who is presumably as knowledgeable and aware as a judge should be blithely dismissing the biggest problem facing the world is chilling.”  Ward, whose trial began on Monday, is part of a group of activists that targeted oil sands pipelines in Washington, Oregon, North Dakota, Montana and Minnesota on 11 October 2016. The coordinated #ShutItDown actions – which have led to a dozen criminal cases and threats of hefty prison sentences against activists and journalists – was aimed at stopping 15% of US crude oil imports for a day. In courtrooms across the US, the activists are pushing to argue that these disruptions are a last resort given political inaction and are “legally justified to avoid the catastrophic harm caused to humanity by unprecedented climatic disruption”.  The legal battles are building on a historic Washington state case last year in which a judge for the first time permitted US climate activists to argue that a criminal act of civil disobedience was committed out of necessity.  The activists known as the Delta Five, who blocked an oil train near Seattle, claimed that their actions were a moral imperative and relied on testimony from climate scientists to bolster their case. The protesters lost in court, though the judge praised them as “part of the solution to the problem of climate change”.  There have been some victories for the necessity defense in the UK and in Massachusetts where a prosecutor in 2014 dropped charges against Ward and another activist who blocked a coal shipment, stating that “climate change is one of the gravest crises our planet has ever faced”.  But Rickert, an elected judge in Skagit county, north of Seattle, sided with state prosecutors who argued against the necessity defense and have alleged that Ward, co-founder of Climate Disobedience Center, committed burglary, criminal trespass and sabotage. While explaining the standards for permitting a necessity defense, Rickert said: “It does need to have some immediacy, some imminence, more so than this particular threat and harm, which is climatic change, global warming, whatever.” He later added that with climate change, there’s “great controversy” with “over half of our political leaders”. (Critics have slammed the GOP as the “only major party in the advanced world” to deny climate change). Rickert also claimed that a single pipeline disruption would make no difference in any “disaster” in our environment, saying, “The actual harm to be avoided is not avoided at all. All that happens is a valve is turned.”  Leonard Higgins, a #ShutItDown activist who targeted a pipeline in Montana and sat in on Ward’s hearing, said he was stunned by Rickert’s explanation, especially since he has a reputation of being a progressive judge.  “My heart sunk,” said Higgins, who is facing felony charges for his demonstration. “I just did not expect him to say that climate science and climate change was still basically a matter for debate and that there was uncertainty about whether it was man-caused.”  By banning Ward from even bringing a necessity defense, the judge was prohibiting scientific evidence, Higgins added.  “This is a matter of fact that needs to be adjudicated by the jury. To be gagged before our jury that is considering whether he is deserving of prison for his crime is just wrong.” Lauren Regan, one of Ward’s attorneys, argued that activists are justified in pursuing more extreme tactics when decades of legal protests and political organizing have failed to spark meaningful policy on climate change. “They’re looking to see how can they be more effective in a faster timeframe,” she said. “It’s a symbolic act to draw attention to the fact that not only are these pipelines not invincible, but there is power within the people to stop these incredibly egregious pipelines.” Rickert did not respond to requests for comment.

"Climate change activists and film-makers who documented their anti-pipeline demonstrations are facing criminal charges and hefty prison sentences, with cases across the US that have raised concerns about press intimidation and the targeting of peaceful protesters. The slew of upcoming trials, beginning on Monday in Washington state, stem from a series of coordinated actions on 11 October 2016 aimed at shutting down oil sands pipelines. Nine criminal cases include several filed against film-makers and live-streamers who recorded protesters closing the emergency valves on pipelines but did not directly participate in the disruptions.   “These activists are responding to a climate emergency,” said Steve Liptay, a film-maker facing trespassing and aiding and abetting charges in Minnesota, where he documented protesters shutting down two Enbridge pipelines. “As media, we have to tell their stories.” The court cases – also in North Dakota, Minnesota and Montana – come at a time of increasing anxiety for journalists and activists surrounding the arrest and aggressive prosecution of reporters and protesters critical of US government and powerful corporations.  During protests of Donald Trump’s inauguration in Washington DC, at least six journalists and film-makers were charged with felony rioting offenses, which could result in 10 years in prison. One case was later dropped. Lawmakers in multiple states have also recently pursued new laws aimed at restricting protests and making it easier for police to target demonstrators. The October #ShutItDown protests were organized in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe’s fight against the Dakota Access pipeline. Those demonstrations have also led to serious criminal charges, including a case against radio host Amy Goodman, which a judge eventually rejected.  Two well-known documentary film-makers, who had faced decades in prison for filming the 11 October actions, have since had charges suspended or dismissed. But several activists who live-streamed and filmed the actions, including Liptay, are now preparing for trials alongside five demonstrators who were directly responsible for shutting down pipeline valves. Charges include mischief, criminal damage, trespassing and conspiracy.  “If they can’t document these stories, then there’s something very, very wrong with our idea of press freedom,” said Emily Johnston, a protester who is facing two felonies that carry 10-year sentences for targeting a Minnesota pipeline. “We have to stand up for that. It has to be absolute.” Sam Jessup, a Vermont activist who live-streamed an action at the TransCanada Keystone pipeline in North Dakota, is facing three felony charges, including two conspiracy allegations that could result in 20-year sentences.  “Live-streaming to Facebook is definitely free speech,” said Jessup, 31, who said he did not play any direct role in shutting the pipeline. “The state will try to intimidate people from standing up and doing what has to be done by throwing the most severe charges at them to try to silence others.”  Even when cases against journalists are ultimately dismissed, the initial charges can have a chilling effect. “It was disorienting to realize how helpless I really am as a law-abiding citizen and how much power the system and government agencies can have over me,” said Deia Schlosberg, an Emmy-winning film-maker who was originally facing 45 years in prison for filming the TransCanada Keystone action. The charges were eventually suspended and will be formally dropped later this year, but only if she commits no further crimes, according to Schlosberg. As a result, she said she has been unable to cover certain protests for fear that she could face serious consequences if she were arrested: “I feel like I can’t fully do my job.” Lindsey Grayzel, the other independent film-maker whose felony case in Washington was ultimately dismissed, said law enforcement still has not returned her memory cards with footage on them, her phone or her notes.  But the ordeal, she said, would not stop her from doing her job.  “It’s scary, but it makes me more determined than ever that we need to do our work and stand together to get these stories told,” Grayzel said. On Monday, Grayzel plans to film the start of the trial of Ken Ward, the 60-year-old subject of her documentary The Reluctant Radical, who is potentially facing 30 years behind bars for targeting the TransMountain pipeline in Skagit County, Washington, on 11 October.  Ward said the urgency of climate change and government’s failure to protect the environment demanded direct actions: “We’re witnessing the end of conditions that make civilization possible. This is the single most important thing facing the planet. We also happen to be living in a time where no political process allows us to do anything about it.” Richard Mollin, Clearwater County attorney in Minnesota, who is handling the cases of Liptay and Johnston, defended the charges, claiming that neither was likely to spend more than a year behind bars if convicted. “He may have been filming,” he said of Liptay, “[but] the fact that he was there and had trespassed on the property is the basis for which the charge was made.” Lauren Regan, executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center and Ward’s attorney, said it was clear that oil companies and government officials were trying to deter these kinds of protest actions. “It is not surprising that they are attempting to come down on these individuals with the full power of the state.”"
"When the news is bad, governments love distractions, and this week the Australian Open has been excellent for diverting voters’ attention from more examples of how badly this government is at governing.  To be fair to Nick Kyrgios and Novak Djokovic, it’s not all their doing. This government – like many others before – has purposefully used the summer holidays to avoid scrutiny.   We would do well to recall that one of the last acts of the government in 2016 was to release the March and June quarterly greenhouse gas emissions reports on the Thursday before Christmas.  The transparent desire to release the report at a time when most of the public were in holiday mode is all you need to know to realise how bad it is for the government.  The report showed that greenhouse gas emissions from electricity have continued to rise since the repeal of the carbon price. Emissions from electricity generation in the June quarter last year were 4.4% higher than in the June 2014 quarter – the last quarter under the carbon price.  It demonstrated that while the government’s Direct Action policy might be good at providing money to companies to do what they were already planning to do – or even not do what they were already planning not to do – it utterly fails at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Now that wouldn’t matter much, except of course 2016 was the hottest year on record and policy sops to climate change deniers such as is Direct Action are one of the main reasons why preventing temperatures rising by 2C above pre-industrial levels is now almost beyond our ability.  Unfortunately for the government it was not able to ensure the release of the Australian National Audit Office report into offshore processing centres just before Christmas. But given the tennis, cricket, Centrelink payments debacle, expenses scandals and ministerial reshuffle, the report’s release this week did get a bit lost. And the report does deserve notice.  The report slammed the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. It noted that the department’s “management of the garrison support and welfare services contracts at the offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea (Manus Island) has fallen well short of effective contract management practice”. “Well short” is the type of polite language the ANAO uses because saying “complete dumpster fire” comes across as rather less than formal. The report covers the period since 2012, and thus the previous Labor government does not come away unscathed.  For example, the report found that the department “did not update its asset register and advise Comcover of new facilities in Nauru valued at $75 million”. Thus, when the facility was burnt down in a riot in 2013 it was not insured.  Cripes.  But the report also provides absolutely no joy for the Abbott or Turnbull governments.  It concludes that of payments made between September 2012 and April 2016, “$1.1bn was approved by DIBP officers who did not have the required authorisation; and for the remaining $1.1bn there was no departmental record of who authorised the payments”. It comes off the back of another ANAO report released last September into the procurement of support and welfare services for offshore detention centres that found the tendering process was horribly flawed.  The ANAO found that in 2014, rather than use an open tender process, the department “determined to only enter into negotiations with its preferred tenderer, Transfield”. And this was done in a situation which the ANAO found “no available record of specific conflict of interest declarations having being made by departmental officers who were responsible for the procurement”. To top it all off, the ANAO concluded that “Transfield’s overall price increased by $1.1bn above its tender bid during negotiations due to the department amending its requirements and accepting further enhancements to services” despite the department having “no government authority to increase the value of the contract to cover service additions”.  And just to put a nice cherry on top, the latest ANAO report concludes of the whole tender process that these contract variation worth $1bn were made “without a documented assessment of value for money”. The report also suggests the department utterly dropped the ball on important aspects of the contracts. It found, for example, that with respect to the filming of detainees “the department could not make available any records to demonstrate that the privacy of individuals, including in relation to filming children without parental consent, had been considered”. Basically, when it comes to offshore detention, the tendering process was done shabbily with little care for value for money, or with the appropriate authority, and the oversight of it has been a disgrace in which “department did not develop an effective framework and strategies to manage the contracts and is not well placed to determine if the contract objectives have been fully met”. That is, the department really can’t even determine whether the money has been well spent.  Oh well, it’s only a couple billion dollars.  Aside from the human rights disaster that is the current asylum seeker policy, the abysmal way in which the policy has been carried out and the cavalier manner in which money has been spent is worth remembering the next time the government gets on its high horse about waste and mismanagement."

"Name: Badlands national park. Location: South Dakota, United States.  Appearance: Vast wild prairies, rich fossil beds and magnificently sculpted buttes. *Snigger*: Buttes are towers of rock formed by erosion. It’s pronounced bewt, actually. Sorry, of course it is. Badlands is managed by the National Park Service, which is part of the US Department of the Interior, the role of which, among other things, is to “move our nation toward a clean-energy economy” and “coordinate climate-change science and resource-management strategies”. I see. And now Americans have elected a president who says that’s all a secret Chinese plot that he has no proof of. Indeed. Needless to say he isn’t very popular at the NPS, whose Twitter account retweeted photos of the sparse turnout at his inauguration, and shared news of civil rights, climate change and healthcare pages disappearing from the White House website. I can’t help cheering, but civil servants shouldn’t publicly undermine their elected bosses, should they? No. And the NPS Twitter feed was shut down for a day while they all got a good talking to. But now Badlands has struck back! How come? On Tuesday, the Badlands National Park Twitter account began publishing blandly accurate information about climate change. For example: “Today, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years. #climate.” Does President Trump disagree with that? Hard to say. I expect he’d get bored and stop reading. No doubt. Anyway, the tweets were soon deleted. Censorship! Not necessarily. The National Parks Service said that they were the work of “a former employee” who wasn’t supposed to have access. “The park was not told to remove the tweets but chose to do so when they realised their account had been compromised,” they said. Is that true? Or has the new government already begun secretly burying inconvenient climate data? Well, we don’t have any evidence that the NPS is censoring things that Badlands would normally have said. The tweets were a bit out of character for Badlands, and another of its tweets about climate change since Trump took office still hasn’t been deleted. So … we don’t know what to believe? No. Get used to it. Do say: “Let’s kick butte!” Don’t say: “Dangerous manmade climate-change is/isn’t happening and requires/doesn’t require urgent action. [Delete according to mood]”"

"House Republicans have introduced a bill to rewrite the Clean Air Act. The bill, which has 114 co-sponsors (all Republicans), would revise the Clean Air Act such that: The term ‘air pollutant’ does not include carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride.  This change would kill the EPA regulation of carbon pollution that’s a key component of the Clean Power Plan. The history behind these regulations is an interesting story. During the George W. Bush Administration, Americans were becoming increasingly concerned about the threats posed by human-caused global warming, and by the Administration’s actions to censor and silence climate scientists instead of taking action to address the problem. So 12 states led by Massachusetts, in coordination with a number of cities, territories, and environmental and scientific groups, sued the Bush EPA. The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court in 2007. The key was that Massachusetts had to demonstrate it had legal standing to sue, which meant proving that the state was being directly harmed by climate change and EPA’s refusal to address it. The Massachusetts Attorney General made a smart argument. As a coastal state, Massachusetts is harmed by sea level rise encroaching on its valuable shoreline property. Sea level rise is indisputably caused by global warming via the melting of land ice and the expansion of warmer water. The Supreme Court ruled in their favor in a 5-4 decision split along partisan lines, with Anthony Kennedy casting the deciding vote on the side of science. Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Roberts dissented, basically arguing that the link between a lack of EPA carbon regulations and the state’s lost coastal property was too hypothetical, but they were outvoted. The Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had to determine if greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare. If they do, then under the Clean Air Act, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases qualify as “air pollutants” and must be regulated as such. The Bush EPA dragged its feet until his term ended, and soon after President Obama took office, the EPA issued its Endangerment Finding that, based on the best available science, greenhouse gases do pose a threat to the public via climate change. The 2007 Supreme Court Clean Air Act ruling and Endangerment Finding form the basis of the Clean Power Plan, a portion of which includes EPA regulation of carbon pollution from power plants. Generally speaking, Republicans hate government regulation, and the party is also in bed with the fossil fuel industry, so they’ve wanted to undercut the Clean Power Plan and Supreme Court decision ever since they were conceived. Now in control of all branches of government, they see their chance. Enter the “Stopping EPA Overreach Act of 2017.” As noted above, the bill would simply revise the Clean Air Act to state that greenhouse gases aren’t air pollutants. The bill states that nothing in the Clean Air Act any other law “authorizes or requires the regulation of climate change or global warming.” It notes that the EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions standards would be voided. Finally, the bill includes this dangerous provision: No regulation, rule, or policy described in subsection (a) shall take effect if the regulation, rule, or policy has a negative impact on employment in the United States unless the regulation, rule, or policy is approved by Congress and signed by the President. In other words, if the EPA were to determine that any sort of pollution was endangering or killing people, but the proposed regulation of that pollutant would result in the loss of a few jobs, EPA would not be allowed issue that regulation. Republicans in Congress – and any members who vote for this bill – are explicitly stating that employment is more important than human and environmental health. There’s a similar bill with 160 Republican co-sponsors: the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act. It says that any regulation with compliance costs over $100 million per year would require approval by both the House and Senate. If either failed to pass the regulation within 70 days, it would be null and void. Again, if a regulatory agency with expert staffers were to decide that a regulation were necessary to protect public health and safety, but politicians in Congress declined to vote in support of the regulation, it wouldn’t be implemented. So far the “Stopping EPA” bill has been assigned to four House committees, and at least three of those have no plans as of yet to take up the bill. Similarly, the REINS Act has been assigned to four House committees, but likely isn’t viewed as a high priority either. I spoke to David Doniger, senior attorney for NRDC’s climate and clean air program about these bills. He noted that neither stands much chance of breaking through a Senate filibuster. Not only would the proposals face near-universal opposition from Democrats, but some moderate Republican Senators might even vote against them. Were the “Stopping EPA” bill to make it through Congress and be signed by the President, there likely wouldn’t be any legal recourse, since it explicitly rewrites the Clean Air Act. However, Senate Democrats have the ability to block these bills, which likely explains why the House Committees don’t view them as a priority. It’s worth noting that of the 240 Republican members of the House of Representatives, 114 co-sponsored the “Stopping EPA” bill, and 160 co-sponsored the REINS Act. In short, half to two-thirds of House Republicans think that protecting public and environmental health and safety may not be worth 0.003% of US annual federal spending, or losing a few jobs, and that they – not scientific experts – should be the ones to make those decisions. It’s also important to note that as with Obamacare, Republicans are trying to repeal existing regulations without first agreeing on a replacement. They could certainly replace EPA climate regulations with a revenue-neutral carbon tax: a policy that many conservatives support. That would be a worthwhile effort. But simply repealing the only regulations America has in place to tackle the threat of human-caused climate change would be dangerous and irresponsible. The Republican Party needs to do much better than this."

"Oslo, Norway’s capital, like most of the Scandinavian country’s cities and towns, boasts bus-lane access for electric vehicles (EVs), recharging stations aplenty, privileged parking, and toll-free travel for electric cars. The initiative began in the 1990s as an effort to cut pollution, congestion, and noise in urban centres; now its primary rationale is combating climate change. Today, Norway has the highest per capita number of all-electric [battery only] cars in the world: more than 100,000 in a country of 5.2 million people. Last year, EVs constituted nearly 40% of the nation’s newly registered passenger cars. And the Norwegian experiment shows every sign of accelerating. Earlier this year, Norway opened the world’s largest fast-charging station, which can charge up to 28 vehicles in about half an hour. The country, joined by Europe’s No 2 in electromobility, the Netherlands, intends to phase out all fossil fuel-powered automobiles by 2025. Elon Musk, CEO of the US electric car company Tesla Motors, responded to Norway’s goal by tweeting: “What an amazingly awesome country. You guys rock!”  Norway is the clear electric vehicle pacesetter in Europe, which now has about 500,000 electric vehicles. China leads the world in EV usage, with about 600,000 all-electric vehicles on its roads and an ambitious plan to deploy 5m EVs by 2020. The US ranks third globally, with fewer than 500,000 EVs. But electric vehicle momentum is picking up in the US, as evidenced by the 400,000 people who have paid $1,000 to be on the waiting list for Tesla’s $35,000 Model 3 car.  The trailblazing achievements of the Norwegians and the Dutch are just one reason that many experts see 2017 as a crucial breakout year for electric mobility in Europe and beyond. Experts acknowledge that in the past the numbers have never quite lived up to the hype around EVs or other alternative transportation technologies. Indeed, in 2016 only 2m electric and hybrid passenger cars were on the road worldwide – about 0.2% of the global fleet; in Europe, significantly less than 1% of new car registrations are battery-electric vehicles (as opposed to hybrid cars). And key questions still loom, such as whether there will be sufficient renewable energy supplies to power vast new fleets of EVs. If electric vehicles are charged with fossil fuel-generated electricity, the result is more, not fewer, greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, because of rapid technological advances and strong government support for EVs in Europe and China, experts maintain that a new era in electromobility is dawning – and that this time there’s more to the prediction than industry optimism.  “We’re convinced that Europe and other continents, too, are now turning the corner on e-mobility,” says Lars Mönch of Germany’s Federal Environment Agency. “It’s the aim of all big cities worldwide to ambitiously tackle the climate and urban congestion issues that they all face.” Referring to the provisions of the Paris agreement on climate change, in which nations pledged emissions cuts aimed at holding temperature increases below 2C, Mönch added, “There are goals now for the transportation sector that can only be met with alternative forms of mobility.”  Norway illustrates that with incentives that eliminate the price advantage of conventional gas-burning vehicles, many people will go for the electric option. “It works, absolutely,” says Martin Norman of Greenpeace Norway, who has driven an EV since 2004. “It’s clearly feasible, especially in urban areas. We’ve found that the range of EVs is enough for most of what people need.” And since 98 % of Norway’s electricity comes from hydropower, the country’s burgeoning EV fleet leaves almost no carbon footprint. Many European experts and industry representatives see the Norwegian model – minus the whopping subsidies – as a sign of where European electromobility is heading. Magdalena Jozwicka of the European Environment Agency, a Copenhagen-based EU body, says the EU looks to non-EU member Norway for inspiration. Even though it’s highly subsidised, e-mobility in Norway has caught fire on account of its own virtues, she says, noting its contribution to air quality, its quiet, and the many perks that e-cars enjoy. “People aren’t just using them as hobby cars for city shopping anymore,” she says. “They’re switching to full e-mobility because it’s possible now.” Thanks to its lucrative offshore oil and natural gas business, Norway can afford to promote e-mobility with generous incentives, including the considerable bonus of exemption from a 25% sales tax. Norway’s access to abundant and cheap zero-emission hydroelectric power means it can even offer e-car owners free power charging at public charging stations. Elsewhere in Europe, the main driver for EV growth isn’t subsidies but legislation, explains Wolfgang Bernhart of the international consulting firm Roland Berger, referring to the EU’s mandatory emissions-reduction targets for new cars. By 2021, the average emissions of all new cars sold must be 40% less than what the average car on the road emits today – an extremely ambitious goal that can only be met by the rapid, large-scale adoption of electric vehicles.  “Every city in the EU is working toward this,” he says, noting that fine particulate pollution is also an issue in European metropolises. “A certain share of electric mobility of one type or another is really the only solution.”  In Europe, transportation is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions. And while Europe’s industrial emissions have fallen by 38% since 1990, those in the transportation sector – including aviation – have increased by 9%. The 2015 Paris climate accord and follow-up agreements stipulate that every signatory country propose national goals for climate protection, including – explicitly for the first time – for the transportation sector. Moreover, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that greenhouse gas emissions from transportation will “increase by 120% from 2000 to 2050 as a result of a projected three-fold increase” in the number of cars worldwide. Some industry and advocacy groups have set a global deployment target of 100m electric cars and 400m electric motorcycles and scooters by 2030.  The upbeat assessments about e-mobility’s future are grounded in recent developments, including rapid advances in EV technology and China’s new-found commitment to decarbonisation. Moreover, 2016 saw a surge in EV sales globally — 30% more than in 2015 — and an expansion of charging infrastructure, both trends that will carry into 2017 and probably beyond. Europe’s most popular EVs were three all-electric plug-ins — the BMW i3, Renault Zoe, and Nissan Leaf, as well as Mitsubishi’s plug-in hybrid, Outlander.  Falling prices for EVs and recent technological developments— several of them led by Tesla — have changed the game. For one, the cost of lithium-ion batteries, which account for about 40% of an EV or hybrid vehicle’s cost, has fallen by two-thirds since 2010 — much faster than experts had anticipated and with further steep reductions expected in the near future. Six years ago, the average EV battery sold for more than $1,000 per kilowatt-hour; now it goes for less than $350. It could drop to as low as $125 in the near future, industry experts say. What’s more, as battery technology develops — in particular the improving “energy density” of lithium-ion batteries, enabling them to store more power with less weight — the range of EVs is rising dramatically from the under 100-miles-per-charge of the first generation of e-cars. The BMW i3 lasts for 114 miles without a recharge, and the newest Renault Zoe claims to push the 200-mile mark. Yet none of the competitors matches Tesla’s leading models with ranges of more than 215 miles. The battery’s steady efficiency evolution, which is expected to continue at about 5% a year, implies that the plug-in all-electric is no longer just a second car for city errands.  This drop in battery price is reflected in the lower price tags on the newest models. The latest Chevy Bolt sells for around $37,500, and the price tag of the BMWi3 is about $38,500.  A second generation of EVs is in production now and they are considerably lighter, longer-range automobiles than those launched five years ago. With the shock of Tesla’s unexpected advances, European car manufacturers have invested heavily in the forthcoming EVs, convinced that they either do so or lose out in the long run. “We’re now flipping the switch,” said Daimler’s CEO Dieter Zetsche last year. “We’re ready for the launch of an electric product offensive that will cover all vehicle segments, from the compact to the luxury class.” European car makers have also lobbied forcefully for governments to provide bigger rebates and tax incentives in different forms to stimulate the domestic markets.  However, even a range exceeding 200 miles doesn’t alleviate the necessity for periodically recharging. The frequency of – and distance between– charging facilities has long been, and remains, one of the key sticking points that make potential buyers hesitate. Charging infrastructure in Europe has grown since 2013 at a rate of 30% to 60% a year. The continent now has more than 100,000 charging spots, all but a few thousand of them “slow chargers”, which take as long as eight hours to juice up a battery.  Significantly reducing charging times is essential to the widespread adoption of EVs, and Europe has recently added 1,300 DC “fast chargers” to the network, namely stations that repower EVs in little more time that it takes to fill up with gas. But, unless you’re in Scandinavia, it’s still difficult to travel long distances in Europe with an all-electric plug-in vehicle. “This is why the hybrid plug-in is going to be important for the next five years or so,” says Bernhart of Roland Berger consulting, noting that it adds an entire tank of gas to the plug-in’s range.  The EU appears newly determined to get behind the push for more charging points by stipulating that as of 2019, every newly built or refurbished house from Cyprus to Lapland will have to have an EV charging station. By 2023, 10% of all buildings’ parking spaces must have EV chargers. Europe’s automakers now recognise their own interest in finally outfitting the continent with the chargers that their electric fleets require. As a group, BMW, Daimler, Ford, and Volkswagen intend to install thousands of EV fast chargers along European autobahns.  Finally, China’s sudden and muscular emergence in the world of electromobility has internationalised momentum for EVs. No country sold more EVs than China in 2015 – 34% of global plug-in sales. Carmakers in the US and Europe consider China as their most important market for manufacturing and sales. General Motors, for example, last year found buyers in China for 35% of its global production of electric vehicles through GM China and its joint ventures with Chinese companies. This, apparently, is just a taste of what the industry believes will come. But as the EEA’s Jozwicka notes, EVs “are only as clean as their source of power. The e-mobility revolution has to go hand-in-hand with a transition to clean energy or it doesn’t make any sense.”   "
"Europe’s Atlantic-facing countries will suffer heavier rainfalls, greater flood risk, more severe storm damage and an increase in “multiple climatic hazards”, according to the most comprehensive study of Europe’s vulnerability to climate change yet. Temperatures in mountain ranges such as the Alps and the Pyrenees are predicted to soar to glacier-melting levels, while the Mediterranean faces a “drastic” increase in heat extremes, droughts, crop failure and forest fires.  Europe and the entire northern hemisphere are warming at a quicker pace than elsewhere, to the extent that tropical diseases such as West Nile fever are expected to spread across northern France by mid-century. Hans-Martin Füssel, one of the lead authors of the European Environment Agency report, said that scientific evidence was pointing increasingly to a speeding up in the pace of climate change. “We have more data confirming that sea-level rise is accelerating,” he said. “It is not a linear trend, largely due to increased disintegration of ice sheets. There is also new evidence that heavy precipitation has increased in Europe. That is what is causing the floods. The [climate] projections are coming true.” Earlier this month, Nasa, Noaa and the Met Office confirmed that 2016 had broken the record for the hottest year ever previously held by 2015, which had itself broken the record that had been held by 2014. The new EEA report finds that land temperatures in Europe in the last decade were 1.5C warmer than the pre-industrial age, although near-surface temperatures – measured at a metre above ground level – were only 0.83C-0.89C warmer. Hans Bruyninckx, the director of the EEA, which produced the report said that there was now “not a snowball’s chance in hell” of limiting global warming to 2C without the full involvement of the US, which has just elected a climate-sceptic president. “Empirical evidence is the basis of the climate debate,” Bruyninckx said. “There are still people around who say the earth is flat or was created in seven days but if you don’t accept the logic of empirical reasoning it becomes a very difficult discussion.” The peer-reviewed EEA study was compiled by 60 contributing authors and institutions, including the EU’s Joint Research Centre. The report, which contains new observations and projections, looked at a wide range of indicators including agriculture, health, transport and biodiversity. Over the course of this century, the study expects average global sea levels to rise between 1.5-2 metres, potentially threatening low-lying areas including south Florida, Bangladesh and Shanghai.  The paper is intended to spur Europe’s sluggish moves towards adaptation strategies for dealing with the impacts of climate change, ahead of an EU review later this year.  Frogs, birds, butterflies and insects are already advancing their life cycles as springs arrive earlier, but local extinctions of some species are being reported. “Species are adpating but not as fast as the climate is changing and this may cause disturbances in the equilibrium of ecosystems,” Bruyninckx said. Butterflies and birds were already migrating northwards to the poles, he added. This trend is only like to deepen as heat extremes in central Europe grow stronger, while the boreal forests of Scandinavia experience less snow, river ice, and an increasing risk of winter storms and pest infestations. On the positive side, the region’s hydropower and summer tourism potential are likely to increase, even as a reverse trend occurs in the Mediterranean. Europe’s thermal growing season is now 10 days longer than in 1992, with delays to the end of the season more dramatic than the advance of its start. In countries such as Spain, warmer conditions are expected to shift crop cultivation to the winter. In the Arctic, one of the most rapidly warming parts of the planet, many habitats for flora and fauna such as sea ice, tundra and permafrost peat lands have already been lost. Oxygen-depleted ocean “dead zones” caused by agricultural fertilisers – particularly in the Baltic Sea – and ocean acidification fed by an influx of freshwater from melting continental ice will pose further threats to marine ecosystems, and the indigenous peoples who depend on them. While retreating sea ice will open up the potential for greater resource exploitation, the report’s authors warn that “utilising Arctic oil and natural gas resources would challenge the transition to a low-carbon society, as it is recommended that two-thirds of known global fossil resources remain in the ground if the 2C warming limit of the UNFCCC [UN framework convention on climate change] is to be met.”"
"We know the climate is changing, the Earth is warming, and humans are the cause. As a scientist who studies this daily, I know the evidence is compelling and mutually reinforcing. In fact, the evidence is so compelling that it’s almost impossible to find scientists who disagree.  We also know that it’s possible to solve this problem using today’s technology. We don’t need to wait for fairy dust or cold fusion. Using energy more wisely, increasing renewable energy, modernizing nuclear power, and other actions are all things we can do right now to make the future better.   But we also know that there are many groups and companies that are trying to stop meaningful action on climate change. Sure, many are fossil fuel companies that want to continue to sell their product. Others are ideological groups and people that for various reasons reject the compelling science. They cannot bring themselves to understand the facts because it conflicts with their belief system. These groups and people spread misinformation and purposely try to muddy the waters by creating a “fake news” environment of sorts. For the rest of us who are interested in making this world better but not experts on climate change, it’s a real challenge to separate the science from the baloney. Not only do you have to know the science, but you may have to communicate it in a very concise situation. We scientists are trained to bloviate, not to persuade. Fortunately, there is help. For anyone who wants easy to access, short elevator-speech responses to the most common questions and myths about climate change, a new resource is available. Interestingly, it was authored not by a climate scientist but by a citizen scientist. I’ve read the text and can vouch for its scientific accuracy. The book is entitled Twenty-eight Climate Change Elevator Pitches written by Rob Honeycutt - a contributor to Skeptical Science. This book covers topics typically in 2-3 pages. Really short, really concise, always on point. Rob uses analogies to help describe climate science in ways that the rest of us can relate. He includes both basic science chapters as well as myth debunking. For instance, he relates geological climate change to a boxing match The basic science topics he covers include titles such as “Ancient Sunlight”, “Radiative Gases”, and “The Climate System”. He also includes 2-3 page discussions on temperature measurements, ocean warming and sea level rise, acidification, ice, past climate change, tipping points, and more. Included with each chapter are rich and engaging graphics. Why do I like this book so much? Well, part of it is that the discussions are short and punchy. They really are elevator speeches. They don’t get bogged down in too much detail. Crucially, his science is correct. Rob finds a way to identify what are the essential things people need to know and focuses on those items.  I also like that this book is simultaneously a warning but also optimistic. He is correct that climate change is a serious problem that we need to face. But, he is also right on in recognizing that there are solutions to this problem that can be implemented immediately. Furthermore, as Rob writes, ignoring the problem will be more injurious than facing it head on. I asked Rob why he decided to write this book and he responded: After finding and taking an online climate change quiz, I noted that the average score for those taking the quiz was only 54%. People who were self-selecting to take the quiz – people who were interested in the topic – were missing basic climate information. I figured what was needed was a way to access basic, accurate climate information in a more time-efficient manner. The book is available on the iBooks store and through Blurb."
"For the first time, researchers have developed a mathematical equation to describe the impact of human activity on the earth, finding people are causing the climate to change 170 times faster than natural forces. The equation was developed in conjunction with Professor Will Steffen, a climate change expert and researcher at the Australian National University, and was published in the journal The Anthropocene Review.   The authors of the paper wrote that for the past 4.5bn years astronomical and geophysical factors have been the dominating influences on the Earth system. The Earth system is defined by the researchers as the biosphere, including interactions and feedbacks with the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and upper lithosphere. But over the past six decades human forces “have driven exceptionally rapid rates of change in the Earth system,” the authors wrote, giving rise to a period known as the Anthropocene.  “Human activities now rival the great forces of nature in driving changes to the Earth system,” the paper said. Steffen and his co-researcher, Owen Gaffney, from the Stockholm Resilience Centre, came up with an “Anthropocene Equation” to determine the impact of this period of intense human activity on the earth. Explaining the equation in New Scientist, Gaffney said they developed it “by homing in on the rate of change of Earth’s life support system: the atmosphere, oceans, forests and wetlands, waterways and ice sheets and fabulous diversity of life”. “For four billion years the rate of change of the Earth system has been a complex function of astronomical and geophysical forces plus internal dynamics: Earth’s orbit around the sun, gravitational interactions with other planets, the sun’s heat output, colliding continents, volcanoes and evolution, among others,” he wrote. “In the equation, astronomical and geophysical forces tend to zero because of their slow nature or rarity, as do internal dynamics, for now. All these forces still exert pressure, but currently on orders of magnitude less than human impact.” According to Steffen these forces have driven a rate of change of 0.01 degrees Celsius per century.  Greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans over the past 45 years, on the other hand, “have increased the rate of temperature rise to 1.7 degrees Celsius per century, dwarfing the natural background rate,” he said. This represented a change to the climate that was 170 times faster than natural forces. “We are not saying the astronomical forces of our solar system or geological processes have disappeared, but in terms of their impact in such a short period of time they are now negligible compared with our own influence,” Steffen said. “Crystallising this evidence in the form of a simple equation gives the current situation a clarity that the wealth of data often dilutes. “What we do is give a very specific number to show how humans are affecting the earth over a short timeframe. It shows that while other forces operate over millions of years, we as humans are having an impact at the same strength as the many of these other forces, but in the timeframe of just a couple of centuries.  “The human magnitude of climate change looks more like a meteorite strike than a gradual change.” Gaffney and Steffen wrote that while the Earth system had proven resilient, achieving millions of years of relative stability due to the complex interactions between the Earth’s core and the biosphere, human societies would be unlikely to fare so well. Failure to reduce anthropological climate change could “trigger societal collapse”, their research concluded."
"Alpine ski resorts are facing the loss of up to 70% of their snow cover by the end of the century, experts have said. Even in the best-case scenarios, global warming is likely to see snowfall replaced by rain across the Alps, according to a report in the European Geosciences Union (EGU) journal the Cryosphere.   It says mathematical climate models predict that “bare alpine slopes could be a much more common sight in future”. “Since many alpine villages are heavily dependent on winter tourism, the economy and society of regions with such tourism centres will suffer,” Sebastian Schlögl, one of the report’s authors wrote.  Last year the Swiss Alps had their driest December since records began 150 years ago. 2016 was the third year in a row with little snow at Christmas, when many families go skiing. If global warming is limited to 2C, the target set in the Paris climate change agreement, the loss of snow cover in the Alps would be 30% by 2100, the report said. Were the temperature to rise above this target, the snow cover would dwindle by 70%, it added. The research was carried out by scientists at the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) and the Cryos Laboratory at the École Polytechnique Fédérale in Switzerland. It also suggests that the season when natural snow is deep enough for winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding is likely to become shorter. In a report entitled How much can we save? Impact of different emission scenarios on future snow cover in the Alps, the lead author Christoph Marty, SLF’s research scientist, writes: “The alpine snow cover will recede anyway, but our future emissions control by how much. “The majority of the climate models used project slightly increasing winter precipitation towards the end of the century. However, since temperatures are clearly increasing simultaneously, we may experience increasing rainfall and not snowfall.” Marty added: “We hope our results convincingly show that even increasing winter precipitation cannot compensate for the effect of the strongly increasing temperatures.” The team’s projections show that the layer of snow covering the Alps would lose depth “for all elevations, time periods and emission scenarios”. The report says: “The most affected elevation zone for climate change is located below 1,200m, where the simulations show almost no continuous snow cover towards the end of the century.”  About a quarter of the ski resorts in the Alps are below this altitude."
"Ladybird books will this week publish a new title on climate change. Co-authored by the Prince of Wales, the polar scientist Emily Shuckburgh and myself, the book is intended as a plain English guide to the subject for an adult readership. Short, peer-reviewed text sits alongside beautiful new paintings by Ruth Palmer to illustrate the basic briefing.  It has already been greeted in some quarters as another controversial intervention by our future king. But while it’s easy to fall behind that line of thinking, it is an increasingly mistaken one. For despite the impression created in some quarters, the truth is that climate change is not controversial. The basic facts are established and increasingly embedded in policy.  We know, for instance, that the global average temperature has during recent decades gone up. This is largely because of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the concentration of which is rising because of human activity. In turn, the altered composition of the atmosphere is leading to changes that range from more extreme weather to reduced ice and snow cover and from unusual seasonal patterns to rising sea levels. All that is now established fact derived from careful observation and analysis. These broad findings are increasingly reflected in policy choices and the business strategies of major companies. While there are those in elected office in some countries who take a non-scientific view, and some vested commercial interests that resist low carbon policies, there is less political division than is sometimes suggested. For example in 2015, nearly every country on Earth (most of them some sort of democracy) signed up to the Paris climate change agreement. That legally binding treaty was not entered into lightly and revealed a level of political consensus visible on very few other issues. In the UK, and despite several major media organisations continuing to pour doubt and confusion into the public discourse, we have a strong political foundation for action, as laid out in the form of the 2008 Climate Change Act, for example. I launched the campaign for that act when I was the director at Friends of the Earth and one reason why it was possible to gain cross-party political backing for such a law was the work of Britain’s world-leading scientific institutions, including the Met Office and the British Antarctic Survey. Through supplying policy-makers with the findings of their research, they helped to shape understanding to the point where official foundations for action were laid. With the science clear and the politics (in this country) quite robust, it is predictable that those with perspectives on climate change founded more on ideology than data will go for the messenger rather than the message. The Prince of Wales should keep “his mouth shut” was, for example, the recommendation of the Daily Mail in the wake of an article penned by the heir to the throne to mark the publication of his new book. While the Mail and some other papers evidently won’t agree with his views on this subject, they might wish to reflect for a moment on the role of our monarchy. In the absence of a written constitution, perhaps the closest we’ve got to an accepted view on what it is for and where its right lie comes from the Victorian essayist and long-serving editor of the Economist, Walter Bagehot. He wrote in 1867 in the English constitution that the monarchy has “the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn”. I can think of few issues where exercising those rights fits the bill more closely than in relation to the ever less controversial matter of climate change."
"Australia’s chief scientist has slammed Donald Trump’s attempt to censor environmental data, saying the US president’s behaviour was comparable to the manipulation of science by the Soviet Union.  Speaking at a scientific roundtable in Canberra on Monday, Alan Finkel warned science was “literally under attack” in the United States and urged his colleagues to keep giving “frank and fearless” advice despite the political opposition.  “The Trump administration has mandated that scientific data published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency from last week going forward has to undergo review by political appointees before that data can be published on the EPA website or elsewhere,” he said. “It defies logic. It will almost certainly cause long-term harm. It’s reminiscent of the censorship exerted by political officers in the old Soviet Union. “Every military commander there had a political officer second-guessing his decisions.” Last month Trump’s administration mandated that any studies or data from scientists at the EPA undergo review by political appointees before they can be released to the public. The communications director for Trump’s transition team at the EPA, Doug Ericksen, said the review also extended to content on the federal agency’s website, including details of scientific evidence showing the Earth’s climate was warming and human-induced carbon emissions were to blame. Finkel compared the Trump administration’s attempt to censor science to the behaviour of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.  “Soviet agricultural science was held back for decades because of the ideology of Trofim Lysenko, who was a proponent of Lamarckism,” he said. “Stalin loved Lysenko’s conflation of science and Soviet philosophy and used his limitless power to ensure that Lysenko’s unscientific ideas prevailed. “Lysenko believed that successive generations of crops could be improved by exposing them to the right environment, and so too could successive generations of soviet citizens be improved by exposing them to the right ideology. “So while Western scientists embraced evolution and genetics, Russian scientists who thought the same were sent to the gulag. Western crops flourished. Russian crops failed. “Today, the catch-cry of scientists must be frank and fearless advice, no matter the opinion of political commissars stationed at the US EPA,” he said. A day after the EPA was told to limit its public communications, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, added a layer of confusion to reports that the Trump administration had directed the communications crackdown. “That’s nothing that’s coming from the White House,” he told the press during his daily briefing. “They haven’t been directed by us to do anything.” But his comments were at odds with statements made by Ericksen, who said the Trump administration was scrutinising studies or data published by scientists at the EPA, and new work was under a “temporary hold” before it could be released.  Finkel was appointed chief scientist by Malcolm Turnbull, replacing former chief scientist Prof Ian Chubb in December."
"Australian scientists have launched a project to bury tens of thousands of teabags in wetlands around the world. They are hoping others will sacrifice a few cups of tea and join in to discover how efficient different wetlands are at capturing and storing carbon dioxide. Lipton green tea and red tea “rooibos” varieties will be used in the project, which already involves more than 500 scientists in every continent except Antarctica.  Leader of the project, Peter Macreadie from Deakin University’s Blue Carbon Lab, said wetlands were important for carbon capture and storage, a process known as carbon sequestration, holding up to 50 times as much carbon by area as rainforests. “But some wetlands are much better at carbon storage than others, and some are in fact carbon emitters, so they’re not all fantastic,” Macreadie said. “We need to find out the best wetland environments for carbon sequestration so we know where we should invest our energy.”  That’s where scientists have come up against barriers in the past. There are hundreds of thousands of wetlands around the world. A standardised technique for monitoring the carbon is needed for accurate comparison, and monitoring devices can cost thousands of dollars to install. But Macreadie had been reading scientific research about teabags being buried and used to measure the rate at which carbon was being released from soil into the atmosphere.  Fast decay of the tea inside the bag meant more carbon was being released into the atmosphere, while slower decay meant the soil was holding the carbon.  “I thought, ‘Jeez this is a bloody good idea. Why aren’t we using it in wetlands?’” Macreadie said. “People think of innovation as involving fancy new technology, but sometimes the best ideas are the most simple ones.” Lipton teabags are being used because they are already favoured by international researchers studying terrestrial carbon sequestration. They also have a fairly standard rate of decay in wetlands and the required tea varieties are sold around the world. Lipton are giving the researchers 50,000 teabags. Macreadie and his team this week began burying the bags at Gardiners Creek wetlands and Western Port Bay in Victoria. The project coordinator, Stacey Trevathan-Tackett, said the green tea aroma and the slight hint of spice in the rooibos masked the smell of the mud as she embedded the bags in the swamp. She inserts a shovel into the ground at about 10cm depth and creates a wedge to drop the teabags into. The teabags are numbered and labelled, and a GPS point is taken down.  Between 40 to 80 teabags are buried per site. “We’re using the green tea and red tea because they’re made of different components, with green tea degrading more quickly and so we expect it not to last as long, while the red tea is made of tougher components and will break down more slowly,” she said. “If we have these two teas out there in the same environment we can examine how they degrade comparatively to each other and also in comparison to other environments.” The bags will be monitored over a three-year period and will be dug up and measured at intervals of three months, six months and each year after that. Once researchers can establish which wetlands are most effective at carbon sequestration, work can begin on protecting those types of wetlands, restoring them and ensuring they are not disrupted, Macraedie said. Destruction of wetlands could see thousands of years worth of ancient carbon released into the atmosphere in just a few months. “Wetlands to many people are the armpits of our environment,” he said. “A lot of people don’t like these environments of mangroves and seagrasses, and we’ve drained them for aesthetic and agricultural reasons, we’ve built roads, airports and football ovals on top of them, and we’ve removed tens of thousands of them without knowing their importance.” Those who contact the Blue Carbon Lab wanting to participate and who have a wetland near them will be sent a kit containing teabags and information on how to bury them. Currently the researchers leading the project are doing the work without funding – aside from the cost of the teabags being covered by Lipton. They hope as their work goes global more funding will be forthcoming. “We also hope that by encouraging professional and citizen scientists to contact us and spread word about this project, other people will begin to understand the importance of wetlands to biodiversity, in carbon sequestration, and in mopping up pollution,” Macreadie said. The executive director of the Global Carbon Project and scientist with the CSIRO, Pep Canadell, described the initiative as “a great idea”. “Wetlands are extremely threatened around the world, so anything we can do to highlight their benefits to society will certainly give us more ammunition to convince agencies, and government and non-governmental groups to put resources towards their conservation,” he said.

"Bangladesh is already one of the most climate vulnerable nations in the world, and global warming will bring more floods, stronger cyclones. At the dry fish yards, close to the airport at the coastal town of Cox’s Bazar, women are busy sorting fish to dry in the sun. They say the process, which begins in October, can continue through to February or March if the weather is good. But Aman Ullah Shawdagor, a dry fish businessman who employs 70 people, says high tides and seasonal changes have hit his business hard. Last year there were four cyclones, more than ever before. In 2015, there was only one.  “My business is not doing so well because of the changing weather conditions,” says Shawdagor. “This is a dry season business. But for the last couple of years, the rain has become more frequent. It rains not only in the rainy season but also in the winter. There have also been more signals [storm warnings] with the rise in high tides. When the high tide comes, it frequently covers the whole of the land here. It is very bad for the dry fish.”  Nurul Hashem, a schoolteacher from Kutubdia Para, a nearby shanty town where many of the dry fish workers live, has also noted the trend. “We believe the water level is getting higher here,” he says. “Last year, my home was under water three or four times.” Scientists predict that, by 2050, as many as 25 million people in Bangladesh will be affected by the rising sea level. Hashem and Shawdagor believe that they are already seeing the effects of a changing climate, however.  Along the coast lies Kutubdia, an island in the Bay of Bengal where lush green rice fields give way to acres and acres of flat fields. Consisting of small rectangles of varying hues of brown, they are salt fields. The encroachment of saline water from rising tides has made rice farming impossible. Abdus Shukur, 50, a former agricultural farmer, says he learned to farm salt 10 years ago, when sea water flooded the land he rents. It took him six months to learn the craft and he finds it back-breaking work.  “I was an agricultural farmer before,” says Shukur. “But the embankment broke down and saline water came on to the land. We had no choice but to adapt.” Salt farming, he says, brings in more money that crops. But it is harder. “Farming crops, I worked two or four hours a day. I’m now earning double what I earned before. But in the salt fields I have to work from morning till evening, the whole day.” The small island, which has halved in size over the past 20 years due to erosion and sea level rise, is surrounded by a three-metre high concrete embankment, built by the Bangladeshi government to protect it from disappearing into the sea. But it is broken in several places and the sea water enters the land. “The coastal belt is facing many problems of salinity,” says Mokbul Ahmed, a project co-ordinator for Coast, an organisation that helps local communities affected by the changing climate. “Day by day, salt water enters the land. In Kutubdia, every year, the government builds the embankment and every year, it is destroyed.”  "
"The environmental movement is “the greatest threat to freedom and prosperity in the modern world”, according to an adviser to the US president Donald Trump’s administration. Myron Ebell, who has denied the dangers of climate change for many years and led Trump’s transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) until the president’s recent inauguration, also said he fully expected Trump to keep his promise to withdraw the US from the global agreement to fight global warming.  Ebell said US voters had rejected what he dubbed the “expertariat” and said there was no doubt that Trump thinks that climate change is not a crisis and does not require urgent action.  Trump has already replaced the climate change page on the White House website with a fossil-fuel-based energy policy, resurrected two controversial oil pipelines and attempted to gag the EPA, the Agriculture Department and the National Parks Service. Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax” and “bullshit”, has packed his administration with climate-change deniers but appeared to soften his stance after his election win, saying there is “some connectivity” between human activity and climate change. However, he also claimed action to cut carbon emissions was making US companies uncompetitive. Ebell, who has returned to his role at the anti-regulation thinktank the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said on Monday: “The environmental movement is, in my view, the greatest threat to freedom and prosperity in the modern world.” The CEI does not disclose its funders but has in the past received money from the oil giant ExxonMobil. “Our special interest is, I would say, freedom,” Ebell said. During the US presidential campaign, Trump pledged to withdraw from the climate change deal agreed by 196 nations in Paris in 2015, making the US the only country considering doing so. “I expect President Trump to be very assiduous in keeping his promises,” Ebell said. Trump’s pick for secretary of state, the former ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson, appeared to contradict the president about leaving the climate agreement at his confirmation hearing, saying the US should keep “its seat at the table”. “Who is going to win that debate? I don’t know but the president was elected and Tillerson was appointed by the president, so would guess the president will be the odds-on favourite,” said Ebell. “The people who elected him don’t want a seat at the table.” “The people of America have rejected the expertariat, and I think with good reason because I think the expertariat have been wrong about one thing after another, including climate policy,” he said. “The expert class, it seems to me, is full of arrogance or hubris.” “I don’t think there is any doubt that [Trump] thinks that global warming is not a crisis and does not require drastic and immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,” he said. The deal agreed by the world’s nations in Paris aims to hold the global temperature rise to well below 2C, a target that requires dramatic cuts in carbon emissions. Without this, the world’s climate experts concluded there will be “severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts” on people and the natural world. Ebell, speaking in London, claimed that the motivation for climate action was protecting a special interest: “The climate-industrial complex is a gigantic special interest that involves everyone from the producers of higher priced energy to the academics that benefit from advancement in their careers and larger government grants.” The IMF has calculated that fossil fuels receive $10m every minute in subsidies, while the fossil fuel industry spends at least $100m a year on lobbying. China’s president, Xi Jinping, recently reaffirmed his nation’s commitment to tackling climate change and said the nation’s green investments were already “paying off”. China pledged earlier in January to invest $360bn in renewable energy by 2020.  In an echo of Trump’s claim that climate change was a hoax invented by China, Ebell said: “China is making big investments in producing more solar panels and windmills, which they sell to gullible consumers in the western world, so that power and electricity prices will become higher and the Chinese economy will become more competitive.” Many experts say that the best way to “make America great again” would be to invest in the fast expanding, trillion-dollar market for clean technologies and that failing to tackle climate change will destroy economic growth.  Sam Hall of Bright Blue, a liberal conservative thinktank in the UK, said: “Despite the attempt by fringe elements to import ‘alternative facts’ from the US, mainstream conservatives in the UK support tackling climate change cost-effectively. Only last week, Theresa May’s Conservative government set out how she wants Britain to take advantage of the economic opportunities of new low carbon industries, such as battery storage and electric vehicles.” Scott Pruitt, Donald Trump’s pick to lead the US EPA, is a climate change sceptic and has sued the agency he is now set to lead 14 times over the EPA’s smog, mercury and other pollution regulations. His confirmation vote in the Senate is expected on Wednesday."
"It’s been a bad couple of weeks for the world’s climate and environment. The inauguration of billionaire property developer and reality TV star Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States has presaged a new Dark Age of climate politics.  In an opening fortnight of controversial executive orders, President Trump has decreed the expansion of major fossil fuel developments including the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, and the neutering of long-standing environmental protections. In addition, he and his leadership team have made it plain they intend to dismantle many of the Obama administration’s climate initiatives and withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. All this runs in direct counterpoint to the rapid decarbonisation required to avoid dangerous climate change.  For Australian fossil fuel interests, President Trump’s war on climate appears particularly opportune. Just last week, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his senior ministers floated the idea of government backing for new coal-fired power stations as part of the government’s response to Australia’s “energy security” and expressed reticence over the country’s Renewable Energy Target.  For a country that has nurtured world-leading innovations in solar photovoltaic and other renewable energy technologies and that is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change – be it in the form of record heat, devastating floods, more widespread drought, coastal inundation from sea level rise combined with stronger tropical storms, or the demise of the Great Barrier Reef – doubling down on the traditional fossil fuel energy path is particularly short-sighted. Of course this hostility to climate action and the decarbonisation of our economies is not new. The attacks on climate action by the Trump presidency and the Turnbull government’s embrace of the discourse of “clean coal” reflect the toxic, partisan political war that has engulfed US and Australian climate policy over several decades. Sound policy has been held hostage by the same vested interests of a large and powerful fossil fuel sector and a traditional vision that jobs and economic growth can only come from the “extractivism” that has defined 19th and 20th century economics. Indeed, since the widespread scientific acknowledgement of human-caused climate change in the late 1980s and early 90s, we have witnessed the development of a highly sophisticated and influential climate change denial industry. Consisting of major fossil fuel corporations, industry groups, lobbyists, “free-enterprise” think-tanks and conservative politicians, this counter-movement has proven remarkably successful in delaying the political actions necessary to curtail greenhouse gas emissions.  Like big tobacco before them, fossil fuel advocates have attacked mainstream climate science to confuse the public and policymakers about the reality and threat of human-caused climate change. As a result, we have seen a full-scale assault on a century and half of established science. For many climate scientists this has involved attacks from conservative politicians and rightwing lobby groups, orchestrated campaigns of harassment via mainstream and social media, challenges to job security and careers, and in some cases, death threats. Indeed, as recounted in The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars, one of us (Michael Mann) has been subject to all of those things. Beyond destroying our politics and corroding public trust in science, climate change denial also threatens the future of a habitable planet and a viable global economy. As a growing body of research has revealed, the maintenance of a “fossil fuels forever” mentality has real implications for the future of global food production, biodiversity, social functioning and geopolitical security. Leading economies around the world have recognised that the decarbonisation of energy and transport systems are key to the future prosperity of human civilisation.  The dramatic fall in the cost of renewable energies and commitment to large-scale investment in solar and wind energy highlight a pathway away from coal, oil and gas. But government leadership is badly needed to take the threat of climate change seriously and ramp up the scale of economic transformation on a par with the political and economic mobilisation we have applied to other existential threats in the past. The good news is that there is still time to prevent the worst climate changes from occurring. The Paris climate agreement was a step forward in that the nations of the world committed to reductions that get us half way from where we would otherwise be headed (more than 5C warming of the planet relative to pre-industrial temperatures by the end of the century) and to where we need to be (stabilisation of warming below 2C or so). The Paris agreement moved us on to a pathway where, with additional ratcheting up of commitments, we can limit warming below truly dangerous levels. That doesn’t mean it will be easy, but there is still a path forward. In the US and Australia, we must shift away from a culture of politically motivated climate change denialism to an acceptance of the truly existential threat now facing humanity. We are in grave need of courageous political leadership and a rejection of vested interests engaged in bad faith efforts to delay the needed transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy. To do otherwise, ensures an increasingly grim future for our children, humanity and the planet."
"If you’re a lobbyist or an industry advocate, then you know you’re winning when you hear your own talking points coming back at you through the mouths of ministers.  Better still, if it’s the Australian prime minister.   During his address to the National Press Club this week, Malcolm Turnbull told Australia it needed more efficient coal plants, and that this would deliver “cheap”, reliable power that could help Australia meet its international climate change targets laid down at the UN climate talks in Paris. Joining Turnbull this week in touting for coal have been his environment and energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, and treasurer, Scott Morrison. A second talking point is that coal can help lift poor countries out of poverty – another argument willingly adopted by Australian government ministers, including Turnbull. Who can forget Tony “coal is good for humanity” Abbott?  There is a stream of analysis that says building new coal plants, even the most expensive and slightly less dirty versions, are incompatible with targets to keep global warming below dangerous levels. They’d also likely be much more expensive than renewables. That’s for another day. But how did the coal industry do it? Where did these two talking points come from and how did they make their way into ministerial speeches and presentations by prime ministers? One possibility is incessant lobbying to a willing administration that’s happy to meet a coal industry executive at the drop of a hat. The coal industry has been playing a long game on these two talking points and we can trace them back to a 2010 World Energy Congress conference in Montreal.  Greg Boyce, then the boss of US coal giant Peabody Energy, gave a speech where he laid out the coal industry’s future.  Amid video images of African children in developing countries, Boyce dismissed climate change, said coal could help the poor and that more efficient coal plants and “clean coal” could help reduce emissions. These are the exact same arguments being made by Australian ministers today. The man who developed that plan of attack within Peabody Energy was its vice-president for government relations, Fred Palmer. In the years that followed, Peabody would develop and roll out its Advanced Energy for Life campaign, based on these talking points. One of its stated target audiences was Australia. Palmer is also a grandfather of fossil fuel-funded attacks on climate science.  He told me in an interview that while he was the boss at Western Fuels Association, a group representing coal haulers and power plants, he was a key member of one of the very first fossil fuel-funded projects to publicly undermine the credibility of climate science. He still thinks there is no evidence linking fossil fuel emissions to dangerous climate change. He thinks coal is part of a “divine plan” by God to help people live longer and says adding CO2 to the atmosphere will be a good thing.  Back in late 2014, the Australian pime minister at the time, Tony Abbott, was defending the coal industry to world leaders during the G20 summit in Brisbane.  A month earlier, Palmer was in Australia holding meetings in Canberra with government personnel, including the then industry minister, Ian Macfarlane (Palmer is now a senior fellow at climate science denial group the Heartland Institute and Macfarlane heads the Queensland Resources Council).  Palmer tells me:  Greg Boyce took all of these concepts that had been developed, and I was the one that developed them in the 90s at Western Fuel. I didn’t have international exposure but I talked in terms of universal access to energy and talked about everyone on Earth having the right to live as well as we do and talked about more people living longer, living better.  Peabody made a major push surrounding that. That was the genesis of what was being said in Australia in 2014. That’s where Tony Abbott and Ian McFarlane and the conservative party in Australia – that’s where it all came from. There is no question that’s where it came from. We were proud of the fact that it had penetrated such an important government and this was all designed for [the 2015 climate talks in] Paris. That was such an important part of this process and everything we did was designed for Paris when it became apparent that Paris was going to be a seminal event.” Palmer describes Abbott, who he has met personally, as a “precursor” to Trump in the context of climate change and energy policy. “When Tony Abbott came in, he came in running against the carbon tax. When Donald Trump came in, he came in running against the Clean Power plan. That’s the parallel I am talking about.” So was it difficult to get a meeting with the government?  “No it was not. I was thrilled to have that meeting and reception that I got,” says Palmer. “I had zero problems. If they had time, they talked to us.” Buried away in documents previously released under freedom of information rules, there is more evidence of just how easy it is for a foreign-owned coal company to get a meeting with senior government personnel.  On 2 February 2015, a lobbyist, Bernie Delaney, emailed the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Sam Gerovich, at the time the country’s ambassador to Apec, asking for a meeting with the ambassador “and relevant colleagues” the following week.  Two Peabody personnel would be in tow. Peabody wanted to “discuss US moves to have the OECD enact a policy guidance document which restricts funding for coal-fired power generation projects”. Ten minutes later, Gerovich emailed back with a slot on the requested date. The following day, Delaney emailed another Dfat ambassador, Brendon Hammer, asking for a meeting on behalf of Peabody. Hammer replied with a suggested meeting time.  “Always happy to see you and Peabody. Hope the new year has begun well for you,” wrote Hammer. Later that year the Australian government announced it was pleased with the new arrangements from those OECD meetings that would ensure coal was not locked out of government funding. Also in early 2015, there are emails between peak coal industry group the Minerals Council of Australia and Gerovich, where the MCA supplies Dfat with a “concept paper” touting the benefits of more efficient coal plants in the context of international climate talks. With easy and regular access like this, is anybody surprised at how fluent government ministers are with talking points and policy positions on coal that come straight from the industry itself?  Certainly, Fred Palmer isn’t.  “It would be shocking to me if Australia turned its back on those resources for something that’s as elusive as what the world might be like 100 years from now based on computer models based on CO2 in a hotly debated area,” he says. Like many climate science deniers and fossil fuel advocates around the world, Palmer is emboldened by the election of Trump and thinks he will be “spectacularly successful”. He says: “We are going down the path of his America first energy plan. There is nothing in there about renewables and there’s nothing in there about carbon taxes. It’s fossil fuel-centric and it is meant to be. It’s a fossil-fuel future for the United States.” “I guarantee you the world is going to follow.” The big question is, can the fossil fuel industry push back against the tsunami of growth and investment globally in the renewables industry?  As long as you don’t deny reality, then there’s an awful lot riding on that question."
"Living in New York and Washington, Greg Wortham heard all the grand talk about green energy from liberal politicians. Then he returned to the place where he grew up, a small town that embraced wind power so warmly that within a couple of years of the first turbine turning, it had some of the biggest farms on the planet. Yet Wortham is not from California, Oregon or New England, but a deeply conservative sector of Texas on the edge of the Permian Basin, one of the most bountiful oil and gas patches in the world. The welcome sign that greets motorists as they arrive in Sweetwater along Interstate 20, a three-hour drive west of Dallas, is not in the shape of an oil derrick or pumpjack, though: it’s a wind turbine blade bearing the town’s motto, “Life is sweet in Texas”. For ranchers facing ruin until major international companies planted forests of 300ft-tall turbines among their crops and cattle, the wind boom has provided regular income that has allowed them to maintain their land and keep it in the family. For Texas, this most Republican-dominated, oil-rich and fracking-friendly of states has found itself with the improbable status of being a national leader in this growing form of renewable energy. Texas has 11,592 turbines and an installed wind capacity of 20,321 megawatts, according to the American Wind Energy Association: three times as much capacity as the next state, Iowa. (California is third.) For the 12-month period ending in October last year, wind provided 12.68% of Texas’s electricity production – equivalent to powering 5.7 million homes. Four of the eleven largest wind farms in the world are in the region around Sweetwater, a friendly, part-historic, part-decrepit town of about 11,000 people that is home to so many serpents that every spring it holds a gory rattlesnake roundup. The county’s tax base has soared from roughly $400m in 2000 to about $3bn today, as a result of a dramatic investment in wind that began in earnest under the governorships of two stalwart Republicans, George W Bush and Rick Perry. Texas is just one of the Republican-leaning states that dominate wind energy in the US – the top three producers by percentage of state electricity supply are Iowa, South Dakota and Kansas. Like Texas, these states all voted for Donald Trump, who has made clear his dislike of clean energy such as solar and wind. “To begin with, the whole push for renewable energy is being driven by the wrong motivation, the mistaken belief that global climate change is being caused by carbon emissions,” the president wrote in his 2015 book Crippled America. “ If you don’t buy that – and I don’t – then what we have is really just an expensive way of making the tree-huggers feel good about themselves.” At a campaign rally in August, Trump added that wind energy “kills all your birds. All your birds, killed. You know, the environmentalists never talk about that”. But while the president and many Republicans in Congress have been disdainful of renewable energy and dismissive of climate change, support for wind in conservative areas has been quietly noted. In 2015, Congress extended a tax credit for wind production until 2020. With many rural communities feeling the benefits of wind energy, it’s unlikely that Trump would find much backing if he attempted to pull away this support. “New York City’s one of those regions that wants to be green but doesn’t want to see green,” meaning they want the benefits of green energy without having to look at unattractive wind turbines or solar panels, Wortham said. He was sipping water at a table in a lumber yard turned country music bar in a speck on the map called Roscoe, where big acts can attract crowds greater than the population of 1,300. Dust danced in through the open door; outside, goods trains barrelled past every few minutes, horns blaring, and a stiff breeze ruffled a couple of flags on a pole outside. In the middle distance, blades swooshed clockwise in a thicket of white wind turbines, as trucks arrived to disgorge their loads at the 24-hour cotton gin. Roscoe was formerly home to the world’s largest wind farm. It was beautifully, promisingly, sunny: the locals are eying solar panels as the next big thing. “You don’t want to see power lines, wind turbines and solar panels,” Wortham said. But in west Texas, already scarred by oil and gas activity, the new infrastructure was mostly welcomed for its potential to help desperate farmers at the mercy of droughts and floods, and the boom-and-bust cycles of the oil industry. And create jobs: according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, wind turbine technician is by far the nation’s fastest-growing occupation. “It has vast space and people who own the land see the value of using the land,” said Carsten Westergaard, a professor at the National Wind Institute at Texas Tech University. Wind came at the right time and fit the mentality of folks that wanted green but in our mind we’re not a green region The Sweetwater region has an average wind speed of over 23mph, space, access to infrastructure and an experienced energy workforce, and is close enough to major population centres to make transmission of the electricity economically viable. One negative: the area is at its windiest at night, when electricity demand is lower. In south Texas, though, the wind blows strongly in the afternoon, around the time when demand peaks. Wind power is set to flourish along the Gulf Coast – though since it is more densely populated, with more tourists and wildlife, objections have been stronger along aesthetic, conservation and quality-of-life grounds. After leasing their land to an energy company with the means to build a wind farm – an average one might cost $350-500m for 125 turbines – a rancher in Sweetwater can expect to receive about $10,000 per turbine per year; potentially twice that figure for a newer, more powerful machine. “The margin of profitability per acre before the wind turbines was minimal – minimal,” said Johnny Ussery, a 61-year-old rancher whose family traditionally farmed wheat, cattle and cotton. “I’ve talked to many people about it and I truly believe the only way to hang on to the land was to be able to make it profitable.” Wind is where oil and gas was in Texas in 1914, 1920. No laws have really yet been created … it’s just the wild frontier Carl Childers, a Roscoe rancher, property developer and retired teacher, has family roots going back more than a hundred years. He has six turbines in his cotton fields and said he has just signed a contract for a battery storage facility on his property. “It was a marriage of love eventually,” he said. “This is a little bit of a guaranteed bonus to help pay the taxes and necessary things.” Wortham’s eclectic career has encompassed public relations for the now-defunct Houston Oilers American football team and a stint as mayor of Sweetwater. Now he helps energy clients develop business plans. “Wind came at exactly the right time and it fit the mentality of a lot of the folks that wanted green but in our own mind we’re not a green region,” he said. “A lot of people were environmentalists or they wouldn’t have held land, been stewards of land for a hundred years in the family. So they all cared but they didn’t know how to activate that.” But in a corrosively partisan political climate, the benefits of clean energy have to be framed carefully. As Perry’s national ambitions grew – he was a Republican presidential hopeful for the 2012 and 2016 elections - he seemed less and less keen to trumpet Texas’s results in a policy area more associated with Democrats. “You don’t stand up around here and say, ‘yee haw, I’m green!’” said Wortham. “If you’re for environmental you talk about energy security, national security, good business. What we all know and can sort of secret handshake to each other, the ‘we save the earth’ kind of stuff – we can’t say that out loud because it defeats the whole thing.” The state spent about $7bn on transmission projects under an initiative known as CREZ. Another key factor in the growth of Texas’ wind industry is that this most independent-minded of states, unlike any other of the lower 48, has its own electric grid, minimising federal influence. “Texas is still the wild west of wind, sort of like the old prospecting days,” said Rod Wetsel, a Sweetwater attorney whose great-great grandparents settled in the town in the 1880s. “You can come out here, stick your stake in the ground, go get the leases from the land owners, you have no permitting – there’s no regulatory agency that controls wind, other than the public utility commission, which really just controls the grid system.” Wetsel is a trim 64-year-old who wears a bow tie and a wristband with the slogan “go green”. His office’s shelves are adorned with high school football memorabilia and a silver model turbine. Ornate saddles stand on each side of his desk, though his usual mode of transport is his BMW. He advised a local rancher on one of the earliest wind deals, in 1999, and reinvented himself as a wind specialist as demand soared. Now he also teaches wind law at the University of Texas in Austin, where several green energy companies are headquartered. “Wind is where oil and gas was in Texas in about 1914, 1920. No laws have really yet been created, there’s no regulation, there’s no governmental agencies, it’s just the wild frontier,” Wetsel said. “All of a sudden, Sweetwater’s the wind capital of the world.” Louis Brooks and his family hold in excess of 18,000 acres – an area larger than Manhattan. The son of a world champion rodeo cowboy, Brooks steered his pick-up truck across his gently undulating land one day last week, sporting a “California Chrome” cap – the name of the now-retired, Kentucky Derby-winning racehorse in which he owns a small stake. To make ends meet, he has tried cattle, wheat, even a horse insurance business. He was a late convert to turbines; 78 of them now dot his property. “I’m not a big person for change. I’m kind of old-fashioned in a lot of ways,” he said. “I don’t say I love them but I like them a lot. It’s just been a godsend. We’ve been able to take better care of our country.” Cattle grazed on a mesa a couple of hundred metres away as the wind picked up, creating a soft whistle amid the thrum, thrum, thrum of the rotating blades. “I never thought that wind would pay more than oil,” he said. “That noise they make – it’s kind of like a cash register.”"
"Fears that Donald Trump’s presidency will suppress climate science at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are causing widespread unease, with a spokesman for the administration admitting staff are experiencing “tension and stress” over the transition.  According to the Associated Press, Trump’s team has placed a “temporary hold” on the release of work by EPA scientists, pending review by political appointees. The report sparked outrage among climate activists and some scientists who claimed climate science was in danger of being distorted by the new administration. The administration was also reportedly poised to remove all mentions of climate change from the EPA website, only to back away from the idea. The White House website has already had all of its climate sections excised.  Doug Ericksen, communications director for Trump’s EPA transition team, told the Guardian no decisions had yet been made and a “misunderstanding” had occurred with the media. “We are refreshing the existing webpage,” he said. “Any time there’s a change in administration you will see a refresh and a review and that’s all we are doing. Next week or the week after the website will look different. But the EPA will stay focused on fact-based science. “We have employees speaking to the media creating a false impression of what’s occurring, causing a lot of tension and stress for staff at the EPA as well as the states and regions. That’s unfortunate.” Ericksen would not comment on whether climate content could be removed in the future, merely restating that a review was under way. The EPA, which regulates clean air and water, displays on its site in-depth information on the basics of climate science, actions the agency is taking to reduce emissions and data showing US emissions over the years. The Trump administration has removed an EPA webpage entitled “Climate change facts: answers to common questions” but has not taken down any other climate-related content. Staff have been told not to speak to the media and the main EPA Twitter account has not posted anything since last Thursday, the day before Trump’s inauguration. EPA employees have privately expressed concerns over their jobs and censorship of their work, although the Guardian could not confirm claims that political vetting of science was now official doctrine.  “They don’t know what they are doing yet,” said one administation staffer, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “They keep going back on themselves.” Uncertainty over the EPA’s prospects, and Trump’s well-known disdain for mainstream climate science, has set off a “series of alarm bells” within the agency, said Christine McEntee, executive director of the American Geophysical Union. “We’ve seen a pattern starting from the campaign, when … Trump questioned whether climate change is real or a hoax and then there was the letter sent to the Department of Energy asking for details on climate scientists,” she said. “There is a fear in the entire US science community and, frankly, internationally too. People fear retribution over their work. There’s a feeling that climate scientists are being targeted. Scientists are also hearing that budget cuts will be quite severe.” McEntee said she would like to see a “strong statement from the administration” that it upholds scientific integrity policies drawn up under Barack Obama. EPA policy states that scientists should be able to freely communicate their research without political distortion. EPA grants were also frozen by the new administation but Ericksen said that $3.8bn in grants was released by late Wednesday, with no holdup of funds for projects such as the effort to restore clean water to Flint, Michigan."
"Donald Trump will work towards the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency – and any employees cleaving to the Obama era should be “very worried” by the prospect of Scott Pruitt taking over the agency, a key aide of the president has told the Guardian. In an exclusive interview, Myron Ebell – who headed up Trump’s EPA transition team, said that agency’s environmental research, reports and data would not be removed from its website, but climate education material might be changed or “withdrawn”.  Ebell also signalled that a review of fuel efficiency standards for cars, rushed through by the departing Obama administration, is likely to be reopened despite its contribution to the US’s pledged emissions cuts in the Paris agreement. A campaign stump pledge by Trump to scrap the EPA in its entirety was “an aspirational goal” that would be best achieved by incremental demolition rather than an executive order, according to Ebell. “To abolish an agency requires not only thought but time because you have to decide what to do with certain functions that Congress has assigned to that agency,” he said. “President Trump said during the campaign that he would like to abolish the EPA or ‘leave a little bit’. It is a goal he has and sometimes it takes a long time to achieve goals. You can’t abolish the EPA by waving a magic wand.” The EPA was created in 1970 to protect human health and the environment, but Trump favours devolving much of its work and responsibilities to US states. Ebell has previously said that two-thirds of the agency’s 15,000 engineers, scientists and researchers could be axed but not that Trump’s campaign pledge of revoking the agency itself was still an objective. Half of the EPA’s $8.2bn (£6.47bn) budget is currently passed on to the states and it was “quite possible” that Trump would initially propose a 10% cut in federal EPA funding, Ebell said. While he does not speak for the president, his dismissals of climate science and environmental regulation have cut with the grain at the new incumbents of the White House.  A climate action plan Ebell prepared for the incoming president outlines a strategy for withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, and scrapping Obama’s signature clean power plan. Any attempts to abolish the EPA would likely be steered by Pruitt, Trump’s nominee who has sued the agency 13 times, although Democrats boycotted his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, preventing a vote. The former EPA chief administrator in the Bush White House, Catherine Todd Whitman, complained earlier this week that agency staff were feeling “nervous” about the arrival of Pruitt, a climate science denier who has reportedly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fossil fuels industry. “If you want to defend the status quo then you should be very worried,” Ebell said. “I expect Scott Pruitt to be a serious reformer at the EPA.” Fears of a purge of EPA climate data, research, and reports have been fuelled by the removal of climate science material on a White House website and a “temporary hold” placed on new publications until they have been vetted by political appointees. Ebell insisted that existing scientific webpages would be protected. “I have no doubt that they will not disappear,” he said. “I don’t think President Trump has the least interest in destroying or hiding information. But I do think that a great deal of what the EPA puts out in the way of so-called ‘climate education’ – some of the research that they’ve not necessarily done but promoted – does not meet the minimal standards legally required by the federal information quality act. It therefore needs to be changed or withdrawn.” Ebell is the director of the ultra-conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, and the “number one enemy of climate change alarmism”, according to his Twitter page.  He has gained notoriety for arguing that climate science is based on “a tissue of improbabilities” and his CEI has been ridiculed by Greenpeace for a video claiming that CO2 is not a pollutant.  As he arrived in Brussels to address a Blue-Green summit on Wednesday, he was jeered by scores of environmental protestors, one of whom was bundled out of the meeting after brandishing a placard saying ‘Resist’ during his speech. Ebell has described the environmental movement as “the greatest threat to freedom and prosperity in the modern world.”  Asked for his advice to Ebell, Greg Barker, a former climate minister under David Cameron issued a plea: “Please stop trashing experts. “It is incredibly dangerous. We live in a very complex and integrated world and the idea that we should denigrate learning and expertise is very worrying, very dark and sinister,” Lord Barker added.  Ebell responded from the podium by accusing Barker of having “strong economic interests in this [environmental] crony capitalist regime”.  The combative stance may not have persuaded EU officials in the audience, but it has won admirers on the US “alt-right”, the far-right movement in the US who share his hostility to environmental regulation.  In a key speech in North Dakota last May, Trump lashed out at what he said were “totalitarian tactics” by the EPA, as he promised to save the US coal industry, build the Keystone XL pipeline and “cancel” the Paris climate agreement.  Doing so would mean “we will be ceding global leadership of climate policy to China,” Ebell said after the meeting. “[But] I want to get rid of global climate policy, so why do I care who is in charge of it? I don’t care. They can take it as far as I’m concerned, and good luck to them.” A green light given to the 54.5 miles a gallon fuel efficiency standard for new automobiles might also be heading for the kerb, after the Obama administration fast-tracked a measure approving the fuel and emissions-saving rule in its last days. Ebell said: “My view is that the mid-term review should be reopened by the Trump administration because I believe the conclusions by the Obama administration were cooked. I don’t think the facts support the conclusion that everything is [proceeding] on target, so I think they will have to reopen that.” "
"As President George W. Bush said, “Fool me once, shame on ... shame on you. Fool me ... You can’t get fooled again!” During the his Administration, political appointees censored climate science reports from government agencies, and mostly got away with it by gagging the scientists. A survey found that nearly half of 1,600 government scientists at seven agencies ranging from NASA to the EPA had been warned against using terms like “global warming” in reports or speeches, throughout Bush’s eight-year presidency.  Unaccustomed to being strong-armed by their own administrators, some government scientists reacted with what former US Climate Change Science Program senior associate Rick Piltz called “an anticipatory kind of self-censorship.” As a result, the Bush Administration’s efforts to smother scientific findings concerning global warming in government reports were remarkably effective. Perhaps assuming those tactics would work again, the Trump Administration has copied the Bush scientific censorship playbook. They issued de facto gag orders to government science agencies like the EPA and USDA, ordered that the EPA take down its climate webpage, and have mandated that any studies or data from EPA scientists must undergo review by political appointees before they can be released to the public. However, the Trump Administration is quickly realizing that scientists learned from the Bush scandal. This time around they’re not trying to appease the political appointees by staying quiet and allowing the censorship to happen. We saw an early indication that the Bush tactics won’t succeed in 2017 when the Trump transition team launched an inquisition into Department of Energy employees working on climate change. The department refused to provide the requested list, and in the face of public and media outrage, the Trump team retreated. Around the same time, climate scientists held a ‘rally to stand up for science’ in San Francisco, fearing that the new administration would bully and censor scientists. Nevertheless, the Trump Administration ignored those warning signs and continued to follow the Bush climate science censorship playbook. It hasn’t worked.  Reacting to the deletion of some National Parks Service tweets of climate change facts, a number of “resistance” Twitter accounts ostensibly run by government scientists have been created. Most recently, the Trump Administration had ordered that the EPA delete its climate webpage, but again in the face of public and media outrage has retreated. This time around, government scientists have been quick to blow the whistle against political censorship of science, either by contacting congressional offices or journalists. Whistleblowers can contact Guardian journalists securely and anonymously by following these instructions. Scientists are even becoming proactive. Following on the tremendous success of the Women’s March on Trump’s first full day as President, a group is organizing a March for Science sometime in March 2017.  It’s possible that reactions to these Trump Administration moves are overblown - that they’re simply the result of a clumsy transition period and weren’t meant to signal a permanent censorship of science. But Trump has given scientists every reason to feel threatened. For example, he appointed Myron Ebell to lead his EPA transition team - an oil and coal-funded enemy of science who wants to gut the agency. That team also included David Schnare and Chris Horner, who have spent much of their careers harassing and intimidating climate scientists. Here’s what the transition team had to say about how the EPA currently uses science: EPA does not use science to guide regulatory policy as much as it uses regulatory policy to steer the science ... EPA has greatly increased its science manipulation. Trump himself has described what the EPA does as “a disgrace.” He then nominated Scott Pruitt to head the agency - a man who has sued the EPA 14 times on behalf of polluters. For his science advisor, Trump is rumored to be considering two climate science deniers. He’s now appointed another climate science denier to lead the NOAA transition. The head of the House [Anti-]Science, Space, and Technology Committee Lamar Smith suggested that for accurate information we should rely not on scientists or the media, but solely on Donald Trump. Donald Trump recently said “I have a running war with the media,” but in reality his war is with facts, and since evidence and facts are the currency of science, scientists fear that he’ll also wage a war on science.  A war on science is a war he’s guaranteed to lose. Trump can deny the science, silence the scientists, censor their reports, even fire them from government agencies - but that won’t stop the Earth from heating and its climate from changing at a dangerous rate. At best he would survive a four or eight-year term, leave the planet a worse place for future generations, and be seen as a villain in the history books. But it looks as though scientists and journalists aren’t going to let that happen without a fight, and kudos to them for standing up to the anti-science bullies on behalf of the planet and future generations. We’ll all have to do our parts to protect science and hold the administration accountable to facts and truth for the next four years."
"The planet is getting hotter, leaving people hungry and fuelling wars around the world and you want to do something about it. But with a green movement to cater for every age, location, and type of plastic recycling, how do you turn your enthusiasm into action? We talked to campaigners and politicians to glean their top tips for getting started as a climate activist.  “The age old problem for green campaigners is how to make something so big, so important, so potentially catastrophic seem like something people should engage with now,” says John Coventry from GoFundMe. “The very best campaigns take those huge problems and make them real for people in their day-to-day life.” He calls this the “‘little big thing’ – the clear relatable story that brings a wider issue to life”. Once you have this locked, says Coventry, you should campaign with tenacity, utilising every platform “from old-fashioned newspapers to snapchat” to get your message across. “Unexpected things will happen and things will fail. Learn from all of it and keep going,” he adds.  Naia Bazin Lopez from People and Planet, a movement for students, recommends researching the people most acutely affected by climate change and working backwards.  If you believe, as People and Planet do, that fossil fuels are the root causes of climate change the first step is to get acquainted with the people fighting to keep them in the ground, from Canada’s indigenous community in Tar Sands to the Colombians living near the Cerrejon Mine,” she says.  Their message is simple: keep it it ground. So for campaigners thousands of miles away, says Lopez, the first step is to stand in solidarity, but the second tangible thing you can do is to pressure businesses and banks to stop contributing to an industry destroying the communities around the world.  The online petition site Change.org has hosted many successful campaigns – from a UK schoolgirl’s fight to keep climate change on the school curriculum to the action to stop the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. Change.org says all of its campaigns start with ordinary people campaigning on an issue that has affected them personally or that they feel passionately about, before realising others share their plight. Lopez also believes the “power is with the people” and says that while signing a petition is the simplest way to get involved, others have more to add. “If you are going to organise an event locally it’s key to build people’s confidence and be interested in their skills,” she says. Amazing campaigns, including climate camp, began after people took the time to talk, listen and collaborate with their communities, says Lopez.  Sometimes encouraging the simplest behaviour changes can have a massive global impact, says John Coventry. Even if you have to put a monetary value on that change.  The 5p charge for plastic bags in England is one of the most successful green campaigns of the past five years, he says. “It may seem trivial to some [but it’s] a relatively simple policy solution that drives behaviour change among consumers and businesses.” Within six months of the ban, the number of single-use plastic bags dropped by 85%, with the government heralding it as a major breakthrough, not least for the world’s marine life, which is being drowned by 8bn tonnes of waste plastic every year.  Unless you are a US registered citizen, there was very little you could have done to stop Trump gaining power, but from Albania to Australia, Zimbabwe to Zambia there are local, regional and national politicians trying to protect the environment through policy.  Caroline Russell, already a local campaigner, got political after a young child was killed by a lorry near her house. Now a member of the London Assembly and an Islington councillor for the Green party, Russell realised that a better road policy was needed to stop the tragedy happening again. “If you get yourself elected, then you have a hope of some influence,” she says. Russell’s advice for anyone interested in getting involved is ask what you can do for your local community. “That’s the power and strength of the Green party which needs a diversity of voices [from] all backgrounds and all ages.” She adds that a strong local network is crucial if you are to have a hope of getting elected, especially in systems like the UK where the big parties dominate.  In the era of fake news where sceptics try to play down the impact of climate change online, it’s important to have the facts at your disposal: this exists in the form of a paper endorsed by 97% of scientists who say climate change is as a result of human activity.  Lopez recognises that sceptics can be a problem for campaigners but cautions against expending energy on fighting trolls who, she says, are an “absolute minority”.  “Let’s not fight those who don’t believe in climate change, let’s find the people who believe in it but don’t know what to do about it,” she says."

"An overhaul of a trading scheme to cut carbon emissions by European industries has been approved in a knife-edge vote by MEPs, although environmental campaigners have been quick to denounce the legislation for not going far enough. Under the proposals agreed in the European parliament in Strasbourg to update the emissions trading scheme (ETS), MEPs hope to balance greater cuts in greenhouse gases with protection for energy-intensive industries.  The ETS imposes a cap on emissions from 11,000 power stations and industrial plants in 31 countries by forcing companies to buy allowances to emit carbon. The new measures agreed by MEPs will gradually reduce the number of allowances available in an attempt to push up their cost and provide an incentive for industries to adopt cleaner technologies. The cap on emissions will fall by 2.2% a year – the so-called linear reduction factor – until at least 2024.  The highest performing 10% of factories and other installations will also receive all their allowances free while a fund of up to €12bn (£10.2bn) is to be established to help industry innovate and invest in technology. The Conservative MEP Ian Duncan, who steered the legislation through the parliament, said: “By passing this report we will be reminding member states of the commitment they signed up to. We simply must deliver the ambitions of the Paris agreement on climate change and do what is required for our planet. “This is bigger than Brexit, bigger than Britain, bigger than the EU. We have to get it right.” The report will now enter so-called “trilogue” negotiations between the European parliament, commission and council, which represents member states. Efforts to overhaul the ETS have also been overshadowed by Britain’s decision to leave the EU, raising fears the country would also leave the scheme. The draft measures were approved by 379 votes to 263 with 57 abstentions, although until a few hours before the vote MEPs were not sure the proposals would be passed. The parliament’s environment committee had suggested a more radical cut in the number of allowances allowed under the scheme. Wendel Trio, director of Climate Action Network Europe, a coalition of environmental groups, said MEPs had failed. He said: “It is shocking that the parliament chose to bow to the interests of polluting industries instead of protecting citizens from a catastrophic climate breakdown. The parliament has completely failed the first test of its commitment to the Paris agreement. “The proposed reforms will keep the carbon market ineffective for a decade or more. We urge progressive EU governments to finally turn the ETS into a functioning tool and create a stimulus to ditch old models and move to green economy.” Marc-Olivier Herman, Oxfam’s EU policy adviser, said: “Today’s vote by the European parliament represents a missed opportunity for the climate and for those hardest hit by global warming. “The text adopted fails to set new ambitious limits for climate-damaging emissions of the EU’s industry after 2020. “In addition, no share of the revenues from the EU emissions trading scheme was allocated to help poor countries adapt to the devastating impacts of climate change. The parliament and the council must address these flaws when they decide on the final text of the legislation.” Changes to the ETS will now be debated at the council of environment ministers on 28 February."
"Scott Morrison and Ray Hadley shared a laugh on Sydney radio as the shock jock praised the federal treasurer’s “great stunt” on Friday when he brandished a lump of coal at the opposition during question time on Thursday. Morrison relayed to the 2GB presenter how he had urged Labor “don’t be afraid, don’t be scared” of the rock, and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, had juggled with it in question time. Hadley revealed he was a fan of the “odd stunt myself” during their interview on Monday morning. “Were you channelling me at any stage when you got that big hunk of coal and hid it – were you thinking that wasn’t such a bad stunt with the Bible, I’m going to try to do it with coal?” Hadley asked, referencing his attempt to make Morrison swear an oath that he had backed Abbott in the leadership spill. “I do all my own work Ray, just like you,” Morrison responded. After the moment of mutual admiration Morrison told Hadley he was “actually making quite a serious point” about the Labor party’s “demonising” of coal at the expense of their own constituents. “We’re not saying that the only thing we should be doing going forward is coal, that wasn’t the point. I mean our policy is all of the above. We have no more a fear of coal than we have a fear of wind, or solar, or wave energy, or pump-hydro, or whatever the option is.” Morrison suggested that Labor was not afraid of coal, but of the Australian Greens. “Because that’s what driven them to write off those jobs of those people in their electorates, and they’re basically cheering on the closure of coal-fired power stations.” Many on social media refused to share in Hadley and Morrison’s merriment over the coal stunt as large parts of Australia’s east coast sweltered in unprecedented temperatures over the weekend.

I could have just got up and said ‘it’s important that coal is part of the mix of things going forward’.” He said five coal-fired power stations were due to close within the next decade, posing a “significant issue” with electricity supply. Morrison wanted coal put “back on the table”. “The Labor party and the Greens took coal off the table, they treated it like a toxic substance – I just thought that was an insult to the men and women who live, in many cases, in their own electorates whose livelihoods depend on it.”"
"Hope your feet aren’t sore yet, because come spring, there are major nationwide marches planned for nearly every weekend. After the success of the Women’s March on Washington, activists are preparing for mass mobilizations throughout the year.  Here are some ahead: Since Donald Trump refused to release his tax returns during the campaign, thousands are marching on Tax Day to protest “the absolute unfairness of a man who is a billionaire president who might be not paying taxes while working folks are paying their fair share”, said Gwen Snyder, a community organizer and national organizer of Tax March. At least 30 Tax Marches have been planned in solidarity around the country with several hundred thousand people expected. The Los Angeles event page shows 66,000 people who have expressed interest or attending. The New York march event page has nearly 40,000 interested or attending, and 37,000 people have said they are interested in the DC march, with over 7,000 clicking “attend”.  Snyder, who has spent 10 years as an organizer around economic justice, declared: “I haven’t seen this kind of energy on the ground since Occupy.” The DC march will take place at 10am at the Ellipse. Trump is known for being sceptical of climate change, meeting with vaccine sceptics and announcing cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency (a department he plans to “abolish”, according to an aide). After the idea for scientists to march on Washington was first suggested in a Reddit forum, the March for Science will be held at the Washington Mall on Earth Day, 22 April. “The March for Science is a demonstration of the widespread public support for the scientific method, the enterprise of science (including science communication and education), and the use of evidence as the basis for good decision-making by our political leaders,” said Jonathan Berman, a University of Texas Health Science Center postdoctoral fellow and march organizer, in a press release. “We hope to humanize scientists as approachable members of our communities, and to draw attention to dangerous trends in the politicization of science,” added Berman.  As well as scientists speaking to the crowd, “teach-in tents” will be held in DC, with scientists explaining their research and its importance to the public. One week later, the People’s Climate March will take place in DC. “It’s not just a march in reaction. We planned this march back last fall before the election. Our goal was to move whoever is our president to be big and bold on climate,” said Paul Getsos, national coordinator for People’s Climate Movement, which is organizing the event. In 2014 the People’s Climate March in New York City had over 300,000 attendees making it the biggest climate march in history, and the 29 April march (which is day 99 of the new president’s first 100 days) is a follow-on rally. “If it was Hillary Clinton, we’d be on the streets on the 29th. Our demands would have been different,” acknowledged Getsos, noting that as well as climate, Trump has attacked people of color, unions and immigrants.  “We’re fighting for climate rooted in racial and economic justice, and we want to hold this administration to account,” said Getsos. “We want a reaction from the administration, we don’t want to roll back our climate progress.” Sister marches and events are also expected to be held in other cities. Details of the route and location of the march have yet to be announced. So far, over 13,000 people have said they are attending or interested on Facebook.  “I started organizing for the march the day that Trump ... signed the executive order on the construction of the wall on the Mexican border,” said Erick Sanchez, whose father is Iranian and great-grandparents are Mexican. That was also the day a draft of Trump’s travel ban was leaked to the press.  The Immigrants March Facebook event page already has 163,000 people interested and 25,000 attending. Sanchez, who works in public relations in DC, quickly secured permits for the National Mall for the weekend of 5-7 May. He noted that the permits were free and on a first-come-first-serve basis for anyone wanting to march on the mall, which is called “an incredible resource to have as American citizens”. He said he sees the march as important to help “build collective sustainable infrastructure to highlight the attacks about immigration” from the Trump administration, and hoped that not just immigrants, but that all different communities came out in support of immigrants. “At this point, with every constituency who gets targeted and harmed, I think it’s important we come together and organize and align,” said Sanchez. A gay activist from Brooklyn first created the Facebook event (originally called Gays on the Mall) after being inspired by the huge crowds at the Women’s March, to be held on Pride weekend. It quickly grew online, with 130,000 people marking themselves as interested or attending on the event’s page. “The outreach and response to this march is staggering and inspiring. What started off as a proposed march in Washington DC on June 11, has quickly morphed into a national movement, as well as a global one,” reads the event description. But there was criticism by some in the LGBT communities, since large-scale Pride events had been long-organized for the weekend. Philly Gay Pride posted an announcement on its website noting that the DC march threatens Philadelphia’s Pride events and that even a 15-25% lower than expected attendance could have “catastrophic” repercussions. “Not only does this threaten the viability of Philadelphia’s gay pride organization, it will have a profound negative effect on the myriad of community non-profits that depend on our events,” reads the announcement. The Guardian contacted the Pride March to discuss the event and was told: “Unfortunately, we are not granting any media requests at the moment until a diverse and intersectional initial planning group has finalized our mission statement and platform/agenda”.  In September, fans of the hip-hop group Insane Clown Posse and their fan base, better known as juggalos, will march on DC to protest their classification by the FBI in 2011 as a gang. “As wonderful as the Women’s March was, we planned this well before the Women’s March,” said Jason Webber, director of public relations for Psychopathic Records, who is organizing the march. He notes they received march permits last September. “The point of the Juggalos March is not to make a statement against the Trump administration. The point of the Juggalo March is to raise awareness about how juggalos are discriminated against, profiled and have their lives ruined as a result of identifying as fans of a certain music genre,” said Webber. Stories from the Juggalos March website describe people who lost custody of their children, were fired from jobs and had criminal charges increased against them because of being classified as gang members. Around 4,000 people are expected. The rally will start at the Lincoln Memorial, then, following speeches, will march down the mall, around the Washington Monument and back to the Lincoln Memorial. Webber is trying to get politicians and other activists involved, since Juggalos view the FBI classification as government-approved discrimination based on music taste. “But considering the current climate in America in general and Washington DC specifically, people are just getting a little bit jittery about going to DC and raising their fists against the FBI,” said Webber."

"Diminishing ice cover has increased political and economic competition for resources inside the Arctic Circle. This means more submarine operations, which are doubly claustrophobia-inducing, as a sub can only surface where the ice is comparatively thin. In an emergency, finding the nearest hole in the ice is essential, and this has spurred the development of a new type of forecast. There are two types of hole in the ice, known as leads and polynyas. Leads are long fractures, gigantic cracks caused by ice sheets moving apart. Ultimately, they are due to wind or ocean currents pushing areas of ice in different directions. Leads are generally transient, as the seawater freezes over quickly when exposed to the cold air.  Polynya is the Russian word for an ice hole, and it describes an area of open sea produced by an upwelling of warm water. This melts the ice cover above and creates a gap in the ice which typically remains in place for longer than a lead. As part of their Arctic Cap Nowcast/Forecast System (ACNFS), the US National Ice Centre produces a Flap (Fractures Leads And Polynya) forecast for submarine operations, based on satellite imagery. This shows current conditions and predicts areas of open water five to seven days ahead; having a prediction before they sail is useful, as a submerged submarine cannot receive radio updates.  The Flaps forecast has a claimed accuracy of around 88% and may prove vital for future Arctic operations.           "
"The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report – which summarizes the latest and greatest climate science research – was quite clear that humans are responsible for global warming: It is extremely likely [95 percent confidence] more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together … The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period … The contribution from natural forcings is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C, and from internal variability is likely to be in the range of −0.1°C to 0.1°C.  In fact, the report’s best estimate was that humans are responsible for all of the global warming since 1951, and greenhouse gases for about 140%. That’s because natural factors have had roughly zero net effect on temperatures during that time, and other human pollutants have had a significant cooling effect. In other words, the Earth’s surface warmed about 0.65°C between 1951 and 2010. Human greenhouse gas emissions caused temperatures to be about 0.9°C hotter than they would have otherwise been. But other human pollutants caused about 0.25°C cooling, and natural factors had a very small effect. This expert conclusion is quite different from the comments of Trump’s cabinet nominees, who were all very consistent in admitting that there is “some connectivity,” as Trump put it, between human activity and global warming, but claimed that the degree of human influence remains open for debate. The IPCC conclusion on human-caused global warming rests upon a broad and deep base of evidence. To start, there’s basic math and physics. Long-term global temperature changes are a response to changes in the Earth’s energy balance. If there’s more incoming than outgoing energy, temperatures rise. For example, that happens when the sun becomes more active (more incoming energy), or when the greenhouse effect increases (trapping heat, decreasing outgoing energy).  Over the past 50 years, solar activity has been flat on average. Greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere have skyrocketed due to humans burning fossil fuels. When scientists look at the various factors that contribute to the global energy balance, over the past 50 years, the increased greenhouse effect dwarfs all others. The increase in heat trapped below the atmosphere and decrease in heat escaping to space are also two of the many “fingerprints” of human-caused global warming. These are changes scientists expect to see if human carbon pollution is the culprit behind global warming.  As another example, we expect to see nights warming faster than days, because at night there’s a smaller volume of air, which allows the increased greenhouse effect to have a bigger effect on temperatures. Warming due to the sun would likely have the opposite effect, causing faster daytime temperature rise when sunlight is bombarding the Earth. For all of these “fingerprints,” observations are consistent with human-caused global warming and many are simply inconsistent with natural warming. There have also been numerous studies specifically investigating and quantifying the various contributors to global warming. I summarized ten of these in the graphic below, and provided details about each study here. The results have been consistent with the IPCC conclusion – humans are responsible for essentially all of the global warming since 1950. There is of course a 97% expert consensus on human-caused global warming. That consensus isn’t a result of groupthink, or a vast conspiracy, or money-grubbing scientists lying to get their greedy little hands on grant funds. In fact, scientists are very hard to convince of anything, and they’d much rather be the one to disprove a theory than the twenty-thousandth to reaffirm it.  But scientists base their conclusions on evidence, and as discussed above, the evidence for human-caused global warming is overwhelming. In the video below from the Denial101x free online course, Peter Jacobs discusses the three pillars of this type of knowledge-based consensus. Trump and his cabinet don’t consider climate change an urgent threat, no doubt because they wrongly think this settled question of human responsibility is still under debate. This became clear when immediately after Trump was sworn in as president, the White House website removed all discussion of climate change, replaced it with the Trump administration’s plan to maximize the burning of fossil fuels, and started talking about “alternative facts.” As happened with the recent marches around America and the world, it will be up to the public to make their voices heard if we’re to prevent the incoming administration from fiddling while the world burns."
"Watching politics builds a high tolerance for hypocrisy and humbug, but even I am aghast at the Coalition’s antics this week – fondling a lump of coal in parliament while accusing the opposition of an “ideological approach to energy” and negligence in policy planning. Seriously. There’s a long list of blame and shame for Australia’s threadbare climate and energy policy, and the failure to plan for an energy market crisis that experts have warned about for years. But Malcolm Turnbull’s Coalition takes out first place. Arguably all sides of politics have made mistakes or miscalculations to get us to this point of omni-failure – high prices, blackouts and an inability to reduce electricity sector emissions – and yes, ideology has played a part: mostly the climate-change denying, renewables-are-a-socialist-plot ideology espoused by sections of the Liberal and National parties that once upon a time, a long time ago, Turnbull also railed against.  Before we untether from reality entirely and drift off into a Trump-like universe where truth belongs to whoever delivers the best poll-driven lines or brings the dumbest prop to question time, let’s hammer down a few facts. Because we aren’t reviewing bad theatre here and when some commentators opine about whether Turnbull’s lines will “work”, or how funny the whole thing was, what they are really assessing is whether the prime minister can successfully, and in broad daylight, shift the blame for a monumental stuff-up, while apparently proposing solutions that will make it substantially worse in every regard.  Since it’s our job to point out things like that, here are a few facts that undermine the “coal comeback” PR strategy that started rolling out sometime last year: We’ve been enduring this climate war nonsense for more than a decade and now we’re wearing the consequences – rising prices, unreliable power supply and increasing emissions. Responding with a parliamentary pantomime to try to shift the blame to a fictitious renewable industry bad guy is true ideological idiocy and also negligent, because it puts the shallowest, shortest-term and most opportunistic strategy for political survival ahead of households, investors and future generations."
"Wikipedia editors recently voted to ban the Daily Mail tabloid as a source for their website after deeming it “generally unreliable.” To put the severity of this decision in context, Wikipedia still allows references to Russia Today and Fox News, both of which display a clear bias toward the ruling parties of their respective countries.  It thus may seem like a remarkable decision for Wikipedia to ban the Daily Mail, but fake news stories by David Rose in two consecutive editions of the Mail on Sunday – which echoed throughout the international conservative media – provide perfect examples of why the decision was justified and wise.  On February 5th, Rose ran a story alleging scandalous behavior by NOAA scientists in a 2015 paper. The story was based on an interview with retired NOAA scientist John Bates, who was not involved in the study. However, in follow-up interviews with real science journalists, Bates clarified that he was in no way disputing the quality or accuracy of the data, even going as far as to make this damning comment: I knew people would misuse this. But you can’t control other people. Most importantly, the scientific integrity of the NOAA data is indisputable. The organization’s global temperature data is nearly identical to that of other scientific groups like NASA, the Hadley Centre, and Berkeley Earth. NOAA's new record is around the middle of the pack w.r.t. other independent groups. Their old record was running a bit cold. @DavidRoseUK pic.twitter.com/Grc8W1KJfx In fact, a recent paper led by Zeke Hausfather confirmed the accuracy of the new NOAA dataset, and Hausfather noted that the group’s new version mostly adjusted temperature estimates in the early 20th century – and decreased the overall warming. Just a quick reminder to folks that the NOAA ""adjustments"" have relatively little impact on our understanding of recent warming. pic.twitter.com/nnXCUrzrQB David Rose’s sensationalist story claiming that “world leaders were duped into investing billions over manipulated global warming data” was entirely without scientific merit. It was a giant nothingburger, or as NASA GISS director Gavin Schmidt called it, “a NOAA-thing burger.” So after a week full of rebuking and debunking from climate science experts and real science journalists, and after Rose’s own source walked back his criticisms and explicitly said there was “no data tampering, no data changing, nothing malicious,” how did Rose respond? Like any good propagandist, he doubled down. In his follow-up piece, Rose’s “smoking gun” is that NOAA published its updated ocean temperature data 5 months later than it could have, to coincide with the 2015 global temperature data paper that incorporated it. This is a smoking gun because ... well, it’s not. It’s another pedantic critique trying desperately to make a mountain out of less than a molehill. The few quasi-scientific points in Rose’s new piece are patently false. Rose’s reaction to the critiques of his first piece are quite reminiscent of Donald Trump’s responses to being called out for spreading misinformation. Both continue to deny the facts. Both brag about the size of their hands, or rally audiences, or Facebook shares (they’re yuge). Both attack the readership of those have debunked them, like the “failing New York Times” or Ars Technica.  Both claim that other people agree with them. Important people – the best people – like in Rose’s case, Lamar Smith. The same Lamar Smith who said that listening to Donald Trump “might be the only way to get the unvarnished truth.” This is far from the first time David Rose and the Mail have published nonscience. For example, in 2013 he wrote that because there was more sea ice in the Arctic that summer than the previous year, this was somehow indicative of “global COOLING!”. In reality, about three-quarters of the summer Arctic sea ice has disappeared in less than four decades due to rapid global warming. In 2014, as Arctic sea ice continued its death spiral, along with disappearing glaciers and ice sheets around the world in a year that would soon become the hottest on record, Rose tried to distract his readers by focusing their attention on Antarctic sea ice. Why is Antarctic sea ice important? For no reason, except it’s bucked the disappearing trend of all the rest of the Earth’s ice. Global warming is actually one reason – melting of Antarctic land ice has freshened and cooled the ocean surface, allowing for more sea ice to form. But David Rose isn’t interested in the physical mechanisms, he’s just interested in giving his readers the impression that something about this global warming stuff just doesn’t seem right. This past November, Rose tried to blame the record-shattering hot global temperatures of 2016 on El Niño in a piece that the climate scientists at Climate Feedback gave a “very low” scientific credibility score of -1.9. The lowest possible score is -2.0. The scientists described Rose’s article as “incredibly misleading,” “flawed to perfection,” “deceptive,” and “completely bogus.” One expressed dismay that they couldn’t rate its credibility worse than “very low.” When it comes to getting science wrong, David Rose goes to 11. This past week, climate scientists Richard Betts, Tamsin Edwards, Doug McNeall, and Ed Hawkins revisited another Rose article from 2013 called ‘The Great Green Con.” In it, he showed a graph of climate model temperature projections against observations. The measured data fell within the model range, but toward the lower end. Rose declared in the Mail on Sunday: The graph shows in incontrovertible detail how the speed of global warming has been massively overestimated … The eco-debate was, in effect, hijacked by false data. Betts, Edwards, McNeall, and Hawkins updated Rose’s graph with the latest temperature data. It now looks like this: Hi @DavidRoseUK we updated your graph - hope it helps make your next article OK for Wikipedia :) @ed_hawkins @flimsin @dougmcneall #fixedit pic.twitter.com/g1PZZBiHQ2 I doubt Rose will revisit his article and now declare that global warming has been massively accurately estimated. But that’s precisely the point, and the problem. The intent of propaganda is to mislead people in order to advance a particular agenda. Undermining and delaying climate policies is one such agenda promoted by the Mail on Sunday and other conservative media outlets. This is quite clear in Rose’s writing, as he rails against the supposed high costs of those policies from ‘green cons.’ Fake science journalists in biased media outlets keep writing false and misleading pieces about climate change. They don’t learn from their mistakes, despite being constantly debunked by climate scientists, because that would require caring about facts and truth. Doubt is their product, and they peddle it well. When they’re caught, they just double down on the misinformation.  But that’s not news; it’s propaganda. And that’s why Wikipedia deemed the Daily Mail an unreliable source. With writers like David Rose, the ruling was well earned. As Gavin Schmidt put it: I agree w/@DavidRoseUK!""We cannot allow such a vital issue for our future to be mired in half truths & deceptions""So don't read the Mail…"
"Sea ice around Antarctica has shrunk to the smallest annual extent on record after years of resisting a trend of manmade global warming, preliminary US satellite data has shown.  Ice floating around the frozen continent usually melts to its smallest for the year towards the end of February, the southern hemisphere summer, before expanding again as the autumn chill sets in.  This year, sea ice extent contracted to 883,015 sq miles (2.28m sq km) on 13 February, according to daily data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).  That extent is a fraction smaller than a previous low of 884,173 sq miles recorded on 27 February 1997 in satellite records dating back to 1979. Mark Serreze, director of the NSIDC, said he would wait for a few days’ more measurements to confirm the record low.  “But, unless something funny happens, we’re looking at a record minimum in Antarctica,” he told Reuters. “Some people say it’s already happened. We tend to be conservative by looking at five-day running averages.” In many recent years, the average extent of sea ice around Antarctica has tended to expand despite the overall trend of global warming, blamed on a build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from burning fossil fuels.  People sceptical of mainstream findings by climate scientists have often pointed to Antarctic sea ice as evidence against global warming. Some climate scientists have linked the paradoxical expansion to shifts in winds and ocean currents.  “We’ve always thought of the Antarctic as the sleeping elephant starting to stir,” Serreze said. “Well, maybe it’s starting to stir now.”  World average temperatures climbed to a record high in 2016 for the third year in a row. Climate scientists say warming is causing more extreme days of heat, downpours and is nudging up global sea levels.  At the other end of the planet, ice covering the Arctic Ocean has been at repeated lows in recent years.  In the northern winter, sea ice expands and is at its smallest extent for mid-February, at 5.38m sq miles."
